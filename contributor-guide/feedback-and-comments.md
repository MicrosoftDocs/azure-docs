# Feedback, comments, and support

If you have feedback, comments, or need help using Azure, here are the suggested channels:

- Feedback or questions about technical articles are best handled through the Disqus thread at the bottom of each article. This makes it clear to us which article you are talking about.

- Suggested changes to technical articles are best handled as proposals for change through pull requests. Each pull request is reviewed by the author of the article.

- If you need support using Azure, your best bets are StackOverflow, MSDN, and our support channels. See the [forum links](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/forums/) and our [support options page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/options/).

-	Product and feature feedback is best handled through the [general feedback page for Azure](https://feedback.azure.com).
