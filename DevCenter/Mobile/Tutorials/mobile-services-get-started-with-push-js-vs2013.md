This topic shows how Visual Studio 2013 lets you use Windows Azure Mobile Services to send push notifications to your Windows Store app. In this tutorial you add push notifications using the Windows Push Notification service (WNS) to the quickstart project, right from Visual Studio. When complete, your mobile service will send a push notification each time a record is inserted.

<div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
<p>This tutorial requires Visual Studio 2013, which makes it easier to send push notifications to your Windows Store app using Mobile Services. To complete the same basic procedure using Visual Studio 2012, follow the steps in the topic <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-push-js-vs2012/">Get started with push notifications in Mobile Services using Visual Studio 2012</a>.</p>

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable push notifications:

1. [Register your app for push notifications and configure Mobile Services]
2. [Update the generated push notification code]
3. [Insert data to receive notifications]

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Get started with data] to connect your project to the mobile service. When a mobile service has not been connected, the Add Push Notification wizard creates this connection for you. 

<h2><a name="register"></a><span class="short-header">Register your app</span>Add and configure push notifications in the app</h2>

<div chunk="../chunks/mobile-services-create-new-push-vs2013.md" />
	
7. Open the generated push.register.js code file and inspect the code that obtains the installation ID and channel for the device and inserts this data into the new **channels** table. 

	This table was created in your mobile service by the Add Push Notification wizard. This code ensures that registration of the device is attempted whenever the app is activated.

8. In Server Explorer, expand **Windows Azure**, **Mobile Services**, your service name, then **channels**, and open the insert.js file. 

	This file, which is stored in your mobile service, contains JavaScript code that is executed when a client sends a request to register a device by inserting data into the channels table. The initial version of this file contains code that checks for an existing registration for the device. It also contains code that sends a push notification when a new registration is added to the channels table. 

9. Press the F5 key to run the app and verify that a notification is immediately received from the mobile service. 
	
	This notification was generated by inserting a row into the new channels table, which is the device registration.

<h2><a name="update-scripts"></a><span class="short-header">Update the code</span>Update the generated push notification code</h2>

<div chunk="../chunks/mobile-services-create-new-push-vs2013-2.md" />

<h2><a name="test"></a><span class="short-header">Test the app</span>Test push notifications in your app</h2>

1. In Visual Studio, press the F5 key to run the app.

2. In the app, type text in **Insert a TodoItem**, and then click **Save**.

   Note that after the insert completes, the app receives a push notification from WNS.

This tutorial demonstrates the basic push notification functionality provided by Mobile Services. If your app requires more advanced functionalities, such as sending cross-platform notifications, subscription-based routing, or very large volumes, consider using Windows Azure Notification Hubs with your mobile service. For more information, see one of the following Notification Hubs topics:

+ [Get started with Notification Hubs]
  <br/>Learn how to leverage Notification Hubs in your Windows Store app.

+ [Send notifications to subscribers]
	<br/>Learn how users can register and receive push notifications for categories they're interested in.

+ [Send notifications to users]
	<br/>Learn how to send push notifications from a Mobile Service to specific users on any device.

+ [Send cross-platform notifications to users]
	<br/>Learn how to use templates to send push notifications from a Mobile Service, without having to craft platform-specific payloads in your back-end.
