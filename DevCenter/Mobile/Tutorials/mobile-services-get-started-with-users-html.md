This topic shows you how to authenticate users in Windows Azure Mobile Services from your HTML app.  In this tutorial, you add authentication to the quickstart project using an identity provider that is supported by Mobile Services. After being successfully authenticated and authorized by Mobile Services, the user ID value is displayed.  

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable authentication in your app:

1. [Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services]
2. [Restrict table permissions to authenticated users]
3. [Add authentication to the app]

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. You must also first complete the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services]. 

<h2><a name="register"></a><span class="short-header">Register your app</span>Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services</h2>

To be able to authenticate users, you must register your app with an identity provider. You must then register the provider-generated client secret with Mobile Services.

1. Log on to the [Windows Azure Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your mobile service.

   ![][4]

2. Click the **Dashboard** tab and make a note of the **Site URL** value.

   ![][5]

    You may need to provide this value to the identity provider when you register your app.

3. Choose a supported identity provider from the list below and follow the steps to register your app with that provider:

 - <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/how-to-guides/register-for-microsoft-authentication/" target="_blank">Microsoft Account</a>
 - <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/how-to-guides/register-for-facebook-authentication/" target="_blank">Facebook login</a>
 - <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/how-to-guides/register-for-twitter-authentication/" target="_blank">Twitter login</a>
 - <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/how-to-guides/register-for-google-authentication/" target="_blank">Google login</a>

    Remember to make a note of the client identity and secret values generated by the provider.

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Security Note</b>
	<p>The provider-generated secret is an important security credential. Do not share this secret with anyone or distribute it with your app.</p>
    </div>

4. Back in the Management Portal, click the **Identity** tab, enter the app identifier and shared secret values obtained from your identity provider, and click **Save**.

   ![][13]

Both your mobile service and your app are now configured to work with your chosen authentication provider.

<h2><a name="permissions"></a><span class="short-header">Restrict permissions</span>Restrict permissions to authenticated users</h2>

1. In the Management Portal, click the **Data** tab, and then click the **TodoItem** table. 

   ![][14]

2. Click the **Permissions** tab, set all permissions to **Only authenticated users**, and then click **Save**. This will ensure that all operations against the **TodoItem** table require an authenticated user. This also simplifies the scripts in the next tutorial because they will not have to allow for the possibility of anonymous users.

   ![][15]

3. In Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8, open the project that you created when you completed the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services]. 

4. Press the F5 key to run this quickstart-based app; verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts. 
   
   This happens because the app attempts to access Mobile Services as an unauthenticated user, but the _TodoItem_ table now requires authentication.

Next, you will update the app to authenticate users before requesting resources from the mobile service.

<h2><a name="add-authentication"></a><span class="short-header">Add authentication</span>Add authentication to the app</h2>

1. Open the project file app.js and _XXXX Krishnan we need to figure out how to use this code XXXX_ with the following code: 
	
        var userId = null;

        // Request authentication from Mobile Services using a Facebook login.
        var login = function () {
            return new WinJS.Promise(function (complete) {
                mobileService.login("facebook").done(function (results) {;
                    userId = results.userId;
                    refreshTodoItems();
                    var message = "You are now logged in as: " + userId;
                    var dialog = new Windows.UI.Popups.MessageDialog(message);
                    dialog.showAsync().done(complete);
                }, function (error) {
                    userId = null;
                    var dialog = new Windows.UI.Popups
                        .MessageDialog("An error occurred during login", "Login Required");
                    dialog.showAsync().done(complete);
                });
            });
        }            

        var authenticate = function () {
            login().then(function () {
                if (userId === null) {

                    // Authentication failed, try again.
                    authenticate();
                }
            });
        }

        authenticate();

    This creates a member variable for storing the current user and a method to handle the authentication process. The user is authenticated by using a Facebook login.

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
	<p>If you are using an identity provider other than Facebook, change the value passed to the <strong>login</strong> method above to one of the following: <i>microsoftaccount</i>, <i>facebook</i>, <i>twitter</i>, or <i>google</i>.</p>
    </div>

9. Navigate to the index.html page to run the app and sign into the app with your chosen identity provider. 

   When you are successfully logged-in, the app should run without errors, and you should be able to query Mobile Services and make updates to data.

In the next tutorial, [Authorize users with scripts], you will take the user ID value provided by Mobile Services based on an authenticated user and use it to filter the data returned by Mobile Services.
