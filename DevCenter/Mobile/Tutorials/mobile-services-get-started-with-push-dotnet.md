This topic shows you how to use Windows Azure Mobile Services to send push notifications to a Windows Store app. 
In this tutorial you add push notifications using the Windows Push Notification service (WNS) to the quickstart project. When complete, your mobile service will send a push notification each time a record is inserted.

<div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
	<p><i>Visual Studio 2013 Preview</i> includes new features that make it easy to setup push notifications in your Windows Store app using Mobile Services. For more information, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=309101">Quickstart: Adding push notifications for a mobile service</a> in the Windows Dev Center.</p>
</div>

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable push notifications:

1. [Register your app for push notifications and configure Mobile Services]
2. [Add push notifications to the app]
3. [Update scripts to send push notifications]
4. [Insert data to receive notifications]

This tutorial demonstrates a simplified way of sending push notifications by attaching a push notification channel to the inserted record. Be sure to follow along with the next tutorial to get a better idea of how to incorporate push notifications into your real-world apps. This tutorial requires the following:

+ Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8
+ Active Windows Store account

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete [Get started with Mobile Services]. 

<h2><a name="register"></a><span class="short-header">Register your app</span>Register your app for the Windows Store</h2>

To be able to send push notifications to Windows Store apps from Mobile Services, you must submit your app to the Windows Store. You must then configure your mobile service to integrate with WNS.

1. If you have not already registered your app, navigate to the [Submit an app page] at the Dev Center for Windows Store apps, log on with your Microsoft account, and then click **App name**.

   ![][0]

2. Type a name for your app in **App name**, click **Reserve app name**, and then click **Save**.

   ![][1]

   This creates a new Windows Store registration for your app.

3. In Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8, open the project that you created when you completed the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services].

4. In solution explorer, right-click the project, click **Store**, and then click **Associate App with the Store...**. 

  ![][2]

   This displays the **Associate Your App with the Windows Store** Wizard.

5. In the wizard, click **Sign in** and then login with your Microsoft account.

6. Select the app that you registered in step 2, click **Next**, and then click **Associate**.

   ![][3]

   This adds the required Windows Store registration information to the application manifest.    

7. Back in the Windows Dev Center page for your new app, click **Services**. 

   ![][4] 

8. In the Services page, click **Live Services site** under **Windows Azure Mobile Services**.

	![][17]

9. Click **Authenticating your service** and make a note of the values of **Client secret** and **Package security identifier (SID)**. 

   ![][5]

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Security Note</b>
	<p>The client secret and package SID are important security credentials. Do not share these secrets with anyone or distribute them with your app.</p>
    </div> 

10. Log on to the [Windows Azure Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your app.

   ![][9]

11. Click the **Push** tab, enter the **Client secret** and **Package SID** values obtained from WNS in Step 4, and then click **Save**.

   ![][10]

Both your mobile service and your app are now configured to work with WNS.

<h2><a name="add-push"></a><span class="short-header">Add push notifications</span>Add push notifications to your app</h2>

1. Open the file App.xaml.cs and add the following using statement:

        using Windows.Networking.PushNotifications;

2. Add the following to App.xaml.cs:
	
        public static PushNotificationChannel CurrentChannel { get; private set; }

	    private async void AcquirePushChannel()
	    {
	            CurrentChannel =  
	                await PushNotificationChannelManager.CreatePushNotificationChannelForApplicationAsync();
        }

   This code acquires and stores a push notification channel.
    
3. At the top of the **OnLaunched** event handler in App.xaml.cs, add the following call to the new **AcquirePushChannel** method:

        AcquirePushChannel();

   This guarantees that the **CurrentChannel** property is initialized each time the application is launched.
		
4. Open the project file MainPage.xaml.cs and add the following new attributed property to the **TodoItem** class:

        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "channel")]
        public string Channel { get; set; }

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
	<p>When dynamic schema is enabled on your mobile service, a new 'channel' column is automatically added to the <strong>TodoItem</strong> table when a new item that contains this property is inserted.</p>
    </div>

5. Replace the **ButtonSave_Click** event handler method with the following code:

	        private void ButtonSave_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
	        {
	            var todoItem = new TodoItem { Text = TextInput.Text, Channel = App.CurrentChannel.Uri };
	            InsertTodoItem(todoItem);
            }

   This sets the client's current channel value on the item before it is sent to the mobile service.

6. (Optional) If you are not using the Management Portal-generated quickstart project, open the Package.appxmanifest file and make sure that in the **Application UI** tab, **Toast capable** is set to **Yes**.

   ![][15]

   This makes sure that your app can raise toast notifications. These notifications are already enabled in the downloaded quickstart project.

<h2><a name="update-scripts"></a><span class="short-header">Update the insert script</span>Update the registered insert script in the Management Portal</h2>

1. In the Management Portal, click the **Data** tab and then click the **TodoItem** table. 

   ![][11]

2. In **todoitem**, click the **Script** tab and select **Insert**.
   
  ![][12]

   This displays the function that is invoked when an insert occurs in the **TodoItem** table.

3. Replace the insert function with the following code, and then click **Save**:

        function insert(item, user, request) {
            request.execute({
                success: function() {
                    // Write to the response and then send the notification in the background
                    request.respond();
                    push.wns.sendToastText04(item.channel, {
                        text1: item.text
                    }, {
                        success: function(pushResponse) {
                            console.log("Sent push:", pushResponse);
                        }
                    });
                }
            });
        }

   This registers a new insert script, which uses the [wns object] to send a push notification (the inserted text) to the channel provided in the insert request.

<h2><a name="test"></a><span class="short-header">Test the app</span>Test push notifications in your app</h2>

1. In Visual Studio, press the F5 key to run the app.

2. In the app, type text in **Insert a TodoItem**, and then click **Save**.

   ![][13]

   Note that after the insert completes, the app receives a push notification from WNS.

   ![][14]

## <a name="next-steps"> </a>Next steps

In this simple example a user receives a push notification with the data that was just inserted. The channel used by WNS is supplied to the mobile service by the client in the request. In the next tutorial, [Push notifications to app users], you will create a separate Channel table in which to store channel URIs and send a push notification out to all stored channels when an insert occurs.
