<h3 class="subtext">Perfect for web apps consisting of client side markup and scripting, server side scripting and a database</h3> 

### [Node.js Web Site] ###
Learn how to use the Windows Azure portal to create a new Windows Azure Web Site, provision a [Git] repository for the web site, and then publish a Node.js application to the web site by using Git.

### [Web Site with Storage]
The Windows Azure Table Service is a NoSQL storage service that is useful for working key/value pairs. Learn how to use this service by creating a Node.js 'task list' style application that uses the azure module to store data in the Table service. This tutorial also teaches you how to use the [Windows Azure Cross-Platform Tools for Mac and Linux] to create a Windows Azure Web Site.

### [Web Site with MongoDB]
[MongoDB] is a popular document-oriented NoSQL solution. In this tutorial you will learn how to create a Node.js 'task list' style application that stores data in a Windows Azure virtual machine hosting MongoDB. This tutorial also teaches you how to use the [Windows Azure Cross-Platform Tools for Mac and Linux] to create a Windows Azure Web Site.

## Cloud Services

</h3>

### [Node.js Cloud Service]
Learn how to use the [Windows Azure PowerShell] cmdlets to create a Node.js application, test it in the Windows Azure Emulator, and then deploy it as a Windows Azure Cloud Service.

### [Cloud Service with Express]
In this tutorial, learn how to use npm to install the popular [Express] module, and use it to create an MVC based application. Then use the [Windows Azure PowerShell] cmdlets to test and deploy the application as a Windows Azure Cloud Service

### [Cloud Service with Storage]
The [Windows Azure Table Service] is a NoSQL storage service that is useful for working key/value pairs. Learn how to use this service by creating a Node.js 'task list' style application that uses the azure module to store data in the Table service.

### [Cloud Service with Socket.IO]
[Socket.io] provides real-time communication between your Node.js application and client browsers. In this tutorial you will learn how to create a Cloud Service based on the 'chat' example provided with Socket.io.

## Deployment

### [Deploying with Cloud9]
[Cloud9] is a browser based IDE that allows you to develop, test, and deploy a Node.js application from within your web browser. In this tutorial you will learn how to deploy a Node.js application from Cloud9 to a Windows Azure Cloud Service.
