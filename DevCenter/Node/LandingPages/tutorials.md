#Node.js Developer Center - Tutorials

## Web Sites


### [Node.js Web Site] ###
Learn how to use the Windows Azure portal to create a new Windows Azure Web Site, provision a [Git] repository for the web site, and then publish a Node.js application to the web site by using Git.

### [Web site with WebMatrix]
[WebMatrix] provides a light-weight development experience for creating web applications. It includes several templates for creating Node.js applications, as well as autocomplete for JavaScript. In this tutorial you will learn how to create a Node.js application, and then deploy your application to a Windows Azure Web Site.

### [Web Site with Storage]
The Windows Azure Table Service is a NoSQL storage service that is useful for working key/value pairs. Learn how to use this service by creating a Node.js 'task list' style application that uses the azure module to store data in the Table service. This tutorial also teaches you how to use the [Windows Azure Cross-Platform Tools for Mac and Linux] to create a Windows Azure Web Site.

### [Web Site with MongoDB]
[MongoDB] is a popular document-oriented NoSQL solution. In this tutorial you will learn how to create a Node.js 'task list' style application that stores data in MongoDB. This tutorial also teaches you how to use the [Windows Azure Cross-Platform Tools for Mac and Linux] to create a Windows Azure Web Site.
