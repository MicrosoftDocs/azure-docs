# Staging an Application in Windows Azure

A packaged application can be deployed to the staging environment in
Windows Azure to be tested before you move it to the production
environment in which the application is accessible on the Internet. The
staging environment is exactly like the production environment, except
that you can only access the staged application with an obfuscated URL
that is generated by Windows Azure. After you have verified that your
application is working correctly, it can be deployed to the production
environment by performing a Virtual IP (VIP) swap.

This task includes the following steps:

-   [Step 1: Stage an Application][]
-   [Step 2: Deploy an Application to Production by Swapping VIPs][]

## Step 1: Stage an Application

This task covers how to stage an application by using the **Windows
Azure PowerShell for Node.js**.

1.  When publishing a service, simply pass the **-Slot** parameter to
    the **Publish-AzureService** cmdlet.

    **Publish-AzureService -Slot staging**

2.  Log on to the [Windows Azure Management Portal][]. After the hosted
    service is created and the deployment's status has been updated to
    **Ready**, click on the deployment and note the values in the
    **Properties** pane to the right. The DNS name is an obfuscated
    internal ID that Windows Azure generated. Also, the environment is
    set to **Staging**.

Now you can verify that the application is working correctly in the
staging environment.

For an upgrade scenario, in which the staged application is an upgraded
version of one that has already been deployed to production, you can
[upgrade the application in the production environment by swapping the
VIPs][Step 2: Deploy an Application to Production by Swapping VIPs].

## Step 2: Upgrade an Application in Production by Swapping VIPs

After you have verified the upgraded version of an application in the
staging environment, you can quickly make it available in production by
swapping the virtual IPs (VIPs) of the staging and production
environments.

**Note:** This step assumes that you have already deployed an
application to production and staged the upgraded version of the
application.

1.  Log into the [Management Portal][Windows Azure Management Portal],
    click **Hosted Services, Storage Accounts, & CDN**, and click
    **Hosted Services**.

2.  Expand the hosted service that contains the deployment that you want
    to upgrade, and then click **Swap VIP**. This opens the Swap VIPs
    dialog.

3.  Review the information, and then click **OK**. The two deployments
    begin updating as the staging deployment switches to production and
    the production deployment switches to staging.

You have successfully staged a deployment and upgraded a production
deployment by swapping VIPs with the deployment in staging.
