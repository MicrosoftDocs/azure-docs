<h1 id="whatisaad">What is Windows Azure Active Directory?</h1>

<div chunk="../../Shared/Chunks/disclaimer.md" />

In much the same way that Active Directory is a service made available to customers through the Windows Server operating system to manage their on-premises directory, Windows Azure Active Directory (Windows Azure AD) is a service that is made available through Windows Azure so that you can manage your organization’s cloud directory.

Because it is your organization’s cloud directory, you decide who your users are, what information to keep in the cloud, who can use the information or manage it, and what applications or services are allowed to access that information. 

When you use Windows Azure AD, it is Microsoft’s responsibility to keep Active Directory running in the cloud with high scale, high availability, and integrated disaster recovery, while fully respecting your requirements for the privacy and security of your organization’s information.

<h3>Integration with your on-premises Active Directory</h3>

If your organization already uses Active Directory on-premises, you can use Windows Azure AD’s directory integration capabilities, such as directory sync and single sign-on, to further extend the reach of your existing on-premises identities into the cloud for an improved admin and end user experience.

<h3>Integration with your applications</h3>

You can develop Windows Azure AD integrated applications for your organization or for other organizations. Integrating an application with Windows Azure AD allows your users or customers to sign in to your application using an identity management system that they already maintain, which reduces or eliminates the need to do separate identity management tasks with your application.
