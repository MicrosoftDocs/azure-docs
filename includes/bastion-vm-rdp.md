1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to the virtual machine that you want to connect to. On the **Overview** page, select **Connect**, then select **Bastion** from the dropdown to open the Bastion page. You can also select **Bastion** from the left pane.

1. On the **Bastion** page, enter the required authentication credentials, then click **Connect**. If you configured your bastion host using the Standard SKU, you'll see additional credential options on this page. If your VM is domain-joined, you must use the following format: **username@domain.com**.

1. When you click **Connect**,the RDP connection to this virtual machine via Bastion will open in your browser (over HTML5) using port 443 and the Bastion service. The following example shows a connection to a Windows 11 virtual machine in a new browser tab. The page you see depends on the VM you're connecting to.

   When working with the VM, using keyboard shortcut keys may not result in the same behavior as shortcut keys on a local computer. For example, when connected to a Windows VM from a Windows client, CTRL+ALT+END is the keyboard shortcut for CTRL+ALT+Delete on a local computer. To do this from a Mac while connected to a Windows VM, the keyboard shortcut is Fn+CTRL+ALT+Backspace.
