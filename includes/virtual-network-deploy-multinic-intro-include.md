You can create virtual machines (VMs) in Azure and attach multiple network interfaces (NICs) to each of your VMs. Multi NIC is a requirement for many network virtual appliances, such as application delivery and WAN optimization solutions. Multi NIC also provides more network traffic management functionality, including isolation of traffic between a front end NIC and back end NIC(s), or separation of data plane traffic from management plane traffic.

Before you can implement multi NICs in VMs, it is necessary to understand when you can use multi NICs, and how they are used. Read the [multi NIC overview](../articles/virtual-network/virtual-networks-multiple-nics.md) to learn more about VMs with multiple NICs.
