### Prepare an Azure Digital Twins instance

To complete this tutorial, you'll need an **Azure Digital Twins instance** to program against. If you already have an Azure Digital Twins instance set up from previous work, you can use that instance.

* Otherwise, **set up an instance and authentication** using the instructions in [*How-to: Set up an instance and authentication*](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-scripted.md). The instructions also contain steps to verify that you have completed each step successfully and are ready to move on to using your new instance.

In this tutorial, you will need the following values from when you set up your instance. 
If you need to gather these values again, use the links below to the corresponding sections in the setup article for finding them in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
* Azure Digital Twins instance **_name_** ([find in portal](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md#verify-success-and-collect-important-values))
* Azure Digital Twins instance **_host name_** ([find in portal](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md#verify-success-and-collect-important-values))
* Azure AD app registration **_Application (client) ID_** ([find in portal](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md#collect-important-values))
* Azure AD app registration **_Directory (tenant) ID_** ([find in portal](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md#collect-important-values))
