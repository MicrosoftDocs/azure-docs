### Prepare an Azure Digital Twins instance

To complete this tutorial, you'll need an **Azure Digital Twins instance** to program against. 

If you already have an Azure Digital Twins instance set up from previous work, you can use that instance, and skip to the next section.

Otherwise, follow these steps to set up your instance:
1. **Create an instance** using the instructions in [How-to: Create an Azure Digital Twins instance](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance.md). 
2. **Set up an Azure Active Directory app registration for your instance** with the *Create an app registration* section of [How-to: Authenticate a client application](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-authenticate-client.md#create-an-app-registration).
