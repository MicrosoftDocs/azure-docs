## <a name="local-settings"></a>Work with app settings locally

When your function app runs in Azure, settings required by your functions are [stored encrypted in app settings](../articles/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings). During local development, these settings are instead added to the `Values` collection in the *local.settings.json* file. The *local.settings.json* file also stores settings used by local development tools. 

Items in the `Values` collection in your project's *local.settings.json* file are intended to mirror items in your function app's [application settings](../articles/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings) in Azure.
