The following table shows the .NET versions supported by Azure Functions.  

The supported version of .NET depends on both your Functions runtime version and your chosen execution model:

### [Isolated worker model](#tab/isolated-process)

Your function code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with [supported versions of .NET and .NET Framework](../articles/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md#supported-versions). To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in the isolated worker model](../articles/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md).

### [In-process model](#tab/in-process)

[!INCLUDE [functions-in-process-model-retirement-note](./functions-in-process-model-retirement-note.md)]

Your function code runs in the same process as the Functions host process. Supports only [Long Term Support (LTS) versions of .NET](../articles/azure-functions/functions-dotnet-class-library.md#supported-versions). To learn more, see [Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](../articles/azure-functions/functions-dotnet-class-library.md).

### [v4.x](#tab/v4/in-process)

| Supported version | Support level | Expected end-of-support date |
| ---- | ---- |--- |
| [.NET 8 (LTS)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle) | GA | November 10, 2026 |

.NET 6 was previously supported on the in-process model but reached the end of official support on [November 12, 2024][dotnet-policy].

For more information, see [Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](../articles/azure-functions/functions-dotnet-class-library.md) and the [Azure Functions C# script developer reference](../articles/azure-functions/functions-reference-csharp.md).

### [v1.x](#tab/v1/in-process)

[!INCLUDE [functions-runtime-1x-retirement-note](./functions-runtime-1x-retirement-note.md)]

| Supported version | Support level | Expected end-of-support date |
| ---- | ---- |--- |
| .NET Framework 4.8 | GA | [See policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-framework) |
 
For more information, see [Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](../articles/azure-functions/functions-dotnet-class-library.md) and the [Azure Functions C# script developer reference](../articles/azure-functions/functions-reference-csharp.md).

### [v4.x](#tab/v4/isolated-process)

| Supported version | Support level | Expected end-of-support date |
| ---- | ---- |--- |
| .NET 9 | GA | [May 12, 2026][dotnet-policy] |
| .NET 8 | GA | [November 10, 2026][dotnet-policy] |

[dotnet-policy]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle
[dotnet-framework-policy]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-framework

.NET 6 was previously supported on the isolated worker model but reached the end of official support on [November 12, 2024][dotnet-policy].

.NET 7 was previously supported on the isolated worker model but reached the end of official support on [May 14, 2024][dotnet-policy].

For more information, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in the isolated worker model](../articles/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md).

### [v1.x](#tab/v1/isolated-process)

Running C# functions in an isolated worker process isn't supported by version 1.x of the Functions runtime. Instead choose the **In-process** tab or choose **v4.x**.
