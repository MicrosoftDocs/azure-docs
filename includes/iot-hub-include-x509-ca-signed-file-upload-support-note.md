> File upload functionality on devices that use X.509 certificate authority (CA) authentication is in public preview, and [preview mode must be enabled](../articles/iot-hub/iot-hub-preview-mode.md). It is generally available on devices that use X.509 thumbprint authentication or X.509 certificate attestation with [Azure Device Provisioning Service](../articles/iot-dps/concepts-x509-attestation.md). To learn more about X.509 authentication with IoT Hub, see [Supported X.509 certificates](../articles/iot-hub/iot-hub-dev-guide-sas.md#supported-x509-certificates).
