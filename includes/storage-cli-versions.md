## Versions of the Azure CLI

There are two versions of the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) currently available:

* [Azure CLI](../articles/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-cli.md): The current version of the Azure CLI, for use with the Resource Manager deployment model.
* [Azure classic CLI](../articles/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-cli.md): An older version of the Azure CLI, intended for use only with the classic deployment model.
