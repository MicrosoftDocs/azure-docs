 >[AZURE.IMPORTANT] It's important to understand that Azure currently works with two deployment models: Resource Manager, and classic (also known as Service Management). Before you begin your configuration, make sure that you understand the deployment models and tools. For information about the deployment models, see [Azure deployment models](../azure-classic-rm.md). For more information about Azure Resource Manager in general, see [Azure Resource Manager overview](../resource-group-overview.md).
