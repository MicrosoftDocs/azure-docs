This tutorial shows you how to build a sample IoT Plug and Play device application with components, connect it to your IoT hub, and use the Azure IoT explorer tool to view the information it sends to the hub. The sample application is written in C# and is included in the Azure IoT device SDK for C#. A solution builder can use the Azure IoT explorer tool to understand the capabilities of an IoT Plug and Play device without the need to view any device code.

[![Browse code](../articles/iot-central/core/media/common/browse-code.svg)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/tree/main/iothub/device/samples/solutions/PnpDeviceSamples/Thermostat)

In this tutorial, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Download the sample code.
> * Build the sample code.
> * Run the sample device application and validate that it connects to your IoT hub.
> * Review the source code.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [iot-pnp-prerequisites](iot-pnp-prerequisites.md)]

You can run this tutorial on Linux or Windows. The shell commands in this tutorial follow the Linux convention for path separators '`/`', if you're following along on Windows be sure to swap these separators for '`\`'.

* The latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) for your platform.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Clone the SDK repository with the sample code

If you completed [Tutorial: Connect a sample IoT Plug and Play device application running on Windows to IoT Hub (C#)](../articles/iot/tutorial-connect-device.md), you've already cloned the repository.

Clone the samples from the Azure IoT Samples for C# GitHub repository. Open a command prompt in a folder of your choice. Run the following command to clone the [Microsoft Azure IoT SDK for .NET](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp) GitHub repository:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp.git
```

## Build the code

You can now build the sample and run it. Run the following commands to build the sample:

```cmd/sh
cd azure-iot-sdk-csharp/iothub/device/samples/solutions/PnpDeviceSamples/TemperatureController
dotnet build
```

## Run the device sample

To run the sample, run the following command:

```cmd/sh
dotnet run
```

The device is now ready to receive commands and property updates, and has started sending telemetry data to the hub. Keep the sample running as you complete the next steps.

## Use Azure IoT explorer to validate the code

After the device client sample starts, use the Azure IoT explorer tool to verify it's working.

[!INCLUDE [iot-pnp-iot-explorer.md](iot-pnp-iot-explorer.md)]

## Review the code

This sample implements an IoT Plug and Play temperature controller device. The model this sample implements uses [multiple components](../articles/iot/concepts-modeling-guide.md). The [Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL) model file for the temperature device](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/samples/TemperatureController.json) defines the telemetry, properties, and commands the device implements.

The device code connects to your IoT hub using the standard `CreateFromConnectionString` method. The device sends the model ID of the DTDL model it implements in the connection request. A device that sends a model ID is an IoT Plug and Play device:

```csharp
private static DeviceClient InitializeDeviceClient(string hostname, IAuthenticationMethod authenticationMethod)
{
    var options = new ClientOptions
    {
        ModelId = ModelId,
    };

    var deviceClient = DeviceClient.Create(hostname, authenticationMethod, TransportType.Mqtt, options);
    deviceClient.SetConnectionStatusChangesHandler((status, reason) =>
    {
        s_logger.LogDebug($"Connection status change registered - status={status}, reason={reason}.");
    });

    return deviceClient;
}
```

The model ID is stored in the code as shown in the following snippet:

```csharp
private const string ModelId = "dtmi:com:example:TemperatureController;1";
```

After the device connects to your IoT hub, the code registers the command handlers. The `reboot` command is defined in the default component. The `getMaxMinReport` command is defined in each of the two thermostat components:

```csharp
await _deviceClient.SetMethodHandlerAsync("reboot", HandleRebootCommandAsync, _deviceClient, cancellationToken);
await _deviceClient.SetMethodHandlerAsync("thermostat1*getMaxMinReport", HandleMaxMinReportCommandAsync, Thermostat1, cancellationToken);
await _deviceClient.SetMethodHandlerAsync("thermostat2*getMaxMinReport", HandleMaxMinReportCommandAsync, Thermostat2, cancellationToken);

```

There are separate handlers for the desired property updates on the two thermostat components:

```csharp
_desiredPropertyUpdateCallbacks.Add(Thermostat1, TargetTemperatureUpdateCallbackAsync);
_desiredPropertyUpdateCallbacks.Add(Thermostat2, TargetTemperatureUpdateCallbackAsync);

```

The sample code sends telemetry from each thermostat component:

```csharp
await SendTemperatureAsync(Thermostat1, cancellationToken);
await SendTemperatureAsync(Thermostat2, cancellationToken);
```

The `SendTemperatureTelemetryAsync` method uses the `PnpHelper` class to create messages for each component:

```csharp
using Message msg = PnpHelper.CreateIothubMessageUtf8(telemetryName, JsonConvert.SerializeObject(currentTemperature), componentName);
```

The `PnpHelper` class contains other sample methods that you can use with a multiple component model.

Use the Azure IoT explorer tool to view the telemetry and properties from the two thermostat components:

You can also use the Azure IoT explorer tool to call commands in either of the two thermostat components, or in the default component.
