> The content in this article applies to the original basic Azure Table storage. However, there is now a premium offering for Azure Table storage in public preview that offers throughput-optimized tables, global distribution, and automatic secondary indexes. To learn more and try out the new premium experience, please check out [Azure Cosmos DB: Table API](https://aka.ms/premiumtables). This article's programming language is not yet supported in the premium offering, but will be added in the future.
