> [!TIP]
> The content in this article applies to Azure Table storage. However, there is now a premium offering for table storage, the Azure Cosmos DB Table API that offers throughput-optimized tables, global distribution, and automatic secondary indexes. To learn more and try out the premium experience, please check out [Azure Cosmos DB Table API](https://aka.ms/premiumtables). This article's programming language is not yet supported in the premium offering, but will be added in the future.
