> [!TIP]
> The content in this article applies to Azure Table storage. However, there is now a premium offering for table storage, Azure Cosmos DB for Table that offers throughput-optimized tables, global distribution, and automatic secondary indexes. To learn more and try out the premium experience, check out [Azure Cosmos DB for Table](../articles/cosmos-db/table-introduction.md). This article's programming language is not yet supported in the premium offering, but will be added in the future.
