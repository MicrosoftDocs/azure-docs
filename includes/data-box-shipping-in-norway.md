    - Book a pickup online by going to [DHL Express Norway](https://mydhl.express.dhl/no/en/schedule-pickup.html#/schedule-pickup#label-reference) and selecting **Schedule a Pickup**.
    
        On the DHL website, select **No** to create a shipping label. Enter the DHL Waybill number generated when completing **Prepare to ship** process.
