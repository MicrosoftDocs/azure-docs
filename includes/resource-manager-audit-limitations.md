The activity log contains all write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed on your resources. It does not include read operations (GET). You can use the audit logs to find an error when troubleshooting or to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource.

There are two important limitations to keep in mind when working with activity logs:

1. Activity logs are only retained for 90 days.
2. You can only query for a range of 15 days or less.
