| **Scale unit** | **Connections per second** | **Mega-Bits per second** | **Packets per second** |
|---|---|---|---| 
|1 scale unit <br> | 14,000 | 2,000 | 200,000
|2 scale units <br> | 28,000 | 4,000 | 400,000
|3 scale units <br> | 42,000 | 6,000 | 600,000
|4 scale units <br> | 56,000 | 8,000 | 800,000
|5 scale units <br> | 70,000 | 10,000 | 1,000,000
|6 scale units <br> | 84,000 | 12,000 | 1,200,000
|7 scale units <br> | 98,000 | 14,000 | 1,400,000
|8 scale units <br> | 112,000 | 16,000 | 1,600,000
|9 scale units <br> | 126,000 | 18,000 | 1,800,000
|10 scale units <br> | 140,000 | 20,000 | 2,000,000

It is important to note the following:
* Scale units 2-10, during maintenance operations, maintain aggregate throughput. However, scale unit 1, during a maintenance operation, may see a slight variation in throughput numbers.  
* Regardless of the number of scale units deployed, traffic may experience performance degradation if more than 1.5 Gbps is sent in a single TCP flow.
