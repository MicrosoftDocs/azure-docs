> [!NOTE]
> * We're enhancing the developer portal with [Fluent UI Web Components](/fluent-ui/web-components) in the React framework. We're also refreshing the placeholder content displayed when you first open the portal. You'll see the latest updates and appearance with a portal created after June 2025. Your portal's appearance may differ slightly from the screenshots in this article, but the functionality remains consistent.
> * If you're using a version of the portal built on the previous components, you'll see a **Preview new UI design** setting at the bottom of the menu on the left. Enable this setting to try the latest experience. You'll switch to the new UI permanently if you reset your portal.<br/><br/> :::image type="content" source="../articles/api-management/media/api-management-howto-developer-portal-customize/preview-new-ui.png" alt-text="Screenshot of preview toggle in the API Management developer portal.":::
