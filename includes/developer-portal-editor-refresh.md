> * We're enhancing the developer portal with [Fluent UI Web Components](/fluent-ui/web-components) in the React framework. We're also refreshing the placeholder content displayed when you first open the portal. Your portal's appearance may differ slightly from the screenshots in this article, but the functionality remains consistent.
> * If you're using a version of the portal built on the previous components, you'll see a **Preview new UI design** setting at the bottom of the menu on the left. Enable this setting to try the latest experience.<br/><br/> :::image type="content" source="../articles/api-management/media/api-management-howto-developer-portal-customize/preview-new-ui.png" alt-text="Screenshot of preview toggle in the API Management developer portal.":::
