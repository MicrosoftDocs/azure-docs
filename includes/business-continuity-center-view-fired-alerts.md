To monitor the alerts, follow these steps:

1. On **Business Continuity Center**, go to **Monitoring + Reporting** > **Alerts**. 

   The count of all alert rules appears that have at least one or more fired alerts in the selected time range.

2. On **Alerts**, filter the list by *severity of alert*, *category of alert*, *time range* (up to last 15 days), and other parameters.

3. The *Impacted Items count* in the grid shows the number of resources on which an alert corresponding to that alert rule was fired. To view the impacted items, select **View impacted items** in the context menu to view all alerts that were triggered due to that alert rule.

   You can then review each alert and take appropriate action.
