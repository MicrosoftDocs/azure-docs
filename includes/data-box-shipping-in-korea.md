Take the following steps if you're returning the device in Korea.

1. Note down the service request number (shown as *reference number* on the **Prepare to Ship** page of the Data Box local web UI).
1. Make sure the device is powered off and any cables are removed. Spool and securely place the power cord provided with the device in the back compartment.
1. Package the device using the original box that was used for shipping. Ensure that the return consignment note is included.
1. To schedule a pickup, call *Quantium Solutions International* hotline at 070-8231-1418 during office hours (10 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday). Quote *Microsoft Azure pickup* and the service request number to arrange for a collection.

   You may also send email to [microsoft@rocketparcel.com](mailto:microsoft@rocketparcel.com) to schedule a pickup. Use the following template:

   ```
   To: microsoft@rocketparcel.com
   Subject: Microsoft Azure Pickup | Service Request Number: <ReferenceNumber>
   Body:
   * Service Request Number (reference number): <ReferenceNumber>
   * Requested pickup date: yyyy/mm/dd;time:HH MM
   * <If the consignment note is missing, note that here along with the sender and receiver information. If the consignment note was included, please delete this section.>
   ```  

1. If you come across any issues or are asked to pay additional fees when scheduling a pickup, email Azure Data Box Operations at [adbops@microsoft.com](mailto:adbops@microsoft.com) for assistance. Please provide the order name and the issue encountered in the **Subject** line.

Once the device is picked up and scanned by the carrier, the order status in the Azure portal is updated to **Picked up**, and a tracking ID is displayed.
