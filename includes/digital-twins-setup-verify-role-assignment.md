One way to check that you have successfully set up the role assignment is to view the role assignments for the Azure Digital Twins instance in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 

Go to your Azure Digital Twins instance in the Azure portal. To get there, you can look it up on the page of [Azure Digital Twins instances](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.DigitalTwins%2FdigitalTwinsInstances) or search its name in the portal search bar.

Then, view all of its assigned roles under **Access control (IAM) > Role assignments**. Your role assignment should appear in the list.
