Take the following steps if you're returning the device in South Africa.

1. Pack the device for return shipment in the original box.
2. Spool and securely place the power cord that was provided with the device in the back of the device.
3. Note the tracking number (shown as reference number on the **Prepare to Ship** page of the Data Box local web UI). The tracking number is available after the "Prepare to ship" step completes successfully. Download the shipping label from this page, and paste it on the packing box.
4. Request a return code from Azure Data Box Operations. A return code is required for delivering the package back to the datacenter. Send email to [adbops@microsoft.com](mailto:adbops@microsoft.com). Note this code on the shipping label next to the return address, where it is clearly visible.
5. Book a pickup with DHL using one of the following methods:
 
   * Book a pickup online by going to [DHL Express South Africa](https://mydhl.express.dhl/za/en/schedule-pickup.html#/schedule-pickup#label-reference) and selecting **Schedule a Pickup**.

        On the DHL website, select **No** to create a shipping label. Enter the DHL Waybill number generated when completing **Prepare to ship** process.
