2. Spool and securely place the power cord that was provided with the device in the back of the device.
3. Note the tracking number (shown as reference number on the **Prepare to Ship** page of the Data Box local web UI). The tracking number is available after the "Prepare to ship" step completes successfully.â€¯Download the shipping label from this page, and paste it on the packing box.
4. Request a return code from Azure Data Box Operations. A return code is required for delivering the package back to the datacenter. Send email to [adbops@microsoft.com](mailto:adbops@microsoft.com). Note this code on the shipping label next to the return address, where it is clearly visible.
