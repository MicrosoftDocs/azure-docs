Gateways undergo regular updates aimed at enhancing functionality, reliability, performance, and security. These updates encompass a wide range of activities, including patching software components, upgrading networking components, and decommissioning hardware.

In most cases, these updates are carefully planned to minimize their impact on customer operations. Factors such as Azure scheduling updates during nonbusiness hours in the gateway region, and customers having robust architecture, help ensure that most updates don't disrupt normal business activities. However, there might be instances where customers are affected by these updates. To mitigate any potential impact on operations, you can configure maintenance windows during non-business hours. This allows you to avoid disruptions and maintain smooth gateway operations.
