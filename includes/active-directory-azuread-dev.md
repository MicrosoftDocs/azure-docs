> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Microsoft identity platform (v2.0)](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview) is an evolution of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) developer platform (v1.0). It allows developers to build applications that sign in all Microsoft identities and get tokens to call Microsoft APIs such as Microsoft Graph or APIs that developers have built.
> This content is for the older, Azure AD v1.0 endpoint. We recommend that you use the v2.0 endpoint for new projects. For more info, read [Why update to Microsoft identity platform (v2.0)?](/azure/active-directory/azuread-dev/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) as well as [Microsoft identity platform limitations](/azure/active-directory/azuread-dev/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison#limitations).
