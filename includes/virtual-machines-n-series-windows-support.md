## Supported operating systems and drivers

### NVIDIA Tesla (CUDA) drivers

NVIDIA Tesla (CUDA) drivers for NC, NCv2, NCv3, NCasT4_v3, ND, and NDv2-series VMs (optional for NV-series) are supported only on the operating systems listed in the following table. Driver download links are current at time of publication. For the latest drivers, visit the [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) website.

> [!TIP]
> As an alternative to manual CUDA driver installation on a Windows Server VM, you can deploy an Azure [Data Science Virtual Machine](../articles/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview.md) image. The DSVM editions for Windows Server 2016 pre-install NVIDIA CUDA drivers, the CUDA Deep Neural Network Library, and other tools.


| OS | Driver |
| -------- |------------- |
| Windows Server 2019 | [451.82](http://us.download.nvidia.com/tesla/451.82/451.82-tesla-desktop-winserver-2019-2016-international.exe) (.exe) |
| Windows Server 2016 | [451.82](http://us.download.nvidia.com/tesla/451.82/451.82-tesla-desktop-winserver-2019-2016-international.exe) (.exe) |

### NVIDIA GRID drivers

Microsoft redistributes NVIDIA GRID driver installers for NV and NVv3-series VMs used as virtual workstations or for virtual applications. Install only these GRID drivers on Azure NV-series VMs, only on the operating systems listed in the following table. These drivers include licensing for GRID Virtual GPU Software in Azure. You do not need to set up a NVIDIA vGPU software license server.

The GRID drivers redistributed by Azure do not work on non-NV series VMs like NC, NCv2, NCv3, ND, and NDv2-series VMs. The one exception is the NCas_T4_V3 VM series where the GRID drivers will enable the graphics functionalities similar to NV-series.

Please note that the Nvidia extension will always install the latest driver. We provide links to the previous version here for customers, who have dependency on an older version.
