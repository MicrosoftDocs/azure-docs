> [!TIP]
> In Azure Database Migration Service, you can migrate your databases offline or while they are online. In an *offline* migration, application downtime starts when the migration starts. To limit downtime to the time it takes you to cut over to the new environment after the migration, use an *online* migration. We recommend that you test an offline migration to determine whether the downtime is acceptable. If the expected downtime isn't acceptable, do an online migration.
