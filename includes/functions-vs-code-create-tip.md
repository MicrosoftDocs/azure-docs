> [!TIP]
> By default, the Azure resources required by your function app are created based on the name you enter for your function app. By default, the resources are created with the function app in the same, new resource group. If you want to customize the names of the associated resources or reuse existing resources, [publish the project with advanced create options](../articles/azure-functions/functions-develop-vs-code.md?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).
