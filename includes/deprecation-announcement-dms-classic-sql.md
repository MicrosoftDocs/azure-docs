> **[Azure Database Migration Service (classic) - SQL scenarios are on a deprecation path](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/retirement-azure-database-migration-service-classic-sql-server-scenarios-deprecation/)**. Since **August 1, 2023**, you're no longer able to create new Database Migration Service (classic) resources for SQL Server scenarios from Azure portal. The service will be retired on **March 15, 2026** for all customers. For seamless migrations from multiple database sources to Azure SQL Targets, Microsoft recommend using the latest version of [Azure Database Migration Service](https://aka.ms/dmslatest), which is available as [Azure SQL Migration](/azure-data-studio/extensions/azure-sql-migration-extension) an extension in Azure Data Studio, or via [Azure Portal](https://aka.ms/dmsazureportal), or through [Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI](../articles/dms/migration-dms-powershell-cli.md). For more information, see [Retirement notice: Database Migration Service (classic)](https://aka.ms/dmsclassicportal).
