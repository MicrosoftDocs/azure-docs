> On July 11, 2026, Blueprints (Preview) will be deprecated. Migrate your existing blueprint definitions and assignments to [Template Specs](../articles/azure-resource-manager/bicep/template-specs.md) and [Deployment Stacks](../articles/azure-resource-manager/bicep/deployment-stacks.md). Blueprint artifacts are to be converted to ARM JSON templates or Bicep files used to define deployment stacks. To learn how to author an artifact as an ARM resource, see:
