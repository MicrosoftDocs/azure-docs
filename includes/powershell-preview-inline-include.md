This topic includes PowerShell cmdlets from Azure PowerShell 1.0 Preview. If you do not wish to install this preview release right now, you can continue using Azure PowerShell 0.9.8. In most cases, the only difference between the two versions is that the 1.0 Preview cmdlet name follows the pattern {verb}-AzureRm{noun}; whereas, the 0.9.8 name does not include **Rm** (for example, New-AzureRmResourceGroup instead of New-AzureResourceGroup). When the difference between the versions is more significant, this topic shows examples for both versions.

When using Azure PowerShell 0.9.8, you must first enable the Resource Manager mode by running the **Switch-AzureMode AzureResourceManager** command. This command is not necessary in 1.0 Preview.

For information about the 1.0 Preview release, including notes about recommended use, see [Azure PowerShell 1.0 Preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azps-1-0-pre/). For information about installing Azure PowerShell 1.0 Preview, see [Azure Resource Manager Cmdlets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt125356.aspx).
