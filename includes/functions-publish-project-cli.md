## Deploy the function project to Azure

With the necessary resources in place, you're now ready to deploy your local functions project to the function app in Azure by using the [func azure functionapp publish](functions-run-local.md#project-file-deployment) command. In the following example, replace `<APP_NAME>` with the name of your app.

```console
func azure functionapp publish <APP_NAME>
```

If you see the error, "Can't find app with name ...", wait a few seconds and try again, as Azure may not have fully initialized the app after the previous `az functionapp create` command.

The publish command shows results similar to the following output (truncated for simplicity):

<pre>
...

Getting site publishing info...
Creating archive for current directory...
Performing remote build for functions project.

...

Deployment successful.
Remote build succeeded!
