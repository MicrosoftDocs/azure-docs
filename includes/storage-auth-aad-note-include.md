> [!NOTE]
> - The preview of Azure AD authentication for blobs and queues is intended for non-production use only. Production service-level agreements (SLAs) are not currently available. If Azure AD authentication is not yet supported for your scenario, continue to use Shared Key authorization or SAS tokens in your applications.
>
> - During the preview, RBAC role assignments may take up to five minutes to propagate.
>
> - To authorize blob and queue operations with an OAuth token, you must use HTTPS.
>
> - The Azure portal now supports using Azure AD credentials to read and write blob and queue data, as part of the preview release.
> 
> - [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) currently uses your storage account key to access blob and queue data.
>
> - Azure Files supports authentication with Azure AD over SMB for domain-joined VMs only (preview). To learn about using Azure AD over SMB for Azure Files, see [Overview of Azure Active Directory authentication over SMB for Azure Files (preview)](../articles/storage/files/storage-files-active-directory-overview.md).
