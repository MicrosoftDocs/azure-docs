There are two options for moving from Mobile Services to App Service: migration or upgrade. Either option will give you access to all of the hosting capabilities of App Service:

- *Migrating* a service just changes the underlying environment that hosts your mobile backend. It requires **no code changes** to either the mobile client or the mobile server project. If you use the automated migration option, this preserves your **service.azure-mobile.net** URL. 

- *Upgrading* a service does **require code changes** to both your server and client project, but allows you to take advantage of new mobile SDK features, such as improvements to authentication and more flexibility for your server project.
