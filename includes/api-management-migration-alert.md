> Support for API Management instances hosted on the `stv1` platform is being retired. In global Azure, the [retirement date is 31 August 2024](../articles/api-management/breaking-changes/stv1-platform-retirement-august-2024.md). In Azure Government and in Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure in China), the [retirement date is 28 February 2025](../articles/api-management/breaking-changes/stv1-platform-retirement-sovereign-clouds-february-2025.md). If you have instances hosted on the `stv1` platform, migrate them to the `stv2` platform before the retirement date to avoid service disruptions.
