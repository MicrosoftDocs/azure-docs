Based on the storage account selected, Data Box creates up to:

* Three shares for each associated storage account for GPv1 and GPv2.
* One share for premium storage.
* One share for blob storage account.

Under block blob and page blob shares, first-level entities are containers, and second-level entities are blobs. Under shares for Azure Files, first-level entities are shares, second-level entities are files.

The following table shows the UNC path to the shares on your Data Box and Azure Storage path URL where the data is uploaded. The final Azure Storage path URL can be derived from the UNC share path.
 
| Blobs and Files | Paths and URLs |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Azure Block blobs | <li>UNC path to shares: `\\<DeviceIPAddress>\<StorageAccountName_BlockBlob>\<ContainerName>\files\a.txt`</li><li>Azure Storage URL: `https://<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/<ContainerName>/files/a.txt`</li> |  
| Azure Page blobs  | <li>UNC path to shares: `\\<DeviceIPAddress>\<StorageAccountName_PageBlob>\<ContainerName>\files\a.txt`</li><li>Azure Storage URL: `https://<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/<ContainerName>/files/a.txt`</li>   |  
| Azure Files       |<li>UNC path to shares: `\\<DeviceIPAddress>\<StorageAccountName_AzFile>\<ShareName>\files\a.txt`</li><li>Azure Storage URL: `https://<StorageAccountName>.file.core.windows.net/<ShareName>/files/a.txt`</li>        |
