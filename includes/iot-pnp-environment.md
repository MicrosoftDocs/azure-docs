In [Set up your environment](../articles/iot/set-up-environment.md), you created four environment variables to configure the sample to use the Device Provisioning Service (DPS) to connect to your IoT hub:

* **IOTHUB_DEVICE_SECURITY_TYPE** with the value `DPS`
* **IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ID_SCOPE** with the DPS ID scope.
* **IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_ID** with the value `my-pnp-device`.
* **IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_KEY** with the enrollment primary key.
* **IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ENDPOINT** with the value `global.azure-devices-provisioning.net`.
