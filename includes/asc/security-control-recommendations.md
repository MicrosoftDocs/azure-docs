Since the ports don't always need to be open, one mitigation strategy is to reduce exposure to the ports using just-in-time network access controls, network security groups, and virtual machine port management.<br>Since many IT organizations don't block SSH communications outbound from their network, attackers can create encrypted tunnels that allow RDP ports on infected systems to communicate back to the attacker command to control servers.

SSL/TLS protocols should be used to exchange data and a VPN is recommended.

Azures use symmetric encryption to encrypt and decrypt large amounts of data at rest. A symmetric encryption key is used to encrypt data as it is written to storage. That encryption key is also used to decrypt that data as it is readied for use in memory. Keys must be stored in a secure location with identity-based access control and audit policies. One such secure location is Azure Key Vault. If an attacker obtains the encrypted data but not the encryption keys, the attacker can't access the data without breaking the encryption.</td>
