Notes on service limits:

1. By default, the time-out for the Functions 1.x runtime in an App Service plan is unbounded.  
2. Requires the App Service plan be set to [Always On](/azure/azure-functions/dedicated-plan#always-on). Pay at standard [rates](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/). A grace period of 10 minutes is given during platform updates.
3. These limits are [set in the host](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/blob/dev/src/WebJobs.Script.WebHost/web.config).  
4. The actual number of function apps that you can host depends on the activity of the apps, the size of the machine instances, and the corresponding resource utilization.  
5. The storage limit is the total content size in temporary storage across all apps in the same App Service plan. For Consumption plans on Linux, the storage is currently 1.5 GB.
6. Consumption plan uses an Azure Files share for persisted storage. When you provide your own Azure Files share, the specific share size limits depend on the storage account you set for [WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING](/azure/azure-functions/functions-app-settings#website_contentazurefileconnectionstring). 
7. On Linux, you must [explicitly mount your own Azure Files share](/azure/azure-functions/storage-considerations#mount-file-shares).
8. When your function app is hosted in a [Consumption plan](/azure/azure-functions/consumption-plan), only the CNAME option is supported. For function apps in a [Premium plan](/azure/azure-functions/functions-premium-plan) or an [App Service plan](/azure/azure-functions/dedicated-plan), you can map a custom domain using either a CNAME or an A record.  
9. There's no maximum execution time-out duration enforced. However, the grace period given to a function execution is 60 minutes [during scale in](../articles/azure-functions/event-driven-scaling.md#scale-in-behaviors) and 10 minutes during platform updates.
10. Workers are roles that host customer apps. Workers are available in three fixed sizes: One vCPU/3.5 GB RAM; Two vCPU/7 GB RAM; Four vCPU/14 GB RAM.   
11. See [App Service limits](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#app-service-limits) for details.  
12. Including the production slot.  
13. There's currently a limit of 5,000 function apps in a given subscription. 
14. Flex Consumption plan instance sizes are currently defined as either 2,048 MB or 4,096 MB. For more information, see [Instance memory](/azure/azure-functions/flex-consumption-plan#instance-memory).  
15. Flex Consumption plan has a regional subscription quota that limits the total memory usage of all instances across a given region. For more information, see [Instance memory](/azure/azure-functions/flex-consumption-plan#instance-memory).  
16. When the [minimum number of replicas](/azure/container-apps/scale-app#scale-definition) is set to zero, the default time-out depends on the specific triggers used in the app.
17. When the [minimum number of replicas](../articles/container-apps/scale-app.md#scale-definition) is set to one or more.
18. On Container Apps, you can set the [maximum number of replicas](/azure/container-apps/scale-app#scale-definition), which is honored as long as there's enough cores quota available.
