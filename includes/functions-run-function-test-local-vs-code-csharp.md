## Run the function locally

Visual Studio Code integrates with [Azure Functions Core tools](../articles/azure-functions/functions-run-local.md) to let you run this project on your local development computer before you publish to Azure. If you don't already have Core Tools installed locally, you are prompted to install it the first time you run your project. 

1. To call your function, press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start the function app project. The **Terminal** panel displays the output from Core Tools. Your app starts in the **Terminal** panel. You can see the URL endpoint of your HTTP-triggered function running locally.

    If you don't already have Core Tools installed, select **Install** to install Core Tools when prompted to do so.  
    If you have trouble running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal for Visual Studio Code isn't set to **WSL Bash**.

1. With the Core Tools running, go to the **Azure: Functions** area. Under **Functions**, expand **Local Project** > **Functions**. Right-click (Windows) or <kbd>Ctrl -</kbd> click (macOS) the `HttpExample` function and choose **Execute Function Now...**.

1. In the **Enter request body**, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to send a request message to your function.

1. When the function executes locally and returns a response, a notification is raised in Visual Studio Code. Information about the function execution is shown in the **Terminal** panel.

1. Press <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd> to stop Core Tools and disconnect the debugger.
