It's important to understand that Azure currently works with two deployment models: Resource Manager and classic. Before you begin your configuration, verify that you are using the instructions for the deployment model that you want to work in. For example, if you are working with a virtual network that was created using the classic deployment model, you would use the classic deployment model configuration steps and tools, not the Resource Manager steps and tools. 

You can't add Resource Manager resources and configure settings for a virtual network that was created using the classic deployment model and vice versa. Additionally, behavior of some features can differ between the two deployment models. For information about the deployment models, see [Understanding Resource Manager deployment and classic deployment](../articles/resource-manager-deployment-model.md).
