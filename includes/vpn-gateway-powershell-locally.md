You can also install and run the Azure PowerShell cmdlets locally on your computer. PowerShell cmdlets are updated frequently. If you haven't installed the latest version, the values specified in the instructions may fail. To find the versions of Azure PowerShell installed on your computer, use the `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` cmdlet. To install or update, see [Install the Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).
