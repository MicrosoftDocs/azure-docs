- To access the Azure Stack Edge service, your organization needs to have an Enterprise Agreement (EA) or Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) subscription. For more information, see [Sign up for an Azure subscription](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9CmaHZeOAo).
- Because this management service is hosted in Azure, it's protected by the Azure security features. For more information about the security features provided by Azure, go to the [Microsoft Azure Trust Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/trust-center/security/).
- For SDK management operations, you can get the encryption key for your resource in **Device properties**. You can view the encryption key only if you have permissions for the Resource Graph API.
