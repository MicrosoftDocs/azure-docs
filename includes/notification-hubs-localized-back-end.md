When you send template notifications, you only need to provide a set of properties. In this scenario, the set of properties contain the localized version of the current news.

```json
{
    "News_English": "World News in English!",
    "News_French": "World News in French!",
    "News_Mandarin": "World News in Mandarin!"
}
```

### Send notifications using a C# console app

This section shows how to send notifications using a console app. The code broadcasts notifications to both Windows Store and iOS devices. Modify the `SendTemplateNotificationAsync` method in the console app you previously created with the following code:

```csharp
private static async void SendTemplateNotificationAsync()
{
    // Define the notification hub.
    NotificationHubClient hub = NotificationHubClient.CreateClientFromConnectionString(
            "<connection string with full access>", "<hub name>");

    // Apple requires the apns-push-type header for all requests
    var headers = new Dictionary<string, string> {{"apns-push-type", "alert"}};

    // Sending the notification as a template notification. All template registrations that contain 
    // "messageParam" or "News_<local selected>" and the proper tags will receive the notifications. 
    // This includes APNS, GCM, WNS, and MPNS template registrations.
    Dictionary<string, string> templateParams = new Dictionary<string, string>();

    // Create an array of breaking news categories.
    var categories = new string[] { "World", "Politics", "Business", "Technology", "Science", "Sports"};
    var locales = new string[] { "English", "French", "Mandarin" };

    foreach (var category in categories)
    {
        templateParams["messageParam"] = "Breaking " + category + " News!";

        // Sending localized News for each tag too...
        foreach( var locale in locales)
        {
            string key = "News_" + locale;

            // Your real localized news content would go here.
            templateParams[key] = "Breaking " + category + " News in " + locale + "!";
        }

        await hub.SendTemplateNotificationAsync(templateParams, category);
    }
}
```

The SendTemplateNotificationAsync method delivers the localized piece of news to **all** your devices, irrespective of the platform. Your notification hub builds and delivers the correct native payload to all the devices subscribed to a specific tag.

### Sending notification with Mobile Services

In your Mobile Services scheduler, use the following script:

```csharp
var azure = require('azure');
var notificationHubService = azure.createNotificationHubService('<hub name>', '<connection string with full access>');
var notification = {
        "News_English": "World News in English!",
        "News_French": "World News in French!",
        "News_Mandarin", "World News in Mandarin!"
}
notificationHubService.send('World', notification, function(error) {
    if (!error) {
        console.warn("Notification successful");
    }
});
```
