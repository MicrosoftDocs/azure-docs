### Set up local Azure credentials

This sample uses [DefaultAzureCredential](/dotnet/api/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-dotnet&preserve-view=true) (part of the `Azure.Identity` library) to authenticate users with the Azure Digital Twins instance when you run it on your local machine. For more information on different ways a client app can authenticate with Azure Digital Twins, see [Write app authentication code](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-authenticate-client.md).
