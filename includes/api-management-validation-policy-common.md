## Logs

Details about the validation errors during policy execution are logged to the variable in `context.Variables` specified in the `errors-variable-name` attribute in the policy's root element. When configured in a `prevent` action, a validation error blocks further request or response processing and is also propagated to the `context.LastError` property. 

To investigate errors, use a [trace](../articles/api-management/trace-policy.md) policy to log the errors from context variables to [Application Insights](../articles/api-management/api-management-howto-app-insights.md).

## Performance implications

Adding a validation policy may affect API throughput. The following general principles apply:
* The larger the API schema size, the lower the throughput will be. 
* The larger the payload in a request or response, the lower the throughput will be. 
* The size of the API schema has a larger impact on performance than the size of the payload. 
* Validation against an API schema that is several megabytes in size may cause request or response timeouts under some conditions. The effect is more pronounced in the  **Consumption** and **Developer** tiers of the service. 

We recommend performing load tests with your expected production workloads to assess the impact of validation policies on API throughput.
