> [AZURE.NOTE] This topic includes PowerShell cmdlets from Azure PowerShell 1.0 Preview, which is a preview release and not intended for mission-critical apps. If you are running mission-critical apps, please continue to use Azure PowerShell 0.9.8. In most cases, the only difference between the two versions is that the 1.0 Preview cmdlet name follows the pattern {verb}-AzureRm{noun}; whereas, the 0.9.8 name does not include **Rm** (for example, New-AzureRmResourceGroup instead of New-AzureResourceGroup). When the difference between the versions is more significant, this topic shows examples for both versions.
