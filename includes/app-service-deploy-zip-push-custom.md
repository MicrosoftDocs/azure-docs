## Deployment customization

The deployment process assumes that the .zip file that you push contains a ready-to-run app. By default, no customizations are run. To enable the same build processes that you get with continuous integration, add the following to your application settings:

`SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=true`

When you use .zip push deployment, this setting is **false** by default. The default is **true** for continuous integration deployments. When set to **true**, your deployment-related settings are used during deployment. You can configure these settings either as app settings or in a .deployment configuration file that's located in the root of your .zip file. For more information, see [Repository and deployment-related settings](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Configurable-settings#repository-and-deployment-related-settings) in the deployment reference.
