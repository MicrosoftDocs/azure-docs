Take the following steps if returning the device in US or Canada.

**If you receive the device packaged in a box, retain the box, and DO NOT discard it.**

1. Make sure the data copy to the device is complete, and the **Prepare to ship** step is completed successfully.
1. Note the tracking number. This tracking number is shown as *reference number* on the **Prepare to Ship** page of the Data Box local web UI. The tracking number is available after the **Prepare to Ship** step completes successfully. Download the shipping label from this page and paste it on the packing box. If you received a device without a box, ensure that the shipping label is displayed on the E-ink display. If the label is damaged or lost, or is not displayed on the E-ink display, contact Microsoft Support.
1. Make sure that the device is powered off and cables are removed.
1. Spool and securely place the power cord that was provided with device in the back of the device.
1. **Package the device using the original box that was used for shipping. Ensure that the return label is included.**
1. Schedule a pickup:

    If your order was delivered via FedEx, schedule a pickup with FedEx. To schedule a pickup:

    - Call the local FedEx number: 800-Go-FedEx.
    - Provide the reverse shipment tracking number as shown on your printed label.
    - Contact adbops@microsoft.com if you encounter any issues while scheduling a pickup.
    - You can also drop your Data Box Disk at your nearest FedEx drop-off location.

    If your order was delivered via UPS, schedule a pickup with UPS. To schedule a pickup: 

    - Call the local UPS (country/region-specific toll-free number). 
    - In your call, quote the reverse shipment tracking number as shown in the E-ink display or your printed label. If you don't quote the tracking number, UPS will require an additional charge during pickup.
    - If any issues are encountered while scheduling a pickup, or you're asked to pay additional fees, contact send email to adbops@microsoft.com. Instead of scheduling the pickup, you can also drop off the Data Box at the nearest drop-off location.

1. After the Data Box is picked up and scanned by your carrier, the order status in the portal updates to Picked up. A tracking ID is also displayed.
