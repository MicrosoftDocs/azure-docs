Take the following steps if returning the device in US or Canada.

1. Make sure that the device is powered off and cables are removed.
2. Spool and securely place the power cord that was provided with device in the back of the device.
3. Ensure that the shipping label is displayed on the E-ink display and schedule a pickup with your carrier. If the label is damaged or lost or not displayed on the E-ink display, contact Microsoft Support. If the Support suggests, then you can go to **Overview > Download shipping label** in the Azure portal. Download the shipping label and affix on the device. 
4. Schedule a pickup with UPS if returning the device. To schedule a pickup:

    * Call the local UPS (country/region-specific toll free number).
    * In your call, quote the reverse shipment tracking number as shown in the E-ink display or your printed label. If you don't quote the tracking number, UPS will require an additional charge during pickup.
    * If any issues come up while you're scheduling a pickup, or you're asked to pay additional fees, contact Azure Data Box Operations. Send email to [adbops@microsoft.com](mailto:adbops@microsoft.com).

    Instead of scheduling the pickup, you can also drop off the Data Box at the nearest drop-off location.
4. Once the Data Box is picked up and scanned by your carrier, the order status in the portal updates to **Picked up**. A tracking ID is also displayed.
