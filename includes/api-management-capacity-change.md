> [!IMPORTANT]
> As part of the [May 2025 service updates](https://github.com/Azure/API-Management/releases/tag/release-service-2025-05), we refined the calculation logic for the capacity metric to enhance accuracy and consistency. After your service receives this update, you may notice higher reported capacity values. This is solely due to improved measurement logic - your serviceâ€™s actual performance and throughput remain unaffected.
> To ensure optimal resource management, you may need to revisit and adjust your scaling thresholds. For guidance on using the capacity metric for scaling, refer to [Use capacity for scaling decisions](../articles/api-management/api-management-capacity.md#use-capacity-for-scaling-decisions) mentioned later in this document.
