An instance is an optimized Azure VM that is created when you configure Azure Bastion. When you configure Azure Bastion using the Basic SKU, 2 instances are created. If you use the Standard SKU, you can specify the number of instances between 2-50.

| Workload Type* | Session Limit per Instance** |
| --- | --- |
| Light |25 |
| Medium |20 |
| Heavy |2 |

*These workload types are defined here: [Remote Desktop workloads](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/remote-desktop-workloads)<br>
**These limits are based on RDP performance tests for Azure Bastion. The numbers may vary due to other on-going RDP sessions or other on-going SSH sessions.
