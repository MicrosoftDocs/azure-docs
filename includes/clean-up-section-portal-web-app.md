## Clean up resources

In the preceding steps, you created Azure resources in a resource group. If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, you can delete them by deleting the resource group.
 
1. From your web app's **Overview** page in the Azure portal, select the **myResourceGroup** link under **Resource group**.
1. On the resource group page, make sure that the listed resources are the ones you want to delete.
1. Select **Delete resource group**, type **myResourceGroup** in the text box, and then select **Delete**.
1. Confirm again by selecting **Delete**.
