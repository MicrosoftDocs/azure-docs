>
>- Create a default [App Service plan](/cli/azure/appservice/plan#az-appservice-plan-create).
>
>- [Create an app](/cli/azure/webapp#az-webapp-create) with the specified name.
>
>- [Zip deploy](../articles/app-service/deploy-zip.md#deploy-a-zip-package) all files from the current working directory, [with build automation enabled](../articles/app-service/deploy-zip.md#enable-build-automation-for-zip-deploy).
>
>- Cache the parameters locally in the *.azure/config* file so that you don't need to specify them again when deploying later with `az webapp up` or other `az webapp` commands from the project folder. The cached values are used automatically by default.
