> [!CAUTION]
> Leaving the RDP port open to the internet is only recommended for testing. For production environments, it's recommended to restrict access to the RDP port to a specific IP address or range of IP addresses. You can also block internet access to the RDP port and use [Azure Bastion](../articles/bastion/bastion-overview.md?toc=/azure/network-watcher/toc.json) to securely connect to your virtual machine from the Azure portal.
