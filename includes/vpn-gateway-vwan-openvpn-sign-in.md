On the **Azure VPN - Properties** page, configure sign-in settings.

1. Set **Enabled for users to sign-in?** to **Yes**. This setting allows all users in the AD tenant to connect to the VPN successfully.
2. Set **User assignment required?** to **Yes** if you want to limit sign-in to only users that have permissions to the Azure VPN.
3. Save your changes.
