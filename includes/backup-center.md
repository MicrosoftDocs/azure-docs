> [!NOTE]
> The functionality described in the following sections can also be accessed via [Backup center](../articles/backup/backup-center-overview.md). Backup center is a single unified management experience in Azure. It enables enterprises to govern, monitor, operate, and analyze backups at scale. With this solution, you can perform most of the key backup management operations without being limited to the scope of an individual vault.
