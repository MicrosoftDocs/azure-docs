* You have your Microsoft Azure storage account with access credentials, such as storage account name and access key.

* The subscription you use for Data Box service is one of the following types:
  * Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) for new subscriptions or Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA) for existing subscriptions. Read more about [MCA for new subscriptions](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/how-to-buy/microsoft-customer-agreement) and [EA subscriptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/).
