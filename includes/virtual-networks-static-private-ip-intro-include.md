A virtual machine (VM) is automatically assigned a private IP address from a range that you specify, based on the subnet in which the VM is deployed. The VM retains the address until the VM is deleted. Azure dynamically assigns the next available private IP address from the subnet you create a VM in. If you want a specific IP address from the subnet assigned to the VM, assign a static IP address.
