To maximize performance, use a separate storage account for each function app. This approach is particularly important when you have Durable Functions or Event Hubs triggered functions, which both generate a high volume of storage transactions. When your application logic interacts with Azure Storage, either directly (using the Storage SDK) or through one of the storage bindings, you should use a dedicated storage account. For example, if you have an event hub-triggered function writing some data to blob storage, use two storage accounts: one for the function app and another for the blobs that the function stores.
