You can use Azure Cloud Shell to run most PowerShell cmdlets and CLI commands, instead of installing Azure PowerShell or CLI locally. Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that has common Azure tools preinstalled and is configured to use with your account. To run any code contained in this article on Azure Cloud Shell, open a Cloud Shell session, use the **Copy** button on a code block to copy the code, and paste it into the Cloud Shell session with __Ctrl+Shift+V__ on Windows and Linux, or __Cmd+Shift+V__ on macOS. Pasted text is not automatically executed, press **Enter** to run code.

There are a few ways to launch the Cloud Shell:

| Option | Link |
