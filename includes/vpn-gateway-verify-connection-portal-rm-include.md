In the Azure portal, you can view the connection status of a VPN gateway by going to the connection. The following steps show one way to navigate to your connection and verify.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your virtual network gateway.
1. On the page for your virtual network gateway, click **Connections**. You can see the status of each connection.
1. Click the name of the connection that you want to verify. In **Essentials**, you can view more information about your connection. The **Status** values are 'Succeeded' and 'Connected' when you have made a successful connection.
