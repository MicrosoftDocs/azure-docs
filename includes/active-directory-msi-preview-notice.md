Managed identities for Azure resources is a feature of Microsoft Entra ID. Each of the [Azure services that support managed identities for Azure resources](../articles/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities.md) are subject to their own timeline. Make sure you review the [availability](../articles/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities.md) status of managed identities for your resource and [known issues](../articles/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/known-issues.md) before you begin.
