<!-- User feedback is being incorporated into customer-managed planned failover (preview) and the feature is temporarily unavailable in all regions. After completion, updated documentation will be released to reflect the regions in which the feature is available.-->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer-managed planned failover is currently in PREVIEW and is supported in all public GRS/GZRS regions. To determine if a region supports GZRS, see the [Azure regions list](/azure/reliability/regions-list#azure-regions-list-1). To support GZRS, a region must support availability zones and have a paired region.
>
> To opt in to the preview, see [Set up preview features in Azure subscription](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/preview-features?tabs=azure-portal#register-preview-feature) and specify AllowSoftFailover as the feature name. The provider name for this preview feature is Microsoft.Storage.
