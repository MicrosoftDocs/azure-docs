Obtain the .cer file for the root certificate. You can use either a root certificate that was generated with an enterprise solution (recommended), or generate a self-signed certificate. After you create the root certificate, export the public certificate data (not the private key) as a Base64 encoded X.509 .cer file. You upload this file later to Azure.

* **Enterprise certificate:** If you're using an enterprise solution, you can use your existing certificate chain. Acquire the .cer file for the root certificate that you want to use.
* **Self-signed root certificate:** If you aren't using an enterprise certificate solution, create a self-signed root certificate. Otherwise, the certificates you create won't be compatible with your P2S connections and clients receive a connection error when they try to connect. You can use Azure PowerShell, MakeCert, or OpenSSL. The steps in the following articles describe how to generate a compatible self-signed root certificate:

  * [PowerShell instructions for Windows 10 or later](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md): These instructions require PowerShell on a computer running Windows 10 or later. Client certificates that are generated from the root certificate can be installed on any supported P2S client.
  * [MakeCert instructions](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site-makecert.md): Use MakeCert to generate certificates if you don't have access to a computer running Windows 10 or later. Although MakeCert is deprecated, you can still use it to generate certificates. Client certificates that you generate from the root certificate can be installed on any supported P2S client.
