4. Specify in the values for **Public IP address**. These settings specify the public IP address object that gets associated to the VPN gateway. When you create a public IP address object, an IP address is assigned to the object. The public IP address object is then associated to the gateway. For gateways that aren't [zone-redundant](../articles/vpn-gateway/about-zone-redundant-vnet-gateways.md), the only time the Public IP address changes is when the gateway is deleted and re-created. It doesn't change across resizing, resetting, or other internal maintenance/upgrades of your VPN gateway. You must associate a public IP address object that uses the **Standard** SKU. The Basic SKU public IP address object is only supported for Basic SKU VPN gateways.
