   * **Subscription**: Verify that the subscription listed is the correct one. You can change subscriptions by using the dropdown box.
   * **Resource group**: Select an existing resource group or select **Create new** to create a new one. For more information about resource groups, see [Azure Resource Manager overview](../articles/azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md#resource-groups).
   * **Name**: Enter the name for your virtual network.
   * **Region**: Select the location for your virtual network. The location determines where the resources that you deploy to this virtual network will reside.

1. Select **IP Addresses** to go to the **IP Addresses** tab. On the **IP Addresses** tab, configure the settings.

   * **IPv4 address space**: By default, an address space is automatically created. You can select the address space and adjust it to reflect your own values. You can also add a different address space and remove the default that was automatically created. For example, you can specify the starting address as **10.1.0.0** and specify the address space size as **/16**. Then select **Add** to add that address space.
   * **+ Add subnet**: If you use the default address space, a default subnet is created automatically. If you change the address space, add a new subnet within that address space. Select **+ Add subnet** to open the **Add subnet** window. Configure the following settings, and then select **Add** at the bottom of the page to add the values.

     * **Subnet name**: You can use the default, or specify the name. Example: **FrontEnd**.
     * **Subnet address range**: The address range for this subnet. Examples are **10.1.0.0** and **/24**.

1. Review the **IP addresses** page and remove any address spaces or subnets that you don't need.
1. Select **Review + create** to validate the virtual network settings.
1. After the settings are validated, select **Create** to create the virtual network.
