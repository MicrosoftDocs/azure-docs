Keep these best practices in mind:

- We recommend that you store all passwords in a secure place so you don't have to reset a password if it's forgotten. The management service can't retrieve existing passwords. It can only reset them via the Azure portal. If you reset a password, be sure to notify all users before you reset it.
- You can access the Windows PowerShell interface of your device remotely over HTTP. As a security best practice, you should use HTTP only on trusted networks.
- Ensure that device passwords are strong and well protected. Follow the [password best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-security-identity-management-best-practices#enable-password-management).
