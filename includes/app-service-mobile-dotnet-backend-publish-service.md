    1. In Visual Studio, right-click the project, click **Publish** > **Publish Web** > **Microsoft Azure Web Apps**, and (if needed) sign-in with your Azure credentials. When you sign in, Visual Studio downloads and stores your publish settings directly from Azure.
    
    2. Select your service from **Existing Web Apps** and click **OK**, then verify the publish information and click **Publish**.  When your Mobile App backend has published successfully, you will see a landing page indicating success.
