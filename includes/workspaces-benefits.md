In API Management, workspaces bring a new level of autonomy to an organization's API teams, enabling them to create, manage, and publish APIs faster, more reliably, securely, and productively within an API Management service. By providing isolated administrative access and API runtime, workspaces empower API teams while allowing the API platform team to retain oversight. This includes central monitoring, enforcement of API policies and compliance, and publishing APIs for discovery through a unified developer portal.
