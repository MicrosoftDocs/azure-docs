> [!IMPORTANT]
> Network security group (NSG) flow logs will be retired on September 30, 2027. After June 30, 2025, you'll no longer be able to create new NSG flow logs. We recommend [migrating](../articles/network-watcher/nsg-flow-logs-migrate.md) to [virtual network flow logs](../articles/network-watcher/vnet-flow-logs-overview.md), which address the limitations of NSG flow logs. After the retirement date, traffic analytics enabled for NSG flow logs will no longer be supported, and existing NSG flow log resources in your subscriptions will be deleted. However, existing NSG flow log records won't be deleted from Azure Storage and will continue to follow their configured retention policies. For more information, see the [official announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/v2/Azure-NSG-flow-logs-Retirement).
