> [!IMPORTANT]
> On September 30, 2027, network security group (NSG) flow logs will be retired. As part of this retirement, you'll no longer be able to create new NSG flow logs starting June 30, 2025. We recommend [migrating](../articles/network-watcher/nsg-flow-logs-migrate.md) to [virtual network flow logs](../articles/network-watcher/vnet-flow-logs-overview.md), which overcome the limitations of NSG flow logs. After the retirement date, traffic analytics enabled with NSG flow logs will no longer be supported, and existing NSG flow logs resources in your subscriptions will be deleted. However, NSG flow logs records won't be deleted and will continue to follow their respective retention policies. For more information, see the [official announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/v2/Azure-NSG-flow-logs-Retirement).
