Connect to the VM by using the private IP that you passed during the VM creation.

1. Open an SSH session to connect with the IP address.

    ```powershell
    ssh -l <username> <ip address>
    ```

1. At the prompt, provide the password that you used when you created the VM.

   If you need to provide the SSH key, use this command.

   `ssh -i c:/users/Administrator/.ssh/id_rsa Administrator@5.5.41.236`

   Here's an example output when you connect to the VM:

    ```output
    PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> ssh -l myazuser "10.126.76.60"
    The authenticity of host '10.126.76.60 (10.126.76.60)' can't be established.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:V649Zbo58zAYMKreeP7M6w7Na0Yf9QPg4SM7JZVV0E4.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
