> [!NOTE]
> A web app can time out after 20 minutes of inactivity, and only requests to the actual web app can reset the timer. Viewing the app's configuration in the Azure portal or making requests to the advanced tools site doesn't reset the timer. If you set the web app that hosts your job to run continuously, run on a schedule, or use event-driven triggers, enable the **Always on** setting on your web app's Azure **Configuration** pane. The **Always on** setting helps make sure that these kinds of WebJobs run reliably. This feature is available only in the Basic, Standard, and Premium [pricing tiers](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).
