If needed, install the Azure CLI using the instruction found in the [Azure CLI installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), and then run `az login` to create a connection with Azure.

This sample works in a Bash shell. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows client, see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../virtual-machines/windows/cli-options.md).
