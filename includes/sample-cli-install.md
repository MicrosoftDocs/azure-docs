To run this sample, install the latest version of the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). To start, run `az login` to create a connection with Azure.

Samples for the Azure CLI are written for the `bash` shell. To run this sample in Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt, you may need to change
elements of the script.
