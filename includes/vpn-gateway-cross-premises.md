> [!NOTE]
> When you use a virtual network as part of a cross-premises architecture, be sure to coordinate with your on-premises network administrator to carve out an IP address range that you can use specifically for this virtual network. If a duplicate address range exists on both sides of the VPN connection, traffic will route in an unexpected way. Additionally, if you want to connect this virtual network to another virtual network, the address space can't overlap with the other virtual network. Plan your network configuration accordingly.
