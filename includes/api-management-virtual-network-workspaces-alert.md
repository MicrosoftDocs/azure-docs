> [!NOTE]
> * The network configuration of a workspace gateway is independent of the network configuration of the API Management instance.
> * Currently, a workspace gateway can only be configured in a virtual network when the gateway is [created](../articles/api-management/how-to-create-workspace.md). You can't change the gateway's network configuration or settings later.
