## Copying data and metadata

To transfer the ACLs, timestamps, and attributes for your data, use the following procedures to copy data into the Data Box.

### Windows data copy tool

To copy data to your Data Box via SMB, use an SMB-compatible file copy tool such as `robocopy`. The following sample command copies all files and directories, transferring metadata along with the data.

When using the `/copyall` or `/dcopy:DAT` option, make sure the required Backup Operator privileges aren't disabled. For more information, see [Use the local web UI to administer your Data Box and Data Box Heavy](../articles/databox/data-box-local-web-ui-admin.md).

```console
robocopy <Source> <Target> * /copyall /e /dcopy:DAT /B /r:3 /w:60 /is /nfl /ndl /np /MT:32 or 64 /fft /log+:<LogFile>
```

where

|Option |Description |
|------------------- | ----- |
|`/copyall` |Copies all attributes.|
|`/e`      |Copies subdirectories, including empty directories.         |
|`/dcopy:DAT`  |Copies data, attributes, and timestamps. Note: The /dcopy:DAT option must be used to transfer `CreationTime` on directories. |
|`/B`      |Copies files in Backup mode. |
|`/r:3`    |Specifies 3 retries on failed copies.         |
|`/w:60`   |Specifies a wait time of 60 seconds between retries.         |
|`/is`     |Includes the same files.         |
|`/nfl`    |Does not log file names.         |
|`/ndl`    |Does not log directory names.        |
|`/np`     |Does not display progress of the copying operation.         |
|`/MT:32 or 64`  |Uses multithreading, with 32 or 64 threads.           |
|`/fft`    |Reduces time stamp granularity for any file system.        |
|`/log+:<LogFile>`  |Appends the output to the existing log file.|

For more information on these `robocopy` parameters, see [Tutorial: Copy data to Azure Data Box via SMB](../articles/databox/data-box-deploy-copy-data.md)

> [!NOTE]
> If you use `/copyall` to copy your data, the source ACLs on directories and files are transferred to Azure Files. If you only had read-access on your source data and could not modify the source data, you'll have read-access only on the data in the Data Box. Use `/copyall` only if you intend to copy all the ACLs on the directories and files along with the data.

#### Use robocopy to list, copy, modify files on Data Box

Here are some of the common scenarios you use when copying data using `robocopy`.

- **Copy only data to Data Box, no ACLs on directories and files**

    Use the `/dcopy:DAT` option to only copy data, attributes, timestamps. ACLs on directories and files aren't copied.

- **Copy data and ACLs on directories and files to Data Box**

    Use `/copyall` to copy all the source data including all the ACLs on directories and files.

- **List the filesystem on Data Box using robocopy**

    Use this command to list directory contents:

    `robocopy <source-dir> NULL /l /s /xx /njh /njs /fp /B`

    Note that the File Explorer doesn't allow you to list these files.
    
- **Copy or delete folders and files on Data Box**

    Use this command to copy a single file:

    `robocopy <source-dir> <destination-dir> <file-name> /B`

    Use this command to delete a single file:

    `robocopy <source-dir> <destination-dir> <file-name> /purge /B`

    In the above command, the `<source-dir>` should not have the file: `<file-name>`. Then, the above command syncs the destination with the source, resulting in the removal of the file from the destination.

    Note that the File Explorer may not allow you to perform the above operations.

For more information, see [Using robocopy commands](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy).

### Linux data copy tools

Transferring metadata in Linux is a two-step process. First, you copy the source data using a tool such as `rsync`, which doesn't copy metadata. After you copy the data, you can copy the metadata using a tool such as `smbcacls` or `cifsacl`.

The following sample commands do the first step, copying the data using `rsync`. 

```console
cp -aR /etc /opt/ 
rsync -avP /etc /opt (-a copies a directory)
```
