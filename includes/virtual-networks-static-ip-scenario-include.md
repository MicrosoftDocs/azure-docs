## Scenario

To better illustrate how to configure a static IP address for a VM, this document uses this scenario:

![Virtual network scenario: Front-end and back-end subnets, with a static IP address for the front-end subnet](./media/virtual-networks-static-ip-scenario-include/static-ip-scenario.png)

In this scenario, you create a VM named *DNS01* in the *FrontEnd* subnet, and then set it to use a static IP address of *192.168.1.101*.
