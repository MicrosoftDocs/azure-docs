The following sample is a copy log for an import to both Azure Files and Azure Blob storage.

This copy failed, with no validation errors but with three copy errors. One file share was renamed (`ShareRenamed` error), and two containers were renamed (`ContainerRenamed` error). The error entry gives the original and new file names.
