|Name |Description |Effect(s) |Version |
|---|---|---|---|
|[Allowed storage account SKUs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/masterbuilt-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/AllowedStorageSkus_Deny.json) |This policy enables you to specify a set of storage account SKUs that your organization can deploy. |Deny |1.0.0 |
|[Audit unrestricted network access to storage accounts](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/masterbuilt-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/Storage_NetworkAcls_Audit.json) |Audit unrestricted network access in your storage account firewall settings. Instead, configure network rules so only applications from allowed networks can access the storage account. To allow connections from specific internet or on-premise clients, access can be granted to traffic from specific Azure virtual networks or to public internet IP address ranges |Audit, Disabled |1.0.0 |
|[Deploy Advanced Threat Protection on Storage Accounts](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/masterbuilt-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageAdvancedThreatProtection_Deploy.json) |This policy enables Advanced Threat Protection on Storage Accounts. |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |1.0.0 |
|[Geo-redundant storage should be enabled for Storage Accounts](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/masterbuilt-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/GeoRedundant_StorageAccounts_Audit.json) |This policy audits any Storage Account with geo-redundant storage not enabled. |Audit, Disabled |1.0.0 |
|[Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/masterbuilt-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/Storage_AuditForHTTPSEnabled_Audit.json) |Audit requirment of Secure transfer in your storage account. Secure transfer is an option that forces your storage account to accept requests only from secure connections (HTTPS). Use of HTTPS ensures authentication between the server and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking |Audit, Deny, Disabled |1.0.0 |
|[Storage accounts should allow access from trusted Microsoft services](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/masterbuilt-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageAccess_TrustedMicrosoftServices_Audit.json) |Some Microsoft services that interact with storage accounts operate from networks that can't be granted access through network rules. To help this type of service work as intended, allow the set of trusted Microsoft services to bypass the network rules. These services will then use strong authentication to access the storage account. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |1.0.0 |
|[Storage accounts should be migrated to new Azure Resource Manager resources](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/masterbuilt-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/Classic_AuditForClassicStorages_Audit.json) |Use new Azure Resource Manager for your storage accounts to provide security enhancements such as: stronger access control (RBAC), better auditing, Azure Resource Manager based deployment and governance, access to managed identities, access to key vault for secrets, Azure AD-based authentication and support for tags and resource groups for easier security management |Audit, Deny, Disabled |1.0.0 |
