FTP and local Git can deploy to an Azure web app by using a *deployment user*. Once you configure your deployment user, you can use it for all your Azure deployments. Your account-level deployment username and password are different from your Azure subscription credentials. 

To configure the deployment user, run the [az webapp deployment user set](/cli/azure/webapp/deployment/user#az-webapp-deployment-user-set) command in Azure Cloud Shell. Replace \<username> and \<password> with a deployment user username and password. 

- The username must be unique within Azure, and for local Git pushes, must not contain the ‘\@’ symbol. 
- The password must be at least eight characters long, with two of the following three elements: letters, numbers, and symbols. 

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp deployment user set --user-name <username> --password <password>
```

The JSON output shows the password as `null`. If you get a `'Conflict'. Details: 409` error, change the username. If you get a `'Bad Request'. Details: 400` error, use a stronger password. 

Record your username and password to use to deploy your web apps.
