|---|---|---|---|
|[\[Preview\] Vulnerability Assessment should be enabled on Virtual Machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F501541f7-f7e7-4cd6-868c-4190fdad3ac9) |Monitors vulnerabilities detected by Azure Security Center Vulnerability Assessment on Virtual Machines |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_ServerVulnerabilityAssessment_Audit.json) |
|[Access through Internet facing endpoint should be restricted](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F9daedab3-fb2d-461e-b861-71790eead4f6) |Azure Security center has identified some of your Network Security Groups' inbound rules to be too permissive. Inbound rules should not allow access from 'Any' or 'Internet' ranges. This can potentially enable attackers to easily target your resources. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_UnprotectedEndpoints_Audit.json) |
|[Adaptive application controls for whitelisting safe applications should be enabled on your machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F47a6b606-51aa-4496-8bb7-64b11cf66adc) |Enable application controls to define the list of known-safe applications running on your machines, and alert you when other applications run. This helps harden your machines against malware. To simplify the process of configuring and maintaining your rules, Security Center uses machine learning to analyze the applications running on each machine and suggest the list of known-safe applications. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_AppWhitelistMonitoring_Audit.json) |
|[Audit virtual machines without disaster recovery configured](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F0015ea4d-51ff-4ce3-8d8c-f3f8f0179a56) |Audit virtual machines which do not have disaster recovery configured. To learn more about disaster recovery, visit [https://aka.ms/asr-doc](https://aka.ms/asr-doc). |auditIfNotExists |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Compute/RecoveryServices_DisasterRecovery_Audit.json) |

IP forwarding is rarely required (e.g., when using the VM as a network virtual appliance), and therefore, this should be reviewed by the network security team. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_IPForwardingOnVirtualMachines_Audit.json) |
|[Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F22730e10-96f6-4aac-ad84-9383d35b5917) |Open remote management ports are exposing your VM to a high level of risk from Internet-based attacks. These attacks attempt to brute force credentials to gain admin access to the machine. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_OpenManagementPortsOnVirtualMachines_Audit.json) |
