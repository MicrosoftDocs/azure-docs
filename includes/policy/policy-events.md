## Available event types

Azure Policy emits the following event types:

| Event type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.PolicyInsights.PolicyStateCreated | Raised when a policy compliance state is created. |
| Microsoft.PolicyInsights.PolicyStateChanged | Raised when a policy compliance state is changed. |
| Microsoft.PolicyInsights.PolicyStateDeleted | Raised when a policy compliance state is deleted. |

## Event schema

Azure Policy events contain all the information you need to respond to changes in your data. You can
identify an Azure Policy event when the `eventType` property starts with "Microsoft.PolicyInsights".
Additional information about the usage of Event Grid event properties is documented in
[Event Grid event schema](../../../event-grid/event-schema.md).

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `id` | string | Unique identifier for the event. |
| `topic` | string | Full resource path to the event source. This field isn't writeable. Event Grid provides this value. |
| `subject` | string | The fully qualified ID of the resource that the compliance state change is for, including the resource name and resource type. Uses the format, `/subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<ResourceGroup>/providers/<ProviderNamespace>/<ResourceType>/<ResourceName>` |
| `data` | object | Azure Policy event data. |
| `data.timestamp` | string | The time (in UTC) that the resource was scanned by Azure Policy. For ordering events, use this property instead of the top level `eventTime` or `time` properties. |
| `data.policyAssignmentId` | string | The resource ID of the policy assignment. |
| `data.policyDefinitionId` | string | The resource ID of the policy definition. |
| `data.policyDefinitionReferenceId` | string | The reference ID for the policy definition inside the initiative definition, if the policy assignment is for an initiative. May be empty. |
| `data.complianceState` | string | The compliance state of the resource with respect to the policy assignment. |
| `data.subscriptionId` | string | The subscription ID of the resource. |
| `data.complianceReasonCode` | string | The compliance reason code. May be empty. |
| `eventType` | string | One of the registered event types for this event source. |
| `eventTime` | string | The time the event is generated based on the provider's UTC time. |
| `dataVersion` | string | The schema version of the data object. The publisher defines the schema version. |
| `metadataVersion` | string | The schema version of the event metadata. Event Grid defines the schema of the top-level properties. Event Grid provides this value. |

Here's an example of a policy state change event:

```json

    "id": "5829794FCB5075FCF585476619577B5A5A30E52C84842CBD4E2AD73996714C4C",
