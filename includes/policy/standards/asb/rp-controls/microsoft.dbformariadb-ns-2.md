|[Private endpoint should be enabled for MariaDB servers](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F0a1302fb-a631-4106-9753-f3d494733990) |Private endpoint connections enforce secure communication by enabling private connectivity to Azure Database for MariaDB. Configure a private endpoint connection to enable access to traffic coming only from known networks and prevent access from all other IP addresses, including within Azure. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/SQL/MariaDB_EnablePrivateEndPoint_Audit.json) |
|[Public network access should be disabled for MariaDB servers](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ffdccbe47-f3e3-4213-ad5d-ea459b2fa077) |Disable the public network access property to improve security and ensure your Azure Database for MariaDB can only be accessed from a private endpoint. This configuration strictly disables access from any public address space outside of Azure IP range, and denies all logins that match IP or virtual network-based firewall rules. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/SQL/MariaDB_DisablePublicNetworkAccess_Audit.json) |
