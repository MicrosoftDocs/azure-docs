|[\[Preview\]: Linux virtual machines should enable Azure Disk Encryption or EncryptionAtHost.](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fca88aadc-6e2b-416c-9de2-5a0f01d1693f) |By default, a virtual machine's OS and data disks are encrypted-at-rest using platform-managed keys; temp disks and data caches aren't encrypted, and data isn't encrypted when flowing between compute and storage resources.

|[Virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets should have encryption at host enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ffc4d8e41-e223-45ea-9bf5-eada37891d87) |Use encryption at host to get end-to-end encryption for your virtual machine and virtual machine scale set data. Encryption at host enables encryption at rest for your temporary disk and OS/data disk caches. Temporary and ephemeral OS disks are encrypted with platform-managed keys when encryption at host is enabled. OS/data disk caches are encrypted at rest with either customer-managed or platform-managed key, depending on the encryption type selected on the disk.

|[Virtual machines should encrypt temp disks, caches, and data flows between Compute and Storage resources](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F0961003e-5a0a-4549-abde-af6a37f2724d) |By default, a virtual machine's OS and data disks are encrypted-at-rest using platform-managed keys. Temp disks, data caches and data flowing between compute and storage aren't encrypted. Disregard this recommendation if: 1. using encryption-at-host, or 2. server-side encryption on Managed Disks meets your security requirements.
