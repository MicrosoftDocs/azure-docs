|[Azure Databricks Workspaces should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F0e7849de-b939-4c50-ab48-fc6b0f5eeba2) |Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that the resource isn't exposed on the public internet. You can control exposure of your resources by creating private endpoints instead.

|[Azure Databricks Workspaces should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F258823f2-4595-4b52-b333-cc96192710d8) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual networks to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Azure Databricks workspaces, you can reduce data leakage risks.
