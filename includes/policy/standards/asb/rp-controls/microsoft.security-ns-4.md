|[Adaptive network hardening recommendations should be applied on internet facing virtual machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F08e6af2d-db70-460a-bfe9-d5bd474ba9d6) |Azure Security Center analyzes the traffic patterns of Internet facing virtual machines and provides Network Security Group rule recommendations that reduce the potential attack surface |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_AdaptiveNetworkHardenings_Audit.json) |
|[All network ports should be restricted on network security groups associated to your virtual machine](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F9daedab3-fb2d-461e-b861-71790eead4f6) |Azure Security Center has identified some of your network security groups' inbound rules to be too permissive. Inbound rules should not allow access from 'Any' or 'Internet' ranges. This can potentially enable attackers to target your resources. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_UnprotectedEndpoints_Audit.json) |
|[Azure DDoS Protection Standard should be enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fa7aca53f-2ed4-4466-a25e-0b45ade68efd) |DDoS protection standard should be enabled for all virtual networks with a subnet that is part of an application gateway with a public IP. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_EnableDDoSProtection_Audit.json) |
|[Internet-facing virtual machines should be protected with network security groups](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ff6de0be7-9a8a-4b8a-b349-43cf02d22f7c) |Protect your virtual machines from potential threats by restricting access to them with network security groups (NSG). Learn more about controlling traffic with NSGs at [https://aka.ms/nsg-doc](https://aka.ms/nsg-doc) |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_NetworkSecurityGroupsOnInternetFacingVirtualMachines_Audit.json) |
|[IP Forwarding on your virtual machine should be disabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fbd352bd5-2853-4985-bf0d-73806b4a5744) |Enabling IP forwarding on a virtual machine's NIC allows the machine to receive traffic addressed to other destinations. IP forwarding is rarely required (e.g., when using the VM as a network virtual appliance), and therefore, this should be reviewed by the network security team. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_IPForwardingOnVirtualMachines_Audit.json) |
|[Management ports of virtual machines should be protected with just-in-time network access control](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fb0f33259-77d7-4c9e-aac6-3aabcfae693c) |Possible network Just In Time (JIT) access will be monitored by Azure Security Center as recommendations |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_JITNetworkAccess_Audit.json) |
|[Subnets should be associated with a Network Security Group](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fe71308d3-144b-4262-b144-efdc3cc90517) |Protect your subnet from potential threats by restricting access to it with a Network Security Group (NSG). NSGs contain a list of Access Control List (ACL) rules that allow or deny network traffic to your subnet. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_NetworkSecurityGroupsOnSubnets_Audit.json) |
