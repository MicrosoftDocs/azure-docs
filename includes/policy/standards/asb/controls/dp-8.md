|[Azure Key Vault should have firewall enabled or public network access disabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F55615ac9-af46-4a59-874e-391cc3dfb490) |Enable the key vault firewall so that the key vault is not accessible by default to any public IPs or disable public network access for your key vault so that it's not accessible over the public internet. Optionally, you can configure specific IP ranges to limit access to those networks. Learn more at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/network-security](/azure/key-vault/general/network-security) and [https://aka.ms/akvprivatelink](https://aka.ms/akvprivatelink) |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[3.3.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Key%20Vault/FirewallEnabled_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Key Vaults should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fa6abeaec-4d90-4a02-805f-6b26c4d3fbe9) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual networks to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to key vault, you can reduce data leakage risks. Learn more about private links at: [https://aka.ms/akvprivatelink](https://aka.ms/akvprivatelink). |[parameters('audit_effect')] |[1.2.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Key%20Vault/Should_Use_PrivateEndpoint_Audit.json) |
|[Key vaults should have deletion protection enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F0b60c0b2-2dc2-4e1c-b5c9-abbed971de53) |Malicious deletion of a key vault can lead to permanent data loss. You can prevent permanent data loss by enabling purge protection and soft delete. Purge protection protects you from insider attacks by enforcing a mandatory retention period for soft deleted key vaults. No one inside your organization or Microsoft will be able to purge your key vaults during the soft delete retention period. Keep in mind that key vaults created after September 1st 2019 have soft-delete enabled by default. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[2.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Key%20Vault/Recoverable_Audit.json) |

Accidental deletion of a key vault can lead to permanent data loss. Soft delete allows you to recover an accidentally deleted key vault for a configurable retention period. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Key%20Vault/SoftDeleteMustBeEnabled_Audit.json) |

This enables you to recreate activity trails to use for investigation purposes when a security incident occurs or when your network is compromised |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[5.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Key%20Vault/AuditDiagnosticLog_Audit.json) |
