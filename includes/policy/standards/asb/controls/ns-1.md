|[Adaptive network hardening recommendations should be applied on internet facing virtual machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F08e6af2d-db70-460a-bfe9-d5bd474ba9d6) |Azure Security Center analyzes the traffic patterns of Internet facing virtual machines and provides Network Security Group rule recommendations that reduce the potential attack surface |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_AdaptiveNetworkHardenings_Audit.json) |
|[All Internet traffic should be routed via your deployed Azure Firewall](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ffc5e4038-4584-4632-8c85-c0448d374b2c) |Azure Security Center has identified that some of your subnets aren't protected with a next generation firewall. Protect your subnets from potential threats by restricting access to them with Azure Firewall or a supported next generation firewall |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/ASC_All_Internet_traffic_should_be_routed_via_Azure_Firewall.json) |
|[All network ports should be restricted on network security groups associated to your virtual machine](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F9daedab3-fb2d-461e-b861-71790eead4f6) |Azure Security Center has identified some of your network security groups' inbound rules to be too permissive. Inbound rules should not allow access from 'Any' or 'Internet' ranges. This can potentially enable attackers to target your resources. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_UnprotectedEndpoints_Audit.json) |
|[API Management services should use a virtual network](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fef619a2c-cc4d-4d03-b2ba-8c94a834d85b) |Azure Virtual Network deployment provides enhanced security, isolation and allows you to place your API Management service in a non-internet routable network that you control access to. These networks can then be connected to your on-premises networks using various VPN technologies, which enables access to your backend services within the network and/or on-premises. The developer portal and API gateway, can be configured to be accessible either from the Internet or only within the virtual network. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/API%20Management/ApiManagement_VNETEnabled_Audit.json) |

Accounts that have at least one IP rule defined with the virtual network filter enabled are deemed compliant. Accounts disabling public access are also deemed compliant. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cosmos%20DB/Cosmos_NetworkRulesExist_Audit.json) |

This can reduce data leakage risks. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/akvprivatelink](https://aka.ms/akvprivatelink). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.1.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Key%20Vault/AzureKeyVaultFirewallEnabled_Audit.json) |

Creating private endpoints can limit exposure of Cognitive Services account. Learn more at: [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800).  |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/CognitiveServices_DisablePublicNetworkAccess_Audit.json) |
|[Cognitive Services accounts should restrict network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F037eea7a-bd0a-46c5-9a66-03aea78705d3) |Network access to Cognitive Services accounts should be restricted. Configure network rules so only applications from allowed networks can access the Cognitive Services account. To allow connections from specific internet or on-premises clients, access can be granted to traffic from specific Azure virtual networks or to public internet IP address ranges. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/CognitiveServices_NetworkAcls_Audit.json) |

To protect your registries from potential threats, allow access from only specific public IP addresses or address ranges. If your registry doesn't have an IP/firewall rule or a configured virtual network, it will appear in the unhealthy resources. Learn more about Container Registry network rules here: [https://aka.ms/acr/portal/public-network](https://aka.ms/acr/portal/public-network) and here [https://aka.ms/acr/vnet](https://aka.ms/acr/vnet). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_NetworkRulesExist_AuditDeny.json) |

IP forwarding is rarely required (e.g., when using the VM as a network virtual appliance), and therefore, this should be reviewed by the network security team. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_IPForwardingOnVirtualMachines_Audit.json) |
|[Management ports of virtual machines should be protected with just-in-time network access control](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fb0f33259-77d7-4c9e-aac6-3aabcfae693c) |Possible network Just In Time (JIT) access will be monitored by Azure Security Center as recommendations |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_JITNetworkAccess_Audit.json) |

These attacks attempt to brute force credentials to gain admin access to the machine. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_OpenManagementPortsOnVirtualMachines_Audit.json) |
