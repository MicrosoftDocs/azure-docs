|[Adaptive network hardening recommendations should be applied on internet facing virtual machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F08e6af2d-db70-460a-bfe9-d5bd474ba9d6) |Azure Security Center analyzes the traffic patterns of Internet facing virtual machines and provides Network Security Group rule recommendations that reduce the potential attack surface |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_AdaptiveNetworkHardenings_Audit.json) |
|[All Internet traffic should be routed via your deployed Azure Firewall](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ffc5e4038-4584-4632-8c85-c0448d374b2c) |Azure Security Center has identified that some of your subnets aren't protected with a next generation firewall. Protect your subnets from potential threats by restricting access to them with Azure Firewall or a supported next generation firewall |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/ASC_All_Internet_traffic_should_be_routed_via_Azure_Firewall.json) |
|[All network ports should be restricted on network security groups associated to your virtual machine](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F9daedab3-fb2d-461e-b861-71790eead4f6) |Azure Security Center has identified some of your network security groups' inbound rules to be too permissive. Inbound rules should not allow access from 'Any' or 'Internet' ranges. This can potentially enable attackers to target your resources. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_UnprotectedEndpoints_Audit.json) |

It is recommended to limit access to authorized IP ranges to ensure that only applications from allowed networks can access the cluster. |Audit, Disabled |[2.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_EnableIpRanges_KubernetesService_Audit.json) |

Accounts that have at least one IP rule defined with the virtual network filter enabled are deemed compliant. Accounts disabling public access are also deemed compliant. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cosmos%20DB/Cosmos_NetworkRulesExist_Audit.json) |

This can reduce data leakage risks. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/akvprivatelink](https://aka.ms/akvprivatelink). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.1.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Key%20Vault/AzureKeyVaultFirewallEnabled_Audit.json) |

Learn more about controlling traffic with NSGs at [https://aka.ms/nsg-doc](https://aka.ms/nsg-doc) |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_NetworkSecurityGroupsOnInternetFacingVirtualMachines_Audit.json) |

IP forwarding is rarely required (e.g., when using the VM as a network virtual appliance), and therefore, this should be reviewed by the network security team. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_IPForwardingOnVirtualMachines_Audit.json) |

Configure network rules so only applications from allowed networks can access the storage account. To allow connections from specific internet or on-premises clients, access can be granted to traffic from specific Azure virtual networks or to public internet IP address ranges |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.1.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/Storage_NetworkAcls_Audit.json) |
