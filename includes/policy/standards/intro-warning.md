The title of each built-in policy definition links to the policy definition in the Azure portal. Use the link in the **Policy Version** column to view the source on the
[Azure Policy GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each control is associated with one or more [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) definitions. These policies might help you [assess compliance](/azure/governance/policy/how-to/get-compliance-data) with the control.
> However, there often isn't a one-to-one or complete match between a control and one or more policies. As such, **Compliant** in Azure Policy refers only to the policies themselves. This doesn't ensure that you're fully compliant with all requirements of a control. In addition, the compliance standard includes controls that aren't addressed by any Azure Policy definitions at this time.
> Therefore, compliance in Azure Policy is only a partial view of your overall compliance status. The associations between controls and Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance definitions for these compliance standards can change over time.
