|[Azure HDInsight clusters should be injected into a virtual network](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fb0ab5b05-1c98-40f7-bb9e-dc568e41b501) |Injecting Azure HDInsight clusters in a virtual network unlocks advanced HDInsight networking and security features and provides you with control over your network security configuration. |Audit, Disabled, Deny |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/HDInsight/HDInsight_VNETInjection_Audit.json) |
|[Azure HDInsight clusters should use customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F64d314f6-6062-4780-a861-c23e8951bee5) |Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of your Azure HDInsight clusters. By default, customer data is encrypted with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. Learn more at [https://aka.ms/hdi.cmk](https://aka.ms/hdi.cmk). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/HDInsight/HDInsight_CMK_Audit.json) |
|[Azure HDInsight clusters should use encryption at host to encrypt data at rest](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F1fd32ebd-e4c3-4e13-a54a-d7422d4d95f6) |Enabling encryption at host helps protect and safeguard your data to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. When you enable encryption at host, data stored on the VM host is encrypted at rest and flows encrypted to the Storage service. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/HDInsight/HDInsight_EncryptionAtHost_Audit.json) |
|[Azure HDInsight clusters should use encryption in transit to encrypt communication between Azure HDInsight cluster nodes](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fd9da03a1-f3c3-412a-9709-947156872263) |Data can be tampered with during transmission between Azure HDInsight cluster nodes. Enabling encryption in transit addresses problems of misuse and tampering during this transmission. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/HDInsight/HDInsight_EncryptionInTransit_Audit.json) |
|[Azure HDInsight should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fc8cc2f85-e019-4065-9fa3-5e6a2b2dde56) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual networks to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Azure HDInsight clusters, you can reduce data leakage risks. Learn more about private links at: [https://aka.ms/hdi.pl](https://aka.ms/hdi.pl). |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/HDInsight/HDInsight_PrivateEndpoint_AuditIfNotExist.json) |
|[Configure Azure HDInsight clusters to use private DNS zones](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F43d6e3bd-fc6a-4b44-8b4d-2151d8736a11) |Use private DNS zones to override the DNS resolution for a private endpoint. A private DNS zone links to your virtual network to resolve to Azure HDInsight clusters. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/hdi.pl](https://aka.ms/hdi.pl). |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/HDInsight/HDInsight_PrivateDNSZone_DeployIfNotExists.json) |
