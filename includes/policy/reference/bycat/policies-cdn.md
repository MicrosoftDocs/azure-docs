|[Azure Front Door profiles should use Premium tier that supports managed WAF rules and private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fdfc212af-17ea-423a-9dcb-91e2cb2caa6b) |Azure Front Door Premium supports Azure managed WAF rules and private link to supported Azure origins. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/CDN/AFD_Premium_Sku_Audit.json) |

Using versions of TLS less than 1.2 is not recommended since they are weak and do not support modern cryptographic algorithms. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/CDN/AFD_Standard_Premium_MinimumTls_Audit.json) |
