|[\[Preview\]: API endpoints in Azure API Management should be authenticated](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F8ac833bd-f505-48d5-887e-c993a1d3eea0) |API endpoints published within Azure API Management should enforce authentication to help minimize security risk. Authentication mechanisms are sometimes implemented incorrectly or are missing. This allows attackers to exploit implementation flaws and to access data. Learn More about the OWASP API Threat for Broken User Authentication here: [https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/mitigate-owasp-api-threats#broken-user-authentication](../../../../articles/api-management/mitigate-owasp-api-threats.md#broken-user-authentication) |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_APIMApiEndpointsShouldbeAuthenticated_AuditIfNotExists.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: API endpoints that are unused should be disabled and removed from the Azure API Management service](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fc8acafaf-3d23-44d1-9624-978ef0f8652c) |As a security best practice, API endpoints that haven't received traffic for 30 days are considered unused and should be removed from the Azure API Management service. Keeping unused API endpoints may pose a security risk to your organization. These may be APIs that should have been deprecated from the Azure API Management service but may have been accidentally left active. Such APIs typically do not receive the most up to date security coverage. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_APIMUnusedApiEndpointsShouldbeRemoved_AuditIfNotExists.json) |
