|[All authorization rules except RootManageSharedAccessKey should be removed from Service Bus namespace](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fa1817ec0-a368-432a-8057-8371e17ac6ee) |Service Bus clients should not use a namespace level access policy that provides access to all queues and topics in a namespace. To align with the least privilege security model, you should create access policies at the entity level for queues and topics to provide access to only the specific entity |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Service%20Bus/ServiceBus_AuditNamespaceAccessRules_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Service Bus namespaces should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F1c06e275-d63d-4540-b761-71f364c2111d) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Service Bus namespaces, data leakage risks are reduced. Learn more at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/private-link-service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/private-link-service). |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Service%20Bus/ServiceBus_PrivateEndpoint_Audit.json) |
|[Configure Service Bus namespaces to use private DNS zones](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ff0fcf93c-c063-4071-9668-c47474bd3564) |Use private DNS zones to override the DNS resolution for a private endpoint. A private DNS zone links to your virtual network to resolve to Service Bus namespaces.

|[Configure Service Bus namespaces with private endpoints](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F7d890f7f-100c-473d-baa1-2777e2266535) |Private endpoints connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination.

|[Resource logs in Service Bus should be enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ff8d36e2f-389b-4ee4-898d-21aeb69a0f45) |Audit enabling of resource logs. This enables you to recreate activity trails to use for investigation purposes; when a security incident occurs or when your network is compromised |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[4.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Service%20Bus/ServiceBus_AuditDiagnosticLog_Audit.json) |
|[Service Bus Premium namespaces should use a customer-managed key for encryption](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F295fc8b1-dc9f-4f53-9c61-3f313ceab40a) |Azure Service Bus supports the option of encrypting data at rest with either Microsoft-managed keys (default) or customer-managed keys. Choosing to encrypt data using customer-managed keys enables you to assign, rotate, disable, and revoke access to the keys that Service Bus will use to encrypt data in your namespace. Note that Service Bus only supports encryption with customer-managed keys for premium namespaces. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Service%20Bus/ServiceBus_CustomerManagedKeyEnabled_Audit.json) |
