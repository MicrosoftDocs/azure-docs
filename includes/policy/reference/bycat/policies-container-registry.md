|[Configure container registries to disable anonymous authentication.](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fcced2946-b08a-44fe-9fd9-e4ed8a779897) |Disable anonymous pull for your registry so that data not accessible by unauthenticated user. Disabling local authentication methods like admin user, repository scoped access tokens and anonymous pull improves security by ensuring that container registries exclusively require Azure Active Directory identities for authentication. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/acr/authentication](https://aka.ms/acr/authentication). |Modify, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_AnonymousPullDisabled_Modify.json) |

Only Azure Container Registry (ACR) audience tokens will be used for authentication. This will ensure only tokens meant for usage on the registry can be used for authentication. Disabling ARM audience tokens does not affect admin user's or scoped access tokens' authentication.

This can reduce data leakage risks. Learn more at [https://aka.ms/acr/portal/public-network](https://aka.ms/acr/portal/public-network) and [https://aka.ms/acr/private-link](https://aka.ms/acr/private-link). |Modify, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_PublicNetworkAccess_Modify.json) |

Disabling local authentication methods like admin user, repository scoped access tokens and anonymous pull improves security by ensuring that container registries exclusively require Azure Active Directory identities for authentication. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/acr/authentication](https://aka.ms/acr/authentication). |Modify, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_TokenDisabled_Modify.json) |
|[Configure Container registries to use private DNS zones](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fe9585a95-5b8c-4d03-b193-dc7eb5ac4c32) |Use private DNS zones to override the DNS resolution for a private endpoint. A private DNS zone links to your virtual network to resolve to your Container Registry. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/privatednszone](https://aka.ms/privatednszone) and [https://aka.ms/acr/private-link](https://aka.ms/acr/private-link). |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_PrivateDNSZone_DeployIfNotExists.json) |

By mapping private endpoints to your premium container registry resources, you can reduce data leakage risks. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/privateendpoints](https://aka.ms/privateendpoints) and [https://aka.ms/acr/private-link](https://aka.ms/acr/private-link). |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_PrivateEndpoint_DeployIfNotExists.json) |

By default, the data is encrypted at rest with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management.

Data cannot be moved out of the registry via 'acr import' or via 'acr transfer'. In order to disable exports, public network access must be disabled. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/acr/export-policy](https://aka.ms/acr/export-policy). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_ExportPolicy_AuditDeny.json) |

|[Container registries should have SKUs that support Private Links](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fbd560fc0-3c69-498a-ae9f-aa8eb7de0e13) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your container registries instead of the entire service, data leakage risks are reduced. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/acr/private-link](https://aka.ms/acr/private-link). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_SkuSupportsPrivateEndpoints_AuditDeny.json) |
|[Container registries should not allow unrestricted network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fd0793b48-0edc-4296-a390-4c75d1bdfd71) |Azure container registries by default accept connections over the internet from hosts on any network. To protect your registries from potential threats, allow access from only specific private endpoints, public IP addresses or address ranges. If your registry doesn't have network rules configured, it will appear in the unhealthy resources.
