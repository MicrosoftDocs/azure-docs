|[Container registries should be encrypted with a customer-managed key (CMK)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F5b9159ae-1701-4a6f-9a7a-aa9c8ddd0580) |Audit container registries that do not have encryption enabled with customer-managed keys (CMK). Azure automatically encrypts registry contents at rest with service-managed keys. You can supplement default encryption with an additional encryption layer using a key that you create and manage in Azure Key Vault. For more information on CMK encryption, please visit: [https://aka.ms/acr/CMK](https://aka.ms/acr/CMK). |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_CMKEncryptionEnabled_Audit.json) |
|[Container registries should not allow unrestricted network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fd0793b48-0edc-4296-a390-4c75d1bdfd71) |Audit container registries that do not have any network or firewall (IP) rules configured and so allow all network access by default. Restricting network access protects container registries from potential threats. Container registries with at least one IP / firewall rule or configured virtual network are deemed compliant. For more information on Container Registry network rules, visit: [https://aka.ms/acr/portal/public-network](https://aka.ms/acr/portal/public-network) and [https://aka.ms/acr/vnet](https://aka.ms/acr/vnet). |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_NetworkRulesExist_Audit.json) |
|[Container registries should use private links](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fe8eef0a8-67cf-4eb4-9386-14b0e78733d4) |Audit container registries that do not have at least one approved private endpoint connection. Clients in a virtual network can securely access resources that have private endpoint connections through private links. Public access can then be disabled to ensure that only private links can be used to connect to the registry. For more information, visit: [https://aka.ms/acr/private-link](https://aka.ms/acr/private-link). |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_PrivateEndpointEnabled_Audit.json) |
