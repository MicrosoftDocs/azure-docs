|[Configure container registries to disable local authentication.](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F79fdfe03-ffcb-4e55-b4d0-b925b8241759) |Disable local authentication so that your container registries exclusively require Azure Active Directory identities for authentication. Learn more about at: [https://aka.ms/acr/authentication](../../../../articles/container-registry/container-registry-authentication.md). |Modify, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_AdminAccountDisabled_Modify.json) |
|[Configure Container registries to disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fa3701552-92ea-433e-9d17-33b7f1208fc9) |Disable public network access for your Container Registry resource so that it's not accessible over the public internet. This can reduce data leakage risks. Learn more at [https://aka.ms/acr/portal/public-network](../../../../articles/container-registry/container-registry-access-selected-networks.md) and [https://aka.ms/acr/private-link](../../../../articles/container-registry/container-registry-private-link.md). |Modify, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_PublicNetworkAccess_Modify.json) |
|[Configure Container registries to use private DNS zones](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fe9585a95-5b8c-4d03-b193-dc7eb5ac4c32) |Use private DNS zones to override the DNS resolution for a private endpoint. A private DNS zone links to your virtual network to resolve to your Container Registry. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/privatednszone](../../../../articles/private-link/private-endpoint-dns.md) and [https://aka.ms/acr/private-link](../../../../articles/container-registry/container-registry-private-link.md). |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_PrivateDNSZone_DeployIfNotExists.json) |
|[Configure Container registries with private endpoints](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fd85c6833-7d33-4cf5-a915-aaa2de84405f) |Private endpoints connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. By mapping private endpoints to your premium container registry resources, you can reduce data leakage risks. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/privateendpoints](../../../../articles/event-grid/configure-private-endpoints.md) and [https://aka.ms/acr/private-link](../../../../articles/container-registry/container-registry-private-link.md). |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_PrivateEndpoint_DeployIfNotExists.json) |
|[Container registries should be encrypted with a customer-managed key](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F5b9159ae-1701-4a6f-9a7a-aa9c8ddd0580) |Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of the contents of your registries. By default, the data is encrypted at rest with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. Learn more at [https://aka.ms/acr/CMK](../../../../articles/container-registry/container-registry-customer-managed-keys.md). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.1.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_CMKEncryptionEnabled_Audit.json) |
|[Container registries should have local authentication methods disabled.](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fdc921057-6b28-4fbe-9b83-f7bec05db6c2) |Disabling local authentication methods improves security by ensuring that container registries exclusively require Azure Active Directory identities for authentication.

|[Container registries should have SKUs that support Private Links](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fbd560fc0-3c69-498a-ae9f-aa8eb7de0e13) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your container registries instead of the entire service, data leakage risks are reduced. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/acr/private-link](../../../../articles/container-registry/container-registry-private-link.md). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_SkuSupportsPrivateEndpoints_AuditDeny.json) |
|[Container registries should not allow unrestricted network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fd0793b48-0edc-4296-a390-4c75d1bdfd71) |Azure container registries by default accept connections over the internet from hosts on any network. To protect your registries from potential threats, allow access from only specific public IP addresses or address ranges. If your registry doesn't have an IP/firewall rule or a configured virtual network, it will appear in the unhealthy resources. Learn more about Container Registry network rules here: [https://aka.ms/acr/portal/public-network](../../../../articles/container-registry/container-registry-access-selected-networks.md) and here [https://aka.ms/acr/vnet](../../../../articles/container-registry/container-registry-vnet.md). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_NetworkRulesExist_AuditDeny.json) |

Creating private endpoints can limit exposure of container registry resources.
