|[Bot Service endpoint should be a valid HTTPS URI](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F6164527b-e1ee-4882-8673-572f425f5e0a) |Data can be tampered with during transmission. Protocols exist that provide encryption to address problems of misuse and tampering. To ensure your bots are communicating only over encrypted channels, set the endpoint to a valid HTTPS URI. This ensures the HTTPS protocol is used to encrypt your data in transit and is also often a requirement for compliance with regulatory or industry standards. Please visit: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-security-guidelines](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-security-guidelines). |audit, Audit, deny, Deny, disabled, Disabled |[1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Bot%20Service/BotService_ValidEndpoint_Audit.json) |
|[Bot Service should be encrypted with a customer-managed key](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F51522a96-0869-4791-82f3-981000c2c67f) |Azure Bot Service automatically encrypts your resource to protect your data and meet organizational security and compliance commitments. By default, Microsoft-managed encryption keys are used. For greater flexibility in managing keys or controlling access to your subscription, select customer-managed keys, also known as bring your own key (BYOK).

|[BotService resources should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fad5621d6-a877-4407-aa93-a950b428315e) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your BotService resource, data leakage risks are reduced. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Bot%20Service/BotService_PrivateEndpoint_Audit.json) |
|[Configure BotService resources to use private DNS zones](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F6a4e6f44-f2af-4082-9702-033c9e88b9f8) |Use private DNS zones to override the DNS resolution for a private endpoint. A private DNS zone links to your virtual network to resolve to BotService related resources.
