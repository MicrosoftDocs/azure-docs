|[Azure AI Search service should use a SKU that supports private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fa049bf77-880b-470f-ba6d-9f21c530cf83) |With supported SKUs of Azure AI Search, Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your Search service, data leakage risks are reduced.

|[Azure AI Search services should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fee980b6d-0eca-4501-8d54-f6290fd512c3) |Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that your Azure AI Search service is not exposed on the public internet. Creating private endpoints can limit exposure of your Search service.

|[Azure AI Search services should have local authentication methods disabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F6300012e-e9a4-4649-b41f-a85f5c43be91) |Disabling local authentication methods improves security by ensuring that Azure AI Search services exclusively require Azure Active Directory identities for authentication. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/azure-cognitive-search/rbac](https://aka.ms/azure-cognitive-search/rbac). Note that while the disable local authentication parameter is still in preview, the deny effect for this policy may result in limited Azure AI Search portal functionality since some features of the Portal use the GA API which does not support the parameter. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Search/DisableLocalAuth_AuditDeny.json) |
