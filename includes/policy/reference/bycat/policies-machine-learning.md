|[Audit Azure Machine Learning Compute Cluster and Instance is behind virtual network](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F7804b5c7-01dc-4723-969b-ae300cc07ff1) |Azure Virtual Network deployment provides enhanced security and isolation for your Azure Machine Learning Compute Clusters and Instances, as well as subnets, access control policies, and other features to further restrict access. When an Azure Machine Learning Compute instance is configured with a virtual network, it is not publicly addressable and can only be accessed from virtual machines and applications within the virtual network. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Machine%20Learning/MachineLearningServices_Vnet_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Machine Learning Compute Instance should have idle shutdown.](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F679ddf89-ab8f-48a5-9029-e76054077449) |Having an idle shutdown schedule reduces cost by shutting down computes that are idle after a pre-determined period of activity. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Machine%20Learning/MachineLearningServices_IdleShutdown_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Machine Learning workspaces should be encrypted with a customer-managed key](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fba769a63-b8cc-4b2d-abf6-ac33c7204be8) |Manage encryption at rest of Azure Machine Learning workspace data with customer-managed keys. By default, customer data is encrypted with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. Learn more at [https://aka.ms/azureml-workspaces-cmk](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-workspace-template#deploy-an-encrypted-workspace"). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.3](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Machine%20Learning/Workspace_CMKEnabled_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Machine Learning workspaces should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F438c38d2-3772-465a-a9cc-7a6666a275ce) |Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that the machine learning workspaces aren't exposed on the public internet. You can limit exposure of your workspaces by creating private endpoints instead. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/privateendpoints](../../../../articles/event-grid/configure-private-endpoints.md). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Machine%20Learning/Workspace_PublicNetworkAccessDisabled_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Machine Learning workspaces should enable V1LegacyMode to support network isolation backward compatibility](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fe413671a-dd10-4cc1-a943-45b598596cb7) |Azure ML is making a transition to a new V2 API platform on Azure Resource Manager and you can control API platform version using V1LegacyMode parameter. Enabling the V1LegacyMode parameter will enable you to keep your workspaces in the same network isolation as V1, though you won't have use of the new V2 features. We recommend turning on V1 Legacy Mode only when you  want to keep the AzureML control plane data inside your private networks. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/V1LegacyMode](../../../../articles/machine-learning/how-to-configure-network-isolation-with-v2.md). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Machine%20Learning/Workspace_EnableV1LegacyMode_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Machine Learning workspaces should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F40cec1dd-a100-4920-b15b-3024fe8901ab) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. Mapping private endpoints to Azure Machine Learning workspaces reduces data leakage risks. Learn more about private links at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-configure-private-link](../../../../articles/machine-learning/how-to-configure-private-link.md). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Machine%20Learning/Workspace_PrivateEndpoint_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Machine Learning workspaces should use user-assigned managed identity](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F5f0c7d88-c7de-45b8-ac49-db49e72eaa78) |Manage access to Azure ML workspace and associated resources, Azure Container Registry, KeyVault, Storage, and App Insights using user-assigned managed identity. By default, system-assigned managed identity is used by Azure ML workspace to access the associated resources. User-assigned managed identity allows you to create the identity as an Azure resource and maintain the life cycle of that identity.

|[Configure Azure Machine Learning workspace to use private DNS zones](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fee40564d-486e-4f68-a5ca-7a621edae0fb) |Use private DNS zones to override the DNS resolution for a private endpoint. A private DNS zone links to your virtual network to resolve to Azure Machine Learning workspaces.
