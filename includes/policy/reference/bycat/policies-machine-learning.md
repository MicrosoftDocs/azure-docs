|[Azure Machine Learning workspaces should be encrypted with a customer-managed key (CMK)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fba769a63-b8cc-4b2d-abf6-ac33c7204be8) |Manage encryption at rest of your Azure Machine Learning workspace data with customer-managed keys (CMK). By default, customer data is encrypted with service-managed keys, but CMKs are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. CMKs enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. Learn more about CMK encryption at [https://aka.ms/azureml-workspaces-cmk](https://aka.ms/azureml-workspaces-cmk). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Machine%20Learning/Workspace_CMKEnabled_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Machine Learning workspaces should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F40cec1dd-a100-4920-b15b-3024fe8901ab) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your Azure Machine Learning workspaces instead of the entire service, you'll also be protected against data leakage risks.
