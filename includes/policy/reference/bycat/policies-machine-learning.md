|[Azure Machine Learning workspaces should be encrypted with a customer-managed key](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fba769a63-b8cc-4b2d-abf6-ac33c7204be8) |Manage encryption at rest of Azure Machine Learning workspace data with customer-managed keys. By default, customer data is encrypted with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management.

|[Azure Machine Learning workspaces should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F40cec1dd-a100-4920-b15b-3024fe8901ab) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Azure Machine Learning workspaces, data leakage risks are reduced. Learn more about private links at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-configure-private-link](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-configure-private-link). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Machine%20Learning/Workspace_PrivateEndpoint_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Machine Learning workspaces should use user-assigned managed identity](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F5f0c7d88-c7de-45b8-ac49-db49e72eaa78) |Manange access to Azure ML workspace and associated resources, Azure Container Registry, KeyVault, Storage, and App Insights using user-assigned managed identity. By default, system-assigned managed identity is used by Azure ML workspace to access the associated resources. User-assigned managed identity allows you to create the identity as an Azure resource and maintain the life cycle of that identity.
