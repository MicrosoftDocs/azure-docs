|[Fluid Relay should use customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F46388f67-373c-4018-98d3-2b83172dd13a) |Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of your Fluid Relay server. By default, customer data is encrypted with service-managed keys, but CMKs are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you, with full control and responsibility, including rotation and management.
