|[\[Preview\]: Azure IoT Hub should use customer-managed key to encrypt data at rest](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F2d7e144b-159c-44fc-95c1-ac3dbf5e6e54) |Encryption of data at rest in IoT Hub with customer-managed key adds a second layer of encryption on top of the default service-managed keys, enables customer control of keys, custom rotation policies, and ability to manage access to data through key access control. Customer-managed keys must be configured during creation of IoT Hub. For more information on how to configure customer-managed keys, see [https://aka.ms/iotcmk](https://aka.ms/iotcmk). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Internet%20of%20Things/IotHub_CMKEncryptionEnabled.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: IoT Hub device provisioning service data should be encrypted using customer-managed keys (CMK)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F47031206-ce96-41f8-861b-6a915f3de284) |Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of your IoT Hub device provisioning service. The data is automatically encrypted at rest with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys (CMK) are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. CMKs enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you.
