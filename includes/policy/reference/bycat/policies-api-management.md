|[API Management APIs should use only encrypted protocols](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fee7495e7-3ba7-40b6-bfee-c29e22cc75d4) |To ensure security of data in transit, APIs should be available only through encrypted protocols, like HTTPS or WSS. Avoid using unsecured protocols, such as HTTP or WS. |Audit, Disabled, Deny |[2.0.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/API%20Management/ApiManagement_HTTPEnabled_AuditDeny.json) |
|[API Management calls to API backends should be authenticated](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fc15dcc82-b93c-4dcb-9332-fbf121685b54) |Calls from API Management to backends should use some form of authentication, whether via certificates or credentials.

|[API Management calls to API backends should not bypass certificate thumbprint or name validation](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F92bb331d-ac71-416a-8c91-02f2cb734ce4) |To improve the API security, API Management should validate the backend server certificate for all API calls. Enable SSL certificate thumbprint and name validation. |Audit, Disabled, Deny |[1.0.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/API%20Management/ApiManagement_BackendCertificateChecks_AuditDeny.json) |

|[API Management minimum API version should be set to 2019-12-01 or higher](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F549814b6-3212-4203-bdc8-1548d342fb67) |To prevent service secrets from being shared with read-only users, the minimum API version should be set to 2019-12-01 or higher. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/API%20Management/ApiManagement_MinimumApiVersion_AuditDeny.json) |
|[API Management secret named values should be stored in Azure Key Vault](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ff1cc7827-022c-473e-836e-5a51cae0b249) |Named values are a collection of name and value pairs in each API Management service. Secret values can be stored either as encrypted text in API Management (custom secrets) or by referencing secrets in Azure Key Vault. To improve security of API Management and secrets, reference secret named values from Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault supports granular access management and secret rotation policies. |Audit, Disabled, Deny |[1.0.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/API%20Management/ApiManagement_NamedValueSecretsInKV_AuditDeny.json) |
|[API Management service should use a SKU that supports virtual networks](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F73ef9241-5d81-4cd4-b483-8443d1730fe5) |With supported SKUs of API Management, deploying service into a virtual network unlocks advanced API Management networking and security features which provides you greater control over your network security configuration. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/apimvnet](https://aka.ms/apimvnet). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/API%20Management/ApiManagement_AllowedVNETSkus_AuditDeny.json) |

These networks can then be connected to your on-premises networks using various VPN technologies, which enables access to your backend services within the network and/or on-premises. The developer portal and API gateway, can be configured to be accessible either from the Internet or only within the virtual network. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/API%20Management/ApiManagement_VNETEnabled_Audit.json) |
