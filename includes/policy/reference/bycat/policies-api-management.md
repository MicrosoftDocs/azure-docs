|[API Management APIs should use only encrypted protocols](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fee7495e7-3ba7-40b6-bfee-c29e22cc75d4) |To ensure security of data in transit, APIs should be available only through encrypted protocols, like HTTPS or WSS. Avoid using unsecured protocols, such as HTTP or WS. |Audit, Disabled, Deny |[2.0.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/API%20Management/HTTPEnabled_AuditDeny.json) |

Secret values can be stored either as encrypted text in API Management (custom secrets) or by referencing secrets in Azure Key Vault. To improve security of API Management and secrets, reference secret named values from Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault supports granular access management and secret rotation policies. |Audit, Disabled, Deny |[1.0.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/API%20Management/NamedValueSecretsInKV_AuditDeny.json) |
|[API Management service should use a SKU that supports virtual networks](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F73ef9241-5d81-4cd4-b483-8443d1730fe5) |With supported SKUs of API Management, deploying service into a virtual network unlocks advanced API Management networking and security features which provides you greater control over your network security configuration.

These networks can then be connected to your on-premises networks using various VPN technologies, which enables access to your backend services within the network and/or on-premises. The developer portal and API gateway, can be configured to be accessible either from the Internet or only within the virtual network. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/API%20Management/VNETEnabled_Audit.json) |
