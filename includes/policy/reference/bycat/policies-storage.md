|[Azure File Sync should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F1d320205-c6a1-4ac6-873d-46224024e8e2) |Creating a private endpoint for the indicated Storage Sync Service resource allows you to address your Storage Sync Service resource from within the private IP address space of your organization's network, rather than through the internet-accessible public endpoint. Creating a private endpoint by itself does not disable the public endpoint. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageSync_PrivateEndpoint_AuditIfNotExists.json) |
|[Configure Azure File Sync to use private DNS zones](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F06695360-db88-47f6-b976-7500d4297475) |To access the private endpoint(s) for Storage Sync Service resource interfaces from a registered server, you need to configure your DNS to resolve the correct names to your private endpoint's private IP addresses. This policy creates the requisite Azure Private DNS Zone and A records for the interfaces of your Storage Sync Service private endpoint(s). |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageSync_PrivateDNSZone_DeployIfNotExists.json) |
|[Configure Azure File Sync with private endpoints](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fb35dddd9-daf7-423b-8375-5a5b86806d5a) |A private endpoint is deployed for the indicated Storage Sync Service resource. This enables you to address your Storage Sync Service resource from within the private IP address space of your organization's network, rather than through the internet-accessible public endpoint. The existence of one or more private endpoints by themselves does not disable the public endpoint. |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageSync_PrivateEndpoint_DeployIfNotExists.json) |
|[Configure diagnostic settings for storage accounts to Log Analytics workspace](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F6f8f98a4-f108-47cb-8e98-91a0d85cd474) |Deploys the diagnostic settings for storage accounts to stream resource logs to a Log Analytics workspace when any storage account which is missing this diagnostic settings is created or updated. |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.3.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/DataConnectorsStorageAccounts%20_PolicyAssignment.json) |

|[HPC Cache accounts should use customer-managed key for encryption](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F970f84d8-71b6-4091-9979-ace7e3fb6dbb) |Manage encryption at rest of Azure HPC Cache with customer-managed keys. By default, customer data is encrypted with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. |Audit, Disabled, Deny |[2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageCache_CMKEnabled.json) |
|[Modify - Configure Azure File Sync to disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F0e07b2e9-6cd9-4c40-9ccb-52817b95133b) |The Azure File Sync's internet-accessible public endpoint are disabled by your organizational policy. You may still access the Storage Sync Service via its private endpoint(s). |Modify, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageSync_IncomingTrafficPolicy_Modify.json) |

There is nothing inherently insecure about allowing requests to the public endpoint, however, you may wish to disable it to meet regulatory, legal, or organizational policy requirements. You can disable the public endpoint for a Storage Sync Service by setting the incomingTrafficPolicy of the resource to AllowVirtualNetworksOnly. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageSync_IncomingTrafficPolicy_AuditDeny.json) |
|[Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F404c3081-a854-4457-ae30-26a93ef643f9) |Audit requirement of Secure transfer in your storage account. Secure transfer is an option that forces your storage account to accept requests only from secure connections (HTTPS). Use of HTTPS ensures authentication between the server and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/Storage_AuditForHTTPSEnabled_Audit.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Storage account public access should be disallowed](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F4fa4b6c0-31ca-4c0d-b10d-24b96f62a751) |Anonymous public read access to containers and blobs in Azure Storage is a convenient way to share data but might present security risks. To prevent data breaches caused by undesired anonymous access, Microsoft recommends preventing public access to a storage account unless your scenario requires it. |audit, deny, disabled |[2.0.1-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/ASC_Storage_DisallowPublicBlobAccess_Audit.json) |
|[Storage accounts should allow access from trusted Microsoft services](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fc9d007d0-c057-4772-b18c-01e546713bcd) |Some Microsoft services that interact with storage accounts operate from networks that can't be granted access through network rules. To help this type of service work as intended, allow the set of trusted Microsoft services to bypass the network rules. These services will then use strong authentication to access the storage account. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageAccess_TrustedMicrosoftServices_Audit.json) |
|[Storage accounts should be limited by allowed SKUs](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F7433c107-6db4-4ad1-b57a-a76dce0154a1) |Restrict the set of storage account SKUs that your organization can deploy. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/AllowedStorageSkus_Audit.json) |
|[Storage accounts should be migrated to new Azure Resource Manager resources](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F37e0d2fe-28a5-43d6-a273-67d37d1f5606) |Use new Azure Resource Manager for your storage accounts to provide security enhancements such as: stronger access control (RBAC), better auditing, Azure Resource Manager based deployment and governance, access to managed identities, access to key vault for secrets, Azure AD-based authentication and support for tags and resource groups for easier security management |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/Classic_AuditForClassicStorages_Audit.json) |
|[Storage accounts should have infrastructure encryption](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F4733ea7b-a883-42fe-8cac-97454c2a9e4a) |Enable infrastructure encryption for higher level of assurance that the data is secure. When infrastructure encryption is enabled, data in a storage account is encrypted twice. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageAccountInfrastructureEncryptionEnabled_Audit.json) |
|[Storage accounts should restrict network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F34c877ad-507e-4c82-993e-3452a6e0ad3c) |Network access to storage accounts should be restricted. Configure network rules so only applications from allowed networks can access the storage account. To allow connections from specific internet or on-premises clients, access can be granted to traffic from specific Azure virtual networks or to public internet IP address ranges |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.1.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/Storage_NetworkAcls_Audit.json) |

Disabling IP-based filtering prevents public IPs from accessing your storage accounts. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageAccountOnlyVnetRulesEnabled_Audit.json) |
|[Storage accounts should use customer-managed key for encryption](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F6fac406b-40ca-413b-bf8e-0bf964659c25) |Secure your storage account with greater flexibility using customer-managed keys. When you specify a customer-managed key, that key is used to protect and control access to the key that encrypts your data. Using customer-managed keys provides additional capabilities to control rotation of the key encryption key or cryptographically erase data. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageAccountCustomerManagedKeyEnabled_Audit.json) |
