|Name |Description |Policies |Version |
|---|---|---|---|
|[\[Preview\]: Configure Azure Defender for SQL agents on virtual machines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Monitoring/AzureMonitoring_AzureDefenderForSql.json) |Configure virtual machines to automatically install the Azure Defender for SQL agents where the Azure Monitor Agent is installed. Security Center collects events from the agents and uses them to provide security alerts and tailored hardening tasks (recommendations). Creates a resource group and Log Analytics workspace in the same region as the machine. This policy only applies to VMs in a few regions. |2 |1.0.0-preview |
|[Configure Linux machines to run Azure Monitor Agent and associate them to a Data Collection Rule](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Monitoring/AzureMonitor_LinuxPlatform_EnableDCR.json) |Monitor and secure your Linux virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets, and Arc machines by deploying the Azure Monitor Agent extension and associating the machines with a specified Data Collection Rule. Deployment will occur on machines with supported OS images (or machines matching the provided list of images) in supported regions. |4 |3.1.0 |
|[Configure Windows machines to run Azure Monitor Agent and associate them to a Data Collection Rule](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Monitoring/AzureMonitor_WindowsPlatform_EnableDCR.json) |Monitor and secure your Windows virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets, and Arc machines by deploying the Azure Monitor Agent extension and associating the machines with a specified Data Collection Rule. Deployment will occur on machines with supported OS images (or machines matching the provided list of images) in supported regions. |4 |3.1.0 |
|[Deploy Linux Azure Monitor Agent with user-assigned managed identity-based auth and associate with Data Collection Rule](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Monitoring/AzureMonitor_LinuxPlatform_UAI_EnableDCR.json) |Monitor your Linux virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets by deploying the Azure Monitor Agent extension with user-assigned managed identity authentication and associating with specified Data Collection Rule. Azure Monitor Agent Deployment will occur on machines with supported OS images (or machines matching the provided list of images) in supported regions. |5 |2.2.0 |
|[Deploy Windows Azure Monitor Agent with user-assigned managed identity-based auth and associate with Data Collection Rule](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Monitoring/AzureMonitor_WindowsPlatform_UAI_EnableDCR.json) |Monitor your Windows virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets by deploying the Azure Monitor Agent extension with user-assigned managed identity authentication and associating with specified Data Collection Rule. Azure Monitor Agent Deployment will occur on machines with supported OS images (or machines matching the provided list of images) in supported regions. |5 |2.2.0 |
|[Enable audit category group resource logging for supported resources to Event Hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Monitoring/AzureMonitor_DiagSettings_eventHub_audit.json) |Resource logs should be enabled to track activities and events that take place on your resources and give you visibility and insights into any changes that occur. This initiative deploys diagnostic setting using the audit category group to route logs to Event Hub for all supported resources |33 |1.0.0 |
|[Enable audit category group resource logging for supported resources to Log Analytics](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Monitoring/AzureMonitor_DiagSettings_logAnalytics_audit.json) |Resource logs should be enabled to track activities and events that take place on your resources and give you visibility and insights into any changes that occur. This initiative deploys diagnostic setting using the audit category group to route logs to Log Analytics for all supported resources. |33 |1.0.0 |
|[Enable audit category group resource logging for supported resources to storage](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Monitoring/AzureMonitor_DiagSettings_storage_audit.json) |Resource logs should be enabled to track activities and events that take place on your resources and give you visibility and insights into any changes that occur. This initiative deploys diagnostic setting using the audit category group to route logs to storage for all supported resources. |33 |1.0.0 |
|[Enable Azure Monitor for Hybrid VMs with AMA](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Monitoring/AzureMonitor_HybridVM_AMA_new.json) |Enable Azure Monitor for the hybrid virtual machines with AMA. |6 |1.0.0 |
|[Enable Azure Monitor for VMs with Azure Monitoring Agent(AMA)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Monitoring/AzureMonitor_VM_AMA_new.json) |Enable Azure Monitor for the virtual machines (VMs) with AMA. |7 |1.0.0 |
|[Enable Azure Monitor for VMSS with Azure Monitoring Agent(AMA)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Monitoring/AzureMonitor_VMSS_AMA_new.json) |Enable Azure Monitor for the virtual machines scale set (VMSS) with AMA. |7 |1.0.0 |
|[Legacy - Enable Azure Monitor for Virtual Machine Scale Sets](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Monitoring/AzureMonitor_VMSS.json) |Legacy - Enable Azure Monitor for the Virtual Machine Scale Sets in the specified scope (Management group, Subscription or resource group). Takes Log Analytics workspace as parameter. Use the new initiative named: Enable Azure Monitor for VMSS with Azure Monitoring Agent(AMA). Note: if your scale set upgradePolicy is set to Manual, you need to apply the extension to the all VMs in the set by calling upgrade on them. In CLI this would be az vmss update-instances. |6 |1.0.2 |
|[Legacy - Enable Azure Monitor for VMs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Monitoring/AzureMonitor_VM.json) |Legacy - Enable Azure Monitor for the virtual machines (VMs) in the specified scope (management group, subscription or resource group). Takes Log Analytics workspace as parameter. Use the new initiative named: Enable Azure Monitor for VMs with Azure Monitoring Agent(AMA) |10 |2.0.1 |
