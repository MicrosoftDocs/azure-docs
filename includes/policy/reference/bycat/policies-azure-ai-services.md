|[Azure AI Services resources should have key access disabled (disable local authentication)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F71ef260a-8f18-47b7-abcb-62d0673d94dc) |Key access (local authentication) is recommended to be disabled for security. Azure OpenAI Studio, typically used in development/testing, requires key access and will not function if key access is disabled. After disabling, Microsoft Entra ID becomes the only access method, which allows maintaining minimum privilege principle and granular control.

The Private Link platform reduces data leakage risks by handling the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network.
