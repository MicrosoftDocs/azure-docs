|[API apps should use an Azure file share for its content directory](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F324c7761-08db-4474-9661-d1039abc92ee) |The content directory of an API app should be located on an Azure file share. The storage account information for the file share must be provided before any publishing activity. To learn more about using Azure Files for hosting app service content refer to [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2151594](../../../../articles/storage/files/storage-files-introduction.md). |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/App%20Service/AppService_ApiApp_StorageAccountRequired_Audit.json) |
|[App Service Apps should be injected into a virtual network](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F72d04c29-f87d-4575-9731-419ff16a2757) |Injecting App Service Apps in a virtual network unlocks advanced App Service networking and security features and provides you with greater control over your network security configuration. Learn more at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/web-sites-integrate-with-vnet](../../../../articles/app-service/web-sites-integrate-with-vnet.md). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/App%20Service/AppService_App_VNetIntegrationEnabled_Audit.json) |

Using the API to set 'vnetRouteAllEnabled' to true enables all outbound traffic into the Azure Virtual Network. This setting allows features like network security groups and user defined routes to be used for all outbound traffic from the App Service app. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/App%20Service/AppService_VnetRouteAllEnabled_Audit.json) |

The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to apps, you can reduce data leakage risks. Learn more about private links at: [https://aka.ms/private-link](../../../../articles/app-service/networking/private-endpoint.md). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/App%20Service/AppService_DisablePrivateEndpoint_Deny.json.json) |

To set the IP address to a virtual network IP, the App Service Environment must be deployed with an internal load balancer. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/App%20Service/AppService_HostingEnvironment_InternalLoadBalancingMode_Audit.json) |

Older versions of App Service Environment require manual management of Azure resources and have greater scaling limitations. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/App%20Service/AppService_HostingEnvironment_LatestVersions_Audit.json) |
|[App Service Environment should disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fd6545c6b-dd9d-4265-91e6-0b451e2f1c50) |TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are out-of-date protocols that do not support modern cryptographic algorithms.
