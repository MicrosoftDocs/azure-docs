|[Azure AI Services resources should encrypt data at rest with a customer-managed key (CMK)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F67121cc7-ff39-4ab8-b7e3-95b84dab487d) |Using customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest provides more control over the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. This is particularly relevant for organizations with related compliance requirements. This is not assessed by default and should only be applied when required by compliance or restrictive policy requirements. If not enabled, the data will be encrypted using platform-managed keys. To implement this, update the 'Effect' parameter in the Security Policy for the applicable scope. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[2.2.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/CustomerManagedKey_Audit.json) |
|[Cognitive Services accounts should use a managed identity](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ffe3fd216-4f83-4fc1-8984-2bbec80a3418) |Assigning a managed identity to your Cognitive Service account helps ensure secure authentication. This identity is used by this Cognitive service account to communicate with other Azure services, like Azure Key Vault, in a secure way without you having to manage any credentials. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/ManagedIdentity_Audit.json) |
|[Cognitive Services accounts should use customer owned storage](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F46aa9b05-0e60-4eae-a88b-1e9d374fa515) |Use customer owned storage to control the data stored at rest in Cognitive Services. To learn more about customer owned storage, visit [https://aka.ms/cogsvc-cmk](https://aka.ms/cogsvc-cmk). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/UserOwnedStorage_Audit.json) |
|[Configure Cognitive Services accounts to disable local authentication methods](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F14de9e63-1b31-492e-a5a3-c3f7fd57f555) |Disable local authentication methods so that your Cognitive Services accounts require Azure Active Directory identities exclusively for authentication. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/cs/auth](https://aka.ms/cs/auth). |Modify, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/DisableLocalAuth_Modify.json) |
|[Configure Cognitive Services accounts to disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F47ba1dd7-28d9-4b07-a8d5-9813bed64e0c) |Disable public network access for your Cognitive Services resource so that it's not accessible over the public internet. This can reduce data leakage risks. Learn more at: [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800). |Disabled, Modify |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/DisablePublicNetworkAccess_Modify.json) |
|[Configure Cognitive Services accounts to use private DNS zones](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fc4bc6f10-cb41-49eb-b000-d5ab82e2a091) |Use private DNS zones to override the DNS resolution for a private endpoint. A private DNS zone links to your virtual network to resolve to Cognitive Services accounts. Learn more at: [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2110097](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2110097). |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/PrivateDnsZones_DINE.json) |
|[Configure Cognitive Services accounts with private endpoints](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fdb630ad5-52e9-4f4d-9c44-53912fe40053) |Private endpoints connect your virtual networks to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. By mapping private endpoints to Cognitive Services, you'll reduce the potential for data leakage. Learn more about private links at: [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800). |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/EnablePrivateEndpoints_DINE.json) |
