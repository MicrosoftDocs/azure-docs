|[App Configuration should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F3d9f5e4c-9947-4579-9539-2a7695fbc187) |Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that the resource isn't exposed on the public internet. You can limit exposure of your resources by creating private endpoints instead.

|[App Configuration should use a customer-managed key](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F967a4b4b-2da9-43c1-b7d0-f98d0d74d0b1) |Customer-managed keys provide enhanced data protection by allowing you to manage your encryption keys. This is often required to meet compliance requirements. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/App%20Configuration/CustomerManagedKey_Audit.json) |
|[App Configuration should use a SKU that supports private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F89c8a434-18f0-402c-8147-630a8dea54e0) |When using a supported SKU, Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your app configuration instances instead of the entire service, you'll also be protected against data leakage risks.
