|[All authorization rules except RootManageSharedAccessKey should be removed from Event Hub namespace](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fb278e460-7cfc-4451-8294-cccc40a940d7) |Event Hub clients should not use a namespace level access policy that provides access to all queues and topics in a namespace. To align with the least privilege security model, you should create access policies at the entity level for queues and topics to provide access to only the specific entity |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Event%20Hub/EventHub_AuditNamespaceAccessRules_Audit.json) |
|[Authorization rules on the Event Hub instance should be defined](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ff4826e5f-6a27-407c-ae3e-9582eb39891d) |Audit existence of authorization rules on Event Hub entities to grant least-privileged access |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Event%20Hub/EventHub_AuditEventHubAccessRules_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Event Hub namespaces should have local authentication methods disabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F5d4e3c65-4873-47be-94f3-6f8b953a3598) |Disabling local authentication methods improves security by ensuring that Azure Event Hub namespaces exclusively require Azure Active Directory identities for authentication. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/disablelocalauth-eh](https://aka.ms/disablelocalauth-eh). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Event%20Hub/EventHub_DisableLocalAuth_AuditDeny.json) |
|[Configure Azure Event Hub namespaces to disable local authentication](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F57f35901-8389-40bb-ac49-3ba4f86d889d) |Disable local authentication methods so that your Azure Event Hub namespaces exclusively require Azure Active Directory identities for authentication. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/disablelocalauth-eh](https://aka.ms/disablelocalauth-eh). |Modify, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Event%20Hub/EventHub_DisableLocalAuth_Modify.json) |
|[Configure Event Hub namespaces to use private DNS zones](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fed66d4f5-8220-45dc-ab4a-20d1749c74e6) |Use private DNS zones to override the DNS resolution for a private endpoint. A private DNS zone links to your virtual network to resolve to Event Hub namespaces. Learn more at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/private-link-service](../../../../articles/event-hubs/private-link-service.md). |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Event%20Hub/EventHub_PrivateDNSZone_DeployIfNotExists.json) |
|[Configure Event Hub namespaces with private endpoints](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F91678b7c-d721-4fc5-b179-3cdf74e96b1c) |Private endpoints connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. By mapping private endpoints to Event Hub namespaces, you can reduce data leakage risks. Learn more at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/private-link-service](../../../../articles/event-hubs/private-link-service.md). |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Event%20Hub/EventHub_PrivateEndpoint_DeployIfNotExists.json) |
|[Event Hub Namespaces should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F0602787f-9896-402a-a6e1-39ee63ee435e) |Azure Event Hub should have public network access disabled. Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that the resource isn't exposed on the public internet. You can limit exposure of your resources by creating private endpoints instead. Learn more at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/private-link-service](../../../../articles/event-hubs/private-link-service.md) |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Event%20Hub/EventHub_AuditPublicNetworkAccess.json) |
|[Event Hub namespaces should have double encryption enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F836cd60e-87f3-4e6a-a27c-29d687f01a4c) |Enabling double encryption helps protect and safeguard your data to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. When double encryption has been enabled, data in the storage account is encrypted twice, once at the service level and once at the infrastructure level, using two different encryption algorithms and two different keys. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Event%20Hub/EventHub_InfrastructureEncryptionEnabled_Audit.json) |
|[Event Hub namespaces should use a customer-managed key for encryption](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fa1ad735a-e96f-45d2-a7b2-9a4932cab7ec) |Azure Event Hubs supports the option of encrypting data at rest with either Microsoft-managed keys (default) or customer-managed keys. Choosing to encrypt data using customer-managed keys enables you to assign, rotate, disable, and revoke access to the keys that Event Hub will use to encrypt data in your namespace. Note that Event Hub only supports encryption with customer-managed keys for namespaces in dedicated clusters. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Event%20Hub/EventHub_CustomerManagedKeyEnabled_Audit.json) |
|[Event Hub namespaces should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fb8564268-eb4a-4337-89be-a19db070c59d) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Event Hub namespaces, data leakage risks are reduced.

|[Resource logs in Event Hub should be enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F83a214f7-d01a-484b-91a9-ed54470c9a6a) |Audit enabling of resource logs. This enables you to recreate activity trails to use for investigation purposes; when a security incident occurs or when your network is compromised |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[5.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Event%20Hub/EventHub_AuditDiagnosticLog_Audit.json) |
