|[\[Preview\]: Configure Azure Recovery Services vaults to use private DNS zones](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F942bd215-1a66-44be-af65-6a1c0318dbe2) |Use private DNS zones to override the DNS resolution for a private endpoint. A private DNS zone links to your virtual network to resolve to Recovery Services Vaults.

|[\[Preview\]: Configure private endpoints on Azure Recovery Services vaults](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fe95a8a5c-0987-421f-84ab-df4d88ebf7d1) |Private endpoints connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. By mapping private endpoints to your site recovery resources of Recovery Services vaults, you can reduce data leakage risks. To use private links, managed service identity must be assigned to Recovery Services Vaults.

The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Azure Recovery Services vaults, data leakage risks are reduced.
