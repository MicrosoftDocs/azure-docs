|[Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pools should enable encryption](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fcfaf0007-99c7-4b01-b36b-4048872ac978) |Enable transparent data encryption for Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pools to protect data-at-rest and meet compliance requirements. Please note that enabling transparent data encryption for the pool may impact query performance. More details can refer to [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2147714](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2147714) |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Synapse/ACAT_SqlPoolEncryption_AINE.json) |
|[Azure Synapse Workspace SQL Server should be running TLS version 1.2 or newer](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fcb3738a6-82a2-4a18-b87b-15217b9deff4) |Setting TLS version to 1.2 or newer improves security by ensuring your Azure Synapse workspace SQL server can only be accessed from clients using TLS 1.2 or newer. Using versions of TLS less than 1.2 is not recommended since they have well documented security vulnerabilities. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Synapse/WorkSpaceDedicatedSqlMinimalTlsSettings_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Synapse workspaces should allow outbound data traffic only to approved targets](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F3484ce98-c0c5-4c83-994b-c5ac24785218) |Increase security of your Synapse workspace by allowing outbound data traffic only to approved targets. This helps prevention against data exfiltration by validating the target before sending data. |Audit, Disabled, Deny |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Synapse/Workspace_RestrictOutboundDataTraffic_Audit.json) |
