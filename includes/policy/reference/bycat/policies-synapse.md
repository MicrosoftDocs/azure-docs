Please note that enabling transparent data encryption for the pool may impact query performance. More details can refer to [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2147714](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2147714) |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Synapse/ACAT_Synapse_SqlPoolEncryption_AINE.json) |
