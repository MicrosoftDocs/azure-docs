|[Azure Active Directory Domain Services managed domains should use TLS 1.2 only mode](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F3aa87b5a-7813-4b57-8a43-42dd9df5aaa7) |Use TLS 1.2 only mode for your managed domains. By default, Azure AD Domain Services enables the use of ciphers such as NTLM v1 and TLS v1. These ciphers may be required for some legacy applications, but are considered weak and can be disabled if you don't need them. When TLS 1.2 only mode is enabled, any client making a request that is not using TLS 1.2 will fail.

|[Azure Active Directory should use private link to access Azure services](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F2e9411a0-0c5a-44b3-9ddb-ff10a1a2bf28) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual networks to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Azure AD, you can reduce data leakage risks.
