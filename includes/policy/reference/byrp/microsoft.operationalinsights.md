|[Azure Monitor Logs clusters should be created with infrastructure-encryption enabled (double encryption)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fea0dfaed-95fb-448c-934e-d6e713ce393d) |To ensure secure data encryption is enabled at the service level and the infrastructure level with two different encryption algorithms and two different keys, use an Azure Monitor dedicated cluster. This option is enabled by default when supported at the region, see [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/customer-managed-keys#customer-managed-key-overview](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/customer-managed-keys#customer-managed-key-overview). |audit, Audit, deny, Deny, disabled, Disabled |[1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Monitoring/LogAnalyticsClusters_CMKDoubleEncryptionEnabled_Deny.json) |

By default, the log data is encrypted with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance. Customer-managed key in Azure Monitor gives you more control over the access to you data, see [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/customer-managed-keys](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/customer-managed-keys). |audit, Audit, deny, Deny, disabled, Disabled |[1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Monitoring/LogAnalyticsClusters_CMKEnabled_Deny.json) |
