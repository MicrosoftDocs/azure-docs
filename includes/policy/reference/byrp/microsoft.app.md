|---|---|---|---|
|[\[Preview\]: Audit Azure Spring Cloud instances where distributed tracing is not enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F0f2d8593-4667-4932-acca-6a9f187af109) |Distributed tracing tools in Azure Spring Cloud allow debugging and monitoring the complex interconnections between microservices in an application. Distributed tracing tools should be enabled and in a healthy state. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/App%20Platform/Spring_DistributedTracing_Audit.json) |
|[App Configuration should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F3d9f5e4c-9947-4579-9539-2a7695fbc187) |Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that the resource isn't exposed on the public internet. You can limit exposure of your resources by creating private endpoints instead. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/appconfig/private-endpoint](https://aka.ms/appconfig/private-endpoint). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/App%20Configuration/PrivateLink_PublicNetworkAccess_Audit.json) |

This is often required to meet compliance requirements. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/App%20Configuration/CustomerManagedKey_Audit.json) |
|[App Configuration should use a SKU that supports private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F89c8a434-18f0-402c-8147-630a8dea54e0) |When using a supported SKU, Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your app configuration instances instead of the entire service, you'll also be protected against data leakage risks.
