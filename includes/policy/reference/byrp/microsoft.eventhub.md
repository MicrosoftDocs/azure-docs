|[\[Preview\]: Event Hubs should be Zone Redundant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fae243d87-5cf3-4dce-90bd-6d62be328de9) |Event Hubs can be configured to be Zone Redundant or not. Event Hubs are Zone Redundant if it's 'zoneRedundant' property is set to 'true'. Enforcing this policy helps ensure that Event Hubs are appropriately configured for zone resilience, reducing the risk of downtime during zone outages. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/EventHub_namespaces_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |

Choosing to encrypt data using customer-managed keys enables you to assign, rotate, disable, and revoke access to the keys that Event Hub will use to encrypt data in your namespace. Note that Event Hub only supports encryption with customer-managed keys for namespaces in dedicated clusters. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Event%20Hub/CustomerManagedKeyEnabled_Audit.json) |

The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Event Hub namespaces, data leakage risks are reduced.
