|[\[Preview\]: Azure Key Vault Managed HSM keys should have an expiration date](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F1d478a74-21ba-4b9f-9d8f-8e6fced0eec5) |To use this policy in preview, you must first follow these instructions at [https://aka.ms/mhsmgovernance](https://aka.ms/mhsmgovernance). Cryptographic keys should have a defined expiration date and not be permanent. Keys that are valid forever provide a potential attacker with more time to compromise the key. It is a recommended security practice to set expiration dates on cryptographic keys. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Key%20Vault/ManagedHsm_Keys_ExpirationSet.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Azure Key Vault Managed HSM Keys should have more than the specified number of days before expiration](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fad27588c-0198-4c84-81ef-08efd0274653) |To use this policy in preview, you must first follow these instructions at [https://aka.ms/mhsmgovernance](https://aka.ms/mhsmgovernance). If a key is too close to expiration, an organizational delay to rotate the key may result in an outage. Keys should be rotated at a specified number of days prior to expiration to provide sufficient time to react to a failure. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Key%20Vault/ManagedHsm_Keys_Expiry_ByDays.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Azure Key Vault Managed HSM keys using elliptic curve cryptography should have the specified curve names](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fe58fd0c1-feac-4d12-92db-0a7e9421f53e) |To use this policy in preview, you must first follow these instructions at [https://aka.ms/mhsmgovernance](https://aka.ms/mhsmgovernance). Keys backed by elliptic curve cryptography can have different curve names. Some applications are only compatible with specific elliptic curve keys. Enforce the types of elliptic curve keys that are allowed to be created in your environment. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Key%20Vault/ManagedHsm_Keys_EC_AllowedCurveNames.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Azure Key Vault Managed HSM keys using RSA cryptography should have a specified minimum key size](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F86810a98-8e91-4a44-8386-ec66d0de5d57) |To use this policy in preview, you must first follow these instructions at [https://aka.ms/mhsmgovernance](https://aka.ms/mhsmgovernance). Set the minimum allowed key size for use with your key vaults. Use of RSA keys with small key sizes is not a secure practice and doesn't meet many industry certification requirements.  |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Key%20Vault/ManagedHsm_Keys_RSA_MinimumKeySize.json) |
