This policy deploys a diagnostic setting using a category group to route logs to an Event Hub for Azure Database for MariaDB servers (microsoft.dbformariadb/servers). |DeployIfNotExists, AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Monitoring/DS_EH_dbformariadb-servers_DINE.json) |

It can be set to a geo-redundant backup storage in which the data is not only stored within the region in which your server is hosted, but is also replicated to a paired region to provide recovery option in case of a region failure. Configuring geo-redundant storage for backup is only allowed during server create. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/SQL/GeoRedundant_DBForMariaDB_Audit.json) |

This policy provides a way to audit if the Azure Database for MariaDB has virtual network service endpoint being used. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/SQL/MariaDB_VirtualNetworkServiceEndpoint_Audit.json) |
