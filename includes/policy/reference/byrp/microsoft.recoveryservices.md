|[\[Preview\]: Azure Recovery Services vaults should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F9ebbbba3-4d65-4da9-bb67-b22cfaaff090) |Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that recovery services vault is not exposed on the public internet. Creating private endpoints can limit exposure of recovery services vault. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/AB-PublicNetworkAccess-Deny](https://aka.ms/AB-PublicNetworkAccess-Deny). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Backup/RecoveryServices_PublicNetworkAccess_AuditDeny.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Azure Recovery Services vaults should use customer-managed keys for encrypting backup data](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F2e94d99a-8a36-4563-bc77-810d8893b671) |Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of your backup data. By default, customer data is encrypted with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. Learn more at [https://aka.ms/AB-CmkEncryption](https://aka.ms/AB-CmkEncryption). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Backup/AzBackupRSVault_CMKEnabled_Audit.json) |

The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Azure Recovery Services vaults, data leakage risks are reduced. Learn more about private links at: [https://aka.ms/AB-PrivateEndpoints](https://aka.ms/AB-PrivateEndpoints). |Audit, Disabled |[2.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Backup/RecoveryServices_PrivateEndpoint_Audit.json) |

Backup and Site Recovery is Zone Redundant if it's 'standardTierStorageRedundancy' property is set to 'ZoneRedundant'. Enforcing this policy helps ensure that Backup and Site Recovery is appropriately configured for zone resilience, reducing the risk of downtime during zone outages. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/RecoveryServices_Vaults_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |

By mapping private endpoints to your site recovery resources of Recovery Services vaults, you can reduce data leakage risks. To use private links, managed service identity must be assigned to Recovery Services Vaults. Learn more about private links at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication-private-endpoints](/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication-private-endpoints). |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Site%20Recovery/PrivateEndpoints_DINE.json) |

By mapping private endpoints to Recovery Services vaults, you can reduce data leakage risks. Note that your vaults need to meet certain pre-requisites to be eligible for private endpoint configuration.

If the policies in your organization requires you to block the creation of vaults that belong to a certain redundancy type, you may achieve the same using this Azure policy. |Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Backup/AzBackuprecoveryServicesVault_RedudancySettings_Deny.json) |
