|---|---|---|---|
|[\[Preview\]: Azure AI Search Service should be Zone Redundant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F90bc8109-d21a-4692-88fc-51419391da3d) |Azure AI Search Service can be configured to be Zone Redundant or not. Availability zones are used when you add two or more replicas to your search service. Each replica is placed in a different availability zone within the region. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/Search_searchServices_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |
|[Azure AI Search service should use a SKU that supports private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fa049bf77-880b-470f-ba6d-9f21c530cf83) |With supported SKUs of Azure AI Search, Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your Search service, data leakage risks are reduced. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/azure-cognitive-search/inbound-private-endpoints](https://aka.ms/azure-cognitive-search/inbound-private-endpoints). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Search/RequirePrivateLinkSupportedResource_Deny.json) |
|[Azure AI Search services should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fee980b6d-0eca-4501-8d54-f6290fd512c3) |Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that your Azure AI Search service is not exposed on the public internet. Creating private endpoints can limit exposure of your Search service. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/azure-cognitive-search/inbound-private-endpoints](https://aka.ms/azure-cognitive-search/inbound-private-endpoints). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Search/RequirePublicNetworkAccessDisabled_Deny.json) |
|[Azure AI Search services should have local authentication methods disabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F6300012e-e9a4-4649-b41f-a85f5c43be91) |Disabling local authentication methods improves security by ensuring that Azure AI Search services exclusively require Azure Active Directory identities for authentication. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/azure-cognitive-search/rbac](https://aka.ms/azure-cognitive-search/rbac). Note that while the disable local authentication parameter is still in preview, the deny effect for this policy may result in limited Azure AI Search portal functionality since some features of the Portal use the GA API which does not support the parameter. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Search/DisableLocalAuth_AuditDeny.json) |
|[Azure AI Search services should use customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F76a56461-9dc0-40f0-82f5-2453283afa2f) |Enabling encryption at rest using a customer-managed key on your Azure AI Search services provides additional control over the key used to encrypt data at rest. This feature is often applicable to customers with special compliance requirements to manage data encryption keys using a key vault. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Search/CMK_Audit.json) |
|[Azure AI Services resources should have key access disabled (disable local authentication)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F71ef260a-8f18-47b7-abcb-62d0673d94dc) |Key access (local authentication) is recommended to be disabled for security. Azure OpenAI Studio, typically used in development/testing, requires key access and will not function if key access is disabled. After disabling, Microsoft Entra ID becomes the only access method, which allows maintaining minimum privilege principle and granular control.

This can be achieved by configuring network rules so that only applications from allowed networks can access the Azure AI service. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[3.2.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Azure%20Ai%20Services/NetworkAcls_Audit.json) |
