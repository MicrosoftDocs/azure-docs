|[\[Preview\]: Linux virtual machines should use only signed and trusted boot components](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F13a6c84f-49a5-410a-b5df-5b880c3fe009) |All OS boot components (boot loader, kernel, kernel drivers) must be signed by trusted publishers. Defender for Cloud has identified untrusted OS boot components on one or more of your Linux machines. To protect your machines from potentially malicious components, add them to your allow list or remove the identified components. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_BootComponent_Signature_Linux_Audit.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Linux virtual machines should use Secure Boot](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fb1bb3592-47b8-4150-8db0-bfdcc2c8965b) |To protect against the installation of malware-based rootkits and boot kits, enable Secure Boot on supported Linux virtual machines. Secure Boot ensures that only signed operating systems and drivers will be allowed to run. This assessment only applies to Linux virtual machines that have the Azure Monitor Agent installed. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_EnableSecureBootOnLinuxVM_Audit.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Machines should have ports closed that might expose attack vectors](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Faf99038c-02fd-4a2f-ac24-386b62bf32de) |Azure's Terms Of Use prohibit the use of Azure services in ways that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair any Microsoft server, or the network. The exposed ports identified by this recommendation need to be closed for your continued security. For each identified port, the recommendation also provides an explanation of the potential threat. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_OpenTOUPortsOnVirtualMachines_Audit.json) |

The server uses these logs to determine whether boot components are trustworthy. This assessment is intended to detect compromises of the boot chain which might be the result of a bootkit or rootkit infection. This assessment only applies to Trusted Launch enabled virtual machines that have Guest Attestation extension installed. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_BootIntegrityAttestation_Audit.json) |

A core component of every cyber risk and security program is the identification and analysis of vulnerabilities. Azure Security Center's standard pricing tier includes vulnerability scanning for your virtual machines at no extra cost. Additionally, Security Center can automatically deploy this tool for you. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_ServerVulnerabilityAssessment_Audit.json) |
|[All network ports should be restricted on network security groups associated to your virtual machine](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F9daedab3-fb2d-461e-b861-71790eead4f6) |Azure Security Center has identified some of your network security groups' inbound rules to be too permissive. Inbound rules should not allow access from 'Any' or 'Internet' ranges. This can potentially enable attackers to target your resources. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_UnprotectedEndpoints_Audit.json) |
|[API endpoints in Azure API Management should be authenticated](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F8ac833bd-f505-48d5-887e-c993a1d3eea0) |API endpoints published within Azure API Management should enforce authentication to help minimize security risk. Authentication mechanisms are sometimes implemented incorrectly or are missing. This allows attackers to exploit implementation flaws and to access data. Learn More about the OWASP API Threat for Broken User Authentication here: [https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/mitigate-owasp-api-threats#broken-user-authentication](/azure/api-management/mitigate-owasp-api-threats#broken-user-authentication) |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_APIMApiEndpointsShouldbeAuthenticated_AINE.json) |

Keeping unused API endpoints may pose a security risk to your organization. These may be APIs that should have been deprecated from the Azure API Management service but may have been accidentally left active. Such APIs typically do not receive the most up to date security coverage. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_APIMUnusedApiEndpointsShouldbeRemoved_AINE.json) |
