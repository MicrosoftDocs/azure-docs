Disable the public network access property as described in [https://aka.ms/storageaccountpublicnetworkaccess](https://aka.ms/storageaccountpublicnetworkaccess). This option disables access from any public address space outside the Azure IP range, and denies all logins that match IP or virtual network-based firewall rules. This reduces data leakage risks. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StoragePublicNetworkAccess_AuditDeny.json) |

|[Storage accounts should prevent cross tenant object replication](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F92a89a79-6c52-4a7e-a03f-61306fc49312) |Audit restriction of object replication for your storage account. By default, users can configure object replication with a source storage account in one Azure AD tenant and a destination account in a different tenant. It is a security concern because customer's data can be replicated to a storage account that is owned by the customer. By setting allowCrossTenantReplication to false, objects replication can be configured only if both source and destination accounts are in the same Azure AD tenant. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageAccountAllowCrossTenantReplication_Audit.json) |

By default, requests can be authorized with either Azure Active Directory credentials, or by using the account access key for Shared Key authorization. Of these two types of authorization, Azure AD provides superior security and ease of use over Shared Key, and is recommended by Microsoft. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageAccountAllowSharedKeyAccess_Audit.json) |
