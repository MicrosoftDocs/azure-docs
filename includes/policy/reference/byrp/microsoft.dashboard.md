|[\[Preview\]: Azure Managed Grafana should be Zone Redundant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fbdd8bbb2-1efd-48dc-a0fd-8ddcba2e96cd) |Azure Managed Grafana can be configured to be Zone Redundant or not. An Azure Managed Grafana instance is Zone Redundant is it's 'zoneRedundancy' property is set to 'Enabled'. Enforcing this policy helps ensure that your Azure Managed Grafana is appropriately configured for zone resilience, reducing the risk of downtime during zone outages. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/Dashboard_Grafana_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |
