|[\[Preview\]: Container Instances should be Zone Aligned](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ff58e8c0a-3c79-431a-abf8-cd1b895478e8) |Container Instances can be configured to be Zone Aligned or not. They are considered Zone Aligned if they have only one entry in their zones array. This policy ensures that they are configured to operate within a single availability zone. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/ContainerInstance_containerGroups_ZoneAligned_Audit.json) |
