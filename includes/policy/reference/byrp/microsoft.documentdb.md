|[\[Preview\]: Cosmos Database Accounts should be Zone Redundant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F44c5a1f9-7ef6-4c38-880c-273e8f7a3c24) |Cosmos Database Accounts can be configured to be Zone Redundant or not. If the 'enableMultipleWriteLocations' is set to 'true' then all locations must have a 'isZoneRedundant' property and it must be set to 'true'. If the 'enableMultipleWriteLocations' is set to 'false' then the primary location ('failoverPriority' set to 0) must have a 'isZoneRedundant' property and it must be set to 'true'. Enforcing this policy ensures Cosmos Database Accounts are appropriately configured for zone redundancy. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/DocumentDB_databaseAccounts_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |

By default, the data is encrypted at rest with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you.
