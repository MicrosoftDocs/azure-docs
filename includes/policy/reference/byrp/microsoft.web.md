When the 'zoneRedundant' property is set to 'false' for an App Service Plan, it is not configured for Zone Redundancy. This policy identifies and enforces the Zone Redundancy configuration for App Service Plans. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/web_serverfarms_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |
