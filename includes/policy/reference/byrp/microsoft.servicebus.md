|[\[Preview\]: Service Bus should be Zone Redundant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fd3ee5dcf-0c6d-49ab-aee4-f250583a7bdc) |Service Bus can be configured to be Zone Redundant or not. When the 'zoneRedundant' property is set to 'false' for a Service Bus, it means it is not configured for Zone Redundancy. This policy identifies and enforces the Zone Redundancy configuration for Service Bus instances. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/ServiceBus_namespaces_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |
|[All authorization rules except RootManageSharedAccessKey should be removed from Service Bus namespace](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fa1817ec0-a368-432a-8057-8371e17ac6ee) |Service Bus clients should not use a namespace level access policy that provides access to all queues and topics in a namespace. To align with the least privilege security model, you should create access policies at the entity level for queues and topics to provide access to only the specific entity |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Service%20Bus/ServiceBus_AuditNamespaceAccessRules_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Service Bus namespaces should have local authentication methods disabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fcfb11c26-f069-4c14-8e36-56c394dae5af) |Disabling local authentication methods improves security by ensuring that Azure Service Bus namespaces exclusively require Azure Active Directory identities for authentication.

|[Azure Service Bus namespaces should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F1c06e275-d63d-4540-b761-71f364c2111d) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Service Bus namespaces, data leakage risks are reduced.
