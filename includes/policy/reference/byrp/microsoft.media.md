|[Azure Media Services accounts should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F8bfe3603-0888-404a-87ff-5c1b6b4cc5e3) |Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that Media Services resources are not exposed on the public internet. Creating private endpoints can limit exposure of Media Services resources. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/mediaservicesprivatelinkdocs](https://aka.ms/mediaservicesprivatelinkdocs). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Media%20Services/PublicNetworkAccess_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Media Services accounts should use an API that supports Private Link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fa77d8bb4-8d22-4bc1-a884-f582a705b480) |Media Services accounts should be created with an API that supports private link. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Media%20Services/RequirePrivateLinkSupport_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Media Services accounts that allow access to the legacy v2 API should be blocked](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fccf93279-9c91-4143-a841-8d1f21505455) |The Media Services legacy v2 API allows requests that cannot be managed using Azure Policy. Media Services resources created using the 2020-05-01 API or later block access to the legacy v2 API. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Media%20Services/BlockRestV2_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Media Services content key policies should use token authentication](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fdaccf7e4-9808-470c-a848-1c5b582a1afb) |Content key policies define the conditions that must be met to access content keys. A token restriction ensures content keys can only be accessed by users that have valid tokens from an authentication service, for example Microsoft Entra ID. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Media%20Services/ContentKeyPolicies_RequireTokenAuth_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Media Services jobs with HTTPS inputs should limit input URIs to permitted URI patterns](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fe9914afe-31cd-4b8a-92fa-c887f847d477) |Restrict HTTPS inputs used by Media Services jobs to known endpoints. Inputs from HTTPS endpoints can be disabled entirely by setting an empty list of allowed job input patterns. Where job inputs specify a 'baseUri' the patterns will be matched against this value; when 'baseUri' is not set, the pattern is matched against the 'files' property. |Deny, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Media%20Services/Jobs_RestrictHttpInputs.json) |
|[Azure Media Services should use customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F9285c3de-d5fd-4225-86d4-027894b0c442) |Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of your Media Services accounts. By default, customer data is encrypted with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management.

The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Media Services, you can reduce data leakage risks.
