|[\[Preview\]: Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server should be Zone Resilient](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F493c215d-2554-5976-bc81-57d2c04fc8c1) |Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server can be configured to be either Zone Aligned, Zone Redundant, or neither. MySQL Server that has a standby server selected in same zone for high availability is considered Zone Aligned. In contrast, MySQL Server that has a standby server selected to be in a different zone for high availability is recognized as Zone Redundant. This policy helps identify and enforce these resilience configurations. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/DBforMySQL_flexibleServers_ZoneResilient_Audit.json) |

Enforcing SSL connections between your database server and your client applications helps protect against 'man in the middle' attacks by encrypting the data stream between the server and your application. This configuration enforces that SSL is always enabled for accessing your database server. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/SQL/MySQL_EnableSSL_Audit.json) |

It can be set to a geo-redundant backup storage in which the data is not only stored within the region in which your server is hosted, but is also replicated to a paired region to provide recovery option in case of a region failure. Configuring geo-redundant storage for backup is only allowed during server create. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/SQL/GeoRedundant_DBForMySQL_Audit.json) |

This policy provides a way to audit if the Azure Database for MySQL has virtual network service endpoint being used. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/SQL/MySQL_VirtualNetworkServiceEndpoint_Audit.json) |
|[MySQL servers should use customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F83cef61d-dbd1-4b20-a4fc-5fbc7da10833) |Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of your MySQL servers. By default, the data is encrypted at rest with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.4](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/SQL/MySQL_EnableByok_Audit.json) |

This configuration strictly disables access from any public address space outside of Azure IP range and denies all logins that match IP or virtual network-based firewall rules. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[2.2.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/SQL/MySQL_FlexibleServers_DisablePublicNetworkAccess_Audit.json) |
