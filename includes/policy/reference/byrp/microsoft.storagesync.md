|[Azure File Sync should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F1d320205-c6a1-4ac6-873d-46224024e8e2) |Creating a private endpoint for the indicated Storage Sync Service resource allows you to address your Storage Sync Service resource from within the private IP address space of your organization's network, rather than through the internet-accessible public endpoint. Creating a private endpoint by itself does not disable the public endpoint. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageSync_PrivateEndpoint_AuditIfNotExists.json) |
|[Configure Azure File Sync with private endpoints](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fb35dddd9-daf7-423b-8375-5a5b86806d5a) |A private endpoint is deployed for the indicated Storage Sync Service resource. This enables you to address your Storage Sync Service resource from within the private IP address space of your organization's network, rather than through the internet-accessible public endpoint. The existence of one or more private endpoints by themselves does not disable the public endpoint. |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageSync_PrivateEndpoint_DeployIfNotExists.json) |
|[Modify - Configure Azure File Sync to disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F0e07b2e9-6cd9-4c40-9ccb-52817b95133b) |The Azure File Sync's internet-accessible public endpoint are disabled by your organizational policy. You may still access the Storage Sync Service via its private endpoint(s). |Modify, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageSync_IncomingTrafficPolicy_Modify.json) |
|[Public network access should be disabled for Azure File Sync](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F21a8cd35-125e-4d13-b82d-2e19b7208bb7) |Disabling the public endpoint allows you to restrict access to your Storage Sync Service resource to requests destined to approved private endpoints on your organization's network. There is nothing inherently insecure about allowing requests to the public endpoint, however, you may wish to disable it to meet regulatory, legal, or organizational policy requirements. You can disable the public endpoint for a Storage Sync Service by setting the incomingTrafficPolicy of the resource to AllowVirtualNetworksOnly. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageSync_IncomingTrafficPolicy_AuditDeny.json) |
