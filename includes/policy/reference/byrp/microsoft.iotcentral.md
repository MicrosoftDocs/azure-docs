|[Deploy - Configure IoT Central with private endpoints](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fc854b0f0-02d0-4f94-9b42-fd175fbd4d49) |A private endpoint is a private IP address allocated inside a customer-owned virtual network via which an Azure resource is reachable. This policy deploys a private endpoint for your IoT Central to allow services inside your virtual network to reach IoT Central without requiring traffic to be sent to IoT Central's public endpoint. |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Internet%20of%20Things/IoTCentral_DeployPrivateEndpoint_DINE.json) |
|[IoT Central should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F9ace2dbc-4b71-48b6-b2a7-428b0b2e3944) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your IoT Central application instead of the entire service, you'll reduce your data leakage risks. Learn more about private links at: [https://aka.ms/iotcentral-network-security-using-pe](https://aka.ms/iotcentral-network-security-using-pe). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Internet%20of%20Things/IoTCentral_EnablePrivateEndpoint_AuditDeny.json) |
|[Modify - Configure IoT Central to disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fd02e48d5-28d9-40d3-8ab8-301932a6f9cb) |Disabling the public network access property improves security by ensuring your IoT Central can only be accessed from a private endpoint. This policy disables public network access on IoT Hub resources. |Modify, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Internet%20of%20Things/IoTCentral_DisablePublicNetworkAccess_Modify.json) |
|[Public network access should be disabled for IoT Central](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fcd870362-211d-4cad-9ad9-11e5ea4ebbc1) |To improve the security of IoT Central, ensure that it isn't exposed to the public internet and can only be accessed from a private endpoint. Disable the public network access property as described in [https://aka.ms/iotcentral-restrict-public-access](https://aka.ms/iotcentral-restrict-public-access). This option disables access from any public address space outside the Azure IP range, and denies all logins that match IP or virtual network-based firewall rules. This reduces data leakage risks. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Internet%20of%20Things/IoTCentral_DisablePublicNetworkAccess_AuditDeny.json) |
