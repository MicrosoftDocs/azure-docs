|[Azure SignalR Service should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F21a9766a-82a5-4747-abb5-650b6dbba6d0) |To improve the security of Azure SignalR Service resource, ensure that it isn't exposed to the public internet and can only be accessed from a private endpoint. Disable the public network access property as described in [https://aka.ms/asrs/networkacls](https://aka.ms/asrs/networkacls). This option disables access from any public address space outside the Azure IP range, and denies all logins that match IP or virtual network-based firewall rules. This reduces data leakage risks. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/SignalR/SignalR_PublicNetworkAccessDisabled_AuditDeny.json) |
