|[Azure SignalR Service should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F21a9766a-82a5-4747-abb5-650b6dbba6d0) |To improve the security of Azure SignalR Service resource, ensure that it isn't exposed to the public internet and can only be accessed from a private endpoint. Disable the public network access property as described in [https://aka.ms/asrs/networkacls](../../../../articles/azure-signalr/howto-network-access-control.md). This option disables access from any public address space outside the Azure IP range, and denies all logins that match IP or virtual network-based firewall rules. This reduces data leakage risks. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/SignalR/SignalR_PublicNetworkAccessDisabled_AuditDeny.json) |
|[Azure SignalR Service should use a Private Link enabled SKU](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F464a1620-21b5-448d-8ce6-d4ac6d1bc49a) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination which protect your resources against public data leakage risks. The policy limits you to Private Link enabled SKUs for Azure SignalR Service.

The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your Azure SignalR Service resource instead of the entire service, you'll reduce your data leakage risks.
