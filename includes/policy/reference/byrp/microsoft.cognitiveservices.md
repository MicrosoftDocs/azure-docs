|[Azure AI Services resources should encrypt data at rest with a customer-managed key (CMK)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F67121cc7-ff39-4ab8-b7e3-95b84dab487d) |Using customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest provides more control over the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. This is particularly relevant for organizations with related compliance requirements. This is not assessed by default and should only be applied when required by compliance or restrictive policy requirements. If not enabled, the data will be encrypted using platform-managed keys. To implement this, update the 'Effect' parameter in the Security Policy for the applicable scope. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[2.2.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/CustomerManagedKey_Audit.json) |
|[Azure AI Services resources should have key access disabled (disable local authentication)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F71ef260a-8f18-47b7-abcb-62d0673d94dc) |Key access (local authentication) is recommended to be disabled for security. Azure OpenAI Studio, typically used in development/testing, requires key access and will not function if key access is disabled. After disabling, Microsoft Entra ID becomes the only access method, which allows maintaining minimum privilege principle and granular control.

|[Azure AI Services resources should restrict network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F037eea7a-bd0a-46c5-9a66-03aea78705d3) |By restricting network access, you can ensure that only allowed networks can access the service. This can be achieved by configuring network rules so that only applications from allowed networks can access the Azure AI service. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[3.2.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Azure%20Ai%20Services/NetworkAcls_Audit.json) |
|[Azure AI Services resources should use Azure Private Link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fd6759c02-b87f-42b7-892e-71b3f471d782) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform reduces data leakage risks by handling the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. Learn more about private links at: [https://aka.ms/AzurePrivateLink/Overview](https://aka.ms/AzurePrivateLink/Overview) |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Azure%20Ai%20Services/EnablePrivateEndpoints_Audit.json) |

This identity is used by this Cognitive service account to communicate with other Azure services, like Azure Key Vault, in a secure way without you having to manage any credentials. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/ManagedIdentity_Audit.json) |
|[Cognitive Services accounts should use customer owned storage](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F46aa9b05-0e60-4eae-a88b-1e9d374fa515) |Use customer owned storage to control the data stored at rest in Cognitive Services.

This can reduce data leakage risks. Learn more at: [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800). |Disabled, Modify |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cognitive%20Services/DisablePublicNetworkAccess_Modify.json) |
