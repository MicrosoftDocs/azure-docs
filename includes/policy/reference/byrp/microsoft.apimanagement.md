|[API Management service should use a SKU that supports virtual networks](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F73ef9241-5d81-4cd4-b483-8443d1730fe5) |With supported SKUs of API Management, deploying service into a virtual network unlocks advanced API Management networking and security features which provides you greater control over your network security configuration.

|[API Management services should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fdf73bd95-24da-4a4f-96b9-4e8b94b402bd) |To improve the security of API Management services, ensure that endpoints aren't exposed to the public internet. Some public endpoints are exposed by API Management services to support user scenarios, e.g. direct access to Management API, managing configuration using Git, self-hosted gateways configuration. If any of those features are not used, corresponding endpoints should be disabled. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/API%20Management/ApiManagement_PublicEndpoint_AuditIfNotExist.json) |

These networks can then be connected to your on-premises networks using various VPN technologies, which enables access to your backend services within the network and/or on-premises. The developer portal and API gateway, can be configured to be accessible either from the Internet or only within the virtual network. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/API%20Management/ApiManagement_VNETEnabled_Audit.json) |
