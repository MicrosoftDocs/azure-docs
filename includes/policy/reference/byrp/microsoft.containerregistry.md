|---|---|---|---|
|[\[Preview\]: Container Registry should be Zone Redundant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F9d2b0a20-57d6-474c-9d12-44a4a20999c6) |Container Registry can be configured to be Zone Redundant or not. When the zoneRedundancy property for a Container Registry is set to 'Disabled', it means the registry is not Zone Redundant. Enforcing this policy helps ensure that your Container Registry is appropriately configured for zone resilience, reducing the risk of downtime during zone outages. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/ContainerRegistry_registries_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |

By default, the data is encrypted at rest with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management.

Data cannot be moved out of the registry via 'acr import' or via 'acr transfer'. In order to disable exports, public network access must be disabled. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/acr/export-policy](https://aka.ms/acr/export-policy). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_ExportPolicy_AuditDeny.json) |

The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your container registries instead of the entire service, data leakage risks are reduced.

To protect your registries from potential threats, allow access from only specific private endpoints, public IP addresses or address ranges. If your registry doesn't have network rules configured, it will appear in the unhealthy resources.
