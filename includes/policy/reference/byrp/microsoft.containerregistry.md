|---|---|---|---|
|[\[Preview\]: Container Registry should use a virtual network service endpoint](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fc4857be7-912a-4c75-87e6-e30292bcdf78) |This policy audits any Container Registry not configured to use a virtual network service endpoint. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Network/VirtualNetworkServiceEndpoint_ContainerRegistry_Audit.json) |

Disabling local authentication methods like admin user, repository scoped access tokens and anonymous pull improves security by ensuring that container registries exclusively require Azure Active Directory identities for authentication. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/acr/authentication](https://aka.ms/acr/authentication). |Modify, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_AnonymousPullDisabled_Modify.json) |

Only Azure Container Registry (ACR) audience tokens will be used for authentication. This will ensure only tokens meant for usage on the registry can be used for authentication. Disabling ARM audience tokens does not affect admin user's or scoped access tokens' authentication.

By default, the data is encrypted at rest with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management.

Data cannot be moved out of the registry via 'acr import' or via 'acr transfer'. In order to disable exports, public network access must be disabled. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/acr/export-policy](https://aka.ms/acr/export-policy). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_ExportPolicy_AuditDeny.json) |

The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your container registries instead of the entire service, data leakage risks are reduced.

To protect your registries from potential threats, allow access from only specific private endpoints, public IP addresses or address ranges. If your registry doesn't have network rules configured, it will appear in the unhealthy resources.
