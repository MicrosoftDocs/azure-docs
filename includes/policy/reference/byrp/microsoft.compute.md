A system-assigned managed identity is a prerequisite for all Azure Monitor assignments and must be added to machines before using any Azure Monitor extension. Target virtual machines must be in a supported location. |modify |[1.2.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Monitoring/AzureMonitoring_AddSystemIdentity_Prerequisite.json) |
