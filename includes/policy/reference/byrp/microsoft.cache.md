|[Azure Cache for Redis should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F470baccb-7e51-4549-8b1a-3e5be069f663) |Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that the Azure Cache for Redis isn't exposed on the public internet. You can limit exposure of your Azure Cache for Redis by creating private endpoints instead. Learn more at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-private-link](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-private-link). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cache/RedisCache_PublicNetworkAccess_AuditDeny.json) |
|[Azure Cache for Redis should reside within a virtual network](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F7d092e0a-7acd-40d2-a975-dca21cae48c4) |Azure Virtual Network deployment provides enhanced security and isolation for your Azure Cache for Redis, as well as subnets, access control policies, and other features to further restrict access.When an Azure Cache for Redis instance is configured with a virtual network, it is not publicly addressable and can only be accessed from virtual machines and applications within the virtual network. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.3](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cache/RedisCache_CacheInVnet_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Cache for Redis should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F7803067c-7d34-46e3-8c79-0ca68fc4036d) |Private endpoints lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. By mapping private endpoints to your Azure Cache for Redis instances, data leakage risks are reduced. Learn more at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-private-link](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-private-link). |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cache/RedisCache_PrivateEndpoint_AuditIfNotExists.json) |
|[Configure Azure Cache for Redis to disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F30b3dfa5-a70d-4c8e-bed6-0083858f663d) |Disable public network access for your Azure Cache for Redis resource so that it's not accessible over the public internet. This helps protect the cache against data leakage risks. |Modify, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cache/RedisCache_PublicNetworkAccess_Modify.json) |
|[Only secure connections to your Azure Cache for Redis should be enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F22bee202-a82f-4305-9a2a-6d7f44d4dedb) |Audit enabling of only connections via SSL to Azure Cache for Redis. Use of secure connections ensures authentication between the server and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Cache/RedisCache_AuditSSLPort_Audit.json) |
