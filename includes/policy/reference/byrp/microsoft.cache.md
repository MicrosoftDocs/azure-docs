|[\[Preview\]: Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise & Flash should be Zone Redundant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F408934a8-941a-4c1e-ba88-dd035d9688f4) |Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise & Flash can be configured to be Zone Redundant or not. Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise & Flash instances with fewer than 3 entries in their zones array are not Zone Redundant. This policy identifies Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise & Flash instances lacking the redundancy needed to withstand a zone outage. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/Cache_redisEnterprise_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |

|[Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise should use customer-managed keys for encrypting disk data](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F09aa11bb-87ec-409f-bf0b-49b7c1561a87) |Use customer-managed keys (CMK) to manage the encryption at rest of your on-disk data. By default, customer data is encrypted with platform-managed keys (PMK), but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management.

By mapping private endpoints to your Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise instances, data leakage risks are reduced.

You can limit exposure of your Azure Cache for Redis by creating private endpoints instead.
