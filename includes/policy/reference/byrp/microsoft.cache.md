|[\[Preview\]: Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise & Flash should be Zone Redundant](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F408934a8-941a-4c1e-ba88-dd035d9688f4) |Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise & Flash can be configured to be Zone Redundant or not. Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise & Flash instances with fewer than 3 entries in their zones array are not Zone Redundant. This policy identifies Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise & Flash instances lacking the redundancy needed to withstand a zone outage. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Resilience/Cache_redisEnterprise_ZoneRedundant_Audit.json) |

You can limit exposure of your Azure Cache for Redis by creating private endpoints instead.
