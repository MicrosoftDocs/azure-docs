### Prepare your environment for the Azure CLI

- Use [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart) using the bash environment.

- If you prefer, do a [local install](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) of the Azure CLI to run CLI reference commands.
    
    - If you're using a local install, sign in with Azure CLI by using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command.  Follow the steps displayed in your terminal to complete the authentication process.  See [Sign in with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli) for additional sign-in options.
   
   - When prompted, install Azure CLI extensions on first use.  Learn more about extensions in [Use extensions with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).
   
   - Run [az version](/cli/azure/reference-index?#az_version) to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run [az upgrade](/cli/azure/reference-index?#az_upgrade).
