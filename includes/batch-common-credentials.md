## Get account credentials

For this example, you need to provide credentials for your Batch and Storage accounts. A straightforward way to get the necessary credentials is in the Azure portal. (You can also get these credentials using the Azure APIs or command-line tools.)

1. Select **All services** > **Batch accounts**, and then select the name of your Batch account.

2. To see the Batch credentials, select **Keys**. Copy the values of **Batch account**, **URL**, and **Primary access key** to a text editor.

3. To see the Storage account name and keys, select **Storage account**. Copy the values of **Storage account name** and **Key1** to a text editor.
