There are **64** recommendations in this category.

|Recommendation |Description |Severity |
|---|---|---|
|All advanced threat protection types should be enabled in SQL managed instance advanced data security settings |It is recommended to enable all advanced threat protection types on your SQL managed instances.

|All advanced threat protection types should be enabled in SQL server advanced data security settings |It is recommended to enable all advanced threat protection types on your SQL servers. Enabling all types protects against SQL injection, database vulnerabilities, and any other anomalous activities.<br />(No related policy) |Medium |

Azure AD authentication enables simplified permission management and centralized identity management of database users and other Microsoft services.<br />(Related policy: [An Azure Active Directory administrator should be provisioned for SQL servers](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f1f314764-cb73-4fc9-b863-8eca98ac36e9)) |High |
|API Management services should use a virtual network |Azure Virtual Network deployment provides enhanced security, isolation and allows you to place your API Management service in a non-internet routable network that you control access to. These networks can then be connected to your on-premises networks using various VPN technologies, which enables access to your backend services within the network and/or on-premises. The developer portal and API gateway, can be configured to be accessible either from the Internet or only within the virtual network.<br />(Related policy: [API Management services should use a virtual network](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fef619a2c-cc4d-4d03-b2ba-8c94a834d85b)) |Medium |
