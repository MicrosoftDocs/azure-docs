|[\[Enable if required\] Azure Cosmos DB accounts should use customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/814df446-7128-eff0-9177-fa52ac035b74) |*** <br> Recommendations to use customer-managed keys for encryption of data at rest are not assessed by default, but are available to enable for applicable scenarios. Data is encrypted automatically using platform-managed keys, so the use of customer-managed keys should only be applied when obligated by compliance or restrictive policy requirements. <br> To enable this recommendation, navigate to your Security Policy for the applicable scope, and update the *Effect* parameter for the corresponding policy to audit or enforce the use of customer-managed keys. For more details, see <a href='/azure/security-center/tutorial-security-policy'>this guidance.</a> <br>*** <br> Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of your Azure Cosmos DB.
