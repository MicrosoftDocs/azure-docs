* **PolicyBased:** PolicyBased VPNs were previously called static routing gateways in the classic deployment model. Policy-based VPNs encrypt and direct packets through IPsec tunnels based on the IPsec policies configured with the combinations of address prefixes between your on-premises network and the Azure VNet. The policy (or traffic selector) is usually defined as an access list in the VPN device configuration. The value for a PolicyBased VPN type is *PolicyBased*. When using a PolicyBased VPN, keep in mind the following limitations:
  
  * PolicyBased VPNs can **only** be used on the Basic gateway SKU. This VPN type isn't compatible with other gateway SKUs.
  * You can have only 1 tunnel when using a PolicyBased VPN.
  * You can only use PolicyBased VPNs for S2S connections, and only for certain configurations. Most VPN Gateway configurations require a RouteBased VPN.
* **RouteBased**: RouteBased VPNs were previously called dynamic routing gateways in the classic deployment model. RouteBased VPNs use "routes" in the IP forwarding or routing table to direct packets into their corresponding tunnel interfaces. The tunnel interfaces then encrypt or decrypt the packets in and out of the tunnels. The policy (or traffic selector) for RouteBased VPNs are configured as any-to-any (or wild cards). The value for a RouteBased VPN type is *RouteBased*.
