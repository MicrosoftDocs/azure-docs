## Launch Azure Cloud Shell

The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account. 

To open the Cloud Shell, just select **Try it** from the upper right corner of a code block. You can also launch Cloud Shell in a separate browser tab by going to [https://shell.azure.com/powershell](https://shell.azure.com/powershell). Select **Copy** to copy the blocks of code, paste it into the Cloud Shell, and press enter to run it.


## Get the managed image

You can see a list of images that are available in a resource group using [Get-AzImage](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azimage). Once you know the image name and what resource group it is in, you can use `Get-AzImage` again to get the image object and store it in a variable to use later. This example gets an image named *myImage* from the "myResourceGroup" resource group and assigns it to the variable *$managedImage*. 

```azurepowershell-interactive
$managedImage = Get-AzImage `
   -ImageName myImage `
   -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
```

## Create an image gallery 

An image gallery is the primary resource used for enabling image sharing. Allowed characters for Gallery name are uppercase or lowercase letters, digits, dots, and periods. The gallery name cannot contain dashes. Gallery names must be unique within your subscription. 

Create an image gallery using [New-AzGallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azgallery). The following example creates a gallery named *myGallery* in the *myGalleryRG* resource group.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$resourceGroup = New-AzResourceGroup `
   -Name 'myGalleryRG' `
   -Location 'West Central US'	
$gallery = New-AzGallery `
   -GalleryName 'myGallery' `
   -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup.ResourceGroupName `
   -Location $resourceGroup.Location `
   -Description 'Shared Image Gallery for my organization'	
```
   
## Create an image definition 

Image definitions create a logical grouping for images. They are used to manage information about the image versions that are created within them. Image definition names can be made up of uppercase or lowercase letters, digits, dots, dashes and periods. For more information about the values you can specify for an image definition, see [Image definitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/shared-image-galleries#image-definitions).

Create the image definition using [New-AzGalleryImageDefinition](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azgalleryimageversion). In this example, the gallery image is named *myGalleryImage*.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$galleryImage = New-AzGalleryImageDefinition `
   -GalleryName $gallery.Name `
   -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup.ResourceGroupName `
   -Location $gallery.Location `
   -Name 'myImageDefinition' `
   -OsState generalized `
   -OsType Windows `
   -Publisher 'myPublisher' `
   -Offer 'myOffer' `
   -Sku 'mySKU'
```


## Create an image version

Create an image version from a managed image using [New-AzGalleryImageVersion](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azgalleryimageversion). 

Allowed characters for image version are numbers and periods. Numbers must be within the range of a 32-bit integer. Format: *MajorVersion*.*MinorVersion*.*Patch*.

In this example, the image version is *1.0.0* and it's replicated to both *West Central US* and *South Central US* datacenters. When choosing target regions for replication, remember that you also have to include the *source* region as a target for replication.


```azurepowershell-interactive
$region1 = @{Name='South Central US';ReplicaCount=1}
$region2 = @{Name='West Central US';ReplicaCount=2}
$targetRegions = @($region1,$region2)
$job = $imageVersion = New-AzGalleryImageVersion `
   -GalleryImageDefinitionName $galleryImage.Name `
   -GalleryImageVersionName '1.0.0' `
   -GalleryName $gallery.Name `
   -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup.ResourceGroupName `
   -Location $resourceGroup.Location `
   -TargetRegion $targetRegions  `
   -Source $managedImage.Id.ToString() `
   -PublishingProfileEndOfLifeDate '2020-01-01' `
   -asJob 
```

It can take a while to replicate the image to all of the target regions, so we have created a job so we can track the progress. To see the progress of the job, type `$job.State`.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$job.State
```
