The following example policy, when added to the `<inbound>` policy section, checks the value of the audience claim in an access token obtained from Microsoft Entra ID that is presented in the Authorization header. It returns an error message if the token is not valid. Configure this policy at a policy scope that's appropriate for your scenario.

* In the `openid-config` URL, the `aad-tenant` is the tenant ID in Microsoft Entra ID. Find this value in the Azure portal, for example, on the **Overview** page of your Microsoft Entra resource. The example shown assumes a single-tenant Microsoft Entra app and a v2 configuration endpoint.
* The value of the `claim` is the client ID of the backend-app you registered in Microsoft Entra ID.


```xml
<validate-jwt header-name="Authorization" failed-validation-httpcode="401" failed-validation-error-message="Unauthorized. Access token is missing or invalid.">
    <openid-config url="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{aad-tenant}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration" />
    <audiences>
        <audience>{audience-value - (ex:api://guid)}</audience>
    </audiences>
    <issuers>
        <issuer>{issuer-value - (ex: https://sts.windows.net/{tenant id}/)}</issuer>
    </issuers>
    <required-claims>
        <claim name="aud">
            <value>{backend-app-client-id}</value>
        </claim>
    </required-claims>
</validate-jwt>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The preceding `openid-config` URL corresponds to the v2 endpoint. For the v1 `openid-config` endpoint, use `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{aad-tenant}/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

For information on how to configure policies, see [Set or edit policies](../articles/api-management/set-edit-policies.md). Refer to the [validate-jwt](../articles/api-management/validate-jwt-policy.md) reference for more customization on JWT validations. To validate a JWT that was provided by the Microsoft Entra service, API Management also provides the [`validate-azure-ad-token`](../articles/api-management/validate-azure-ad-token-policy.md) policy.
