Here's an example of what the embedded viewer might look like in an independent application:

The 3D visualization component library is available in GitHub, in the [iot-cardboard-js](https://github.com/microsoft/iot-cardboard-js) repository. This library is an open source React component library for creating internet of things (IoT) web experiences.

For instructions on how to use the library to embed 3D experiences into custom applications, see the repository's wiki, [Embedding 3D Scenes](https://github.com/microsoft/iot-cardboard-js/wiki/Embedding-3D-Scenes). You can also use the [CRA IoT Cardboard](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cra-template-iot-cardboard-js) sample, which deploys a Create React App template for the library, to get started building a custom app with an embedded viewer.
