The steps and examples in this article use Azure PowerShell Az modules. To install the Az modules locally on your computer, see [Install Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). To learn more about the new Az module, see [Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az). PowerShell cmdlets are updated frequently. If you are not running the latest version, the values specified in the instructions may fail. To find the installed versions of PowerShell on your system, use the `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` cmdlet.
