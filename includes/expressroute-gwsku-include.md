When you create a virtual network gateway, you need to specify the gateway SKU that you want to use. When the virtual network gateway is created, it is built as virtual hardware. When you select a higher gateway SKU, more processing power is allocated to the gateway in order to route traffic and, in the case of VPN Gateway, process VPN encryption.

ExpressRoute virtual network gateways can use the following SKUs: 

- Standard
