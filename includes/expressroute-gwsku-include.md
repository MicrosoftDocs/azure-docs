When you create a virtual network gateway, you need to specify the gateway SKU that you want to use. When you select a higher gateway SKU, more CPUs and network bandwidth are allocated to the gateway. As a result, the gateway can support higher network throughput to the virtual network.

ExpressRoute virtual network gateways can use the following SKUs:

* ERGwScale (preview)
* Standard
* HighPerformance
* UltraPerformance
* ErGw1Az
* ErGw2Az
* ErGw3Az
