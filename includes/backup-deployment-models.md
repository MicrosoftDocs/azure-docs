Azure Backup service has two types of vaults - the Backup vault and the Recovery Services vault.

| **Deployment** | **Portal** | **Vault** |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Classic | [Classic](https://manage.windowsazure.com) | Backup vault |
| Resource Manager(recommended) | [Azure](https://portal.azure.com) | Recovery Services vault |

> [AZURE.NOTE] Backup vaults cannot protect Resource Manager-deployed solutions. However, you can use a Recovery Services vault to protect classically-deployed servers and VMs.
