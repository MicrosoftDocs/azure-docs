The legacy (old) VPN Gateway SKUs are:

* Standard
* High Performance

When working with the legacy SKUs, consider the following:

* Active-active S2S VPN Gateway connections can be configured on the High Performance SKU only.
* VPN Gateway doesn't use the UltraPerformance gateway SKU. For information about the UltraPerformance SKU, see the [ExpressRoute](../articles/expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways.md) documentation.
