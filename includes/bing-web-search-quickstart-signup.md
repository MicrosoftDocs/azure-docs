## Create an Azure resource

Start using the Bing Web Search API by creating one of the following Azure resources:

[Bing Search v7 resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesBingSearch-v7)
   * Available through the Azure portal until you delete the resource.
   * Use the free pricing tier to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

[Multi-service resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne)
   * Available through the Azure portal until you delete the resource.  
   * Use the same key and endpoint for your applications, across multiple Azure AI services.
