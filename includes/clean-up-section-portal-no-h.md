In the preceding steps, you created Azure resources in a resource group. If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, you can delete them by deleting the resource group.
 
From the Azure portal menu or **Home** page, select **Resource groups**. Then, on the **Resource groups** page, select **myResourceGroup**.

On the **myResourceGroup** page, make sure that the listed resources are the ones you want to delete.

Select **Delete resource group**, type **myResourceGroup** in the text box to confirm, and then select **Delete**.
