A security attribute is a quality or feature of an Azure service. It contributes to the service's ability to prevent, detect, and respond to security vulnerabilities.

Security attributes are categorized as:
* Preventative
* Network segmentation
* Detection
* Support for identity and access management
* Audit trail
* Access controls (if used)
* Configuration management (if used)

In each category, we show "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether an attribute is used. For some services, we show "N/A" for an attribute that is not applicable. We might also provide a note or a link to more information about an attribute.
