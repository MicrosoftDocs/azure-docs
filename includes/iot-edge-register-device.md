Create a device identity for your simulated device so that it can communicate with your IoT hub. Since IoT Edge devices behave and can be managed differently than typical IoT devices, you declare this to be an IoT Edge device from the beginning. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your IoT hub.
1. Select **IoT Edge (preview)**.
1. Select **Add IoT Edge Device**.
1. Give your simulated device a unique device ID.
1. Select **Save** to add your device.
1. Select your new device from the list of devices.
1. Copy the value for **Connection string—primary key** and save it. You'll use this value to configure the IoT Edge runtime in the next section.
