Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that does not adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data. 

Blob storage also supports Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for enterprise big data analytics. For more information about Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, see [Introduction to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/data-lake-storage/introduction).

Blob storage is designed for:

* Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
* Storing files for distributed access.
* Streaming video and audio.
* Writing to log files.
* Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
* Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.

Users or client applications can access objects in Blob storage via HTTP/HTTPS, from anywhere in the world. Objects in Blob storage are available via URLs, the [Azure Storage REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api), [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azure.storage), [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage), or an Azure Storage client library. The storage client libraries are available for various languages, including [.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/storage/client), [Java](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/storage/client), [Node.js](http://azure.github.io/azure-storage-node), [Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/azure/), [PHP](http://azure.github.io/azure-storage-php/), and [Ruby](http://azure.github.io/azure-storage-ruby).
