> [!IMPORTANT]
> A new hosting method for running Azure Functions directly in Azure Container Apps is now available. See [Native Azure Functions Support in Azure Container Apps](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/announcing-native-azure-functions-support-in-azure-container-apps/4414039). This integration allows you to use the full features and capabilities of Azure Container Apps. You also benefit from the functions programming model and simplicity of autoscaling provided by Azure Functions. 
>
>  We recommend this approach for most new workloads. For more information, see [Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps](../articles/container-apps/functions-overview.md).
