## <a name="os-config"></a>Add IP addresses to a VM operating system

Connect and sign in to a VM you created with multiple private IP addresses. You must manually add all the private IP addresses, including the primary, that you added to the VM. Complete the following steps for your VM operating system.

### Windows Server

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>

1. Open a command prompt or PowerShell.

2. Enter **`ipconfig /all`** at the command line. You'll see the **Primary** private IP address that was assigned through DHCP.

3. Enter **`ncpa.cpl`** at the command line to open the **Network Connections** configuration.

4. Open the **Properties** for the network adapter assigned the new IP addresses.

5. Double-click **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**.

6. Select **Use the following IP address:**. Enter the following values.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **IP address:** | Enter the **Primary** private IP address. |
    | **Subnet mask:** | Enter a subnet mask based on your IP address. </br> For example, if the subnet is a **/24** subnet then the subnet mask is **255.255.255.0**. |
    | **Default gateway:** | The first IP address in the subnet. </br> If your subnet is **10.0.0.0/24**, then the gateway IP address is **10.0.0.1**. |

7. Select **Use the following DNS server addresses:**. Enter the following values.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Preferred DNS server:** | Enter your primary DNS server. </br> Enter the IP address of **168.63.129.16** to use the default Azure provided DNS. |

8. Select the **Advanced** button.

9. Select **Add**.

10. Enter the private **IP address** you added to the Azure network interface. Enter the corresponding **Subnet mask**. Select **Add**.

11. Repeat the previous steps to add any additional private IP addresses that you added to the Azure network interface.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should never manually assign the public IP address assigned to an Azure virtual machine within the virtual machine's operating system. When you manually set the IP address within the operating system, ensure that it's the same address as the private IP address assigned to the Azure network interface. Failure to assign the address correctly can cause loss of connectivity to the virtual machine. For more information, see [Change IP address settings](../articles/virtual-network/ip-services/virtual-network-network-interface-addresses.md#change-ip-address-settings).
>
For more information about private IP addresses, see [Private IP address](../articles/virtual-network/ip-services/virtual-network-network-interface-addresses.md#private).

12. Select **OK** to close the secondary IP address settings.

13. Select **OK** to close the adapter settings. Your RDP connection will re-establish.

14. Open a command prompt or PowerShell.

15. Enter **`ipconfig /all`** at the command line.

16. Verify the primary and secondary private IP addresses have been added to the configuration.

17. Ensure the primary private IP address used in windows is the same as the primary IP address of the Azure VM network interface. For more information, see [No Internet access from Azure Windows VM that has multiple IP addresses](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4040882/no-internet-access-from-azure-windows-vm-that-has-multiple-ip-addresse).

#### Validation (Windows Server)

To validate connectivity to the internet from the secondary IP configuration via the public IP, use the following command. Replace 10.1.0.5 with the secondary private IP address you added to the Azure VM network interface.

```powershell
ping -S 10.1.0.5 outlook.com
```
 
> [!NOTE]
> For secondary IP configurations, you can ping to the Internet if the configuration has a public IP address associated with it. For primary IP configurations, a public IP address is not required to ping to the Internet.

### SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE
 
<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
 
SUSE-based distributions use the <code>cloud-netconfig</code> plugin from the <code>cloud-netconfig-azure</code> package to manage additional IP addresses. No manual configuration is required on the part of the administrator. The first IP address of an interface set on the platform is assigned via DHCP. The cloud-netconfig plugin then probes the Azure Instance Metadata Service API continuously (once per minute) for additional IP addresses assigned to the interface and adds/removes them as secondary IP addresses automatically.

This plugin should be installed and enabled on new images by default.  Configuration steps for old workloads can be found here: https://www.suse.com/c/multi-nic-cloud-netconfig-ec2-azure/.

  <summary>Expand</summary>

We recommend looking at the latest documentation for your Linux distribution. 

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Ensure you're the root user. If you aren't, enter the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo -i
   ```

3. Update the configuration file of the network interface (assuming **‘eth0’**).

   * Keep the existing line item for dhcp. The primary IP address remains configured as it was previously.
   
   * Add a configuration for an additional static IP address with the following commands:

     ```bash
     cd /etc/network/interfaces.d/
     ls
     ```

     You should see a .cfg file.

4. Open the file. You should see the following lines at the end of the file:

   ```bash
   auto eth0
   iface eth0 inet dhcp
   ```

5. Add the following lines after the lines that exist in the file. Replace **`10.1.0.5`** with your private IP address and subnet mask.

   ```bash
   iface eth0 inet static
   address 10.1.0.5
   netmask 255.255.255.0
   ```
    
    To add additional private IP addresses, edit the file and add the new private IP addresses on subsequent lines:

    ```bash
    iface eth0 inet static
    address 10.1.0.5
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    iface eth0 inet static
    address 10.1.0.6
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    ```

6. Save the file by using the following command:

   ```bash
   :wq
   ```

7. Reset the network interface with the following command:

   ```bash
   ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Execute both ifdown and ifup in the same line if using a remote connection.
   >

8. Verify the IP address is added to the network interface with the following command:

   ```bash
   ip addr list eth0
   ```

   You should see the IP address you added as part of the list. Example:

    ```bash
    2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:0d:3a:04:45:16 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.1.0.5/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet 10.1.0.6/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global secondary eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet 10.1.0.4/24 brd 10.1.0.255 scope global secondary eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::20d:3aff:fe04:4516/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    ```

#### Validation (Ubuntu 14/16)

To ensure you're able to connect to the internet from your secondary IP configuration via the public IP associated with it, use the following command:

```bash
ping -I 10.1.0.5 outlook.com
```

> [!NOTE]
> For secondary IP configurations, you can only ping to the Internet if the configuration has a public IP address associated with it. For primary IP configurations, a public IP address is not required to ping to the Internet.

For Linux VMs, when attempting to validate outbound connectivity from a secondary NIC, you may need to add appropriate routes. See appropriate documentation for your Linux distribution. The following is one method to accomplish this:

```bash
echo 150 custom >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables 

ip rule add from 10.1.0.5 lookup custom
ip route add default via 10.1.0.1 dev eth2 table custom
```

- Ensure to replace:
  
  - **10.1.0.5** with the private IP address that has a public IP address associated to it
  
  - **10.1.0.1** to your default gateway
  
  - **eth2** to the name of your secondary NIC

### Ubuntu 18.04+

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>

Ubuntu 18.04 and above have changed to **`netplan`** for OS network management. We recommend looking at the latest documentation for your Linux distribution. 

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Ensure you're the root user. If you are not, enter the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo -i
    ```

3. Create a file for the second interface and open it in a text editor:

    ```bash
    vi /etc/netplan/60-static.yaml
    ```

4. Add the following lines to the file, replacing **`10.1.0.5/24`** with your IP and subnet mask:

    ```bash
    network:
        version: 2
        ethernets:
            eth0:
                addresses:
                    - 10.1.0.5/24
    ```
    To add additional private IP addresses, edit the file and add the new private IP addresses on subsequent lines:

    ```bash
    network:
        version: 2
        ethernets:
            eth0:
                addresses:
                    - 10.1.0.5/24
                    - 10.1.0.6/24
    ```

5. Save the file by using the following command:

    ```bash
    :wq
    ```

6. Test the changes with [netplan try](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/kinetic/en/man8/netplan-try.8.html) to confirm syntax:

    ```bash
    netplan try
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > `netplan try` will apply the changes temporarily and roll the changes back after 120 seconds. If there is a loss of connectivity, please wait 120 seconds, and then reconnect. At that time, the changes will have been rolled back.

7. Assuming no issues with **`netplan try`**, apply the configuration changes:

    ```bash
    netplan apply
    ```

8. Verify the IP address is added to the network interface with the following command:

    ```bash
    ip addr list eth0
    ```

    You should see the IP address you added as part of the list. Example:

    ```bash
    2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:0d:3a:04:45:16 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
