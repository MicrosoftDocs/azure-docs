> [!NOTE]
> To simplify the example, the Batch and Storage account credentials appear in clear text. In practice, we recommend that you restrict access to the credentials and refer to them in your code using environment variables or a configuration file. For examples, see the Azure Batch [code samples repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-batch-samples).
