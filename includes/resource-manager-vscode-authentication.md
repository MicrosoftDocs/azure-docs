> [!NOTE]
> The Bicep deploy command in Visual Studio Code uses the new built-in [authentication API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#authentication) for managing authentication. It doesn't use cloud profiles from [bicepconfig.json](../articles/azure-resource-manager/bicep/bicep-config-modules.md#configure-profiles-and-credentials).
> To sign in to a custom cloud, select **Manage** > **Settings** > **Extension** > **Microsoft accounts** > **Microsoft Sovereign Cloud**. At this time, multiple signed-in accounts aren't supported.
