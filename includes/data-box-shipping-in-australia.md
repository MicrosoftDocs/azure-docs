Azure datacenters in Australia have an additional security notification. All the inbound shipments must have an advanced notification. Take the following steps to ship in Australia.

1. Keep the original box used to ship the device for return shipment.
2. Make sure that the data copy to device is complete and **Prepare to ship run** is successful.
3. Power off the device and remove the cables.
4. Spool and securely place the power cord that was provided with the device in the back of the device.
5. Book a pickup online by going to [DHL Express Australia](https://mydhl.express.dhl/au/en/schedule-pickup.html#/schedule-pickup#label-reference) and selecting **Schedule a Pickup**.
    - On the DHL website, select **No** to create a shipping label. Enter the DHL Waybill number generated when completing **Prepare to ship** process.
