Always use [Azure AD security groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-manage-groups) as the assigned principal in an ACL entry. Resist the opportunity to directly assign individual users or service principals. Using this structure will allow you to add and remove users or service principals without the need to reapply ACLs to an entire directory structure. Instead, you can just add or remove users and service principals from the appropriate Azure AD security group. 

There are many different ways to set up groups. For example, imagine that you have a directory named **/logs** which holds log data that is generated by your server. Azure Data Factory (ADF) ingests data into that folder. Specific users from the service engineering team will upload logs and manage other users of this folder, and various Databricks clusters will analyze logs from that folder. 

To enable these activities, you could create a `LogsWriter` group and a `LogsReader` group. Then, you could assign permissions as follows:

- Add the `LogsWriter` group to the ACL of the **/logs** directory with `rwx` permissions.
- Add the `LogsReader` group to the ACL of the **/logs** directory with `r-x` permissions.
- Add the service principal object or Managed Service Identity (MSI) for ADF to the `LogsWriters` group.
- Add users in the service engineering team to the `LogsWriter` group.
- Add the service principal object or MSI for Databricks to the `LogsReader` group.
