Get the following information about the custom location from your cluster administrator (see [Create a custom location](../articles/app-service/manage-create-arc-environment.md#create-a-custom-location)).

```azurecli-interactive
customLocationGroup="<resource-group-containing-custom-location>"
customLocationName="<name-of-custom-location>"
```

Get the custom location ID for the next step.

```azurecli-interactive
customLocationId=$(az customlocation show \
    --resource-group $customLocationGroup \
    --name $customLocationName \
    --query id \
    --output tsv)
```
