## Prerequisite: Install the Azure PowerShell module

To perform the steps in this article, you need to [install and configure the Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs). Be sure to complete all of the instructions. After the installation is finished, sign in to Azure and select your subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> You need an Azure account to complete these steps. If you don't have an Azure account, you can sign up for a [free trial](../articles/active-directory/fundamentals/sign-up-organization.md).
