If firewall rules are set on the storage account for your Data Box, you might not be able to access copy logs from the Azure portal by using **COPY LOG PATH** on the **Overview** pane. To access the logs, either modify the storage firewall settings to allow the current system, or use a system which is in the firewall network.
