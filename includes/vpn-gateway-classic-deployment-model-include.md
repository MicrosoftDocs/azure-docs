> [!NOTE]
> This article is written for the classic (legacy) deployment model. We recommend that you use the latest Azure deployment model instead. The Resource Manager deployment model is the latest deployment model and offers more options and feature compatibility than the classic deployment model. To understand the difference between these two deployment models, see [Understanding deployment models and the state of your resources](../articles/azure-resource-manager/management/deployment-models.md).
