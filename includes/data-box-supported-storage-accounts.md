Here's a list of the supported storage accounts and storage types for a Data Box device. For a complete list of all capabilities for all types of storage accounts, see [Types of storage accounts](../articles/storage/common/storage-account-overview.md#types-of-storage-accounts).

#### Supported storage accounts for imports

For import orders, following table shows the supported storage accounts.

| **Storage account / Supported storage types** | **Block blob** |**Page blob**<sup>1</sup> |**Azure files** |**Supported access tiers**|
| --- | --- | -- | -- | -- |
| Classic Standard | Y | Y | Y |
| General-purpose v1 Standard  | Y | Y | Y | Hot, Cool |

| Azure Premium FileStorage |  |  | Y |  |  
| Blob storage Standard | Y | | | Hot, Cool |
| Block Blob storage Premium |Y | | | Hot, Cool |


<sup>1</sup> *Data uploaded to page blobs must be 512 bytes aligned such as VHDs.*

<sup>2</sup> *Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is supported for imports but not for exports.*


#### Supported storage accounts for exports

For export orders, following table shows the supported storage accounts.

| **Storage account / Supported storage types** | **Block blob** |**Page blob*** |**Azure files** |**Supported access tiers**|
| --- | --- | -- | -- | -- |
| Classic Standard | Y | Y | Y | |
| General-purpose v1 Standard  | Y | Y | Y | Hot, Cool |
| General-purpose v1 Premium  |  | Y| | |

#### Caveats for storage accounts

- For General-purpose accounts:
  - For import orders, Data Box doesn't support Queue, Table, and Disk storage types.
  - For export orders, Data Box doesn't support Queue, Table, Disk, and Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage types.
- Data Box doesn't support append blobs for Blob Storage and Block Blob Storage accounts.
- Data uploaded to page blobs must be 512 bytes aligned such as VHDs.
- For exports:
  - A maximum of 80 TB can be exported.
  - File history and blob snapshots aren't exported.
  - Archive blobs aren't supported for export. Rehydrate the blobs in archive tier before exporting. For more information, see [Rehydrate an archived blob to an online tier](../articles/storage/blobs/archive-rehydrate-overview.md).
  - Data Box only supports block blobs with Azure Data Lake Gen2 Storage accounts. Page blobs are not allowed and should not be uploaded over REST.  If page blobs are uploaded over REST, these blobs would fail when data is uploaded to Azure.
