- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

- This article requires the latest version (2.35.0 or later) of the Azure CLI. See [How to install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). If you're using the Bash environment in Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed. If you plan to run the commands locally instead of in Azure Cloud Shell, be sure to run them with administrative privileges. For more information, see [Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/get-started).

- You'll need the Kubernetes command-line client, `kubectl`. It's already installed if you're using Azure Cloud Shell, or you can install it locally by running the `az aks install-cli` command.

- If you haven't already installed Azure Container Storage, follow the instructions in [Use Azure Container Storage with Azure Kubernetes Service](../articles/storage/container-storage/container-storage-aks-quickstart.md).

- Check if your target region is supported in [Azure Container Storage regions](../articles/storage/container-storage/container-storage-introduction.md#regional-availability).
