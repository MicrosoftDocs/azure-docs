In API Management, you can add a GraphQL API in one of two models: pass-through to an existing GraphQL endpoint, or import a GraphQL schema and create a synthetic GraphQL API with custom field resolvers. For more information, see the [GraphQL overview](../articles/api-management/graphql-apis-overview.md).
