> Support for managing HDInsight resources using Azure Service Manager (ASM) through Azure PowerShell, the Azure CLI, and the HDInsight .NET SDK is **deprecated**, and was removed on January 1, 2017. The steps in this document use the new Azure PowerShell cmdlets, Azure CLI commands, and .NET SDK that work with Azure Resource Manager.
> 
> Please follow the steps in the [Install and Configure Azure CLI](../articles/cli-install-nodejs.md) and [Install and Configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs) to install the latest version of Azure PowerShell and the Azure CLI. To install the latest version of the HDInsight .NET SDK, use the information provided on the [Microsoft Azure HDInsight .NET SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Management.HDInsight/) NuGet page. If you have existing scripts or applications that need to be modified to use the new cmdlets, new CLI commands, or .NET SDK, see [Migrating to Azure Resource Manager-based development tools for HDInsight clusters](../articles/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-development-using-azure-resource-manager.md) for more information.
