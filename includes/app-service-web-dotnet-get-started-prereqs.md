* The tutorial assumes you have worked with ASP.NET MVC. If you need an introduction, see [Getting Started with ASP.NET MVC 5](http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started).

* You need an Azure account. You can [open a free Azure account](/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) or [Activate Visual Studio subscriber benefits](/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). If you want to get started with Azure App Service before you sign up for an Azure account, go to [Try App Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523751). There, you can immediately create a short-lived starter  app in App Service — no credit card required, and no commitments.

The tutorial is written for Visual Studio 2015 with the [Azure SDK for .NET](../articles/dotnet-sdk.md) 2.8.2 or later. [Download the latest Azure SDK for Visual Studio 2015 here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=518003). Visual Studio is automatically installed with the SDK if you don't already have it.

If you have Visual Studio 2013, you can [download the latest Azure SDK for Visual Studio 2013](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=324322). Some screens may look different from the illustrations.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Depending on how many of the SDK dependencies you already have on your machine, installing the SDK could take a long time, from several minutes to a half hour or more.
