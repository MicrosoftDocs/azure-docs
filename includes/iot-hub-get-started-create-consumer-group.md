## Add a consumer group to your IoT hub

[Consumer groups](../articles/event-hubs/event-hubs-features.md#event-consumers) provide independent views into the event stream that enable apps and Azure services to independently consume data from the same Event Hub endpoint. In this section, you add a consumer group to your IoT hub's built-in endpoint that is used later in this tutorial to pull data from the endpoint.

To add a consumer group to your IoT hub, follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), open your IoT hub.

1. On the left pane, select **Built-in endpoints**. Enter a name for your new consumer group in the text box under **Consumer groups**.

1. Click anywhere outside the text box to save the consumer group.
