    > In this example we created a NAT gateway to provide outbound Internet access. The outbound rules tab in the configuration is bypassed as it's optional and isn't needed with the NAT gateway. For more information on Azure NAT gateway, see [What is Azure Virtual Network NAT?](/azure/nat-gateway/nat-overview)
    > For more information about outbound connections in Azure, see [Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections).
