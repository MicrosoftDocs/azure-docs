>[!NOTE]
> Digital twins in Azure Digital Twins are different from [**device twins** in IoT Hub](../articles/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins.md). IoT Hub device twins often focus on describing the aspects and capabilities of a device itself, while twins in Azure Digital Twins are more conceptual representations that can store user-defined insights about a device or many related devices.
>
>
> IoT Hub device twins can be connected to Azure Digital Twins as part of an [end-to-end solution](../articles/digital-twins/tutorial-end-to-end.md) that represents devices across services.
