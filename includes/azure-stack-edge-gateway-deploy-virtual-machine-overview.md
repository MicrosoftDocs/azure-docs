You can create and manage virtual machines (VMs) on an Azure Stack Edge device using APIs. These APIs are standard Azure Resource Manager APIs called using the local Azure Stack Edge endpoint. The Azure Resource Manager APIs provide a consistent management layer that in this case enables you to create, update, and delete VMs in a local subscription that exists on the device. You can connect to the Azure Resource Manager running on Azure Stack Edge via Azure PowerShell cmdlets.
