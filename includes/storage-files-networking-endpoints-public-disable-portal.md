Navigate to the storage account for which you would like to restrict all access to the public endpoint. In the table of contents for the storage account, select **Networking**.

At the top of the page, select the **Enabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses** radio button. This will un-hide a number of settings for controlling the restriction of the public endpoint. Select **Allow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage account** to allow trusted first party Microsoft services such as Azure File Sync to access the storage account.
