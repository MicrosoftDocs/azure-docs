It is either not available or in PREVIEW for other storage account performance tiers, resource types, and attributes. For complete feature status information of ABAC for Azure Storage, see [Status of condition features in Azure Storage](../articles/storage/blobs/storage-auth-abac.md#status-of-condition-features-in-azure-storage).
