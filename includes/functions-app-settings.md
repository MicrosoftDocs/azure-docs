There are several ways that you can add, update, and delete function app settings:

+ [In the Azure portal.](../articles/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings)
+ [By using the Azure CLI.](/cli/azure/functionapp/config/appsettings#az_functionapp_config_appsettings_set)
+ [By using Azure PowerShell.](/powershell/module/az.functions/update-azfunctionappsetting)

Changes to function app settings require your function app to be restarted.
