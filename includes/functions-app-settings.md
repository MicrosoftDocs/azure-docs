There are several ways that you can add, update, and delete function app settings:

- [In the Azure portal](../articles/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings)
- [By using the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/functionapp/config/appsettings#az-functionapp-config-appsettings-set)
- [By using Azure PowerShell](/powershell/module/az.functions/update-azfunctionappsetting)

Changes to function app settings require your function app to be restarted.
