You can verify that your connection succeeded by using the `Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection` cmdlet, with or without `-Debug`. 

1. Use the following cmdlet example, configuring the values to match your own. If prompted, select 'A' in order to run 'All'. In the example, `-Name` refers to the name of the connection that you created and want to test.

		Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name MyGWConnection -ResourceGroupName MyRG

2. After the cmdlet has finished, view the values. In the example below, the connection status shows as 'Connected' and you can see ingress and egress bytes.
