* If you want to continue using the Azure Digital Twins instance you set up in this article, but clear out some or all of its models, twins, and relationships, you can use the [az dt](/cli/azure/dt) CLI commands in an [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) window to delete the elements you want to remove.
