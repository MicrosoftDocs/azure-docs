## Get Copilot assistance

You can get AI assistance from Copilot to create and edit your API Management policy definitions. You can use Copilot to create and update policies that match your specific requirements without needing to know the XML syntax. You can also get explanations of existing policies. And Copilot can help you translate policies that you might have configured in other API management solutions.

* [Microsoft Copilot in Azure](/azure/copilot/author-api-management-policies?toc=%2Fazure%2Fapi-management%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fapi-management%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json) provides policy authoring assistance with natural language prompts in the Azure portal. You can author policies in the API Management policy editor and ask Copilot to explain policy sections.
* [GitHub Copilot for Azure in Visual Studio Code](../articles/api-management/api-management-debug-policies.md) provides policy authoring assistance in Visual Studio Code, and you can use the [Azure API Management Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-apimanagement&ssr=false#overview) to speed up policy configuration. You can prompt Copilot Chat or Copilot Edits with natural language to create and refine policy definitions in place.

Example prompt:

```copilot-prompt
Generate a policy that adds an Authorization header to the request with a Bearer token.
```
 
Copilot is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible. For more information, see [Copilot general use FAQs](https://aka.ms/copilot-general-use-faqs).
