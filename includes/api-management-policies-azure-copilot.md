## Get assistance creating policies using Microsoft Copilot for Azure (preview)


[Microsoft Copilot for Azure](../articles/copilot/overview.md) (preview) provides policy authoring capabilities for Azure API Management. Use Copilot for Azure in the context of API Management's policy editor to create policies that match your specific requirements without knowing the syntax, or have already configured policies explained to you. 

You can prompt Copilot for Azure to generate policy definitions, then copy the results into the policy editor and make any necessary adjustments. Ask questions to gain insights into different options, modify the provided policy, or clarify the policy you already have.
