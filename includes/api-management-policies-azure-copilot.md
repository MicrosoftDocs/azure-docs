## Get Copilot assistance

Get AI assistance from Copilot to create and edit your API Management policy definitions. With Copilot, create and update policies that match your specific requirements without needing to know the XML syntax, and get explanations of existing policies. Copilot can also help you translate policies you might have configured in other API management solutions.

* [Microsoft Copilot in Azure](/azure/copilot/author-api-management-policies?toc=%2Fazure%2Fapi-management%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fapi-management%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json) - Offers policy authoring assistance with natural language prompts in the Azure portal. Author policies in API Management's policy editor, and ask Copilot to explain policy sections.
* [GitHub Copilot for Azure in VS Code](../articles/api-management/api-management-debug-policies.md) - Provides policy authoring assistance in Visual Studio Code, accelerating policy configuration when you use the [Azure API Management Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-apimanagement&ssr=false#overview). Prompt Copilot Chat or Copilot Edits (preview) with natural language to create and refine policy definitions in place.

Example prompt:

```copilot-prompt
Generate a policy that adds an Authorization header to the request with a Bearer token.
```
 
Copilot is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible. For more information, see [Copilot general use FAQs](https://aka.ms/copilot-general-use-faqs).
