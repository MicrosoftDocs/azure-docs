## Add a user journey 

At this point, the identity provider has been set up, but it's not yet available in any of the sign-in pages. If you don't have your own custom user journey, create a duplicate of an existing template user journey, otherwise continue to the next step. 

1. Open the *TrustFrameworkBase.xml* file from the starter pack.
1. Find and copy the entire contents of the **UserJourney** element that includes `Id="SignUpOrSignIn"`.
1. Open the *TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml* and find the **UserJourneys** element. If the element doesn't exist, add one.
1. Paste the entire content of the **UserJourney** element that you copied as a child of the **UserJourneys** element.
1. Rename the Id of the user journey. For example, `Id="CustomSignUpSignIn"`.

## Add the identity provider to a user journey 

Now that you have a user journey, add the new identity provider to the user journey. You first add a sign-in button, then link the button to an action. The action is the technical profile you created earlier.

1. Find the orchestration step element that includes `Type="CombinedSignInAndSignUp"`, or `Type="ClaimsProviderSelection"` in the user journey. It's usually the first orchestration step. The **ClaimsProviderSelections** element contains a list of identity providers that a user can sign in with. The order of the elements controls the order of the sign-in buttons presented to the user. Add a **ClaimsProviderSelection** XML element. Set the value of **TargetClaimsExchangeId** to a friendly name.

1. In the next orchestration step, add a **ClaimsExchange** element. Set the **Id** to the value of the target claims exchange Id. Update the value of **TechnicalProfileReferenceId** to the Id of the technical profile you created earlier.

The following XML demonstrates the first two orchestration steps of a user journey with the identity provider:
