### Prerequisites

- A [Salesforce](https://salesforce.com) account  


Before you can use your Salesforce account in a logic app, you must authorize the logic app to connect to your Salesforce account.Fortunately, you can do this easily from within your logic app on the Azure Portal.  

Here are the steps to authorize your logic app to connect to your Salesforce account:  
1. To create a connection to Salesforce, in the logic app designer, select **Show Microsoft managed APIs** in the drop down list then enter *Salesforce* in the search box. Select the trigger or action you'll like to use:

2. If you haven't created any connections to Salesforce before, you'll get prompted to provide your Salesforce credentials. These credentials will be used to authorize your logic app to connect to, and access your Salesforce account's data:

3. Provide your Salesforce user name and password to authorize your logic app:
