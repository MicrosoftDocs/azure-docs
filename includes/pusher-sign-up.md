Your first step is to create a new account to use for the tutorial. You can use the FREE Sandbox plan, it's perfect for this tutorial.

### To sign up for a Pusher account

3. Click **Store**.
   
    ![pusher-store][pusher-store]
4. In the **Choose an Add-on** dialog, select **Pusher** and click the right arrow.
5. In the **Personalize Add-on** dialog select the **Pusher** plan you want to sign up for.
6. Enter a name to identify your **Pusher** service in your Azure settings, or use the default value of **Pusher**. Names must be between 1 and 100 characters in length and contain only alphanumeric characters, dashes, dots, and underscores. The name must be unique in your list of subscribed Azure Store Items.
   
    ![store-screen-1][store-screen-1]

8. Click the right arrow.
