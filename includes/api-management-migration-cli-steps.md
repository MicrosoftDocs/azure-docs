Run the following Azure CLI commands to call the Migrate to Stv2 API, setting variables where indicated with the name of your API Management instance and the name of the resource group in which it was created.

> [!NOTE]
> The following script is written for the bash shell. To run the script in PowerShell, prefix the variable name with the `$` character when setting the variables. Example: `$APIM_NAME=...`.

```azurecli
APIM_NAME={name of your API Management instance}
# In PowerShell, use the following syntax: $APIM_NAME={name of your API Management instance}
RG_NAME={name of your resource group}
# Get resource ID of API Management instance
APIM_RESOURCE_ID=$(az apim show --name $APIM_NAME --resource-group $RG_NAME --query id --output tsv)
# Call REST API to migrate to stv2 and preserve VIP address
az rest --method post --uri "$APIM_RESOURCE_ID/migrateToStv2?api-version=2023-03-01-preview" --body '{"mode": "PreserveIp"}'
# Alternate call to migrate to stv2 and change VIP address
# az rest --method post --uri "$APIM_RESOURCE_ID/migrateToStv2?api-version=2023-03-01-preview" --body '{"mode": "NewIp"}'
``` 

The status of your API Management instance changes to **Updating**. The migration process takes approximately 45 minutes to complete. When the status changes to **Online**, migration is complete.
