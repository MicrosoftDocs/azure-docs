## Extract the zip file

Extract the zip file. The file contains the following folders:

* AzureVPN
* Generic
* OpenVPN (If you have enabled the OpenVPN with **Azure certificate** or **RADIUS authentication** settings on the gateway). Select the appropriate article that corresponds to your configuration to create a tenant.

  * [VPN Gateway- Create a tenant](../articles/vpn-gateway/openvpn-azure-ad-tenant.md)
  * [Virtual WAN - Create a tenant](../articles/virtual-wan/openvpn-azure-ad-tenant.md)

## Retrieve information

In the **AzureVPN** folder, navigate to the ***azurevpnconfig.xml*** file and open it with Notepad. Make a note of the text between the following tags.

```
<audience>          </audience>
<issuer>            </issuer>
<tenant>            </tenant>
<fqdn>              </fqdn>
<serversecret>      </serversecret>
```

## Profile details

When you add a connection, use the information you collected in the previous step for the profile details page. The fields correspond to the following information:

* **Audience:** Identifies the recipient resource the token is intended for.
* **Issuer:** Identifies the Security Token Service (STS) that emitted the token as well as the Microsoft Entra tenant.
* **Tenant:** Contains an immutable, unique identifier of the directory tenant that issued the token.
* **FQDN:** The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the Azure VPN gateway.
* **ServerSecret:** The VPN gateway preshared key.

## Folder contents

* The **generic folder** contains the public server certificate and the VpnSettings.xml file. The VpnSettings.xml file contains information needed to configure a generic client.

* The downloaded zip file may also contain **WindowsAmd64** and **WindowsX86** folders. These folders contain the installer for SSTP and IKEv2 for Windows clients. You need admin rights on the client to install them.
