## Configure NSG rules

Configure custom network rules in the API Management subnet to filter traffic to and from your API Management instance. We recommend the following *minimum* NSG rules to ensure proper operation and access to your instance. Review your environment carefully to determine more rules that might be needed. 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Depending on your use of caching and other features, you may need to configure additional NSG rules beyond the minimum rules in the following table. For detailed settings, see [Virtual network configuration reference](../articles/api-management/virtual-network-reference.md#required-ports). 

  * For most scenarios, use the indicated [service tags](../articles/virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md) instead of service IP addresses to specify network sources and destinations. 
  * Set the priority of these rules higher than that of the default rules.
