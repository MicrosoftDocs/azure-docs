| **GeoType** | Transaction from Primary or Secondary cluster. The available values include **Primary** and **Secondary**. It applies to Read Access Geo Redundant Storage(RA-GRS) when reading objects from secondary tenant. |
| **ResponseType** | Transaction response type. The available values include: <br/><br/> <li>**ServerOtherError**: All other server-side errors except described ones </li> <li>**ServerBusyError**: Authenticated request that returned an HTTP 503 status code. </li> <li>**ServerTimeoutError**: Timed-out authenticated request that returned an HTTP 500 status code.

Most commonly occurs when a client prematurely closes a connection before timeout expiration. </li><li>**ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingError**: The request is throttled on bandwidth for exceeding [storage account scalability limits](../articles/storage/common/scalability-targets-standard-account.md?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json).</li><li>**ClientAccountRequestThrottlingError**: The request is throttled on request rate for exceeding [storage account scalability limits](../articles/storage/common/scalability-targets-standard-account.md?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json).<li>**ClientThrottlingError**: Other client-side throttling error. ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingError and ClientAccountRequestThrottlingError are excluded.</li><li>**ClientShareEgressThrottlingError**: Applicable to premium files shares only. Other client-side throttling error. The request failed due to egress bandwidth throttling for exceeding share limits. ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingError is excluded.</li><li>**ClientShareIngressThrottlingError**: Applicable to premium files shares only. Other client-side throttling error. The request failed due to ingress bandwidth throttling for exceeding share limits. ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingError is excluded.</li><li>**ClientShareIopsThrottlingError**: Other client-side throttling error. The request failed due to IOPS throttling. ClientAccountRequestThrottlingError is excluded.</li><li>**ClientTimeoutError**: Timed-out authenticated request that returned an HTTP 500 status code.

Successful request when a SMB client gets throttled due to egress bandwidth throttling in the first attempt(s) but succeeds after retries.</li><li> **SuccessWithShareIngressThrottling**: Applicable to premium files shares only. Successful request when a SMB client gets throttled due to ingress bandwidth throttling in the first attempt(s) but succeeds after retries.</li><li> **SuccessWithShareIopsThrottling**: Successful request when a SMB client gets throttled due to IOPS throttling in the first attempt(s) but succeeds after retries.</li> |
