| **Dimension Name** | **Description** |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **GeoType** | Transaction from Primary or Secondary cluster. The available values include **Primary** and **Secondary**. It applies to Read Access Geo Redundant Storage (RA-GRS) when reading objects from a secondary tenant. |
| **ResponseType** | Transaction response type. The available values include: <br/><br/> <li>**ServerOtherError**: All other server-side errors except described ones. </li> <li>**ServerBusyError**: Authenticated request that returned an HTTP 503 status code. </li> <li>**ServerTimeoutError**: Timed-out authenticated request that returned an HTTP 500 status code. The timeout occurred due to a server error. </li><li>**AuthenticationError**: The request couldn't be authenticated by the server.</li><li>**AuthorizationError**: Authenticated request that failed due to unauthorized access of data or an authorization failure. </li> <li>**NetworkError**: Authenticated request that failed due to network errors. Most commonly occurs when a client prematurely closes a connection before timeout expiration. </li><li>**ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingError**: The request is throttled on bandwidth for exceeding [storage account scalability limits](../articles/storage/common/scalability-targets-standard-account.md?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json).</li><li>**ClientAccountRequestThrottlingError**: The request is throttled on request rate for exceeding [storage account scalability limits](../articles/storage/common/scalability-targets-standard-account.md?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json).<li>**ClientThrottlingError**: Other client-side throttling error. `ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingError` and `ClientAccountRequestThrottlingError` are excluded.</li><li>**ClientShareEgressThrottlingError**: Applicable to premium file shares only. Other client-side throttling error. The request failed due to egress bandwidth throttling for exceeding share limits. `ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingError` is excluded.</li><li>**ClientShareIngressThrottlingError**: Applicable to premium file shares only. Other client-side throttling error. The request failed due to ingress bandwidth throttling for exceeding share limits. `ClientAccountBandwidthThrottlingError` is excluded.</li><li>**ClientShareIopsThrottlingError**: Other client-side throttling error. The request failed due to IOPS throttling. `ClientAccountRequestThrottlingError` is excluded.</li><li>**ClientTimeoutError**: Timed-out authenticated request that returned an HTTP 500 status code. If the client's network timeout or the request timeout is set to a lower value than expected by the storage service, it's an expected timeout. Otherwise, it's reported as a `ServerTimeoutError`. </li> <li>**ClientOtherError**: All other client-side errors except described ones. </li> <li>**Success**: Successful request</li> <li> **SuccessWithThrottling**: Successful request when an SMB client gets throttled in the first attempt(s) but succeeds after retries.</li><li> **SuccessWithShareEgressThrottling**: Applicable to premium file shares only. Successful request when an SMB client gets throttled due to egress bandwidth throttling in the first attempt or attempts, but succeeds after retries.</li><li> **SuccessWithShareIngressThrottling**: Applicable to premium file shares only. Successful request when an SMB client gets throttled due to ingress bandwidth throttling in the first attempt or attempts, but succeeds after retries.</li><li> **SuccessWithShareIopsThrottling**: Successful request when an SMB client gets throttled due to IOPS throttling in the first attempt(s) but succeeds after retries.</li><li> **SuccessWithMetadataWarning**: Applicable to file shares only. Successful request when a client runs high metadata IOPS, which may cause throttling later if the IOPS remain high or increase.</li><li> **SuccessWithMetadataThrottling**: Applicable to file shares only. Successful request when a client gets throttled due to high metadata IOPS in the first attempt or attempts, but succeeds after retries.</li> |
| **ApiName** | The name of operation. If a failure occurs before the name of the [operation](/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-logged-operations-and-status-messages) is identified,  the name appears as "Unknown." You can use the value of the `ResponseType` dimension to learn more about the failure.
| **Authentication** | Authentication type used in transactions. The available values include: <br/> <li>**AccountKey**: The transaction is authenticated with storage account key.</li> <li>**SAS**: The transaction is authenticated with service/account shared access signatures.</li><li>**DelegationSas**: The transaction is authenticated with user-delegation SAS.</li> <li>**OAuth**: The transaction is authenticated with OAuth access tokens.</li> <li>**Anonymous**: The transaction is requested anonymously. It doesnâ€™t include preflight requests.</li> <li>**AnonymousPreflight**: The transaction is preflight request.</li>|
| **TransactionType** | Type of transaction. The available values include: <br/> <li>**User**: The transaction was made by customer.</li> <li>**System**: The transaction was made by system process.</li> |
