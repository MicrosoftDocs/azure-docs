> [!NOTE]
> To deploy a template or reference a linked template that is stored in a private GitHub repo, see a custom solution documented in a [MVP blog](https://blog.tyang.org/2017/05/19/deploying-arm-templates-with-artifacts-located-in-a-private-github-repository/). You can set up an [Azure function](../../azure-functions/functions-overview.md) as a proxy to construct the URL needed to access a template file in a private GitHub repo.
