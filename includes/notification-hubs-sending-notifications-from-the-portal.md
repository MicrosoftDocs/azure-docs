Push notifications are normally sent in a back-end service like Mobile Apps or ASP.NET using a compatible library. If a library isn't available for your back end, you can also use the REST API directly to send notification messages.

Here is a list of some other tutorials you might want to review for sending notifications:

* Azure Mobile Apps: For an example of how to send notifications from a Mobile Apps back end integrated with Notification Hubs, see [Add Push Notifications to your iOS App](/previous-versions/azure/app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-ios-get-started-push).  
* ASP.NET: [Use Notification Hubs to push notifications to users](../articles/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-aspnet-backend-ios-apple-apns-notification.md).
* Azure Notification Hub Java SDK: See [How to use Notification Hubs from Java](../articles/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-java-push-notification-tutorial.md) for sending notifications from Java. This has been tested in Eclipse for Android Development.
* PHP: [How to use Notification Hubs from PHP](../articles/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-php-push-notification-tutorial.md).
