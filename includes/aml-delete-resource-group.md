If you're not going to use what you've created here, delete the resources you just created with this quickstart so you don't incur any charges.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** on the far left.  
 
   ![Delete in Azure portal](./media/aml-delete-resource-group/delete-resources.png)

1. From the list, select the resource group you created.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. Type the resource group name and then select **Delete**.

   If you get the error "Can not delete resource before nested resources are deleted", you must delete any nested resources first. [Refer to this troubleshooting section](../articles/machine-learning/desktop-workbench/known-issues-and-troubleshooting-guide.md#cant-delete-experimentation-account) for details.
