The Azure VPN Client system tray, available in version 4.0.0.0 and later, lets you close the Azure VPN Client application while keeping the connection active. When you close the application, you can see the application in the Windows system tray. You can reopen the Azure VPN Client app in compact mode by clicking the tray icon.
