Azure Internal Load Balancer (ILB) provides network load balancing between virtual machines that reside inside a cloud service or a virtual network with a regional scope.

For information about the use and configuration of virtual networks with a regional scope, see [Regional virtual networks](../articles/virtual-network/virtual-networks-migrate-to-regional-vnet.md). Existing virtual networks that have been configured for an affinity group cannot use ILB.
