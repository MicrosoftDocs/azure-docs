Azure Internal Load Balancing (ILB) provides network load balancing between virtual machines that reside inside a cloud service, a virtual network with a regional scope. An internal load balancer acts as a security boundary not allowing direct access to the virtual machines behind this type of load balancer from Internet.

For information about the use and configuration of virtual networks with a regional scope, see [Regional Virtual Networks](virtual-networks-migrate-to-regional-vnet.md). Existing virtual networks that have been configured for an affinity group cannot use ILB.
