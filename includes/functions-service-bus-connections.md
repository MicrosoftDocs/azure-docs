## Connections

The `connection` property is a reference to environment configuration which specifies how the app should connect to Service Bus. It may specify:

- The name of an application setting containing a [connection string](#connection-string)
- The name of a shared prefix for multiple application settings, together defining an [identity-based connection](#identity-based-connections).

If the configured value is both an exact match for a single setting and a prefix match for other settings, the exact match is used.

### Connection string

To obtain a connection string, follow the steps shown at [Get the management credentials](../articles/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dotnet-get-started-with-queues.md#get-the-connection-string). The connection string must be for a Service Bus namespace, not limited to a specific queue or topic.

This connection string should be stored in an application setting with a name matching the value specified by the `connection` property of the binding configuration.

If the app setting name begins with "AzureWebJobs", you can specify only the remainder of the name. For example, if you set `connection` to "MyServiceBus", the Functions runtime looks for an app setting that is named "AzureWebJobsMyServiceBus". If you leave `connection` empty, the Functions runtime uses the default Service Bus connection string in the app setting that is named "AzureWebJobsServiceBus".

### Identity-based connections

If you are using [version 5.x or higher of the extension](../articles/azure-functions/functions-bindings-service-bus.md?extensionv5), instead of using a connection string with a secret, you can have the app use an [Microsoft Entra identity](../articles/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md). To do this, you would define settings under a common prefix which maps to the `connection` property in the trigger and binding configuration.

In this mode, the extension requires the following properties:

| Property                  | Environment variable template                       | Description                                | Example value |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| Fully Qualified Namespace | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__fullyQualifiedNamespace` | The fully qualified Service Bus namespace. | <service_bus_namespace>.servicebus.windows.net  |

Additional properties may be set to customize the connection. See [Common properties for identity-based connections](../articles/azure-functions/functions-reference.md#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).
> [!NOTE]
> When using [Azure App Configuration](../articles/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp.md) or [Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for Managed Identity connections, setting names should use a valid key separator such as `:` or `/` in place of the `__` to ensure names are resolved correctly.
> 
> For example, `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>:fullyQualifiedNamespace`.
