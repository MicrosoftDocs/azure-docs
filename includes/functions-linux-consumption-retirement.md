> [!IMPORTANT]  
> After 30 September 2028, the option to host your function app on Linux in a Consumption plan is retired. To avoid disruptions, migrate your existing Consumption plan apps that run on Linux to the [Flex Consumption plan](../articles/azure-functions/flex-consumption-plan.md) before that date. Apps running on Windows in a Consumption plan aren't affected by this change.
> For more information, see the [Linux Consumption plan retirement notice](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2335809).
