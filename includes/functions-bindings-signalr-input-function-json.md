The following example shows a SignalR connection info input binding in a *function.json* file and a function that uses the binding to return the connection information.

Here's binding data for the example in the *function.json* file:

```json
{
    "type": "signalRConnectionInfo",
    "name": "connectionInfo",
    "hubName": "hubName1",
    "connectionStringSetting": "<name of setting containing SignalR Service connection string>",
    "direction": "in"
}
```
