This tutorial shows you how to build a sample IoT Plug and Play device application, connect it to your IoT hub, and use the Azure IoT explorer tool to view the telemetry it sends. The sample application is written in C# and is included in the Azure IoT SDK for C#. A solution builder can use the Azure IoT explorer tool to understand the capabilities of an IoT Plug and Play device without the need to view any device code.

[!INCLUDE [iot-authentication-device-connection-string](iot-authentication-device-connection-string.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [iot-pnp-prerequisites](iot-pnp-prerequisites.md)]

You can run this tutorial on Linux or Windows. The shell commands in this tutorial follow the Linux convention for path separators `/`, if you're following along on Windows be sure to swap these separators for `\`.

* The latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) for your platform.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Download the code

In this tutorial, you prepare a development environment you can use to clone and build the Azure IoT SDK for C# repository.

Open a command prompt in a folder of your choice. Run the following command to clone the [Microsoft Azure IoT SDK for C# (.NET)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp) GitHub repository into this location:

```cmd
git clone  https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp
```

## Build the code

You can now build the sample and run it. Run the following commands to build the sample:

```cmd/sh
cd azure-iot-sdk-csharp/iothub/device/samples/solutions/PnpDeviceSamples/Thermostat
dotnet build
```

## Run the device sample

To run the sample, run the following command:

```cmd/sh
dotnet run
```

The device is now ready to receive commands and property updates, and is sending telemetry data to the hub. Keep the sample running as you complete the next steps.

## Use Azure IoT explorer to validate the code

After the device client sample starts, use the Azure IoT explorer tool to verify it's working.

[!INCLUDE [iot-pnp-iot-explorer.md](iot-pnp-iot-explorer.md)]

## Review the code

This sample implements a simple IoT Plug and Play thermostat device. The model this sample implements doesn't use IoT Plug and Play [components](../articles/iot/concepts-modeling-guide.md). The [Digital Twins definition language (DTDL) model file for the thermostat device](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/samples/Thermostat.json) defines the telemetry, properties, and commands the device implements.

The device code connects to your IoT hub using the standard `CreateFromConnectionString` method. The device sends the model ID of the DTDL model it implements in the connection request. A device that sends a model ID is an IoT Plug and Play device:

```csharp
private static void InitializeDeviceClientAsync()
{
  var options = new ClientOptions
  {
    ModelId = ModelId,
  };
  s_deviceClient = DeviceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(s_deviceConnectionString, TransportType.Mqtt, options);
  s_deviceClient.SetConnectionStatusChangesHandler((status, reason) =>
  {
     s_logger.LogDebug($"Connection status change registered - status={status}, reason={reason}.");
  });
}
```

The model ID is stored in the code as shown in the following snippet:

```csharp
private const string ModelId = "dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1";
```

The code that updates properties, handles commands, and sends telemetry is identical to the code for a device that doesn't use the IoT Plug and Play conventions.

The sample uses a JSON library to parse JSON objects in the payloads sent from your IoT hub:

```csharp
using Newtonsoft.Json;

...

DateTime since = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<DateTime>(request.DataAsJson);
```
