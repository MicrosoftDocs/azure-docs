This article uses PowerShell cmdlets. To run the cmdlets, you can use Azure Cloud Shell. Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account.

To open Cloud Shell, just select **Try it** from the upper-right corner of a code block. You can also open Cloud Shell on a separate browser tab by going to [https://shell.azure.com/powershell](https://shell.azure.com/powershell). Select **Copy** to copy the blocks of code, paste them into Cloud Shell, and select the Enter key to run them.
