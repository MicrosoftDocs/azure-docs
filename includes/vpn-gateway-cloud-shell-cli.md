This article uses the Azure CLI. To run commands, you can use Azure Cloud Shell. The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account.

To open the Cloud Shell, just select **Try it** from the upper right corner of a code block. You can also launch Cloud Shell in a separate browser tab by going to [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com) and toggle the dropdown in the left corner to reflect Bash or PowerShell. Select **Copy** to copy the blocks of code, paste it into the Cloud Shell, and press enter to run it.
