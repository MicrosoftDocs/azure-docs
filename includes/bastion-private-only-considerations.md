* Private-only Bastion is configured at the time of deployment and requires the Premium SKU Tier.

* You can't change from a regular Bastion deployment to a private-only deployment.

* To deploy private-only Bastion to a virtual network that already has a Bastion deployment, first remove Bastion from your virtual network, then deploy Bastion back to the virtual network as private-only. You don't need to delete and recreate the AzureBastionSubnet.

* If you want to create end-to-end private connectivity, connect using the native client instead of connecting via the Azure portal.

* If your client machine is on-premises and non-Azure, you will need to deploy an ExpressRoute or VPN and enable **IP-based connection** on the Bastion resource
