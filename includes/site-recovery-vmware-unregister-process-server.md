Only use these steps if there's no way to revive the machine on which the process server is installed.

1. Sign in the configuration server as an Administrator.
2. Open an Administrative command prompt, and browse to `%ProgramData%\ASR\home\svsystems\bin`.
3. Run this command to get a list of one or more process servers.

    ```
    perl Unregister-ASRComponent.pl -IPAddress <IP_of_Process_Server> -Component PS
    ```
    - IP/Name: The IP address and name of the machine running the process server.
