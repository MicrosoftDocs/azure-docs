>[!NOTE]
> If you can't select a property from the dropdown list because the list isn't responding, this lack of response might mean there's an error in some model in your instance. For example, having nonunique enum values in the attributes of a model breaks this feature. If this error happens, [review your model definitions](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer.md#view-model-definition) and make sure all properties are valid.
