>[!NOTE]
> If you can't select a property from the dropdown list because the list is not responding, this might mean there's an error in some model in your instance. For example, having non-unique enum values in the attributes of a model will break this feature. If this happens, [review your model definitions](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer.md#view-model-definition) and make sure all properties are valid.
