> Route servers created before November 1, 2021, without an associated public IP address, were deployed with the [public preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) offering. The public preview offering doesn't include General Availability SLA and support. To deploy a route server with the General Availability offering and qualify for the General Availability SLA and support, delete and recreate your route server.
