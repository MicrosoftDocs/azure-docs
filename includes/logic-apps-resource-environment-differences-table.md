| **Logic App (Consumption)** <br><br>Host environment: Multi-tenant Azure Logic Apps | - Easiest to get started <br><br>- Pay-for-what-you-use <br><br>- Fully managed | A single logic app can have *only one* workflow. <br><br>Logic apps *across Azure Active Directory tenants* share the same processing (compute), storage, network, and so on. <br><br>For redundancy purposes, data is replicated in the [paired region](../articles/reliability/cross-region-replication-azure.md). For high availability, [geo-redundant storage (GRS)](../articles/storage/common/storage-redundancy.md#geo-redundant-storage) is enabled. | [Consumption](../articles/logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#consumption-pricing) (pay-per-execution) | Azure Logic Apps manages the default values for these limits, but you can change some of these values, if that option exists for a specific limit. |
| **Logic App (Consumption)** <br><br>Host environment: <br>[Integration service environment (ISE)](../articles/logic-apps/connect-virtual-network-vnet-isolated-environment-overview.md) <br><br>**Note**: On August 31, 2024, the ISE option will retire. Since November 1, 2022, you can no longer create an ISE. Instead, you can create a Standard logic app, which runs in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps, can include multiple workflows, and provides the same capabilities as an ISE plus more. | - Enterprise scale for large workloads <br><br>- 20+ ISE-specific connectors that connect directly to virtual networks <br><br>- Predictable pricing with included usage and customer-controlled scaling | A single logic app can have *only one* workflow. <br><br>Logic apps *in the same environment* share the same processing (compute), storage, network, and so on. <br><br>Data stays in the same region where you deploy the ISE. | [ISE](../articles/logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#ise-pricing) (fixed) | Azure Logic Apps manages the default values for these limits, but you can change some of these values, if that option exists for a specific limit. |
| **Logic App (Standard)** <br><br>Host environment: <br>Single-tenant Azure Logic Apps <br><br>**Note**: If your scenario requires containers, [create single-tenant based logic apps using Azure Arc enabled Logic Apps](../articles/logic-apps/azure-arc-enabled-logic-apps-create-deploy-workflows.md). For more information, review [What is Azure Arc enabled Logic Apps?](../articles/logic-apps/azure-arc-enabled-logic-apps-overview.md) | - Run using the single-tenant Azure Logic Apps runtime. Deployment slots are currently not supported. <br><br>- More built-in connectors for higher throughput and lower costs at scale <br><br>- More control and fine-tuning capability around runtime and performance settings <br><br>- Integrated support for virtual networks and private endpoints. <br><br>- Create your own built-in connectors. | A single logic app can have multiple [*stateful* and *stateless*](../articles/logic-apps/single-tenant-overview-compare.md#stateful-stateless) workflows. <br><br>Workflows *in a single logic app and tenant* share the same processing (compute), storage, network, and so on. <br><br>Data stays in the same region where you deploy your logic apps. | [Standard](../articles/logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#standard-pricing), based on a hosting plan with a selected pricing tier. <br><br>If you run *stateful* workflows, which use [external storage](../articles/azure-functions/storage-considerations.md#storage-account-requirements), the Azure Logic Apps runtime makes storage transactions that follow [Azure Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/). | You can change the default values for many limits, based on your scenario's needs. <br><br>**Important**: Some limits have hard upper maximums. In Visual Studio Code, the changes you make to the default limit values in your logic app project configuration files won't appear in the designer experience.

| **Logic App (Standard)** <br><br>Host environment: <br>[App Service Environment v3 (ASEv3) - Windows plans only](../articles/app-service/environment/overview.md) | Same capabilities as single-tenant *plus* the following benefits: <br><br>- Fully isolate your logic apps. <br><br>- Create and run more logic apps than in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps. <br><br>- Pay only for the ASE App Service plan, no matter the number of logic apps that you create and run. <br><br>- Can enable autoscaling or manually scale with more virtual machine instances or a different App Service plan. <br><br>- Inherit the network setup from the selected ASEv3. For example, when deployed to an internal ASE, workflows can access the resources in a virtual network associated with the ASE and have internal access points. <br><br>**Note**: If accessed from outside an internal ASE, run histories for workflows in that ASE can't access action inputs and outputs. | A single logic app can have multiple [*stateful* and *stateless*](../articles/logic-apps/single-tenant-overview-compare.md#stateful-stateless) workflows. <br><br>Workflows *in a single logic app and tenant* share the same processing (compute), storage, network, and so on. <br><br>Data stays in the same region where you deploy your logic apps. | [App Service plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/windows/) | You can change the default values for many limits, based on your scenario's needs. <br><br>**Important**: Some limits have hard upper maximums.
