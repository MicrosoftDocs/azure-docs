| Hosting option | Benefits | Resource sharing and usage | [Pricing and billing model](../articles/logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md) | [Limits management](../articles/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config.md) |
|---------------|----------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Consumption** <br><br>Host environment: Multitenant Azure Logic Apps | - Easiest to get started <br><br>- Pay for what you use <br><br>- Fully managed | A single logic app resource can have *only one* workflow. <br><br>All logic apps *across Microsoft Entra tenants* share the same processing (compute), storage, network, and so on. <br><br>For redundancy purposes, data is replicated in the [paired region](../articles/reliability/cross-region-replication-azure.md). For high availability, [geo-redundant storage (GRS)](../articles/storage/common/storage-redundancy.md#geo-redundant-storage) is enabled. | [Consumption (pay-per-execution)](../articles/logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#consumption-pricing) | Azure Logic Apps manages the default values for these limits, but you can change some of these values, if that option exists for a specific limit. |
| **Standard (Workflow Service Plan)** <br><br>Host environment: <br>Single-tenant Azure Logic Apps | - More built-in connectors hosted on the single-tenant runtime for higher throughput and lower costs at scale <br><br>- More control and fine-tuning capability around runtime and performance settings <br><br>- Integrated support for virtual networks and private endpoints. <br><br>- Create your own built-in connectors. | A single logic app resource can have multiple [*stateful* and *stateless*](../articles/logic-apps/single-tenant-overview-compare.md#stateful-stateless) workflows. <br><br>Workflows *in a single logic app and tenant* share the same processing (compute), storage, network, and so on. <br><br>Data stays in the same region where you deploy your logic app. | [Standard](../articles/logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#standard-pricing), based on a hosting plan with a selected pricing tier. <br><br>If you run *stateful* workflows, which use [external storage](../articles/azure-functions/storage-considerations.md#storage-account-requirements), the Azure Logic Apps runtime makes storage transactions that follow [Azure Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/). | You can change the default values for many limits, based on your scenario's needs. <br><br>**Important**: Some limits have hard upper maximums. In Visual Studio Code, the changes you make to the default limit values in your logic app project configuration files won't appear in the designer experience. For more information, see [Edit app and environment settings for logic apps in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](../articles/logic-apps/edit-app-settings-host-settings.md). |
| **Standard (App Service Environment v3)** <br><br>Host environment: <br>[App Service Environment v3 (ASEv3) - Windows plans only](../articles/app-service/environment/overview.md) | Same capabilities as single-tenant *plus* the following benefits: <br><br>- Fully isolate your logic apps. <br><br>- Create and run more logic apps than in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps. <br><br>- Pay only for the ASE App Service plan, no matter the number of logic apps that you create and run. <br><br>- Can enable autoscaling or manually scale with more virtual machine instances or a different App Service plan. <br><br>- Inherit the network setup from the selected ASEv3. For example, when you deploy to an internal ASE, workflows can access the resources in a virtual network associated with the ASE and have internal access points. <br><br>**Note**: If accessed from outside an internal ASE, run histories for workflows in that ASE can't access action inputs and outputs. | A single logic app can have multiple [*stateful* and *stateless*](../articles/logic-apps/single-tenant-overview-compare.md#stateful-stateless) workflows. <br><br>Workflows *in a single logic app and tenant* share the same processing (compute), storage, network, and so on. <br><br>Data stays in the same region where you deploy your logic apps. | [App Service plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/windows/) | You can change the default values for many limits, based on your scenario's needs. <br><br>**Important**: Some limits have hard upper maximums. In Visual Studio Code, the changes you make to the default limit values in your logic app project configuration files won't appear in the designer experience. For more information, see [Edit app and environment settings for logic apps in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](../articles/logic-apps/edit-app-settings-host-settings.md). |
| **Standard (Hybrid)** <br><br>Host environment: <br>Your own on-premises infrastructure | - Scenarios where you need to control, and manage your own infrastructure. <br><br>- Capabilities that let you build and host integration solutions for partially connected environments that require local processing, storage, and network access. <br><br>- Supports infrastructure that can include on-premises systems, private clouds, and public clouds. <br><br>- Workflows are powered by the Azure Logic Apps runtime, which is hosted on premises as part of an Azure Container Apps extension. <br><br>For more information, see the following articles: <br><br>- [Set up your own infrastructure for Standard logic apps using hybrid deployment](../articles/logic-apps/set-up-standard-workflows-hybrid-deployment-requirements.md) <br><br>- [Create Standard logic app workflows for hybrid deployment on your own infrastructure](../articles/logic-apps/create-standard-workflows-hybrid-deployment.md) | A single logic app can have multiple [*stateful* and *stateless*](../articles/logic-apps/single-tenant-overview-compare.md#stateful-stateless) workflows. <br><br>Workflows *in a single logic app and tenant* share the same processing (compute), storage, network, and so on. <br><br>Data stays in the same region where you deploy your logic apps. | [Hybrid pricing](../articles/logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#standard-hybrid-pricing) | You can change the default values for many limits, based on your scenario's needs. <br><br>**Important**: Some limits have hard upper maximums.
