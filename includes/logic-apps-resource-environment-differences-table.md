For more information, review [What is Azure Arc enabled Logic Apps?](../articles/logic-apps/azure-arc-enabled-logic-apps-overview.md) | - Run using the single-tenant Azure Logic Apps runtime. Deployment slots are currently not supported. <p><p>- More built-in connectors for higher throughput and lower costs at scale <p>- More control and fine-tuning capability around runtime and performance settings <p>- Integrated support for virtual networks and private endpoints. <p>- Create your own built-in connectors. <p><p>- Data stays in the same region where you deploy your logic apps. | A single logic app can have multiple [*stateful* and *stateless*](../articles/logic-apps/single-tenant-overview-compare.md#stateful-stateless) workflows. <p><p>Workflows *in a single logic app and tenant* share the same processing (compute), storage, network, and so on. | [Standard](../articles/logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#standard-pricing), based on a hosting plan with a selected pricing tier. <p>If you run *stateful* workflows, which use [external storage](../articles/azure-functions/storage-considerations.md#storage-account-requirements), the Azure Logic Apps runtime makes storage transactions that follow [Azure Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/). | You can change the default values for many limits, based on your scenario's needs. <p><p>**Important**: Some limits have hard upper maximums.

| **Logic App (Standard)** <p><p>Host environment: <br>[App Service Environment v3 (ASEv3) - Windows plans only](../articles/app-service/environment/overview.md) | Same capabilities as single-tenant *plus* the following benefits: <p>- Fully isolate your logic apps. <p>- Create and run more logic apps than in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps. <p>- Pay only for the ASE App Service plan, no matter the number of logic apps that you create and run. <p>- Can enable autoscaling or manually scale with more virtual machine instances or a different App Service plan. <p><p>- Data stays in the same region where you deploy your logic apps. <p>- Inherit the network setup from the selected ASEv3. For example, when deployed to an internal ASE, workflows can access the resources in a virtual network associated with the ASE and have internal access points. <p>**Note**: If accessed from outside an internal ASE, run histories for workflows in that ASE can't access action inputs and outputs. | A single logic app can have multiple [*stateful* and *stateless*](../articles/logic-apps/single-tenant-overview-compare.md#stateful-stateless) workflows. <p><p>Workflows *in a single logic app and tenant* share the same processing (compute), storage, network, and so on. | [App Service plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/windows/) | You can change the default values for many limits, based on your scenario's needs. <p><p>**Important**: Some limits have hard upper maximums.
