To work with Azure Digital Twins in this article, you need an Azure Digital Twins instance and the required permissions for using it. If you already have an Azure Digital Twins instance set up, you can use that instance and skip to the next section. Otherwise, follow the instructions in [Set up an instance and authentication](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md). The instructions contain information to help you verify that you completed each step successfully.

After you set up your instance, make a note of the instance's host name. You can [find the host name in the Azure portal](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md#verify-success-and-collect-important-values).
