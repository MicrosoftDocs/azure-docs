The following table lists quota information specific to Service Bus messaging. For information about pricing and other quotas for Service Bus, see the [Service Bus Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/service-bus/) overview.

| Quota Name | Scope | Type | Behavior when exceeded | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maximum number of basic / standard namespaces per Azure subscription |Namespace |Static |Subsequent requests for additional basic / standard namespaces will be rejected by the portal. |100|
| Maximum number of premium namespaces per Azure subscription |Namespace |Static |Subsequent requests for additional premium namespaces will be rejected by the portal. |10 |
| Queue/topic size |Entity |Defined upon creation of the queue/topic. |Incoming messages will be rejected and an exception will be received by the calling code. |1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 GB.<br /><br />If [partitioning](../articles/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-partitioning.md) is enabled, the maximum queue/topic size is 80 GB. |
| Number of concurrent connections on a namespace |Namespace |Static |Subsequent requests for additional connections will be rejected and an exception will be received by the calling code. REST operations do not count towards concurrent TCP connections. |NetMessaging: 1,000<br /><br />AMQP: 5,000 |
| Number of concurrent receive requests on a queue/topic/subscription entity |Entity |Static |Subsequent receive requests will be rejected and an exception will be received by the calling code. This quota applies to the combined number of concurrent receive operations across all subscriptions on a topic. |5,000 |
| Number of topics/queues per service namespace |System-wide |Static |Subsequent requests for creation of a new topic or queue on the service namespace will be rejected. As a result, if configured through the [Azure portal][Azure portal], an error message will be generated. If called from the management API, an exception will be received by the calling code. |10,000<br /><br />The total number of topics plus queues in a service namespace must be less than or equal to 10,000.<br/>This is not applicable to Premium as all entities are partitioned. |
| Number of partitioned topics/queues per service namespace |System-wide |Static |Subsequent requests for creation of a new partitioned topic or queue on the service namespace will be rejected. As a result, if configured through the [Azure portal][Azure portal], an error message will be generated. If called from the management API, a **QuotaExceededException** exception will be received by the calling code. |Basic and Standard Tiers - 100<br />[Premium](../articles/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-premium-messaging.md) - 1,000 (per messaging unit)<br/><br />Each partitioned queue or topic counts towards the quota of 10,000 entities per namespace. |
| Maximum size of any messaging entity path: queue or topic |Entity |Static |- |260 characters |
| Maximum size of any messaging entity name: namespace, subscription, or subscription rule |Entity |Static |- |50 characters |
| Message size for a queue/topic/subscription entity |System-wide |Static |Incoming messages that exceed these quotas will be rejected and an exception will be received by the calling code. |Maximum message size: 256KB ([Standard tier](../articles/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-premium-messaging.md)) / 1MB ([Premium tier](../articles/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-premium-messaging.md)). <br /><br />**Note** Due to system overhead, this limit is usually slightly less.<br /><br />Maximum header size: 64KB<br /><br />Maximum number of header properties in property bag: **byte/int.MaxValue**<br /><br />Maximum size of property in property bag: No explicit limit. Limited by maximum header size. |
| Message property size for a queue/topic/subscription entity |System-wide |Static |A **SerializationException** exception is generated. |Maximum message property size for each property is 32K. Cumulative size of all properties cannot exceed 64K. This applies to the entire header of the [BrokeredMessage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.aspx), which has both user properties as well as system properties (such as [SequenceNumber](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.sequencenumber.aspx), [Label](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.label.aspx), [MessageId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.messageid.aspx), and so on). |
| Number of subscriptions per topic |System-wide |Static |Subsequent requests for creating additional subscriptions for the topic will be rejected. As a result, if configured through the portal, an error message will be shown. If called from the management API an exception will be received by the calling code. |2,000 |
| Number of SQL filters per topic |System-wide |Static |Subsequent requests for creation of additional filters on the topic will be rejected and an exception will be received by the calling code. |2,000 |
| Number of correlation filters per topic |System-wide |Static |Subsequent requests for creation of additional filters on the topic will be rejected and an exception will be received by the calling code. |100,000 |
| Size of SQL filters/actions |System-wide |Static |Subsequent requests for creation of additional filters will be rejected and an exception will be received by the calling code. |Maximum length of filter condition string: 1024 (1K).<br /><br />Maximum length of rule action string: 1024 (1K).<br /><br />Maximum number of expressions per rule action: 32. |
| Number of [SharedAccessAuthorizationRule](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.sharedaccessauthorizationrule.aspx) rules per namespace, queue, or topic |Entity, namespace |Static |Subsequent requests for creation of additional rules will be rejected and an exception will be received by the calling code. |Maximum number of rules: 12. <br /><br /> Rules that are configured on a Service Bus namespace apply to all queues and topics in that namespace. |
