<sup>1</sup> Apps and storage quotas are per App Service plan unless noted otherwise.

<sup>2</sup> The actual number of apps that you can host on these machines depends on the activity of the apps, the size of the machine instances, and the corresponding resource utilization.

<sup>3</sup> Dedicated instances can be of different sizes. For more information, see [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/).

<sup>4</sup> More are allowed upon request.

<sup>5</sup> The storage limit is the total content size across all apps in the same App service plan. The total content size of all apps across all App service plans in a single resource group and region cannot exceed 500 GB. The file system quota for App Service hosted apps is determined by the aggregate of App Service plans created in a region and resource group.

<sup>6</sup> These resources are constrained by physical resources on the dedicated instances (the instance size and the number of instances).

<sup>7</sup>If you scale a Windows app in the Basic tier to two instances, you have 350 concurrent connections for each of the two instances. For Windows apps on Standard tier and above, there are no theoretical limits to WebSockets, but other factors can limit the number of WebSockets. For example, maximum concurrent requests allowed (defined by `maxConcurrentRequestsPerCpu`) are: 7,500 per small VM, 15,000 per medium VM (7,500 x 2 cores), and 75,000 per large VM (18,750 x 4 cores). Linux apps are limited 5 concurrent WebSocket connections on Free SKU and ~50k concurrent WebSocket connections per instance on all other SKUs.

<sup>8</sup> The maximum IP connections are per instance and depend on the instance size: 1,920 per B1/S1/P0V3/P1V3/P0V4/P1V4 instance, 3,968 per B2/S2/P2V3/P2V4 instance, 8,064 per B3/S3/P3V3/P4V4 instance.

<sup>9</sup> App Service Isolated SKUs can be internally load balanced (ILB) with Azure Load Balancer, so there's no public connectivity from the internet. As a result, some features of an ILB Isolated App Service must be used from machines that have direct access to the ILB network endpoint.

<sup>10</sup> Run custom executables and/or scripts on demand, on a schedule, or continuously as a background task within your App Service instance. Always On is required for continuous WebJobs execution. There's no predefined limit on the number of WebJobs that can run in an App Service instance. There are practical limits that depend on what the application code is trying to do.

<sup>11</sup> Only issuing standard certificates (wildcard certificates aren't available). Limited to only one free certificate per custom domain.

<sup>12</sup> Total storage usage across all apps deployed in a single App Service environment (regardless of how they're allocated across different resource groups).
