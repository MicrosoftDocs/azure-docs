The devices are designed to continue to operate when your internet connection is slow or gets interrupted. In normal operating conditions, we recommend that  you use: 

- A minimum of 10-Mbps download bandwidth to ensure the device stays updated.
- A minimum of 20-Mbps dedicated upload and download bandwidth to transfer files.
- A minimum of 100-Mbps is required for the internet connection on AP5GC networks.

Use WAN throttling to limit your WAN throughput to 64 Mbps or higher.
