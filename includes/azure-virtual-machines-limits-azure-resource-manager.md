| Resource | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| VMs per [subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) |25,000<sup>1</sup> per region. |
| VM total cores per [subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) |20<sup>1</sup> per region. Contact support to increase limit. |
| Azure Spot VM total cores per [subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) |20<sup>1</sup> per region. Contact support to increase limit. |
| VM per series, such as Dv2 and F, cores per [subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) |20<sup>1</sup> per region. Contact support to increase limit. |
| [Availability sets](/azure/virtual-machines/availability-set-overview) per subscription |2,500 per region. |
| Virtual machines per availability set | 200 |
| [Proximity placement groups](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/proximity-placement-groups-portal) per [resource group](../articles/azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md#resource-groups) | 800 |
| Certificates per availability set | 199<sup>2</sup> |
| Certificates per subscription |Unlimited<sup>3</sup> |

<sup>1</sup> Default limits vary by offer category type, such as Free Trial and Pay-As-You-Go, and by series, such as Dv2, F, and G. For example, the default for Enterprise Agreement subscriptions is 350. For security, subscriptions default to 20 cores to prevent large core deployments. If you need more cores, submit a support ticket.

<sup>2</sup> Properties such as SSH public keys are also pushed as certificates and count towards this limit. To bypass this limit, use the [Azure Key Vault extension for Windows](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/key-vault-windows) or the [Azure Key Vault extension for Linux](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/key-vault-linux) to install certificates.

<sup>3</sup> With Azure Resource Manager, certificates are stored in the Azure Key Vault. The number of certificates is unlimited for a subscription. There's a 1-MB limit of certificates per deployment, which consists of either a single VM or an availability set.

> [!NOTE]
> Virtual machine cores have a regional total limit. They also have a limit for regional per-size series, such as Dv2 and F. These limits are separately enforced. For example, consider a subscription with a US East total VM core limit of 30, an A series core limit of 30, and a D series core limit of 30. This subscription can deploy 30 A1 VMs, or 30 D1 VMs, or a combination of the two not to exceed a total of 30 cores. An example of a combination is 10 A1 VMs and 20 D1 VMs.
