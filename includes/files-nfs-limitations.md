Currently, only NFS version 4.1 is supported. NFSv4.1 shares are only supported within the **FileStorage** storage account type (SSD file shares only).

NFS Azure file shares support most features from the 4.1 protocol specification. Some features aren't supported, such as Kerberos authentication and delegations and callback of all kinds.
