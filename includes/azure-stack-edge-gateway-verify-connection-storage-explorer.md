The next step to verify is that the data transfer is actually working correctly over this connection.

Take the following steps to load data into your Edge storage account on the device and it should automatically get tiered to the mapped Azure Storage account.

1. Select the container to which you want to load the data in your Edge storage account. Select **Upload** and then select **Upload files**.

4. Next, you will connect to the Azure Storage account that was mapped to this Edge storage account. Any data that is uploaded to the Edge storage account should automatically tier to the Azure Storage account. 
    
    To get the connection string for the Azure Storage account, go to the **Azure Storage account > Access keys** and copy the connection string.
