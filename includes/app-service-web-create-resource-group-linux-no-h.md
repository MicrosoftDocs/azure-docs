[!INCLUDE [resource group intro text](resource-group.md)]

In the Cloud Shell, create a resource group with the [`az group create`](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command. The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *West Europe* location. To see all supported locations for App Service on Linux in **Basic** tier, run the [`az appservice list-locations --sku B1 --linux-workers-enabled`](/cli/azure/appservice#az-appservice-list-locations) command.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location "West Europe"
```

You generally create your resource group and the resources in a region near you. 

When the command finishes, a JSON output shows you the resource group properties.
