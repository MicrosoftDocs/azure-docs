Most sponsored academic offers include a Developer tier of Azure Support for free. Microsoft also offers an [Educator Support page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/support) where your local Microsoft representative or teaching assistant can request support for any questions about the Azure Education Hub, including setup problems.
