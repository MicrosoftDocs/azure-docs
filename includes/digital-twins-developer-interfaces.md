## Developer interfaces

This article highlights how to complete different management operations using the [.NET (C#) SDK](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/resourcemanager.digitaltwins-readme). You can also craft these same management calls using the other language SDKs described in [Azure Digital Twins APIs and SDKs](../articles/digital-twins/concepts-apis-sdks.md).

Other developer interfaces that can be used to complete these operations include:
* [Azure Digital Twins Explorer](../articles/digital-twins/concepts-azure-digital-twins-explorer.md)
* [REST API](/rest/api/azure-digitaltwins/) calls
* [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/dt) commands
