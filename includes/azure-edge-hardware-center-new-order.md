6. On the **Select Hardware** page, use the **Select** button to select the hardware product to order. For example, here **Azure Stack Edge Pro - GPU** was selected. 

    ![Screenshot for selecting a hardware product for an Azure Edge Hardware Center order. The Select button for a product is highlighted.](./media/azure-edge-hardware-center-new-order/edge-hardware-center-new-resource-05.png)

    After you select a hardware product, you'll select the device configuration to order. For example, if you chose Azure Stack Edge Pro - GPU, you can choose from Azure Stack Edge Pro - 1 GPU and Azure Stack Edge Pro - 2 GPU models.

    If you are placing a first-time order for Azure Stack Edge, select **Sign-up** and fill out the web form as part of the Azure Edge Hardware Center ordering experience.

    The web form collects the following details about your deployment:
   - Total deployment scale 
   - Cluster size 
   - Hardware requirements 
   - Geographic presence 

   Microsoft will evaluate the deployment details you provide and may contact you by email for more information. We have certain requirements in place for new customers to ensure that Azure Stack Edge is the right fit for the use case; not all requests will be fulfilled. If you have questions, you can send email to [AzureStack1Pinquiry@microsoft.com](mailto:AzureStack1Pinquiry@microsoft.com).

    Next, you'll add each ship to address you want to send devices to and then specify how many devices to send to each address. You can order up to 20 units (devices) per order.

9. On the **Shipping + quantity** tab, add each ship to address to send devices to: 

    - To add a new ship to address, select **Add a new address**. 

       A required **Address alias** field on the **New address** screen identifies the address for later use. Select **Add** when you finish filling in the address fields. Then use **Select address(es)** to add the address to your order.

       ![Screenshot of New address screen for Azure Edge Hardware Center order. Address alias option and Add button are highlighted.](./media/azure-edge-hardware-center-new-order/edge-hardware-center-new-resource-08.png)

    - To use a ship to address from a previous order, or to use an address that you just added, choose **Select address(es)**. Then, on the **Select address(es)** screen, select one or more addresses, and choose **Select**.

       ![Screenshot of Select Addresses screen for Azure Edge Hardware Center order. "Select addresses" option, two selected addresses, and Select button are highlighted.](./media/azure-edge-hardware-center-new-order/edge-hardware-center-new-resource-09.png)

    The **Shipping + quantity** tab now has a separate item for each ship to address.

    Each order item name includes a name prefix (the order name followed by the address alias), with an item number for each device that is shipped to that address.

11. If you want to change the names of order items, select and click the order item name to open the **Rename order item** pane. If you're shipping more than one item to an address, select **+n more**.

    You can make two types of name change:
 
    * To use a different name prefix for all of the order items, edit the **Name prefix** and then select **Apply**, as shown on the following screen.

    * You can also edit the name of each order item individually. 

    When you finish, select **Done**.

    When you finish, select **Review + create** to continue.

13. On the **Review + create** tab:

    1. Review your order. The order is automatically validated when you open this screen. If you see a **Validation failed** banner, you'll have to fix the issues before you create the order.
    
    1. Review the **Privacy terms**, and select the check box to agree to them.
 
    1. Select **Create**.

    ![Screenshot of the Review + create tab for an Azure Edge Hardware Center order](./media/azure-edge-hardware-center-new-order/edge-hardware-center-new-resource-14.png)
