<!-- F-series, Fs-series* -->

F-series is based on the 2.4 GHz Intel Xeon® E5-2673 v3 (Haswell) processor, which can achieve clock speeds as high as 3.1 GHz with the Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0. This is the same CPU performance as the Dv2-series of VMs.  At a lower per-hour list price, the F-series is the best value in price-performance in the Azure portfolio based on the Azure Compute Unit (ACU) per core. 

F-series VMs are an excellent choice for workloads that demand faster CPUs but do not need as much memory or local SSD per CPU core.  Workloads such as analytics, gaming servers, web servers, and batch processing will benefit from the value of the F-series.

The Fs-series provides all the advantages of the F-series, in addition to Premium storage.

## Fs-series*

ACU: 210 - 250

| Size | CPU cores | Memory: GiB | Local SSD: GiB | Max data disks | Max cached and local disk throughput: IOPS / MBps (cache size in GiB) | Max uncached disk throughput: IOPS / MBps | Max NICs / Expected network performance (Mbps) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard_F1s |1 |2 |4 |2 |4,000 / 32 (12) |3,200 / 48 |2 / 750 |
| Standard_F2s |2 |4 |8 |4 |8,000 / 64 (24) |6,400 / 96 |2 / 1500 |

MBps = 10^6 bytes per second, and GiB = 1024^3 bytes.

*The maximum disk throughput (IOPS or MBps) possible with a Fs series VM may be limited by the number, size and striping of the attached disk(s).  For details, see [Premium Storage: High-performance storage for Azure virtual machine workloads](../articles/storage/storage-premium-storage.md).
