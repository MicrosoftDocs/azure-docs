> [!CAUTION]
> Minimize risks of credential exposure when configuring this policy. Microsoft recommends that you use more secure authentication methods if supported by your backend, such as [managed identity authentication](../articles/api-management/authentication-managed-identity-policy.md) or [credential manager](../articles/api-management/credentials-overview.md). If you configure sensitive information in policy definitions, we recommend using [named values](../articles/api-management/api-management-howto-properties.md) and storing secrets in Azure Key Vault.
