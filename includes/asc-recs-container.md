There are **32** recommendations in this category.

|Recommendation |Description |Severity |Type |
|---|---|---|--|
|[\[Enable if required\] Container registries should be encrypted with a customer-managed key (CMK)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/af560c4d-9c05-e073-b9f1-f7a94958ff25) |Recommendations to use customer-managed keys for encryption of data at rest are not assessed by default, but are available to enable for applicable scenarios. Data is encrypted automatically using platform-managed keys, so the use of customer-managed keys should only be applied when obligated by compliance or restrictive policy requirements. <br> To enable this recommendation, navigate to your Security Policy for the applicable scope, and update the *Effect* parameter for the corresponding policy to audit or enforce the use of customer-managed keys. Learn more in <a target="_blank" href="/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-security-policy">Manage security policies</a>.<br>Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of the contents of your registries. By default, the data is encrypted at rest with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys (CMK) are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. CMKs enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management.

To protect your registries from potential threats, allow access from only specific public IP addresses or address ranges.
