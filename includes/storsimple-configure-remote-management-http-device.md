####To configure remote management on the device

1. On your virtual device, go to **Devices > Configure**.

2. Scroll down to the **Remote Management** section.

3. Set **Enable Remote Management** to **Yes**.

4. You can now choose to connect using HTTP. The default is to connect over HTTPS. Connecting over HTTP is acceptable only on trusted networks.

5. Click **Download Remote Management Certificate** to download a remote management certificate. You will specify a location in which to save this file. This certificate then needs to be installed on the client or host machine that you will use to connect to the virtual device.

6. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.
