This action opens Azure Digital Twins Explorer in a new tab. If this is your first time using the Explorer, you see a welcome modal summarizing its key features.

Azure Digital Twins Explorer might automatically connect to your instance. If not, you see the following screen asking you to specify an Azure Digital Twins URL. (If you don't see this box on your screen, Azure Digital Twins Explorer completed this step automatically.)

The Azure Digital Twins URL modal displays an empty editable box for the Azure Digital Twins URL." lightbox="../articles/digital-twins/media/includes/azure-digital-twins-explorer-no-environment.png":::

If you see this box, enter *https://* into the field, followed by the host name of your instance (this value can be found back on the instance's **Overview** page in the portal). These values together make up the instance URL. Select **Save** to connect to your instance.
