> [!WARNING]
> Azure Machine Learning requires the __admin account__ be enabled on your Azure Container Registry. By default, this setting is disabled when you create a container registry. For information on enabling the admin account, see [Admin account](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-authentication#admin-account).
> 
> Once an Azure Container Registry has been created for a workspace, do not delete it. Doing so will break your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
