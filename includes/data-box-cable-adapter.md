> - Data Box Next-gen 120 TB and 525 TB devices use QSFP28 cable (for example, Q28-PC01 100G DAC QSFP28 Passive Direct Attach Copper Twinax cable). <br>

>  - To connect SFP+/SFP28 cables to Data Box Next-gen devices, use an appropriate adapter. For example, QSFP to SFP+ adapters include Mellanox MAM1Q00A-QSA or Cisco 100G QSFP28. <br>
>  - To connect a QSFP28 device to an LC fiber backend using the Mellanox MAM1Q00A-QSA adapter or another compatible adapter, you need:
>    - A Mellanox MAM1Q00A-QSA Adapter, which converts the QSFP28 port to an SFP+ or SFP28 slot.
>    - A Compatible optical SFP+ or SFP28 Transceiver that matches your LC fiber backbone (for example, SFP+ SR for multimode fiber or SFP+ LR for single-mode fiber).
>    - An LC Fiber Cable, which connects the transceiver to your fiber backbone.
