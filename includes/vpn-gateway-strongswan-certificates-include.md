Generate the CA certificate.

  ```
  ipsec pki --gen --outform pem > caKey.pem
  ipsec pki --self --in caKey.pem --dn "CN=VPN CA" --ca --outform pem > caCert.pem
  ```

Print the CA certificate in base64 format, the format that Azure supports. You upload this certificate to Azure as part of the [P2S configuration steps](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md).

  ```
  openssl x509 -in caCert.pem -outform der | base64 -w0 ; echo
  ```

Generate the user certificate.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft recommends that you use the most secure authentication flow available. The authentication flow described in this procedure requires a very high degree of trust in the application, and carries risks that aren't present in other flows. You should only use this flow when other more secure flows, such as managed identities, aren't viable.

  ```
  export PASSWORD="password"
  export USERNAME=$(hostnamectl --static)

  ipsec pki --gen --outform pem > "${USERNAME}Key.pem"
  ipsec pki --pub --in "${USERNAME}Key.pem" | ipsec pki --issue --cacert caCert.pem --cakey caKey.pem --dn "CN=${USERNAME}" --san "${USERNAME}" --flag clientAuth --outform pem > "${USERNAME}Cert.pem"
  ```

Generate a p12 bundle containing the user certificate. This bundle will be used in the next steps when working with the client configuration files.

  ```
  openssl pkcs12 -in "${USERNAME}Cert.pem" -inkey "${USERNAME}Key.pem" -certfile caCert.pem -export -out "${USERNAME}.p12" -password "pass:${PASSWORD}"
  ```
