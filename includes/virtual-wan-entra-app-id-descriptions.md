Virtual WAN now supports a Microsoft-registered App ID and corresponding Audience values for the latest versions of the Azure VPN Client. When you configure a P2S VPN gateway using the new Audience values, you skip the previously required Azure VPN Client app manual registration process for your Microsoft Entra tenant. The App ID is already created and your tenant is automatically able to use it with no extra registration steps. This process is more secure than manually registering the Azure VPN Client because you don't need to authorize the app or assign permissions via the Cloud App Administrator role. To better understand the difference between the types of application objects, see [How and why applications are added to Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity-platform/how-applications-are-added).

* If your P2S User VPN gateway is configured using the Audience values for the manually configured Azure VPN Client app, you can easily [change](../articles/virtual-wan/point-to-site-entra-gateway-update.md) the gateway and client settings to take advantage of the new Microsoft-registered App ID. If you want Linux clients to connect, you must update the P2S gateway with the new Audience value. The Azure VPN Client for Linux isn't backward compatible with the older Audience values.

* For this configuration, you can instead, use a custom Audience value. For more information, see [Create a custom audience app ID for P2S VPN](../articles/virtual-wan/point-to-site-entra-register-custom-app.md).

**Considerations**

* A P2S User VPN gateway can only support one Audience value. It can't support multiple Audience values simultaneously.

* The Azure VPN Client for Linux isn't backward compatible with P2S gateways configured to use the older Audience values that align with the manually registered app. However, the Azure VPN Client for Linux does support Custom Audience values.

* The latest versions of the Azure VPN Clients for macOS and Windows are backward compatible with P2S gateways configured to use the older Audience values that align with the manually registered app. These clients also support Custom Audience values.

The following table shows the versions of the Azure VPN Client that are supported for each App ID and the corresponding available Audience values.
