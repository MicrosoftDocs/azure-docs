In order to connect to **SharePoint Online**, you need to provide your identity (username and password, smart card credentials, etc.) to SharePoint Online. Once you've been authenticated, you can proceed to use the SharePoint Online connector  in your logic app. 

While on the designer of your logic app, follow these steps to sign into SharePoint to create the **connection** for use in your logic app:

1. Enter SharePoint in the search box and wait for the search to return all triggers and actions related to SharePoint Online:   
![Configure SharePoint][1]  
2. Select the **SharePoint Online - When a file is created** trigger  
3. Select **Sign in to SharePoint Online**:   
![Configure SharePoint][2]    
4. Provide your SharePoint credentials to sign in to authenticate with SharePoint   
![Configure SharePoint][3]     
5. After the authentication completes you'll be redirected to your logic app. That's it, the connection has been created. Notice the message at the bottom that indicates that you are now connected to SharePoint.  
![Configure SharePoint][4]  
6. You can then add other triggers and actions that you need to complete your logic app.
