Before following the steps in this article, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* An Azure Machine Learning workspace. If you don't have one, use the steps in the [Quickstart: Create workspace resources](../articles/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources.md) article to create one.

* To install the Python SDK v2, use the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install azure-ai-ml azure-identity
    ```

    For more information, see [Install the Python SDK v2 for Azure Machine Learning](/python/api/overview/azure/ai-ml-readme).
