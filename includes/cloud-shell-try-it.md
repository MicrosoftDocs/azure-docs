![Cloud Shell](./media/cloud-shell-try-it/cloud-shell.png) The [Azure Cloud Shell](../articles/cloud-shell/quickstart.md) (in public preview) is a web based shell that is preconfigured to simplify using Azure tools. With Cloud Shell, you always have the most up-to-date version of the tools available and you don’t have to install, update or separately log-in. Just click the Cloud Shell button on the top navigation. Or, click the **Try It** button at the top right of a code block to launch it in the Cloud Shell.

If you prefer not to use the Cloud Shell please make sure you have installed the latest version of the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and log in using the **az login** command.
