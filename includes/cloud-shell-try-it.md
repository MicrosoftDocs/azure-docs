The [Azure Cloud Shell](../articles/cloud-shell/quickstart.md) (in public preview) is a web-based shell that is preconfigured to simplify using Azure tools. With Cloud Shell, you always have the most up-to-date version of the tools available and you don’t have to install, update or separately log in. You can also open the Cloud Shell from the Azure portal by clicking the ![Cloud Shell](./media/cloud-shell-try-it/cs-button.png) button on the menu in the upper-right of the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, you need to log in to your Azure subscription with the [az login](/cli/azure/#login) command and follow the on-screen directions.
