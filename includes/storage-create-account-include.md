## Create an Azure storage account

The easiest way to create your first Azure storage account is by using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). To learn more, see [Create a storage account](../articles/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account.md).

You can also create an Azure storage account by using [Azure PowerShell](../articles/storage/common/storage-powershell-guide-full.md), [Azure CLI](../articles/storage/common/storage-azure-cli.md), or the [Azure Storage Resource Provider for .NET](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/storage-dotnet-resource-provider-getting-started/).

If you prefer not to create a storage account in Azure at this time, you can also use the Azure storage emulator to run and test your code in a local environment. For more information, see [Use the Azure Storage Emulator for Development and Testing](../articles/storage/common/storage-use-emulator.md).
