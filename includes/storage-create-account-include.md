## Create an Azure storage account

The easiest way to create your first Azure storage account is by using the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). To learn more, see [Create a storage account](storage-create-storage-account.md#create-a-storage-account).

You can also create an Azure storage account by using [Azure PowerShell](storage-powershell-guide-full.md), [Azure CLI](storage-azure-cli.md), or the [Storage Resource Provider Client Library for .NET](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt131037.aspx).

If you prefer not to create a storage account at this time, you can also use the Azure storage emulator to run and test your code in a local environment. For more information, see [Use the Azure Storage Emulator for Development and Testing](storage-use-emulator.md).
