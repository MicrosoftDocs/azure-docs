### Create an Azure Digital Twins instance

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-setup-portal.md](digital-twins-setup-portal.md)]

3. Fill in the fields on the **Basics** tab of setup, including your subscription, resource group, a resource name for your new instance, and region. Check the **Assign Azure Digital Twins Data Owner Role** box to give yourself permissions to manage data in the instance.

    >[!NOTE]
    > If the Assign Azure Digital Twins Data Owner Role box is greyed out, it means you don't have permissions in your Azure subscription to manage user access to resources. You can continue creating the instance in this section, and then should have someone with the necessary permissions [assign you this role on the instance](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md#assign-the-role-using-azure-identity-management-iam) before completing the rest of this quickstart.
    >
    > Common roles that meet this requirement are **Owner**, **Account admin**, or the combination of **User Access Administrator** and **Contributor**.  

4. Select **Review + create** to finish creating your instance.
    
5. You see a summary page showing the details you entered. Confirm and create the instance by selecting **Create**.

This action takes you to an Overview page tracking the deployment status of the instance.

Wait for the page to say that your deployment is complete.
