Setting a custom domain name is only available for the Shared, Basic and Standard modes for Azure Websites. Before switching a website from the Free website mode to the Shared, Basic or Standard mode, you must first remove spending caps in place for your Website subscription. 

For more information on the Website modes, including how to change the mode of your site, see [How to scale web sites](/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-scale/).
