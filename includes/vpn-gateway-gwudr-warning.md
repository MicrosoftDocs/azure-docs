* User-defined routes with a 0.0.0.0/0 destination and network security groups (NSGs) on the gateway subnet *are not supported*. Gateways with this configuration are blocked from being created. Gateways require access to the management controllers in order to function properly. [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route propagation](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview#border-gateway-protocol) should be enabled on the gateway subnet to ensure availability of the gateway. If BGP route propagation is disabled, the gateway won't function.

* Diagnostics, data path, and control path can be affected if a user-defined route overlaps with the gateway subnet range or the gateway public IP range.
