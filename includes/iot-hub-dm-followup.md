## Customize and extend the device management actions

Your IoT solutions can expand the defined set of device management patterns or enable custom patterns by using the device twin and cloud-to-device method primitives. Other examples of device management actions include factory reset, firmware update, software update, power management, network and connectivity management, and data encryption.

## Device maintenance windows

Typically, you configure devices to perform actions at a time that minimizes interruptions and downtime. Device maintenance windows are a commonly used pattern to define the time when a device should update its configuration. Your back-end solutions can use the desired properties of the device twin to define and activate a policy on your device that enables a maintenance window. When a device receives the maintenance window policy, it can use the reported property of the device twin to report the status of the policy. The back-end app can then use device twin queries to attest to compliance of devices and each policy.

## Next steps

In this article, you used a direct method to trigger a remote reboot on a device. You used the reported properties to report the last reboot time from the device, and queried the device twin to discover the last reboot time of the device from the cloud.
