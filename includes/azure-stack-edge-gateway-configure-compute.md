To configure compute on your Azure Stack Edge Pro, you create an IoT Hub resource via Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal of your Azure Stack Edge resource, go to **Overview**, and select **Kubernetes for Azure Stack Edge**.

2. In **Get started with Kubernetes service**, select **Add**.

3. After the resource is created, the **Overview** indicates that the Kubernetes service is online.

It can take 20-30 minutes to configure compute because, behind the scenes, virtual machines, and a Kubernetes cluster are being created.
