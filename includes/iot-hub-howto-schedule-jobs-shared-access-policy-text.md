<!-- This contains intro text for the "Get an IoT hub connection string" section in the iot-hub-lang-lang-schedule-jobs.md files-->

In this article, you create a back-end service that schedules a job to invoke a direct method on a device, schedules a job to update the device twin, and monitors the progress of each job. To perform these operations, your service needs the **registry read** and **registry write** permissions. By default, every IoT hub is created with a shared access policy named **registryReadWrite** that grants these permissions.
