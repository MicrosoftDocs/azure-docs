In this quickstart, add example utterances to a Home Automation app and train the app. Example utterances are conversational user text mapped to an intent. By providing example utterances for intents, you teach LUIS what kinds of user-supplied text belongs to which intent. 


For more information, see the technical documentation for the [add example utterance to intent](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5890b47c39e2bb052c5b9c08), [train](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5890b47c39e2bb052c5b9c45), and [training status](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5890b47c39e2bb052c5b9c46) APIs.
