#### To delete a volume container

1. On the **Devices** page, select the device, double-click it, and then click the **Volume containers** tab.

2. Select the volume container you want to delete.

3. If a volume container has no associated volumes, then it can be deleted. Click **Delete** at the bottom of the page to delete this container. When prompted for confirmation, click **Yes**. This will delete the volume container.

If the volume container has associated volumes, you will first need to take those volumes offline by following the steps in [Take a volume offline](../articles/storsimple/storsimple-manage-volumes.md#take-a-volume-offline). After the volumes are offline, you can delete them. When the volume container has no associated volumes, delete the volume container as described above.
