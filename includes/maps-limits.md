> **Azure Maps Gen1 Price Tier Retirement**
>
> Gen1 pricing tier is now deprecated and will be retired on 9/15/26. Gen2 pricing tier replaces Gen1 (both S0 and S1) pricing tier. If your Azure Maps account has Gen1 pricing tier selected, you can switch to Gen2 pricing before it's retired, otherwise it will automatically be updated. For more information, see [Manage the pricing tier of your Azure Maps account](../articles/azure-maps/how-to-manage-pricing-tier.md).

For Azure Maps queries per second limits, see [Azure Maps QPS rate limits](../articles/azure-maps/azure-maps-qps-rate-limits.md)

The following table shows the cumulative data size limit for Azure Maps accounts in an Azure subscription. The Azure Maps Data service is available only at the Gen1 (S1) and Gen2 pricing tier.

| Resource                               | Limit  |
|----------------------------------------|:------:|
| Maximum storage per Azure subscription |   1 GB |
| Maximum size per file upload           | 100 MB |
