<!-- This tells how to create a custom shared access policy for your IoT hub and get the connection string for it-->

To create a shared access policy that grants **service connect** and **registry read** permissions and get a connection string for this policy, follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups**. Select the resource group where your hub is located, and then select your hub from the list of resources.

1. On the left-side pane of your hub, select **Shared access policies**.

1. From the top menu above the list of policies, select **Add shared policy access policy**.

1. In the **Add shared access policy** pane on the right, enter a descriptive name for your policy, such as *serviceAndRegistryRead*. Under **Permissions**, select **Registry Read** and **Service Connect**, and then select **Add**.
