  > Azure PowerShell support for managing HDInsight resources by using Azure Service Manager is deprecated, and the support was removed on January 1, 2017. The procedure in this document uses new HDInsight cmdlets that work with Azure Resource Manager.
  > 
  > To install the latest version of Azure PowerShell, see [Install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs). If you have scripts that must be modified to use the new cmdlets, see [Migrate to Azure Resource Manager-based development tools for HDInsight clusters](../articles/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-development-using-azure-resource-manager.md).
