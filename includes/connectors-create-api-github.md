1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your logic app workflow in the designer.

1. In the designer search box, enter **github**. If your workflow is blank, select the trigger that you want to use. If your workflow already has a trigger, select the action that you want to use.

   This example continues with a GitHub trigger.

1. If you didn't previously create a connection, select **Sign in** so you can provide your GitHub credentials when prompted.

   Your workflow requires these credentials for authenticating your identity to GitHub.

1. Provide your GitHub user name and password. To confirm access to your GitHub account, authorize Azure Logic Apps (**aaptapps**) to create the connection.
