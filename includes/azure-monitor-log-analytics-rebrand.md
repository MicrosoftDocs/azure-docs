>[!NOTE]
> This article was recently updated to use the term Azure Monitor logs instead of Log Analytics. Log data is still stored in a Log Analytics workspace and is still collected and analyzed by the same Log Analytics service. We are updating the terminology to better reflect the role of [logs in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-platform-logs). See [Azure Monitor terminology changes](/azure/azure-monitor/terminology) for details.
