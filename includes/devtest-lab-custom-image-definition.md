In Azure DevTest Labs, you can use custom images to:

- Create a VM from a VHD file that has all the software you need preinstalled.
- Create VMs quickly, because you don't have to install all the required software on the target machines.
- Clone a VM by creating a custom image from a VM, and then creating VMs based on that image.
