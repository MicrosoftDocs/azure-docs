When you're finished using your Cosmos DB account, you can delete the Azure resources you created for this quickstart, so you don't incur any more charges. To delete the resources:

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** on the far left. If the left menu is collapsed, click ![Expand button](./media/cosmos-db-delete-resource-group/expand.png) to expand it.

2. Select the resource group you created for this quickstart.

2. In the new window, select **Delete resource group**.
