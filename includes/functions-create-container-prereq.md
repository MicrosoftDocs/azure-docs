## Create the custom container

If you haven't already done so, complete the previous quickstart article [Create a function that runs in custom container](../articles/azure-functions/functions-create-function-linux-custom-image.md) to create and publish a custom container with your first function app. 

This article creates a container image named `azurefunctionsimage` in either Azure Container Registry or Docker Hub. If you chose a different name for your image, you'll need to modify the examples in this article.
