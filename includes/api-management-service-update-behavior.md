> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changes to your API Management service's infrastructure (such as configuring custom domains, adding CA certificates, scaling, virtual network configuration, availability zone changes, and region additions) can take 15 minutes or longer to complete, depending on the service tier and the size of the deployment. Expect longer times for an instance with a greater number of scale units or multi-region configuration. Rolling changes to API Management are executed carefully to preserve capacity and availability.
>
> While the service is updating, other service infrastructure changes can't be made. However, you can configure APIs, products, policies, and user settings. The service will **not** experience gateway downtime, and API Management **will continue** to service API requests without interruption (except in the Developer tier).
