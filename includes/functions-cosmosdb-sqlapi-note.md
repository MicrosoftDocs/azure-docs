Azure Cosmos DB bindings are only supported for use with Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. Support for Azure Cosmos DB for Table is provided by using the [Table storage bindings](../articles/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-table.md?tabs=in-process%2Ctable-api%2Cextensionv3#table-api-extension), starting with extension 5.x. For all other Azure Cosmos DB APIs, you should access the database from your function by using the static client for your API, including [Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB](/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb-introduction), [Azure Cosmos DB for Cassandra](/azure/cosmos-db/cassandra-introduction), and [Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Gremlin](/azure/cosmos-db/graph-introduction).
