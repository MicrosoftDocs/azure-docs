This article uses PowerShell cmdlets. To run the cmdlets, you can use Azure Cloud Shell, a free interactive shell. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account. Just click the **Copy** to copy the code, paste it into the Cloud Shell, and then press enter to run it. There are a few ways to launch the Cloud Shell:

|  |   |
|-----------------------------------------------|---|
| Click **Try It** in the upper right corner of a code block. | ![Cloud Shell in this article](./media/vpn-gateway-cloud-shell-powershell/cloud-shell-powershell-try-it.png) |
| Open Cloud Shell in your browser. | [![https://shell.azure.com/powershell](./media/vpn-gateway-cloud-shell-powershell/launchcloudshell.png)](https://shell.azure.com/powershell) |
| Click the **Cloud Shell** button on the menu in the upper right of the Azure portal. | [![Cloud Shell in the portal](./media/vpn-gateway-cloud-shell-powershell/cloud-shell-menu.png)](https://portal.azure.com) |

If you don't want to use Azure Cloud Shell, you can install PowerShell locally instead. If you choose to install and use PowerShell locally, be sure to install the latest version of the Azure Resource Manager PowerShell cmdlets to get the latest feature functionality.

To find the version of PowerShell that you are running locally, use the 'Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM' cmdlet. To update, see [Install the Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps). 

For more information, see [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/overview).
