**Configuration and process server requirements**


## Hardware requirements

**Component** | **Requirement** 
--- | ---
CPU cores | 8 
RAM | 16 GB
Number of disks | 3, including the OS disk, process server cache disk, and retention drive for failback 
Free disk space (process server cache) | 600 GB
Free disk space (retention disk) | 600 GB
 | 

## Software requirements

**Component** | **Requirement** 
--- | ---
Operating system | Windows Server 2012 R2 <br> Windows Server 2016 <br> **Note**: Windows Server 2019 is only supported for modernized architecture. As classic architecture is under deprecation, no new feature supports will be added to it. We suggest you use the [modernized architecture](../articles/site-recovery/replication-appliance-support-matrix.md#software-requirements).
Operating system locale | English (en-*)
Windows Server roles | Don't enable these roles: <br> - Active Directory Domain Services <br>- Internet Information Services <br> - Hyper-V 
Group policies | Don't enable these group policies: <br> - Prevent access to the command prompt. <br> - Prevent access to registry editing tools. <br> - Trust logic for file attachments. <br> - Turn on Script Execution. <br> [Learn more](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-7/gg176671(v=ws.10))
IIS | - No pre-existing default website <br> - No pre-existing website/application listening on port 443 <br>- Enable  [anonymous authentication](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731244(v=ws.10)) <br> - Enable [FastCGI](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc753077(v=ws.10)) setting 
FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) | Do not enable FIPS mode
|

## Network requirements

**Component** | **Requirement** 
--- | --- 
IP address type | Static 
Ports | 443 (Control channel orchestration)<br>9443 (Data transport) 
NIC type | VMXNET3 (if the configuration server is a VMware VM)
 |
**Internet access**  (the server needs access to the following URLs, directly or via proxy):|
\*.backup.windowsazure.com | Used for replicated data transfer and coordination
\*.blob.core.windows.net | Used to access storage account that stores replicated data. You can provide the specific URL of your cache storage account.
\*.hypervrecoverymanager.windowsazure.com | Used for replication management operations and coordination
https:\//login.microsoftonline.com | Used for replication management operations and coordination 
time.nist.gov | Used to check time synchronization between system and global time
time.windows.com | Used to check time synchronization between system and global time
| <ul> <li> \*.management.azure.com </li><li> https:\//secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com </li><li> https:\//login.live.com </li><li> https:\//graph.windows.net </li><li> https:\//login.windows.net </li><li> *.services.visualstudio.com (Optional) </li><li> https:\//www.live.com </li><li> https:\//www.microsoft.com </li></ul> | OVF setup needs access to these additional URLs. They're used for access control and identity management by Microsoft Entra ID.
https:\//dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQLInstaller/mysql-installer-community-5.7.20.0.msi  | To complete MySQL download. </br> In a few regions, the download might be redirected to the CDN URL. Ensure that the CDN URL is also approved, if necessary.
|

> [!NOTE]
> If you have [private links connectivity](../articles/site-recovery/hybrid-how-to-enable-replication-private-endpoints.md) to Site Recovery vault, you do not need any additional internet access for the Configuration Server. An exception to this is while setting up the CS machine using OVA template, you will need access to following URLs over and above private link access - https://www.live.com and https://www.microsoft.com. If you do not wish to allow access to these URLs, please set up the CS using Unified Installer.

> [!NOTE]
> While setting up private endpoints to protect VMware and physical machines, you will need to install MySQL on the configuration server manually. Follow the steps [here](../articles/site-recovery/vmware-azure-deploy-configuration-server.md#configure-settings) to perform the manual installation. 

## Required software

**Component** | **Requirement** 
--- | ---
VMware vSphere PowerCLI | Not required for versions 9.14 and higher
MYSQL | MySQL should be installed. You can install manually, or Site Recovery can install it. (Refer to [configure settings](../articles/site-recovery/vmware-azure-deploy-configuration-server.md#configure-settings) for more information)
|

> [!NOTE]
> Upgrading MySQL on the configuration server is not supported.

## Sizing and capacity requirements

The following table summarizes capacity requirements for the configuration server. If you're replicating multiple VMware VMs, review the [capacity planning considerations](../articles/site-recovery/site-recovery-plan-capacity-vmware.md) and run the [Azure Site Recovery Deployment Planner tool](../articles/site-recovery/site-recovery-deployment-planner.md).


**CPU** | **Memory** | **Cache disk** | **Data change rate** | **Replicated machines**
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
8 vCPUs<br/><br/> 2 sockets * 4 cores \@ 2.5 GHz | 16 GB | 300 GB | 500 GB or less | < 100 machines
12 vCPUs<br/><br/> 2 socks  * 6 cores \@ 2.5 GHz | 18 GB | 600 GB | 500 GB-1 TB | 100 to 150 machines
16 vCPUs<br/><br/> 2 socks  * 8 cores \@ 2.5 GHz | 32 GB | 1 TB | 1-2 TB | 150 -200 machines
