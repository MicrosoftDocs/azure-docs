You can increase or decrease compute by adjusting Data Warehouse Units (DWUs). The default is 400 DWUs. Compute resources increase linearly as the DWUs increase. For example, changing DWUs from 400 to 800 will double the compute resources. 

For a list of the current DWU settings, see the Service Level Objective in [Service capacity limits](../articles/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-service-capacity-limits.md).
