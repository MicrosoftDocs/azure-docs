## Zero Trust

This feature helps organizations to align their [identities](/security/zero-trust/deploy/identity) with the three guiding principles of a Zero Trust architecture: 

- Verify explicitly
- Use least privilege
- Assume breach

To find out more about Zero Trust and other ways to align your organization to the guiding principles, see the [Zero Trust Guidance Center](/security/zero-trust/).
