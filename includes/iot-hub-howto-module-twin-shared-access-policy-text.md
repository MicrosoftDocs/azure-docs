<!-- This contains intro text for the "Get an IoT hub connection string" section in the iot-hub-lang-lang-module-twin-getstarted.md files-->

In this article, you create a back-end service that adds a device in the identity registry and then adds a module to that device. Your service requires the **registry write** permission. By default, every IoT hub is created with a shared access policy named **registryReadWrite** that grants this permission.
