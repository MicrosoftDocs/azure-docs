> [!NOTE]  
> The default time zone used to run CRON expressions is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). To have your CRON expression run based on another time zone, create an app setting for your function app named WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE. To learn more, see [NCRONTAB time zones](../articles/azure-functions/functions-bindings-timer.md#ncrontab-time-zones).
