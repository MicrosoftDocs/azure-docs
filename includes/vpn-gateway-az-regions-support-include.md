The steps in this article use the gateway SKU **VpnGw2AZ**, which is a SKU that supports Azure availability zones. Effective May 2025, all regions will accept an **AZ** SKU, regardless of whether availability zones are supported in that region. For more information about gateway SKUs, see [About gateway SKUs](../articles/vpn-gateway/about-gateway-skus.md).
