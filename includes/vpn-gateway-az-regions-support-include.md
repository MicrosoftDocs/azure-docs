The steps in this article use the gateway SKU **VpnGw2AZ**, which is a SKU that supports Azure availability zones. If availability zones aren't supported for your region, use a non-AZ SKU instead. For more information about SKUs, see [About gateway SKUs](../articles/vpn-gateway/about-gateway-skus.md).
