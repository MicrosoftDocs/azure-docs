>[!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Digital Twins Explorer **does not support** private endpoints. If you want to use Azure Digital Twins Explorer with an Azure Digital Twins instance that uses [Private Link](../articles/digital-twins/concepts-security.md#private-network-access-with-azure-private-link) to disable public access, you can deploy the Azure Digital Twins Explorer codebase privately in the cloud. For instructions on how to do this, see [Azure Digital Twins Explorer: Running in the cloud](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/digital-twins-explorer#running-in-the-cloud).
