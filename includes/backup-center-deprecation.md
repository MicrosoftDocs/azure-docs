>[!Important]
>The Backup center has evolved to offer advanced BCDR management capabilities at scale. We recommend you to use [Azure Business Continuity Center](/azure/business-continuity-center/business-continuity-center-overview) for comprehensive BCDR management of your protected resources across Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery. Backup center is no longer available from Azure Portal search. You can go to Backup center from the **Azure Business Continuity center Help** menu. Learn about [switching to Azure Business Continuity Center for your at scale BCDR management needs](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-storage-blog/switch-to-azure-business-continuity-center-for-your-at-scale/ba-p/4246169).
