```json
{
    "version": "2.0",
    "extensionBundle": {
        "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
        "version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
    }
}
```

In this example, the `version` value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)` instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0` but less than `5.0.0`, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.
