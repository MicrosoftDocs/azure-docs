## Prerequisites

Before beginning this tutorial, start with these prerequisites:
* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
* This tutorial uses .NET. You can download the latest version of the .NET SDK for multiple platforms from [Download .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

Then, continue through the rest of this section to set up the remaining prerequisites.

### Get sample resources

The tutorial is driven by an [Azure Digital Twins end-to-end sample project written in C#](/samples/azure-samples/digital-twins-samples/digital-twins-samples). Get the sample project on your machine by navigating to the sample link, and selecting the **Browse code** button underneath the title. 

This will take you to the GitHub repo for the samples, which you can download as a .zip by selecting the **Code** button followed by **Download ZIP**.
