### Required permissions

To deploy a Bicep file or ARM template, you need write access on the resources you're deploying and access to all operations on the `Microsoft.Resources/deployments` resource type. For example, to deploy a virtual machine, you need `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write` and `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*` permissions.  The what-if operation has the same permission requirements.

For a list of roles and permissions, see [Azure built-in roles](../articles/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md).
