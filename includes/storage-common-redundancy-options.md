Replication options for a storage account include:

* [Locally-redundant storage (LRS)](../articles/storage/common/storage-redundancy-lrs.md): The default and low-cost option for replication of data in Azure Storage.
* [Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)](../articles/storage/common/storage-redundancy-zrs.md): A simple option for high availability and durability.
* [Geo-redundant storage (GRS)](../articles/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs.md): Cross-regional replication to protect against regional disasters.
* [Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)](../articles/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs.md#read-access-geo-redundant-storage): Cross-regional replication with read access to the replica.
* [ZRS Classic](../articles/storage/common/storage-redundancy-zrs-classic.md): Classic option for legacy applications using ZRS, available only for block blobs in general-purpose V1 storage accounts.
