If you don't have an existing project, this section shows you how to set up a project to work with the Azure Blob Storage client library for Java. For more information, see [Get started with Azure Blob Storage and Java](../../articles/storage/blobs/storage-blob-java-get-started.md).

To work with the code examples in this article, follow these steps to set up your project.

> [!NOTE]
> This article uses the Maven build tool to build and run the example code. Other build tools, such as Gradle, also work with the Azure SDK for Java.

#### Install packages

Open the `pom.xml` file in your text editor. Install the packages by [including the BOM file](../../articles/storage/blobs/storage-blob-java-get-started.md#include-the-bom-file), or [including a direct dependency](../../articles/storage/blobs/storage-blob-java-get-started.md#include-a-direct-dependency).
