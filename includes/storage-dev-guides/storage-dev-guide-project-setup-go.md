This section shows how to set up your project to work with the Azure Blob Storage client module for Go. The steps include module installation, adding `import` paths, and creating an authorized client object. For details, see [Get started with Azure Blob Storage and Go](../../articles/storage/blobs/storage-blob-go-get-started.md).

#### Install modules

Install the [azblob](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/storage/azblob/) module using the following command:

```console
go get github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/storage/azblob
```
To authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID (recommended), install the [`azidentity`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity) module using the following command:

```console
go get github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity
```

#### Add import paths

In your code file, add the following import paths:

```go
import (
    "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity"
	"github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/storage/azblob"
)
```

Some code examples in this article might require additional import paths. For specific details and example usage, see [Code samples](#code-samples).

#### Create a client object

To connect an app to Blob Storage, create a client object using [azblob.NewClient](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/storage/azblob#NewClient). The following example shows how to create a client object using `DefaultAzureCredential` for authorization:
