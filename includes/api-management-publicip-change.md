When changing from an internal to external virtual network, updating an API Management instance in a VNet by migrating from the `stv1` to `stv2` platform, or changing subnets in the network, you can configure a different [public IP address](../articles/api-management/api-management-using-with-vnet.md?tabs=stv2#prerequisites). If you don't provide one, an Azure-managed public IP address is automatically configured.
