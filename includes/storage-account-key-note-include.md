> Your storage account key is similar to the root password for your storage account. Always be careful to protect your account key. Avoid distributing it to other users, hard-coding it, or saving it anywhere in plaintext that is accessible to others. Regenerate your account key using the Azure portal if you believe it may have been compromised.

> Microsoft recommends using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication for your Blob and Queue storage applications (preview) when possible for enhanced security. For more information, see [Authenticate access to Azure blobs and queues using Azure Active Directory (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad).
