> [!NOTE]
> For web workloads, we highly recommend utilizing [**Azure DDoS protection**](/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview) and a [**web application firewall**](/azure/web-application-firewall/overview) to safeguard against emerging DDoS attacks. Another option is to employ [**Azure Front Door**](/azure/frontdoor/web-application-firewall) along with a web application firewall. Azure Front Door offers [**platform-level protection**](/azure/frontdoor/front-door-ddos) against network-level DDoS attacks. For more information, see [**security baseline for Azure services**](/security/benchmark/azure/security-baselines-overview).
