1. In the portal, go to the virtual network gateway that you want to reset.
1. On the **Virtual network gateway** page, in the left pane, scroll and locate **Help -> Reset**.
1. On the **Reset** page, select **Reset**. After the command is issued, the current active instance of Azure VPN gateway is rebooted immediately. Resetting the gateway causes a gap in VPN connectivity and might limit future root cause analysis of the issue.
