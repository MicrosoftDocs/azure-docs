Rate limit counts in a self-hosted gateway can be configured to synchronize locally (among gateway instances across cluster nodes), for example, through Helm chart deployment for Kubernetes or using the Azure portal [deployment templates](../articles/api-management/how-to-deploy-self-hosted-gateway-kubernetes.md). However, rate limit counts don't synchronize with other gateway resources configured in the API Management instance, including the managed gateway in the cloud.
