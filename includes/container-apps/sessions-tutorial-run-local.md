1. Run the sample app:

    ```bash
    fastapi dev main.py
    ```

1. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs`. You see the Swagger UI for the sample app.

1. Expand the `/chat` endpoint and select **Try it out**.

1. Enter `What time is it right now?` in the `message` field and select **Execute**.
