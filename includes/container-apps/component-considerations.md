| Item | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Scope | Components run in the same environment as the connected container app. |
| Scaling | Component canâ€™t scale. The scaling properties `minReplicas` and `maxReplicas` are both set to `1`. |
| Resources | The container resource allocation for components is fixed. The number of the CPU cores is 0.5, and the memory size is 1 Gi. |
| Pricing | Component billing falls under consumption-based pricing. Resources consumed by managed components are billed at the active/idle rates. You can delete components that are no longer in use to stop billing. |
| Binding | Container apps connect to a component via a binding. The bindings inject configurations into container app environment variables. After a binding is established, the container app can read the configuration values from environment variables and connect to the component. |
