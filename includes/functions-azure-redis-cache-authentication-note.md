> For optimal security, your function app should use Microsoft Entra ID with managed identities to authorize requests against your cache, if possible. Authorization by using Microsoft Entra ID and managed identities provides superior security and ease of use over shared access key authorization. For more information about using managed identities with your cache, see [Use Microsoft Entra ID for cache authentication](/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-azure-active-directory-for-authentication).
