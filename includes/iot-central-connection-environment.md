Set the environment variables to configure the sample. The following snippet shows how set the environment variables at the Windows command prompt. If you're using a **bash** shell, replace the `set` commands with `export` commands:

```cmd
set IOTHUB_DEVICE_SECURITY_TYPE=DPS
set IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ID_SCOPE=<The ID scope you made a note of previously>
set IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_ID=sample-device-01
set IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_KEY=<The generated device key you made a note of previously>
set IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ENDPOINT=global.azure-devices-provisioning.net
```
