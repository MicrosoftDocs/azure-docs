To connect a device to IoT Hub using an X.509 certificate:

1. Use [DeviceAuthenticationWithX509Certificate](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.devices.client.deviceauthenticationwithx509certificate) to create an object that contains device and certificate information. `DeviceAuthenticationWithX509Certificate` is passed as the second parameter to `DeviceClient.Create` (step 2).

1. Use [DeviceClient.Create](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.devices.client.deviceclient.create?&#microsoft-azure-devices-client-deviceclient-create(system-string-microsoft-azure-devices-client-iauthenticationmethod-microsoft-azure-devices-client-transporttype)) to connect the device to IoT Hub using an X.509 certificate.

In this example, device and certificate information is populated in the `auth` `DeviceAuthenticationWithX509Certificate` object that is passed to `DeviceClient.Create`.

This example shows certificate input parameter values as local variables for clarity. In a production system, store sensitive input parameters in environment variables or another more secure storage location. For example, use `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("HOSTNAME")` to read the host name environment variable.

```csharp
RootCertPath = "~/certificates/certs/sensor-thl-001-device.cert.pem";
Intermediate1CertPath = "~/certificates/certs/sensor-thl-001-device.intermediate1.cert.pem";
Intermediate2CertPath = "~/certificates/certs/sensor-thl-001-device.intermediate2.cert.pem";
DevicePfxPath = "~/certificates/certs/sensor-thl-001-device.cert.pfx";
DevicePfxPassword = "1234";
DeviceName = "MyDevice";
HostName = "xxxxx.azure-devices.net";

var chainCerts = new X509Certificate2Collection();
chainCerts.Add(new X509Certificate2(RootCertPath));
chainCerts.Add(new X509Certificate2(Intermediate1CertPath));
chainCerts.Add(new X509Certificate2(Intermediate2CertPath));
using var deviceCert = new X509Certificate2(DevicePfxPath, DevicePfxPassword);
using var auth = new DeviceAuthenticationWithX509Certificate(DeviceName, deviceCert, chainCerts);

using var deviceClient = DeviceClient.Create(
    HostName,
    auth,
    TransportType.Amqp);
```
