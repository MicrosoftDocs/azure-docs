#### Timeout values

##### From Client to Front Door

* Header timeout - After establishing TCP/TLS connection, Front Door has a 5-second timeout for receiving all headers from the client. The connection is terminated if the client doesn't send headers within 5 seconds. You can't configure this timeout value.
* HTTP keep-alive timeout - Front Door has a 90-second HTTP keep-alive timeout. The connection is terminated if the client doesn't send data for 90 seconds. You can't configure this timeout value.

##### Front Door to application back-end

* After the HTTP request gets forwarded to the back end, Azure Front Door waits for 60 seconds (Standard and Premium) or 30 seconds (classic) for the first packet from the back end. Then it returns a 503 error to the client, or 504 for a cached request. You can configure this value using the *originResponseTimeoutSeconds* field in Azure Front Door Standard and Premium API, or the sendRecvTimeoutSeconds field in the Azure Front Door (classic) API.

* After the back end receives the first packet, if the origin pauses for any reason in the middle of the response body beyond the originResponseTimeoutSeconds or sendRecvTimeoutSeconds, the response will be canceled.

* Front Door takes advantage of HTTP keep-alive to keep connections open for reuse from previous requests. These connections have an idle timeout of 90 seconds. Azure Front Door would disconnect idle connections after reaching the 90-second idle timeout. This timeout value can't be configured.

#### Upload and download data limit

|  | With chunked transfer encoding (CTE) | Without HTTP chunking |
| ---- | ------- | ------- |
| **Download** | There's no limit on the download size. | There's no limit on the download size. |
| **Upload** |    There's no limit as long as each CTE upload is less than 2 GB. | The size can't be larger than 2 GB. |

#### Other limits
* Maximum URL size - 8,192 bytes - Specifies maximum length of the raw URL (scheme + hostname + port + path + query string of the URL)
* Maximum Query String size - 4,096 bytes - Specifies the maximum length of the query string, in bytes.
* Maximum HTTP response header size from health probe URL - 4,096 bytes - Specified the maximum length of all the response headers of health probes. 
* Maximum rules engine action header value character: 640 characters.
* Maximum rules engine condition header value character: 256 characters.
* Maximum ETag header size: 128 bytes
* Maximum endpoint name for Standard and Premium: 46 characters.
