## Create an Azure account

1.  Open a web browser and browse to <http://azure.microsoft.com>

   Otherwise, navigate to the [create a free trial account](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) page and follow the steps to create a trial account. You'll need a credit card number and a mobile phone number for proof of identity, but you will not be billed.
