## Prerequisites

To work through this tutorial, you need a virtual hard disk (VHD) file uploaded to the Azure Storage account for the lab where you want to create the custom image. To upload a VHD file to your storage account, follow the instructions in one of these articles:

- [Upload a VHD file by using the AzCopy command-line utility](../articles/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-upload-vhd-using-azcopy.md).
- [Upload a VHD file by using Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](../articles/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-upload-vhd-using-storage-explorer.md).
- [Upload a VHD file by using PowerShell](../articles/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-upload-vhd-using-powershell.md).
