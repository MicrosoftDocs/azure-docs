You can enable remote audio output for your VM. Some VMs automatically enable this setting, whereas others require you to enable audio settings manually. The settings are changed on the VM itself. Your Bastion deployment doesn't need any special configuration settings to enable remote audio output.

> [!NOTE]
> Audio output uses bandwidth on your internet connection.

To enable remote audio output on a Windows VM:

1. After you're connected to the VM, an audio button appears on the lower-right corner of the toolbar. Right-click the audio button, and then select **Sounds**.
1. A pop-up message asks if you want to enable the Windows Audio Service. Select **Yes**. You can configure more audio options in **Sound preferences**.
1. To verify sound output, hover over the audio button on the toolbar.
