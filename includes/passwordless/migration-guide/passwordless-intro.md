Application requests to Azure services must be authenticated using configurations such as account access keys or passwordless connections. However, you should prioritize passwordless connections in your applications when possible.

The following tutorial explains how to migrate an existing application to connect using passwordless connections. These same migration steps should apply whether you're using access keys, connection strings, or another secrets-based approach.
