When developing locally, make sure that the user account that connects to Azure Event Hubs has the correct permissions. You'll need the [Azure Event Hubs Data Owner](../../../articles/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#azure-event-hubs-data-owner) role in order to send and receive messages. To assign yourself this role, you'll need the User Access Administrator role, or another role that includes the `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` action. You can assign Azure RBAC roles to a user using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell. Learn more about the available scopes for role assignments on the [scope overview](../../../articles/role-based-access-control/scope-overview.md) page.

The following example assigns the `Azure Event Hubs Data Owner` role to your user account, which provides full access to Azure Event Hubs resources. In a real scenario, follow the [Principle of Least Privilege](../../../articles/active-directory/develop/secure-least-privileged-access.md) to give users only the minimum permissions needed for a more secure production environment.

### Azure built-in roles for Azure Event Hubs
For Azure Event Hubs, the management of namespaces and all related resources through the Azure portal and the Azure resource management API is already protected using the Azure RBAC model. Azure provides the below Azure built-in roles for authorizing access to an Event Hubs namespace:

- [Azure Event Hubs Data Owner](../../../articles/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#azure-event-hubs-data-owner): Enables data access to Event Hubs namespace and its entities (queues, topics, subscriptions, and filters)
- [Azure Event Hubs Data Sender](../../../articles/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#azure-event-hubs-data-sender): Use this role to give the sender access to Event Hubs namespace and its entities.
- [Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver](../../../articles/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#azure-event-hubs-data-receiver): Use this role to give the receiver access to Event Hubs namespace and its entities.

If you want to create a custom role, see [Rights required for Event Hubs operations](../../../articles/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-sas.md#rights-required-for-service-bus-operations).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In most cases, it will take a minute or two for the role assignment to propagate in Azure. In rare cases, it may take up to eight minutes. If you receive authentication errors when you first run your code, wait a few moments and try again.

### [Azure portal](#tab/roles-azure-portal)

1. In the Azure portal, locate your Event Hubs namespace using the main search bar or left navigation.

2. On the overview page, select **Access control (IAM)** from the left-hand menu.	

3. On the **Access control (IAM)** page, select the **Role assignments** tab.

4. Select **+ Add** from the top menu and then **Add role assignment** from the resulting drop-down menu.

5. Use the search box to filter the results to the desired role. For this example, search for `Azure Event Hubs Data Owner` and select the matching result. Then choose **Next**.

6. Under **Assign access to**, select **User, group, or service principal**, and then choose **+ Select members**.

7. In the dialog, search for your Microsoft Entra username (usually your *user@domain* email address) and then choose **Select** at the bottom of the dialog. 

8. Select **Review + assign** to go to the final page, and then **Review + assign** again to complete the process.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/roles-azure-cli)

To assign a role at the resource level using the Azure CLI, you first must retrieve the resource ID using the `az eventhubs namespace show` command. You can filter the output properties using the `--query` parameter. 

```azurecli
az eventhubs namespace show -g '<your-event-hub-resource-group>' -n '<your-event-hub-name> --query id
```

Copy the output `Id` from the preceding command. You can then assign roles using the [az role](/cli/azure/role) command of the Azure CLI.

```azurecli
az role assignment create --assignee "<user@domain>" \
--role "Azure Event Hubs Data Owner" \
--scope "<your-resource-id>"
```

### [PowerShell](#tab/roles-powershell)

To assign a role at the resource level using Azure PowerShell, you first must retrieve the resource ID using the `Get-AzResource` command.

```azurepowershell
Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName "<your-event-hub-resource-group>" -Name "<your-event-hub-name>"
```

Copy the `Id` value from the preceding command output. You can then assign roles using the [New-AzRoleAssignment](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azroleassignment) command in PowerShell.

```azurepowershell
New-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName <user@domain> `
-RoleDefinitionName "Azure Event Hubs Data Owner" `
-Scope <yourResourceId>
```
