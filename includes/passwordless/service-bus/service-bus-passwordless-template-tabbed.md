## Authenticate the app to Azure

This article shows you two ways of connecting to Azure Service Bus: **passwordless** and **connection string**. 

The first option shows you how to use your security principal in Microsoft Entra ID and role-based access control (RBAC) to connect to a Service Bus namespace. You don't need to worry about having a hard-coded connection string in your code, in a configuration file, or in a secure storage like Azure Key Vault. 

The second option shows you how to use a connection string to connect to a Service Bus namespace. If you're new to Azure, you might find the connection string option easier to follow. We recommend using the passwordless option in real-world applications and production environments. For more information, see [Service Bus authentication and authorization](../../../articles/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-authentication-and-authorization.md). To read more about passwordless authentication, see [Authenticate .NET apps](/dotnet/azure/sdk/authentication?tabs=command-line).

## Get the connection string

Creating a new namespace automatically generates an initial Shared Access Signature (SAS) policy with primary and secondary keys. It creates primary and secondary connection strings that each grant full control over all aspects of the namespace. For more information about how to create rules with more constrained rights for regular senders and receivers, see [Service Bus authentication and authorization](../../../articles/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-authentication-and-authorization.md).

A client can use the connection string to connect to the Service Bus namespace. To copy the primary connection string for your namespace, follow these steps: 

1. On the **Service Bus Namespace** page, in the left menu, expand **Settings**, then select **Shared access policies**.
1. On the **Shared access policies** page, select **RootManageSharedAccessKey**.
1. In the **Policy: RootManageSharedAccessKey** window, select the copy button next to **Primary Connection String**, to copy the connection string to your clipboard for later use. Paste this value into Notepad or some other temporary location.

   You can use this page to copy primary key, secondary key, primary connection string, and secondary connection string.
