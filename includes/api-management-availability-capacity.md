> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Max** aggregation of the capacity metric is only supported in the **Premium** tier of API Management. This aggregation is intended for informational purposes only and should not be used for scaling decisions or alerting. Short-lived spikes in **Max** capacity are expected and typically not a cause for concern. However, if these spikes persist for 15 consecutive minutes or longer, further investigation may be warranted. For more information, refer to [Use capacity for scaling decisions](../articles/api-management/api-management-capacity.md#use-capacity-for-scaling-decisions) mentioned later in this document.
