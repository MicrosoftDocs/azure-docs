Azure Storage encrypts all data in a storage account at rest. For more information, see [Azure Storage encryption for data at rest](../articles/storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md).

By default, data is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys. For more control over encryption keys, you can supply customer-managed keys to use for encryption of blob and file data. These keys must be present in Azure Key Vault for Functions to be able to access the storage account. To learn more, see [Encrypt your application data at rest using customer-managed keys](../articles/azure-functions/configure-encrypt-at-rest-using-cmk.md).
