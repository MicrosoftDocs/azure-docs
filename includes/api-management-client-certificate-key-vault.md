### Prerequisites for key vault integration

[!INCLUDE [api-management-workspace-availability](api-management-workspace-availability.md)]

1. If you don't already have a key vault, create one. For steps to create a key vault, see [Quickstart: Create a key vault using the Azure portal](/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal).

    To create or import a certificate to the key vault, see [Quickstart: Set and retrieve a certificate from Azure Key Vault using the Azure portal](/azure/key-vault/certificates/quick-create-portal).

1. Enable a system-assigned or user-assigned [managed identity](../articles/api-management/api-management-howto-use-managed-service-identity.md) in the API Management instance.

[!INCLUDE [api-management-key-vault-access](./api-management-key-vault-access.md)]

## Add a key vault certificate

See [Prerequisites for key vault integration](#prerequisites-for-key-vault-integration).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When adding a key vault certificate to your API Management instance, you must have permissions to list secrets from the key vault.

> [!CAUTION]
> When using a key vault certificate in API Management, be careful not to delete the certificate, key vault, or managed identity used to access the key vault.

To add a key vault certificate to API Management:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your API Management instance.
1. Under **Security**, select **Certificates**.
1. Select **Certificates** > **+ Add**.
1. In **Id**, enter a name of your choice.
1. In **Certificate**, select **Key vault**.
1. Enter the identifier of a key vault certificate, or choose **Select** to select a certificate from a key vault.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you enter a key vault certificate identifier yourself, ensure that it doesn't have version information. Otherwise, the certificate won't rotate automatically in API Management after an update in the key vault.
1. In **Client identity**, select a system-assigned or an existing user-assigned managed identity. Learn how to [add or modify managed identities in your API Management service](../articles/api-management/api-management-howto-use-managed-service-identity.md).
    > [!NOTE]
    > The identity needs permissions to get and list certificate from the key vault. If you haven't already configured access to the key vault, API Management prompts you so it can automatically configure the identity with the necessary permissions.
1. Select **Add**.
