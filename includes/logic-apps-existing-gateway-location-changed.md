**Q**: Why did the location for my existing gateway change? <br/>
**A**: Gateway resources created before May 3, 2017 were moved to the original locations of the Microsoft Entra tenant for the work or school account that created those gateways. However, these changes shouldn't affect currently running logic apps, which should continue working as usual. With the gateway's general availability in May, gateway resource locations can differ from logic app locations.
