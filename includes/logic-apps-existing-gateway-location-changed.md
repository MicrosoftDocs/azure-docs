**Q**: Why did the location for my existing gateway change? <br/>
**A**: Gateway resources created before May 3, 2017 were 
moved to the original locations of the Azure AD tenant for 
the work or school account that created those gateways. 
However, these changes shouldn't affect currently running logic apps, 
which should continue working as usual. With the gateway's general 
availability in May, gateway resource locations can differ 
from logic app locations.
