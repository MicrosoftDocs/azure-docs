## Confirm settings before old gateway is purged

For scenarios in which the old gateway is temporarily retained after migration, the old and the new compute created during migration coexist for a short period of time, approximately 15 minutes, that you can use to validate the deployment and that your applications work as expected. For certain scenarios, you can optionally extend the retention period to 48 hours via a portal setting. 

* During this window, the old and new gateways are both online and serving traffic. You are not billed during this time. 
* Use this window to update any network dependencies including DNS, firewall rules, and VNets to use the new VIP address and subnet address space.
* Additionally, check the updated instance's network status to ensure connectivity of the instance to its dependencies. In the portal, in the left-hand menu, under **Deployment and infrastructure**, select **Network** > **Network status**. If needed, update settings such as UDRs and NSG rules.
* After the window, the old gateway is decommissioned and the new gateway is the only one serving traffic.
