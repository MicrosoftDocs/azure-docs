> Tutorials are typically longer and more complex than quickstarts. They are created from the list of top user tasks identified in milestone one and focus on the best procedure for completing that task. A tutorial usually aligns with one or two customer tasks. At a minimum, you need one tutorial in the Tutorials node of the TOC.

> Tutorials are 100 – 200 for an audience new to the service, product, or scenario. Ideally, your tutorials should build on each other using a common theme, resulting in a completed customer scenario. Unlike how-to content, they are not open-ended, complete walkthroughs of a feature.
