# Checklist for submitting Office and SharePoint Add-ins and Office 365 web apps to the Seller Dashboard







Before you submit Office and SharePoint Add-ins or Office 365 web apps in the Seller Dashboard:

- Review the current [Validation policies for apps and add-ins submitted to the Office Store (version 2.0)](Validation-policies-for-apps-and-add-ins-submitted-to-the-Office-Store-version-2.0.md). This will help you avoid common mistakes and verify that you’re fully compliant with the current validation requirements, and ensure that your app or add-in will pass validation when it is submitted to the Office Store for approval.
- Check the [](7f8445c7-f4f6-4cd7-888f-b0936aa8785b.md) to verify that you reside in a country or region that the Seller Dashboard supports.
- For Office Add-ins, validate your add-in manifest. You can validate your add-in manifest in two ways:
    - In Visual Studio, go to Build > Publish, and choose **Perform Validation check**.
    - Download the [Office App Compatibility Kit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46831) and run it on your add-in.

|![Seller Dashboard checklist checkbox](..\media\17bacc50-19b6-45fc-81ae-1097bdb3c928.gif)|Pricing information|The price is set at the app or add-in level. You don’t set a price for each language. You set a price tier. The price shown to customers is in the currency associated with the store the app or add-in is being sold in.You can list your app or add-in for free, for a one-time purchase, or as a perpetual monthly subscription. For a paid or subscription app or add-in, you can also choose whether you want to offer it as a trial, and if so, the duration of that trial.For SharePoint Add-ins, you can also set two additional pricing options: **Number of trial users** - This limits the total number of users on a given site who can use the add-in as a trial.**Price threshold** - This sets a limit on the amount a single buyer pays for purchasing multiple add-in licenses. For example, if you set the price threshold at ten users, the user is only charged for the first ten licenses they purchase.You can add this information at any time, so if you decide to list your add-in for purchase at a later date, you can add pricing information at that time. You can’t change the pricing from subscription to one-time charge, or vice versa, after you have submitted the add-in listing. This includes add-ins you submitted before the subscription pricing option was available.For more information, see [Decide on a pricing model for your Office or SharePoint Add-in or Office 365 web app](Decide-on-a-pricing-model-for-your-Office-or-SharePoint-Add-in-or-Office-365-web-app.md).|
