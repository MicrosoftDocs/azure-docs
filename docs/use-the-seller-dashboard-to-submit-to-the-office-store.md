# Use the Seller Dashboard to submit your solution to AppSource

If you want your Office Add-in, Office 365 web app, or Power BI custom visual to appear in AppSource and the in-product Store, you need to submit it to the [Seller Dashboard](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248605) for approval. First, familiarize yourself with the [AppSource validation policies](validation-policies.md). You can add and save your submission as a draft in your Seller Dashboard account until you're ready to submit it for approval.

If your SharePoint Add-in requires an Open Authorization (OAuth) client ID and client secret, you can add a client ID and client secret in the Seller Dashboard before you add your add-in. For more information, see [Create or update client IDs and secrets in the Seller Dashboard](create-or-update-client-ids-and-secrets.md).


For information about the AppSource approval process, see [Make your solutions available in AppSource and within Office](submit-to-the-office-store.md).
