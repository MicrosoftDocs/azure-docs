NAME
       curl - transfer a URL

SYNOPSIS
       curl [options / URLs]

DESCRIPTION
       curl  is  a tool for transferring data from or to a server. It supports
       these protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS,  HTTP,  HTTPS,
       IMAP,  IMAPS,  LDAP,  LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, SCP,
       SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET, TFTP, WS and WSS. The command  is
       designed to work without user interaction.

       curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authen-
       tication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file  trans-
       fer resume and more. As you will see below, the number of features will
       make your head spin.

       curl is powered by  libcurl  for  all  transfer-related  features.  See
       libcurl(3) for details.

URL
       The  URL  syntax is protocol-dependent. You find a detailed description
       in RFC 3986.

       You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs  by  writing  part  sets
       within braces and quoting the URL as in:

         "http://site.{one,two,three}.com"

       or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:

         "ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt"

         "ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001-100].txt"    (with leading zeros)

         "ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt"

       Nested  sequences  are not supported, but you can use several ones next
       to each other:

         "http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html"

       You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line.  They  will  be
       fetched  in a sequential manner in the specified order. You can specify
       command line options and URLs mixed and in any  order  on  the  command
       line.

       You  can  specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number
       or letter:

         "http://example.com/file[1-100:10].txt"

         "http://example.com/file[a-z:2].txt"

       When using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line  prompt,
       you probably have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid the
       shell from interfering with it. This also  goes  for  other  characters
       treated special, like for example '&', '?' and '*'.

       Provide  the IPv6 zone index in the URL with an escaped percentage sign
       and the interface name. Like in

         "http://[fe80::3%25eth0]/"

       If you specify URL without protocol:// prefix,  curl  will  attempt  to
       guess  what  protocol  you might want. It will then default to HTTP but
       try other protocols based on often-used host name prefixes.  For  exam-
       ple,  for  host names starting with "ftp." curl will assume you want to
       speak FTP.

       curl will do its best to use what you pass to it as a URL.  It  is  not
       trying  to  validate it as a syntactically correct URL by any means but
       is fairly liberal with what it accepts.

       curl will attempt to re-use connections for multiple file transfers, so
       that  getting many files from the same server will not do multiple con-
       nects / handshakes. This improves speed. Of course this is only done on
       files  specified  on  a  single command line and cannot be used between
       separate curl invocations.

OUTPUT
       If not told otherwise, curl writes the received data to stdout. It  can
       be  instructed  to  instead save that data into a local file, using the
       -o, --output or -O, --remote-name options. If curl  is  given  multiple
       URLs  to  transfer on the command line, it similarly needs multiple op-
       tions for where to save them.

       curl does not parse or otherwise "understand" the content  it  gets  or
       writes  as  output.  It does no encoding or decoding, unless explicitly
       asked to with dedicated command line options.

PROTOCOLS
       curl supports numerous protocols, or put in URL  terms:  schemes.  Your
       particular build may not support them all.

       DICT   Lets you lookup words using online dictionaries.

       FILE   Read  or  write  local  files.  curl  does not support accessing
              file:// URL remotely, but when running on Microsoft Windows  us-
              ing the native UNC approach will work.

       FTP(S) curl  supports  the  File Transfer Protocol with a lot of tweaks
              and levers. With or without using TLS.

       GOPHER(S)
              Retrieve files.

       HTTP(S)
              curl supports HTTP with numerous options and variations. It  can
              speak HTTP version 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 2 and 3 depending on build op-
              tions and the correct command line options.

       IMAP(S)
              Using the mail reading protocol, curl can "download" emails  for
              you. With or without using TLS.

       LDAP(S)
              curl can do directory lookups for you, with or without TLS.

       MQTT   curl supports MQTT version 3. Downloading over MQTT equals "sub-
              scribe" to a topic while uploading/posting equals "publish" on a
              topic. MQTT over TLS is not supported (yet).

       POP3(S)
              Downloading  from  a  pop3  server means getting a mail. With or
              without using TLS.

       RTMP(S)
              The Realtime Messaging Protocol  is  primarily  used  to  server
              streaming media and curl can download it.

       RTSP   curl supports RTSP 1.0 downloads.

       SCP    curl supports SSH version 2 scp transfers.

       SFTP   curl supports SFTP (draft 5) done over SSH version 2.

       SMB(S) curl supports SMB version 1 for upload and download.

       SMTP(S)
              Uploading  contents  to  an  SMTP server means sending an email.
              With or without TLS.

       TELNET Telling curl to fetch a telnet URL starts an interactive session
              where  it  sends  what  it  reads  on stdin and outputs what the
              server sends it.

       TFTP   curl can do TFTP downloads and uploads.

PROGRESS METER
       curl normally displays a progress meter during  operations,  indicating
       the  amount  of  transferred  data,  transfer speeds and estimated time
       left, etc. The progress meter displays the transfer rate in  bytes  per
       second.  The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based. For example 1k is
       1024 bytes. 1M is 1048576 bytes.

       curl displays this data to the terminal by default, so  if  you  invoke
       curl  to do an operation and it is about to write data to the terminal,
       it disables the progress meter as otherwise it would mess up the output
       mixing progress meter and response data.

       If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to
       redirect the response output to a file, using shell redirect  (>),  -o,
       --output or similar.

       This  does  not apply to FTP upload as that operation does not spit out
       any response data to the terminal.

       If you prefer a progress  "bar"  instead  of  the  regular  meter,  -#,
       --progress-bar  is your friend. You can also disable the progress meter
       completely with the -s, --silent option.

OPTIONS
       Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the  options  require  an
       additional value next to them.

       The  short  "single-dash"  form  of the options, -d for example, may be
       used with or without a space between it and its value, although a space
       is a recommended separator. The long "double-dash" form, -d, --data for
       example, requires a space between it and its value.

       Short version options that do not need any  additional  values  can  be
       used  immediately  next to each other, like for example you can specify
       all the options -O, -L and -v at once as -OLv.

       In general, all boolean options are enabled with --option and yet again
       disabled  with  --no-option.  That is, you use the same option name but
       prefix it with "no-". However, in this list we  mostly  only  list  and
       show the --option version of them.

       --abstract-unix-socket <path>
              (HTTP)  Connect  through an abstract Unix domain socket, instead
              of using the network.  Note: netstat shows the path  of  an  ab-
              stract  socket  prefixed  with  '@', however the <path> argument
              should not have this leading character.

              If --abstract-unix-socket is provided several  times,  the  last
              set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --abstract-unix-socket socketpath https://example.com

              See also --unix-socket. Added in 7.53.0.

       --alt-svc <file name>
              (HTTPS)  This  option enables the alt-svc parser in curl. If the
              file name points to an existing alt-svc cache file, that will be
              used. After a completed transfer, the cache will be saved to the
              file name again if it has been modified.

              Specify a "" file name (zero length) to avoid loading/saving and
              make curl just handle the cache in memory.

              If  this  option  is used several times, curl will load contents
              from all the files but the last one will be used for saving.

              --alt-svc can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --alt-svc svc.txt https://example.com

              See also --resolve and --connect-to. Added in 7.64.1.

       --anyauth
              (HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself,
              and  use  the most secure one the remote site claims to support.
              This is done by first doing a request and checking the response-
              headers,  thus  possibly  inducing  an extra network round-trip.
              This is  used  instead  of  setting  a  specific  authentication
              method,  which  you  can  do with --basic, --digest, --ntlm, and
              --negotiate.

              Using --anyauth is not recommended if you do uploads from stdin,
              since  it  may require data to be sent twice and then the client
              must be able to rewind. If the need should arise when  uploading
              from stdin, the upload operation will fail.

              Used together with -u, --user.

              Providing --anyauth multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --anyauth --user me:pwd https://example.com

              See also --proxy-anyauth, --basic and --digest.

       -a, --append
              (FTP SFTP) When used in an upload, this makes curl append to the
              target file instead of overwriting it. If the remote  file  does
              not exist, it will be created. Note that this flag is ignored by
              some SFTP servers (including OpenSSH).

              Providing -a, --append multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-append.

              Example:
               curl --upload-file local --append ftp://example.com/

              See also -r, --range and -C, --continue-at.

       --aws-sigv4 <provider1[:provider2[:region[:service]]]>
              Use AWS V4 signature authentication in the transfer.

              The  provider argument is a string that is used by the algorithm
              when creating outgoing authentication headers.

              The region argument is a string that points to a geographic area
              of  a resources collection (region-code) when the region name is
              omitted from the endpoint.

              The service argument is a string that points to a function  pro-
              vided by a cloud (service-code) when the service name is omitted
              from the endpoint.

              If --aws-sigv4 is provided several times,  the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --aws-sigv4 "aws:amz:east-2:es" --user "key:secret" https://example.com

              See also --basic and -u, --user. Added in 7.75.0.

       --basic
              (HTTP)  Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication with the re-
              mote host. This is the default and this option is usually point-
              less, unless you use it to override a previously set option that
              sets a different authentication method (such  as  --ntlm,  --di-
              gest, or --negotiate).

              Used together with -u, --user.

              Providing --basic multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl -u name:password --basic https://example.com

              See also --proxy-basic.

       --cacert <file>
              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify
              the peer. The file may contain  multiple  CA  certificates.  The
              certificate(s)  must be in PEM format. Normally curl is built to
              use a default file for this, so this option is typically used to
              alter that default file.

              curl  recognizes the environment variable named 'CURL_CA_BUNDLE'
              if it is set, and uses the given path as a path  to  a  CA  cert
              bundle. This option overrides that variable.

              The  windows  version  of  curl will automatically look for a CA
              certs file named 'curl-ca-bundle.crt', either in the same direc-
              tory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in any
              folder along your PATH.

              If curl is built against  the  NSS  SSL  library,  the  NSS  PEM
              PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) needs to be available for this op-
              tion to work properly.

              (iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure  Transport,
              then  this  option  is supported for backward compatibility with
              other SSL engines, but it should not be set. If  the  option  is
              not  set,  then curl will use the certificates in the system and
              user Keychain to verify the peer, which is the preferred  method
              of verifying the peer's certificate chain.

              (Schannel only) This option is supported for Schannel in Windows
              7 or later with libcurl 7.60 or later. This option is  supported
              for backward compatibility with other SSL engines; instead it is
              recommended to use Windows' store of root certificates (the  de-
              fault for Schannel).

              If  --cacert  is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --cacert CA-file.txt https://example.com

              See also --capath and -k, --insecure.

       --capath <dir>
              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate  directory  to
              verify  the  peer.  Multiple paths can be provided by separating
              them with ":" (e.g.  "path1:path2:path3"). The certificates must
              be  in PEM format, and if curl is built against OpenSSL, the di-
              rectory must have been processed using the c_rehash utility sup-
              plied  with  OpenSSL.  Using  --capath can allow OpenSSL-powered
              curl to make SSL-connections much more  efficiently  than  using
              --cacert if the --cacert file contains many CA certificates.

              If this option is set, the default capath value will be ignored.
              If  --capath  is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --capath /local/directory https://example.com

              See also --cacert and -k, --insecure.

       --cert-status
              (TLS) Tells curl to verify the status of the server  certificate
              by using the Certificate Status Request (aka. OCSP stapling) TLS
              extension.

              If this option is enabled and the server sends an invalid  (e.g.
              expired) response, if the response suggests that the server cer-
              tificate has been revoked, or no response at  all  is  received,
              the verification fails.

              This  is  currently  only implemented in the OpenSSL, GnuTLS and
              NSS backends.

              Providing --cert-status multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-cert-status.

              Example:
               curl --cert-status https://example.com

              See also --pinnedpubkey. Added in 7.41.0.

       --cert-type <type>
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  what type the provided client certificate is
              using. PEM, DER, ENG and P12 are recognized types.

              The default type depends on the TLS backend and is usually  PEM,
              however  for  Secure  Transport  and  Schannel it is P12. If -E,
              --cert is a pkcs11: URI then ENG is the default type.

              If --cert-type is provided several times,  the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --cert-type PEM --cert file https://example.com

              See also -E, --cert, --key and --key-type.

       -E, --cert <certificate[:password]>
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to use the specified client certificate file
              when getting a file with HTTPS, FTPS or another SSL-based proto-
              col.  The  certificate must be in PKCS#12 format if using Secure
              Transport, or PEM format if using any other engine. If  the  op-
              tional  password is not specified, it will be queried for on the
              terminal. Note that this option assumes a certificate file  that
              is  the private key and the client certificate concatenated. See
              -E, --cert and --key to specify them independently.

              In the <certificate> portion of the argument,  you  must  escape
              the  character  ":"  as "\:" so that it is not recognized as the
              password delimiter. Similarly, you must escape the character "\"
              as "\\" so that it is not recognized as an escape character.

              If  curl  is  built against the NSS SSL library then this option
              can tell curl the nickname of the certificate to use within  the
              NSS  database defined by the environment variable SSL_DIR (or by
              default /etc/pki/nssdb). If the NSS  PEM  PKCS#11  module  (lib-
              nsspem.so) is available then PEM files may be loaded.

              If  you  provide  a  path relative to the current directory, you
              must prefix the path with "./" in order to avoid confusion  with
              an NSS database nickname.

              If  curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine pkcs11
              is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to spec-
              ify  a  certificate located in a PKCS#11 device. A string begin-
              ning with "pkcs11:" will be interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI.  If  a
              PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the --engine option will be set as
              "pkcs11" if none was provided and the --cert-type option will be
              set as "ENG" if none was provided.

              (iOS  and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport,
              then the certificate string can either be the name of a certifi-
              cate/private  key in the system or user keychain, or the path to
              a PKCS#12-encoded certificate and private key. If  you  want  to
              use  a  file  from the current directory, please precede it with
              "./" prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.

              (Schannel only) Client certificates must be specified by a  path
              expression  to  a  certificate  store.  (Loading PFX is not sup-
              ported; you can import it to a store first). You can use "<store
              location>\<store  name>\<thumbprint>"  to refer to a certificate
              in  the  system  certificates  store,  for   example,   "Curren-
              tUser\MY\934a7ac6f8a5d579285a74fa61e19f23ddfe8d7a".   Thumbprint
              is usually a SHA-1 hex string which you can see  in  certificate
              details.  Following  store locations are supported: CurrentUser,
              LocalMachine, CurrentService, Services,  CurrentUserGroupPolicy,
              LocalMachineGroupPolicy, LocalMachineEnterprise.

              If -E, --cert is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --cert certfile --key keyfile https://example.com

              See also --cert-type, --key and --key-type.

       --ciphers <list of ciphers>
              (TLS) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The list
              of  ciphers  must  specify  valid ciphers. Read up on SSL cipher
              list details on this URL:

               https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

              If --ciphers is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-CCM8 https://example.com

              See also --tlsv1.3.

       --compressed-ssh
              (SCP SFTP) Enables built-in SSH compression.  This is a request,
              not an order; the server may or may not do it.

              Providing --compressed-ssh multiple times has no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-compressed-ssh.

              Example:
               curl --compressed-ssh sftp://example.com/

              See also --compressed. Added in 7.56.0.

       --compressed
              (HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms
              curl supports, and automatically decompress the content. Headers
              are not modified.

              If  this  option is used and the server sends an unsupported en-
              coding, curl will report an error. This is a request, not an or-
              der; the server may or may not deliver data compressed.

              Providing --compressed multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-compressed.

              Example:
               curl --compressed https://example.com

              See also --compressed-ssh.

       -K, --config <file>
              Specify a text file to read curl  arguments  from.  The  command
              line  arguments  found  in the text file will be used as if they
              were provided on the command line.

              Options and their parameters must be specified on the same  line
              in the file, separated by whitespace, colon, or the equals sign.
              Long option names can optionally be given  in  the  config  file
              without the initial double dashes and if so, the colon or equals
              characters can be used as separators. If the option is specified
              with  one or two dashes, there can be no colon or equals charac-
              ter between the option and its parameter.

              If the parameter contains whitespace (or starts with  :  or  =),
              the  parameter  must  be  enclosed  within quotes. Within double
              quotes, the following escape sequences are  available:  \\,  \",
              \t, \n, \r and \v. A backslash preceding any other letter is ig-
              nored.

              If the first column of a config line is  a  '#'  character,  the
              rest of the line will be treated as a comment.

              Only write one option per physical line in the config file.

              Specify  the  filename  to -K, --config as '-' to make curl read
              the file from stdin.

              Note that to be able to specify a URL in the  config  file,  you
              need  to  specify  it  using the --url option, and not by simply
              writing the URL on its own line. So, it could  look  similar  to
              this:

              url = "https://curl.se/docs/"

               # --- Example file ---
               # this is a comment
               url = "example.com"
               output = "curlhere.html"
               user-agent = "superagent/1.0"

               # and fetch another URL too
               url = "example.com/docs/manpage.html"
               -O
               referer = "http://nowhereatall.example.com/"
               # --- End of example file ---

              When  curl  is invoked, it (unless -q, --disable is used) checks
              for a default config file and uses it if found,  even  when  -K,
              --config  is used. The default config file is checked for in the
              following places in this order:

              1) "$CURL_HOME/.curlrc"

              2) "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.curlrc" (Added in 7.73.0)

              3) "$HOME/.curlrc"

              4) Windows: "%USERPROFILE%\.curlrc"

              5) Windows: "%APPDATA%\.curlrc"

              6) Windows: "%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\.curlrc"

              7) Non-Windows: use getpwuid to find the home directory

              8) On Windows, if it finds no .curlrc file in the  sequence  de-
              scribed  above,  it checks for one in the same dir the curl exe-
              cutable is placed.

              On Windows two filenames are checked per location:  .curlrc  and
              _curlrc,  preferring  the  former.  Older  versions  on  Windows
              checked for _curlrc only.

              -K, --config can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --config file.txt https://example.com

              See also -q, --disable.

       --connect-timeout <fractional seconds>
              Maximum time in seconds that  you  allow  curl's  connection  to
              take.   This  only  limits the connection phase, so if curl con-
              nects within the given period it will continue - if not it  will
              exit.  Since version 7.32.0, this option accepts decimal values.
              The "connection phase" is considered complete when the requested
              TCP, TLS or QUIC handshakes are done.

              The decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.)  as  decimal
              separator  - not the local version even if it might be using an-
              other separator.

              If --connect-timeout is provided several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --connect-timeout 20 https://example.com
               curl --connect-timeout 3.14 https://example.com

              See also -m, --max-time.

       --connect-to <HOST1:PORT1:HOST2:PORT2>

              For  a  request  to  the  given  HOST1:PORT1  pair,  connect  to
              HOST2:PORT2 instead.  This option is suitable to direct requests
              at a specific server, e.g. at a specific cluster node in a clus-
              ter of servers. This option is only used to establish  the  net-
              work  connection.  It  does NOT affect the hostname/port that is
              used for TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI, certificate verification) or for the
              application  protocols.  "HOST1"  and  "PORT1"  may be the empty
              string, meaning "any host/port". "HOST2" and "PORT2" may also be
              the   empty   string,   meaning   "use  the  request's  original
              host/port".

              A "host" specified to this option is compared as a string, so it
              needs  to  match  the name used in request URL. It can be either
              numerical such as "127.0.0.1" or the full host name such as "ex-
              ample.org".

              --connect-to can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --connect-to example.com:443:example.net:8443 https://example.com

              See also --resolve and -H, --header. Added in 7.49.0.

       -C, --continue-at <offset>
              Continue/Resume  a  previous  file transfer at the given offset.
              The given offset is the exact  number  of  bytes  that  will  be
              skipped,  counting  from the beginning of the source file before
              it is transferred to the destination. If used with uploads,  the
              FTP server command SIZE will not be used by curl.

              Use  "-C  -" to tell curl to automatically find out where/how to
              resume the transfer. It then uses the given  output/input  files
              to figure that out.

              If  -C,  --continue-at  is  provided several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl -C - https://example.com
               curl -C 400 https://example.com

              See also -r, --range.

       -c, --cookie-jar <filename>
              (HTTP) Specify to which file you want curl to write all  cookies
              after  a  completed  operation. Curl writes all cookies from its
              in-memory cookie storage to the given file at the end of  opera-
              tions.  If  no  cookies  are known, no data will be written. The
              file will be written using the Netscape cookie file  format.  If
              you set the file name to a single dash, "-", the cookies will be
              written to stdout.

              This command line option will activate the  cookie  engine  that
              makes curl record and use cookies. Another way to activate it is
              to use the -b, --cookie option.

              If the cookie jar cannot be created or  written  to,  the  whole
              curl  operation  will  not fail or even report an error clearly.
              Using -v, --verbose will get a warning displayed,  but  that  is
              the  only  visible  feedback  you get about this possibly lethal
              situation.

              If -c, --cookie-jar is provided  several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl -c store-here.txt https://example.com
               curl -c store-here.txt -b read-these https://example.com

              See also -b, --cookie.

       -b, --cookie <data|filename>
              (HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server in the Cookie header. It
              is supposedly the data previously received from the server in  a
              "Set-Cookie:"   line.   The   data   should  be  in  the  format
              "NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2". This makes  curl  use  the  cookie
              header  with this content explicitly in all outgoing request(s).
              If multiple requests are done due  to  authentication,  followed
              redirects or similar, they will all get this cookie passed on.

              If  no '=' symbol is used in the argument, it is instead treated
              as a filename to read previously stored cookie from. This option
              also activates the cookie engine which will make curl record in-
              coming cookies, which may be handy if you are using this in com-
              bination  with  the  -L,  --location  option  or do multiple URL
              transfers on the same invoke. If the file name is exactly a  mi-
              nus ("-"), curl will instead read the contents from stdin.

              The file format of the file to read cookies from should be plain
              HTTP headers (Set-Cookie style) or the  Netscape/Mozilla  cookie
              file format.

              The  file  specified with -b, --cookie is only used as input. No
              cookies will be written to the file. To store cookies,  use  the
              -c, --cookie-jar option.

              If  you  use the Set-Cookie file format and do not specify a do-
              main then the cookie is not sent since  the  domain  will  never
              match.  To  address this, set a domain in Set-Cookie line (doing
              that will include sub-domains) or preferably: use  the  Netscape
              format.

              Users  often want to both read cookies from a file and write up-
              dated cookies back to a file, so using both -b, --cookie and -c,
              --cookie-jar in the same command line is common.

              -b, --cookie can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl -b cookiefile https://example.com
               curl -b cookiefile -c cookiefile https://example.com

              See also -c, --cookie-jar and -j, --junk-session-cookies.

       --create-dirs
              When used in conjunction with the -o, --output option, curl will
              create the necessary local directory hierarchy as  needed.  This
              option  creates  the directories mentioned with the -o, --output
              option, nothing else. If the -o, --output file name uses no  di-
              rectory, or if the directories it mentions already exist, no di-
              rectories will be created.

              Created dirs are made with mode 0750 on unix style file systems.
              To create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try  --ftp-
              create-dirs.

              Providing  --create-dirs  multiple  times  has  no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-create-dirs.

              Example:
               curl --create-dirs --output local/dir/file https://example.com

              See also --ftp-create-dirs and --output-dir.

       --create-file-mode <mode>
              (SFTP SCP FILE) When curl is used to create files remotely using
              one  of  the supported protocols, this option allows the user to
              set which 'mode' to set on the file at creation time, instead of
              the default 0644.

              This option takes an octal number as argument.

              If  --create-file-mode  is  provided several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --create-file-mode 0777 -T localfile sftp://example.com/new

              See also --ftp-create-dirs. Added in 7.75.0.

       --crlf (FTP SMTP)  Convert  LF  to  CRLF  in  upload.  Useful  for  MVS
              (OS/390).

              (SMTP added in 7.40.0)

              Providing --crlf multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it
              again with --no-crlf.

              Example:
               curl --crlf -T file ftp://example.com/

              See also -B, --use-ascii.

       --crlfile <file>
              (TLS) Provide a file using PEM format with a Certificate Revoca-
              tion List that may specify peer certificates that are to be con-
              sidered revoked.

              If --crlfile is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --crlfile rejects.txt https://example.com

              See also --cacert and --capath.

       --curves <algorithm list>
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to request specific curves to use during SSL
              session establishment according to RFC 8422, 5.1.  Multiple  al-
              gorithms  can  be  provided  by  separating  them with ":" (e.g.
              "X25519:P-521").  The parameter is available identically in  the
              "openssl s_client/s_server" utilities.

              --curves  allows  a OpenSSL powered curl to make SSL-connections
              with exactly the (EC) curve requested by  the  client,  avoiding
              nontransparent client/server negotiations.

              If  this  option  is  set,  the  default  curves list built into
              openssl will be ignored.

              If --curves is provided several times, the last set  value  will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --curves X25519 https://example.com

              See also --ciphers. Added in 7.73.0.

       --data-ascii <data>
              (HTTP) This is just an alias for -d, --data.

              --data-ascii can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --data-ascii @file https://example.com

              See also --data-binary, --data-raw and --data-urlencode.

       --data-binary <data>
              (HTTP)  This  posts data exactly as specified with no extra pro-
              cessing whatsoever.

              If you start the data with the letter @, the rest  should  be  a
              filename. Data is posted in a similar manner as -d, --data does,
              except that newlines and carriage returns are preserved and con-
              versions are never done.

              Like  -d,  --data the default content-type sent to the server is
              application/x-www-form-urlencoded. If you want the  data  to  be
              treated as arbitrary binary data by the server then set the con-
              tent-type to octet-stream: -H "Content-Type:  application/octet-
              stream".

              If  this  option  is  used several times, the ones following the
              first will append data as described in -d, --data.

              --data-binary can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --data-binary @filename https://example.com

              See also --data-ascii.

       --data-raw <data>
              (HTTP) This posts data similarly to -d, --data but  without  the
              special interpretation of the @ character.

              --data-raw can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl --data-raw "hello" https://example.com
               curl --data-raw "@at@at@" https://example.com

              See also -d, --data. Added in 7.43.0.

       --data-urlencode <data>
              (HTTP)  This posts data, similar to the other -d, --data options
              with the exception that this performs URL-encoding.

              To be CGI-compliant, the <data> part should begin  with  a  name
              followed  by a separator and a content specification. The <data>
              part can be passed to curl using one of the following syntaxes:

              content
                     This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass  that
                     on.  Just be careful so that the content does not contain
                     any = or @ symbols, as that will  then  make  the  syntax
                     match one of the other cases below!

              =content
                     This  will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that
                     on. The preceding = symbol is not included in the data.

              name=content
                     This will make curl URL-encode the content part and  pass
                     that  on.  Note that the name part is expected to be URL-
                     encoded already.

              @filename
                     This will make curl load data from the  given  file  (in-
                     cluding  any  newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it
                     on in the POST.

              name@filename
                     This will make curl load data from the  given  file  (in-
                     cluding  any  newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it
                     on in the POST. The name part  gets  an  equal  sign  ap-
                     pended,  resulting  in name=urlencoded-file-content. Note
                     that the name is expected to be URL-encoded already.

       --data-urlencode can be used several times in a command line

       Examples:
        curl --data-urlencode name=val https://example.com
        curl --data-urlencode =encodethis https://example.com
        curl --data-urlencode name@file https://example.com
        curl --data-urlencode @fileonly https://example.com

       See also -d, --data and --data-raw.

       -d, --data <data>
              (HTTP MQTT) Sends the specified data in a POST  request  to  the
              HTTP server, in the same way that a browser does when a user has
              filled in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This  will
              cause curl to pass the data to the server using the content-type
              application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Compare to -F, --form.

              --data-raw is almost the same but does not have a special inter-
              pretation  of  the  @ character. To post data purely binary, you
              should instead use the --data-binary option. To  URL-encode  the
              value of a form field you may use --data-urlencode.

              If  any of these options is used more than once on the same com-
              mand line, the data pieces specified will be merged with a sepa-
              rating  &-symbol.  Thus,  using  '-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy'
              would    generate    a    post    chunk    that    looks    like
              'name=daniel&skill=lousy'.

              If  you  start  the data with the letter @, the rest should be a
              file name to read the data from, or - if you want curl  to  read
              the  data  from  stdin.  Posting data from a file named 'foobar'
              would thus be done with -d, --data @foobar. When -d,  --data  is
              told  to  read  from a file like that, carriage returns and new-
              lines will be stripped out. If you do not want the  @  character
              to have a special interpretation use --data-raw instead.

              -d, --data can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl -d "name=curl" https://example.com
               curl -d "name=curl" -d "tool=cmdline" https://example.com
               curl -d @filename https://example.com

              See  also  --data-binary,  --data-urlencode and --data-raw. This
              option is mutually exclusive to -F, --form and  -I,  --head  and
              -T, --upload-file.

       --delegation <LEVEL>
              (GSS/kerberos)  Set  LEVEL to tell the server what it is allowed
              to delegate when it comes to user credentials.

              none   Do not allow any delegation.

              policy Delegates if and only if the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag  is  set
                     in  the  Kerberos  service  ticket,  which is a matter of
                     realm policy.

              always Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.

       If --delegation is provided several times, the last set value  will  be
       used.

       Example:
        curl --delegation "none" https://example.com

       See also -k, --insecure and --ssl.

       --digest
              (HTTP)  Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is an authenti-
              cation scheme that prevents the password from  being  sent  over
              the  wire in clear text. Use this in combination with the normal
              -u, --user option to set user name and password.

              Providing --digest multiple times has no extra effect.   Disable
              it again with --no-digest.

              Example:
               curl -u name:password --digest https://example.com

              See  also  -u, --user, --proxy-digest and --anyauth. This option
              is mutually exclusive to --basic and --ntlm and --negotiate.

       --disable-eprt
              (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands
              when doing active FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first
              attempt to use EPRT, then LPRT before using PORT, but with  this
              option,  it  will  use PORT right away. EPRT and LPRT are exten-
              sions to the original FTP protocol, and  may  not  work  on  all
              servers, but they enable more functionality in a better way than
              the traditional PORT command.

              --eprt can be used to explicitly enable EPRT again and --no-eprt
              is an alias for --disable-eprt.

              If  the  server is accessed using IPv6, this option will have no
              effect as EPRT is necessary then.

              Disabling EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you want  to
              switch  to  passive  mode  you need to not use -P, --ftp-port or
              force it with --ftp-pasv.

              Providing --disable-eprt multiple times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-disable-eprt.

              Example:
               curl --disable-eprt ftp://example.com/

              See also --disable-epsv and -P, --ftp-port.

       --disable-epsv
              (FTP)  Tell curl to disable the use of the EPSV command when do-
              ing passive FTP transfers. Curl will normally always  first  at-
              tempt to use EPSV before PASV, but with this option, it will not
              try using EPSV.

              --epsv can be used to explicitly enable EPSV again and --no-epsv
              is an alias for --disable-epsv.

              If  the  server is an IPv6 host, this option will have no effect
              as EPSV is necessary then.

              Disabling EPSV only changes the passive behavior. If you want to
              switch to active mode you need to use -P, --ftp-port.

              Providing  --disable-epsv  multiple  times  has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-disable-epsv.

              Example:
               curl --disable-epsv ftp://example.com/

              See also --disable-eprt and -P, --ftp-port.

       -q, --disable
              If used as the first parameter on the command line,  the  curlrc
              config  file will not be read and used. See the -K, --config for
              details on the default config file search path.

              Providing -q, --disable multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-disable.

              Example:
               curl -q https://example.com

              See also -K, --config.

       --disallow-username-in-url
              (HTTP)  This  tells  curl  to  exit if passed a URL containing a
              username. This is probably most useful when  the  URL  is  being
              provided at runtime or similar.

              Providing --disallow-username-in-url multiple times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-disallow-username-in-url.

              Example:
               curl --disallow-username-in-url https://example.com

              See also --proto. Added in 7.61.0.

       --dns-interface <interface>
              (DNS) Tell curl to send outgoing DNS  requests  through  <inter-
              face>.  This  option is a counterpart to --interface (which does
              not affect DNS). The supplied string must be an  interface  name
              (not an address).

              If --dns-interface is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --dns-interface eth0 https://example.com

              See also --dns-ipv4-addr  and  --dns-ipv6-addr.  --dns-interface
              requires  that  the  underlying  libcurl was built to support c-
              ares. Added in 7.33.0.

       --dns-ipv4-addr <address>
              (DNS) Tell curl to bind to <ip-address> when making IPv4 DNS re-
              quests,  so  that  the DNS requests originate from this address.
              The argument should be a single IPv4 address.

              If --dns-ipv4-addr is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --dns-ipv4-addr 10.1.2.3 https://example.com

              See  also  --dns-interface  and --dns-ipv6-addr. --dns-ipv4-addr
              requires that the underlying libcurl was  built  to  support  c-
              ares. Added in 7.33.0.

       --dns-ipv6-addr <address>
              (DNS) Tell curl to bind to <ip-address> when making IPv6 DNS re-
              quests, so that the DNS requests originate  from  this  address.
              The argument should be a single IPv6 address.

              If --dns-ipv6-addr is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --dns-ipv6-addr 2a04:4e42::561 https://example.com

              See also --dns-interface  and  --dns-ipv4-addr.  --dns-ipv6-addr
              requires  that  the  underlying  libcurl was built to support c-
              ares. Added in 7.33.0.

       --dns-servers <addresses>
              Set the list of DNS servers to be used instead of the system de-
              fault.   The  list of IP addresses should be separated with com-
              mas. Port numbers may also optionally be given as :<port-number>
              after each IP address.

              If  --dns-servers  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --dns-servers 192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2 https://example.com

              See also --dns-interface and --dns-ipv4-addr. --dns-servers  re-
              quires  that the underlying libcurl was built to support c-ares.
              Added in 7.33.0.

       --doh-cert-status
              Same as --cert-status but used for DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS).

              Providing --doh-cert-status multiple times has no extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-doh-cert-status.

              Example:
               curl --doh-cert-status --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com

              See also --doh-insecure. Added in 7.76.0.

       --doh-insecure
              Same as -k, --insecure but used for DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS).

              Providing  --doh-insecure  multiple  times  has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-doh-insecure.

              Example:
               curl --doh-insecure --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com

              See also --doh-url. Added in 7.76.0.

       --doh-url <URL>
              Specifies which DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) server to  use  to  resolve
              hostnames, instead of using the default name resolver mechanism.
              The URL must be HTTPS.

              Some SSL options that you set for your transfer  will  apply  to
              DoH  since  the  name  lookups take place over SSL. However, the
              certificate verification settings are not inherited and  can  be
              controlled separately via --doh-insecure and --doh-cert-status.

              This  option  is unset if an empty string "" is used as the URL.
              (Added in 7.85.0)

              If --doh-url is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com

              See also --doh-insecure. Added in 7.62.0.

       -D, --dump-header <filename>
              (HTTP  FTP) Write the received protocol headers to the specified
              file. If no headers are received, the use of  this  option  will
              create an empty file.

              When  used  in FTP, the FTP server response lines are considered
              being "headers" and thus are saved there.

              Having multiple transfers in one set  of  operations  (i.e.  the
              URLs  in  one  -:,  --next clause), will append them to the same
              file, seperated by a blank line.

              If -D, --dump-header is provided several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --dump-header store.txt https://example.com

              See also -o, --output.

       --egd-file <file>
              (TLS)  Deprecated  option.  This option is ignored by curl since
              7.84.0. Prior to that it only had an effect on curl if built  to
              use old versions of OpenSSL.

              Specify  the  path  name to the Entropy Gathering Daemon socket.
              The socket is used to seed the random  engine  for  SSL  connec-
              tions.

              If --egd-file is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --egd-file /random/here https://example.com

              See also --random-file.

       --engine <name>
              (TLS) Select the OpenSSL crypto engine to use for cipher  opera-
              tions. Use --engine list to print a list of build-time supported
              engines. Note that not all (and possibly none)  of  the  engines
              may be available at runtime.

              If  --engine  is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --engine flavor https://example.com

              See also --ciphers and --curves.

       --etag-compare <file>
              (HTTP) This option makes a conditional HTTP request for the spe-
              cific ETag read from the given file by sending a custom If-None-
              Match header using the stored ETag.

              For correct results, make sure that the specified file  contains
              only  a  single  line  with  the  desired ETag. An empty file is
              parsed as an empty ETag.

              Use the option --etag-save to first save the  ETag  from  a  re-
              sponse,  and  then  use this option to compare against the saved
              ETag in a subsequent request.

              If --etag-compare is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --etag-compare etag.txt https://example.com

              See also --etag-save and -z, --time-cond. Added in 7.68.0.

       --etag-save <file>
              (HTTP)  This option saves an HTTP ETag to the specified file. An
              ETag is a caching related header,  usually  returned  in  a  re-
              sponse.

              If no ETag is sent by the server, an empty file is created.

              If  --etag-save  is  provided  several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --etag-save storetag.txt https://example.com

              See also --etag-compare. Added in 7.68.0.

       --expect100-timeout <seconds>
              (HTTP) Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl to wait for a
              100-continue  response  when curl emits an Expects: 100-continue
              header in its request. By default curl  will  wait  one  second.
              This  option accepts decimal values! When curl stops waiting, it
              will continue as if the response has been received.

              The decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.)  as  decimal
              separator  - not the local version even if it might be using an-
              other separator.

              If --expect100-timeout is provided several times, the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --expect100-timeout 2.5 -T file https://example.com

              See also --connect-timeout. Added in 7.47.0.

       --fail-early
              Fail and exit on the first detected transfer error.

              When  curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command line,
              it will attempt to operate on each given URL, one by one. By de-
              fault,  it  will  ignore errors if there are more URLs given and
              the last URL's success will determine the error  code  curl  re-
              turns. So early failures will be "hidden" by subsequent success-
              ful transfers.

              Using this option, curl will instead  return  an  error  on  the
              first  transfer  that  fails,  independent of the amount of URLs
              that are given on the command line. This way, no transfer  fail-
              ures go undetected by scripts and similar.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              This option does not imply -f, --fail, which causes transfers to
              fail  due  to the server's HTTP status code. You can combine the
              two options, however note -f, --fail is not global and is there-
              fore contained by -:, --next.

              Providing --fail-early multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-fail-early.

              Example:
               curl --fail-early https://example.com https://two.example

              See also -f, --fail and --fail-with-body. Added in 7.52.0.

       --fail-with-body
              (HTTP) Return an error on server errors where the HTTP  response
              code  is  400  or  greater). In normal cases when an HTTP server
              fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document stating
              so  (which  often  also  describes why and more). This flag will
              still allow curl to output and save that content but also to re-
              turn error 22.

              This  is  an  alternative  option to -f, --fail which makes curl
              fail for the same circumstances but without saving the content.

              Providing --fail-with-body multiple times has no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-fail-with-body.

              Example:
               curl --fail-with-body https://example.com

              See  also  -f,  --fail. This option is mutually exclusive to -f,
              --fail. Added in 7.76.0.

       -f, --fail
              (HTTP) Fail fast with no output at all on server errors. This is
              useful  to  enable  scripts and users to better deal with failed
              attempts. In normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a
              document,  it  returns  an HTML document stating so (which often
              also describes why and more). This flag will prevent  curl  from
              outputting that and return error 22.

              This  method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where non-
              successful response codes will slip through, especially when au-
              thentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).

              Providing  -f,  --fail multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-fail.

              Example:
               curl --fail https://example.com

              See also --fail-with-body. This option is mutually exclusive  to
              --fail-with-body.

       --false-start
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to use false start during the TLS handshake.
              False start is a mode where a TLS client will start sending  ap-
              plication  data  before verifying the server's Finished message,
              thus saving a round trip when performing a full handshake.

              This is currently only implemented in the NSS and Secure  Trans-
              port (on iOS 7.0 or later, or OS X 10.9 or later) backends.

              Providing  --false-start  multiple  times  has  no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-false-start.

              Example:
               curl --false-start https://example.com

              See also --tcp-fastopen. Added in 7.42.0.

       --form-escape
              (HTTP) Tells curl to pass on names of multipart form fields  and
              files using backslash-escaping instead of percent-encoding.

              If  --form-escape  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --form-escape -F 'field\name=curl' -F 'file=@load"this' https://example.com

              See also -F, --form. Added in 7.81.0.

       --form-string <name=string>
              (HTTP SMTP IMAP) Similar to -F, --form  except  that  the  value
              string  for  the  named parameter is used literally. Leading '@'
              and '<' characters, and the ';type=' string in the value have no
              special meaning. Use this in preference to -F, --form if there's
              any possibility that the string value may  accidentally  trigger
              the '@' or '<' features of -F, --form.

              --form-string can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --form-string "data" https://example.com

              See also -F, --form.

       -F, --form <name=content>
              (HTTP  SMTP  IMAP) For HTTP protocol family, this lets curl emu-
              late a filled-in form in which a user  has  pressed  the  submit
              button.  This  causes  curl  to POST data using the Content-Type
              multipart/form-data according to RFC 2388.

              For SMTP and IMAP protocols, this is the means to compose a mul-
              tipart mail message to transmit.

              This  enables  uploading of binary files etc. To force the 'con-
              tent' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign. To
              just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with
              the symbol <. The difference between @ and  <  is  then  that  @
              makes  a  file  get attached in the post as a file upload, while
              the < makes a text field and just get the contents for that text
              field from a file.

              Tell  curl to read content from stdin instead of a file by using
              - as filename. This goes for both @ and < constructs. When stdin
              is used, the contents is buffered in memory first by curl to de-
              termine its size and allow a possible resend. Defining a  part's
              data from a named non-regular file (such as a named pipe or sim-
              ilar) is unfortunately not subject to buffering and will be  ef-
              fectively  read at transmission time; since the full size is un-
              known before the transfer starts, such data is sent as chunks by
              HTTP and rejected by IMAP.

              Example: send an image to an HTTP server, where 'profile' is the
              name of the form-field to which the file  portrait.jpg  will  be
              the input:

               curl -F profile=@portrait.jpg https://example.com/upload.cgi

              Example:  send your name and shoe size in two text fields to the
              server:

               curl -F name=John -F shoesize=11 https://example.com/

              Example: send your essay in a text field to the server. Send  it
              as  a plain text field, but get the contents for it from a local
              file:

               curl -F "story=<hugefile.txt" https://example.com/

              You can also  tell  curl  what  Content-Type  to  use  by  using
              'type=', in a manner similar to:

               curl -F "web=@index.html;type=text/html" example.com

              or

               curl -F "name=daniel;type=text/foo" example.com

              You  can  also explicitly change the name field of a file upload
              part by setting filename=, like this:

               curl -F "file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost" example.com

              If filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by  dou-
              ble-quotes like:

               curl -F "file=@\"local,file\";filename=\"name;in;post\"" example.com

              or

               curl -F 'file=@"local,file";filename="name;in;post"' example.com
              Note  that  if  a  filename/path is quoted by double-quotes, any
              double-quote or backslash within the filename must be escaped by
              backslash.

              Quoting  must  also  be  applied to non-file data if it contains
              semicolons, leading/trailing spaces or leading double quotes:

               curl -F 'colors="red; green; blue";type=text/x-myapp' example.com

              You can add custom headers to the  field  by  setting  headers=,
              like

                curl -F "submit=OK;headers=\"X-submit-type: OK\"" example.com

              or

                curl -F "submit=OK;headers=@headerfile" example.com

              The  headers=  keyword may appear more that once and above notes
              about quoting apply. When headers are read from  a  file,  Empty
              lines and lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored; each
              header can be folded by splitting between two words and starting
              the  continuation  line  with a space; embedded carriage-returns
              and trailing spaces are stripped.   Here  is  an  example  of  a
              header file contents:

                # This file contain two headers.
                X-header-1: this is a header

                # The following header is folded.
                X-header-2: this is
                 another header

              To  support  sending  multipart mail messages, the syntax is ex-
              tended as follows:
              - name can be omitted: the equal sign is the first character  of
              the argument,
              -  if  data  starts with '(', this signals to start a new multi-
              part: it can be followed by a content type specification.
              - a multipart can be terminated with a '=)' argument.

              Example: the following command sends an SMTP mime email consist-
              ing in an inline part in two alternative formats: plain text and
              HTML. It attaches a text file:

               curl -F '=(;type=multipart/alternative' \
                    -F '=plain text message' \
                    -F '= <body>HTML message</body>;type=text/html' \
                    -F '=)' -F '=@textfile.txt' ...  smtp://example.com

              Data can be encoded for transfer using encoder=.  Available  en-
              codings are binary and 8bit that do nothing else than adding the
              corresponding Content-Transfer-Encoding header, 7bit  that  only
              rejects 8-bit characters with a transfer error, quoted-printable
              and base64 that encodes  data  according  to  the  corresponding
              schemes, limiting lines length to 76 characters.

              Example:  send  multipart mail with a quoted-printable text mes-
              sage and a base64 attached file:

               curl -F '=text message;encoder=quoted-printable' \
                    -F '=@localfile;encoder=base64' ... smtp://example.com

              See further examples and details in the MANUAL.

              -F, --form can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --form "name=curl" --form "file=@loadthis" https://example.com

              See also -d, --data, --form-string and --form-escape.  This  op-
              tion  is mutually exclusive to -d, --data and -I, --head and -T,
              --upload-file.

       --ftp-account <data>
              (FTP) When an FTP server asks for "account data" after user name
              and  password has been provided, this data is sent off using the
              ACCT command.

              If --ftp-account is provided several times, the last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-account "mr.robot" ftp://example.com/

              See also -u, --user.

       --ftp-alternative-to-user <command>
              (FTP)  If  authenticating with the USER and PASS commands fails,
              send this  command.   When  connecting  to  Tumbleweed's  Secure
              Transport  server  over  FTPS  using a client certificate, using
              "SITE AUTH" will tell the server to retrieve the  username  from
              the certificate.

              If --ftp-alternative-to-user is provided several times, the last
              set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-alternative-to-user "U53r" ftp://example.com

              See also --ftp-account and -u, --user.

       --ftp-create-dirs
              (FTP SFTP) When an FTP or SFTP URL/operation uses  a  path  that
              does not currently exist on the server, the standard behavior of
              curl is to fail. Using this option, curl will instead attempt to
              create missing directories.

              Providing  --ftp-create-dirs multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ftp-create-dirs.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-create-dirs -T file ftp://example.com/remote/path/file

              See also --create-dirs.

       --ftp-method <method>
              (FTP) Control what method curl should use to reach a file on  an
              FTP(S)  server. The method argument should be one of the follow-
              ing alternatives:

              multicwd
                     curl does a single CWD operation for each  path  part  in
                     the  given URL. For deep hierarchies this means many com-
                     mands. This is how RFC 1738 says it should be done.  This
                     is the default but the slowest behavior.

              nocwd  curl  does  no  CWD at all. curl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR
                     etc and give a full path to the server for all these com-
                     mands. This is the fastest behavior.

              singlecwd
                     curl does one CWD with the full target directory and then
                     operates on the file "normally"  (like  in  the  multicwd
                     case).  This  is  somewhat  more standards compliant than
                     'nocwd' but without the full penalty of 'multicwd'.

       If --ftp-method is provided several times, the last set value  will  be
       used.

       Examples:
        curl --ftp-method multicwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file
        curl --ftp-method nocwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file
        curl --ftp-method singlecwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file

       See also -l, --list-only.

       --ftp-pasv
              (FTP)  Use  passive mode for the data connection. Passive is the
              internal default behavior, but using this option can be used  to
              override a previous -P, --ftp-port option.

              Reversing  an enforced passive really is not doable but you must
              then instead enforce the correct -P, --ftp-port again.

              Passive mode means that curl will try the EPSV command first and
              then PASV, unless --disable-epsv is used.

              Providing  --ftp-pasv  multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-ftp-pasv.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-pasv ftp://example.com/

              See also --disable-epsv.
       -P, --ftp-port <address>
              (FTP) Reverses the default initiator/listener  roles  when  con-
              necting  with  FTP. This option makes curl use active mode. curl
              then tells the server to connect back to the client's  specified
              address and port, while passive mode asks the server to setup an
              IP address and port for it to connect to.  <address>  should  be
              one of:

              interface
                     e.g.  "eth0"  to specify which interface's IP address you
                     want to use (Unix only)

              IP address
                     e.g. "192.168.10.1" to specify the exact IP address

              host name
                     e.g. "my.host.domain" to specify the machine

              -      make curl pick the same IP address that is  already  used
                     for the control connection

       Disable the use of PORT with --ftp-pasv. Disable the attempt to use the
       EPRT command instead of PORT by using --disable-eprt.  EPRT  is  really
       PORT++.

       You  can  also  append ":[start]-[end]" to the right of the address, to
       tell curl what TCP port range to use. That means  you  specify  a  port
       range,  from a lower to a higher number. A single number works as well,
       but do note that it increases the risk of failure since  the  port  may
       not be available.

       If -P, --ftp-port is provided several times, the last set value will be
       used.

       Examples:
        curl -P - ftp:/example.com
        curl -P eth0 ftp:/example.com
        curl -P 192.168.0.2 ftp:/example.com

       See also --ftp-pasv and --disable-eprt.

       --ftp-pret
              (FTP) Tell curl to send a PRET command before PASV  (and  EPSV).
              Certain  FTP  servers,  mainly drftpd, require this non-standard
              command for directory listings as well as up  and  downloads  in
              PASV mode.

              Providing  --ftp-pret  multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-ftp-pret.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-pret ftp://example.com/

              See also -P, --ftp-port and --ftp-pasv.

       --ftp-skip-pasv-ip
              (FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP address the server suggests in
              its  response to curl's PASV command when curl connects the data
              connection. Instead curl will re-use the same IP address it  al-
              ready uses for the control connection.

              Since curl 7.74.0 this option is enabled by default.

              This  option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used instead
              of PASV.

              Providing --ftp-skip-pasv-ip multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ftp-skip-pasv-ip.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-skip-pasv-ip ftp://example.com/

              See also --ftp-pasv.

       --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode <active/passive>
              (FTP)  Sets the CCC mode. The passive mode will not initiate the
              shutdown, but instead wait for the server to do it, and will not
              reply to the shutdown from the server. The active mode initiates
              the shutdown and waits for a reply from the server.

              Providing --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ftp-ssl-ccc-mode.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode active --ftp-ssl-ccc ftps://example.com/

              See also --ftp-ssl-ccc.

       --ftp-ssl-ccc
              (FTP)  Use  CCC  (Clear  Command Channel) Shuts down the SSL/TLS
              layer after authenticating. The rest of the control channel com-
              munication  will be unencrypted. This allows NAT routers to fol-
              low the FTP transaction. The default mode is passive.

              Providing --ftp-ssl-ccc multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ftp-ssl-ccc.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-ssl-ccc ftps://example.com/
              See also --ssl and --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode.

       --ftp-ssl-control
              (FTP)  Require  SSL/TLS  for  the FTP login, clear for transfer.
              Allows secure authentication, but non-encrypted  data  transfers
              for  efficiency.  Fails the transfer if the server does not sup-
              port SSL/TLS.

              Providing --ftp-ssl-control multiple times has no extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ftp-ssl-control.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-ssl-control ftp://example.com

              See also --ssl.

       -G, --get
              When  used,  this  option  will make all data specified with -d,
              --data, --data-binary or --data-urlencode to be used in an  HTTP
              GET  request instead of the POST request that otherwise would be
              used. The data will be appended to the URL with a '?' separator.
              If used in combination with -I, --head, the POST data  will  in-
              stead be appended to the URL with a HEAD request.

              Providing -G, --get multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-get.

              Examples:
               curl --get https://example.com
               curl --get -d "tool=curl" -d "age=old" https://example.com
               curl --get -I -d "tool=curl" https://example.com

              See also -d, --data and -X, --request.

       -g, --globoff
              This option switches off the "URL globbing parser". When you set
              this  option, you can specify URLs that contain the letters {}[]
              without having curl itself interpret them. Note that these  let-
              ters  are  not  normal legal URL contents but they should be en-
              coded according to the URI standard.

              Providing -g, --globoff multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-globoff.

              Example:
               curl -g "https://example.com/{[]}}}}"

              See also -K, --config and -q, --disable.

       --happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms <milliseconds>
              Happy  Eyeballs is an algorithm that attempts to connect to both
              IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for  dual-stack  hosts,  giving  IPv6  a
              head-start  of the specified number of milliseconds. If the IPv6
              address cannot be connected to within that time, then a  connec-
              tion  attempt is made to the IPv4 address in parallel. The first
              connection to be established is the one that is used.

              The range of suggested useful values is limited. Happy  Eyeballs
              RFC  6555  says  "It  is RECOMMENDED that connection attempts be
              paced 150-250 ms apart to balance human factors against  network
              load."  libcurl currently defaults to 200 ms. Firefox and Chrome
              currently default to 300 ms.

              If --happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms is provided  several  times,  the
              last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms 500 https://example.com

              See also -m, --max-time and --connect-timeout. Added in 7.59.0.

       --haproxy-protocol
              (HTTP)  Send a HAProxy PROXY protocol v1 header at the beginning
              of the connection. This is used by some load balancers  and  re-
              verse proxies to indicate the client's true IP address and port.
              This  option is primarily useful when sending test requests to a
              service that expects this header.

              Providing --haproxy-protocol multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-haproxy-protocol.

              Example:
               curl --haproxy-protocol https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy. Added in 7.60.0.

       -I, --head
              (HTTP FTP FILE) Fetch the headers only! HTTP-servers feature the
              command HEAD which this uses to get nothing but the header of  a
              document.  When  used  on an FTP or FILE file, curl displays the
              file size and last modification time only.

              Providing -I, --head multiple times has no extra  effect.   Dis-
              able it again with --no-head.

              Example:
               curl -I https://example.com

              See also -G, --get, -v, --verbose and --trace-ascii.

       -H, --header <header/@file>
              (HTTP  IMAP  SMTP)  Extra header to include in information sent.
              When used within an HTTP request, it is added to the regular re-
              quest headers.

              For an IMAP or SMTP MIME uploaded mail built with -F, --form op-
              tions, it is prepended to the resulting  MIME  document,  effec-
              tively including it at the mail global level. It does not affect
              raw uploaded mails (Added in 7.56.0).

              You may specify any number of extra headers. Note  that  if  you
              should  add a custom header that has the same name as one of the
              internal ones curl would use, your externally set header will be
              used  instead of the internal one.  This allows you to make even
              trickier stuff than curl would normally do. You should  not  re-
              place internally set headers without knowing perfectly well what
              you are doing. Remove an internal header by giving a replacement
              without  content  on  the  right  side  of  the colon, as in: -H
              "Host:". If you send the custom header with  no-value  then  its
              header  must  be terminated with a semicolon, such as -H "X-Cus-
              tom-Header;" to send "X-Custom-Header:".

              curl will make sure that each header  you  add/replace  is  sent
              with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus not add that
              as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage
              returns, they will only mess things up for you.

              This  option can take an argument in @filename style, which then
              adds a header for each line in the input  file.  Using  @-  will
              make curl read the header file from stdin. Added in 7.55.0.

              Please note that most anti-spam utilities check the presence and
              value of several MIME mail headers: these  are  "From:",  "To:",
              "Date:"  and  "Subject:"  among  others and should be added with
              this option.

              You need --proxy-header to send custom headers intended  for  an
              HTTP proxy. Added in 7.37.0.

              Passing  on  a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header when doing an
              HTTP request with a request body, will make curl send  the  data
              using chunked encoding.

              WARNING:  headers  set  with this option will be set in all HTTP
              requests - even after redirects are  followed,  like  when  told
              with  -L,  --location. This can lead to the header being sent to
              other hosts than the original host, so sensitive headers  should
              be used with caution combined with following redirects.

              -H, --header can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl -H "X-First-Name: Joe" https://example.com
               curl -H "User-Agent: yes-please/2000" https://example.com
               curl -H "Host:" https://example.com

              See also -A, --user-agent and -e, --referer.

       -h, --help <category>
              Usage  help.  This  lists all commands of the <category>.  If no
              arg was provided, curl will display the most  important  command
              line  arguments.   If the argument "all" was provided, curl will
              display all options available.  If the argument  "category"  was
              provided, curl will display all categories and their meanings.

              Providing  -h,  --help multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-help.

              Example:
               curl --help all

              See also -v, --verbose.

       --hostpubmd5 <md5>
              (SFTP SCP) Pass a string containing 32 hexadecimal  digits.  The
              string  should  be the 128 bit MD5 checksum of the remote host's
              public key, curl will refuse the connection with the host unless
              the md5sums match.

              If  --hostpubmd5  is  provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --hostpubmd5 e5c1c49020640a5ab0f2034854c321a8 sftp://example.com/

              See also --hostpubsha256.

       --hostpubsha256 <sha256>
              (SFTP SCP) Pass a string containing a Base64-encoded SHA256 hash
              of the remote host's public key. Curl will refuse the connection
              with the host unless the hashes match.

              If --hostpubsha256 is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --hostpubsha256 NDVkMTQxMGQ1ODdmMjQ3MjczYjAyOTY5MmRkMjVmNDQ= sftp://example.com/

              See also --hostpubmd5. Added in 7.80.0.

       --hsts <file name>
              (HTTPS)  This  option enables HSTS for the transfer. If the file
              name points to an existing HSTS cache file, that will  be  used.
              After  a completed transfer, the cache will be saved to the file
              name again if it has been modified.

              Specify a "" file name (zero length) to avoid loading/saving and
              make curl just handle HSTS in memory.

              If  this  option  is used several times, curl will load contents
              from all the files but the last one will be used for saving.

              --hsts can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --hsts cache.txt https://example.com

              See also --proto. Added in 7.74.0.

       --http0.9
              (HTTP) Tells curl to be fine with HTTP version 0.9 response.

              HTTP/0.9 is a completely headerless response and  therefore  you
              can  also  connect with this to non-HTTP servers and still get a
              response since curl will simply transparently downgrade - if al-
              lowed.

              Since curl 7.66.0, HTTP/0.9 is disabled by default.

              Providing --http0.9 multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-http0.9.

              Example:
               curl --http0.9 https://example.com

              See also --http1.1, --http2 and --http3. Added in 7.64.0.

       -0, --http1.0
              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.0 instead of  using  its
              internally preferred HTTP version.

              Providing -0, --http1.0 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --http1.0 https://example.com

              See also --http0.9 and --http1.1. This option is mutually exclu-
              sive to --http1.1 and --http2  and  --http2-prior-knowledge  and
              --http3.

       --http1.1
              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.1.

              Providing --http1.1 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --http1.1 https://example.com

              See  also  -0,  --http1.0 and --http0.9. This option is mutually
              exclusive to -0, --http1.0 and --http2 and  --http2-prior-knowl-
              edge and --http3. Added in 7.33.0.

       --http2-prior-knowledge
              (HTTP)  Tells  curl  to  issue  its  non-TLS HTTP requests using
              HTTP/2 without HTTP/1.1 Upgrade.  It  requires  prior  knowledge
              that  the  server  supports HTTP/2 straight away. HTTPS requests
              will still do HTTP/2 the standard way with  negotiated  protocol
              version in the TLS handshake.

              Providing  --http2-prior-knowledge  multiple  times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-http2-prior-knowledge.

              Example:
               curl --http2-prior-knowledge https://example.com

              See also --http2 and --http3.  --http2-prior-knowledge  requires
              that  the  underlying  libcurl was built to support HTTP/2. This
              option is mutually exclusive to --http1.1 and -0, --http1.0  and
              --http2 and --http3. Added in 7.49.0.

       --http2
              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 2.

              For  HTTPS,  this means curl will attempt to negotiate HTTP/2 in
              the TLS handshake. curl does this by default.

              For HTTP, this means curl will attempt to upgrade the request to
              HTTP/2 using the Upgrade: request header.

              When  curl  uses HTTP/2 over HTTPS, it does not itself insist on
              TLS 1.2 or higher even though that is required by the specifica-
              tion. A user can add this version requirement with --tlsv1.2.

              Providing --http2 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --http2 https://example.com

              See also --http1.1 and --http3. --http2 requires that the under-
              lying libcurl was built to support HTTP/2. This option is  mutu-
              ally exclusive to --http1.1 and -0, --http1.0 and --http2-prior-
              knowledge and --http3. Added in 7.33.0.

       --http3
              (HTTP) **WARNING**: this option is experimental. Do not  use  in
              production.

              Tells  curl  to use HTTP version 3 directly to the host and port
              number used in the URL. A normal HTTP/3 transaction will be done
              to  a  host and then get redirected via Alt-Svc, but this option
              allows a user to circumvent that when you know that  the  target
              speaks HTTP/3 on the given host and port.

              This  option  will make curl fail if a QUIC connection cannot be
              established, it cannot fall back to a lower HTTP version on  its
              own.

              Providing --http3 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --http3 https://example.com

              See also --http1.1 and --http2. --http3 requires that the under-
              lying libcurl was built to support HTTP/3. This option is  mutu-
              ally  exclusive  to  --http1.1 and -0, --http1.0 and --http2 and
              --http2-prior-knowledge. Added in 7.66.0.

       --ignore-content-length
              (FTP HTTP) For HTTP, Ignore the Content-Length header.  This  is
              particularly  useful  for servers running Apache 1.x, which will
              report incorrect Content-Length for files larger  than  2  giga-
              bytes.

              For  FTP (since 7.46.0), skip the RETR command to figure out the
              size before downloading a file.

              This option does not work for HTTP if libcurl was built  to  use
              hyper.

              Providing  --ignore-content-length  multiple  times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-ignore-content-length.

              Example:
               curl --ignore-content-length https://example.com

              See also --ftp-skip-pasv-ip.

       -i, --include
              Include the HTTP response headers in the output.  The  HTTP  re-
              sponse  headers  can  include  things like server name, cookies,
              date of the document, HTTP version and more...

              To view the request headers, consider the -v, --verbose option.

              Providing -i, --include multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-include.

              Example:
               curl -i https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose.

       -k, --insecure
              (TLS SFTP SCP) By default, every secure connection curl makes is
              verified to be secure before the transfer takes place. This  op-
              tion  makes  curl skip the verification step and proceed without
              checking.

              When this option is not used for protocols using TLS, curl veri-
              fies  the server's TLS certificate before it continues: that the
              certificate contains the right name which matches the host  name
              used in the URL and that the certificate has been signed by a CA
              certificate present in the cert store.  See this online resource
              for further details:
               https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

              For  SFTP  and  SCP, this option makes curl skip the known_hosts
              verification.  known_hosts is a  file  normally  stored  in  the
              user's home directory in the ".ssh" subdirectory, which contains
              host names and their public keys.

              WARNING: using this option makes the transfer insecure.

              Providing -k, --insecure multiple times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-insecure.

              Example:
               curl --insecure https://example.com

              See also --proxy-insecure, --cacert and --capath.

       --interface <name>
              Perform  an operation using a specified interface. You can enter
              interface name, IP address or host name. An example  could  look
              like:

               curl --interface eth0:1 https://www.example.com/

              On  Linux  it can be used to specify a VRF, but the binary needs
              to either have CAP_NET_RAW or to be run as root.  More  informa-
              tion   about  Linux  VRF:  https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documenta-
              tion/networking/vrf.txt

              If --interface is provided several times,  the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --interface eth0 https://example.com

              See also --dns-interface.

       -4, --ipv4
              This  option  tells curl to use IPv4 addresses only, and not for
              example try IPv6.

              Providing -4, --ipv4 multiple times has no extra  effect.   Dis-
              able it again with --no-ipv4.

              Example:
               curl --ipv4 https://example.com

              See  also  --http1.1 and --http2. This option is mutually exclu-
              sive to -6, --ipv6.

       -6, --ipv6
              This option tells curl to use IPv6 addresses only, and  not  for
              example try IPv4.

              Providing  -6,  --ipv6 multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-ipv6.

              Example:
               curl --ipv6 https://example.com

              See also --http1.1 and --http2. This option is  mutually  exclu-
              sive to -4, --ipv4.

       --json <data>
              (HTTP)  Sends  the  specified JSON data in a POST request to the
              HTTP server. --json works as a shortcut  for  passing  on  these
              three options:

               --data [arg]
               --header "Content-Type: application/json"
               --header "Accept: application/json"

              There  is no verification that the passed in data is actual JSON
              or that the syntax is correct.

              If you start the data with the letter @, the rest  should  be  a
              file  name  to  read  the data from, or a single dash (-) if you
              want curl to read the data from stdin. Posting data from a  file
              named 'foobar' would thus be done with --json @foobar and to in-
              stead read the data from stdin, use --json @-.

              If this option is used more than once on the same command  line,
              the  additional data pieces will be concatenated to the previous
              before sending.

              The headers this option sets can be overridden with -H, --header
              as usual.

              --json can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl --json '{ "drink": "coffe" }' https://example.com
               curl --json '{ "drink":' --json ' "coffe" }' https://example.com
               curl --json @prepared https://example.com
               curl --json @- https://example.com < json.txt

              See  also  --data-binary and --data-raw. This option is mutually
              exclusive to -F, --form and -I, --head  and  -T,  --upload-file.
              Added in 7.82.0.

       -j, --junk-session-cookies
              (HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file, this
              option will make it discard all "session cookies". This will ba-
              sically  have  the  same  effect as if a new session is started.
              Typical browsers always discard session cookies  when  they  are
              closed down.

              Providing -j, --junk-session-cookies multiple times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-junk-session-cookies.

              Example:
               curl --junk-session-cookies -b cookies.txt https://example.com

              See also -b, --cookie and -c, --cookie-jar.

       --keepalive-time <seconds>
              This option sets the time a connection needs to remain idle  be-
              fore  sending  keepalive  probes and the time between individual
              keepalive probes. It is currently effective on operating systems
              offering  the  TCP_KEEPIDLE  and  TCP_KEEPINTVL  socket  options
              (meaning Linux, recent AIX, HP-UX  and  more).   Keepalives  are
              used  by the TCP stack to detect broken networks on idle connec-
              tions. The number of missed keepalive  probes  before  declaring
              the  connection  down  is  OS dependent and is commonly 9 or 10.
              This option has no effect if --no-keepalive is used.

              If unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.

              If --keepalive-time is provided  several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --keepalive-time 20 https://example.com

              See also --no-keepalive and -m, --max-time.

       --key-type <type>
              (TLS)  Private key file type. Specify which type your --key pro-
              vided private key is. DER, PEM, and ENG are  supported.  If  not
              specified, PEM is assumed.

              If --key-type is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --key-type DER --key here https://example.com

              See also --key.

       --key <key>
              (TLS SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your pri-
              vate  key in this separate file. For SSH, if not specified, curl
              tries  the  following  candidates  in  order:   '~/.ssh/id_rsa',
              '~/.ssh/id_dsa', './id_rsa', './id_dsa'.

              If  curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine pkcs11
              is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to spec-
              ify  a  private key located in a PKCS#11 device. A string begin-
              ning with "pkcs11:" will be interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI.  If  a
              PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the --engine option will be set as
              "pkcs11" if none was provided and the --key-type option will  be
              set as "ENG" if none was provided.

              If  curl is built against Secure Transport or Schannel then this
              option is ignored for TLS protocols (HTTPS, etc). Those backends
              expect  the private key to be already present in the keychain or
              PKCS#12 file containing the certificate.

              If --key is provided several times, the last set value  will  be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --cert certificate --key here https://example.com

              See also --key-type and -E, --cert.

       --krb <level>
              (FTP)  Enable Kerberos authentication and use. The level must be
              entered and should be one of 'clear', 'safe', 'confidential', or
              'private'.  Should  you  use  a  level that is not one of these,
              'private' will instead be used.

              If --krb is provided several times, the last set value  will  be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --krb clear ftp://example.com/

              See  also --delegation and --ssl. --krb requires that the under-
              lying libcurl was built to support Kerberos.

       --libcurl <file>
              Append this option to any ordinary curl command  line,  and  you
              will  get  libcurl-using  C source code written to the file that
              does the equivalent of what your command-line operation does!

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              If  --libcurl is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --libcurl client.c https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose.

       --limit-rate <speed>
              Specify the maximum transfer rate you want curl  to  use  -  for
              both downloads and uploads. This feature is useful if you have a
              limited pipe and you would like your transfer not  to  use  your
              entire bandwidth. To make it slower than it otherwise would be.

              The  given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix is
              appended.  Appending 'k' or 'K' will count the number  as  kilo-
              bytes,  'm' or 'M' makes it megabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes it
              gigabytes. The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based. For  ex-
              ample 1k is 1024. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.

              The rate limiting logic works on averaging the transfer speed to
              no more than the set threshold over a period  of  multiple  sec-
              onds.

              If  you  also use the -Y, --speed-limit option, that option will
              take precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to
              help keeping the speed-limit logic working.

              If  --limit-rate  is  provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --limit-rate 100K https://example.com
               curl --limit-rate 1000 https://example.com
               curl --limit-rate 10M https://example.com

              See also --rate, -Y, --speed-limit and -y, --speed-time.

       -l, --list-only
              (FTP POP3) (FTP) When listing  an  FTP  directory,  this  switch
              forces  a  name-only view. This is especially useful if the user
              wants to machine-parse the contents of an  FTP  directory  since
              the  normal  directory view does not use a standard look or for-
              mat. When used like this, the option causes an NLST  command  to
              be sent to the server instead of LIST.

              Note:  Some  FTP  servers  list  only files in their response to
              NLST; they do not include sub-directories and symbolic links.

              (POP3) When retrieving a specific email from POP3,  this  switch
              forces  a  LIST command to be performed instead of RETR. This is
              particularly useful if the user wants to see if a specific  mes-
              sage-id exists on the server and what size it is.

              Note:  When combined with -X, --request, this option can be used
              to send a UIDL command instead, so the user may use the  email's
              unique  identifier  rather  than  its message-id to make the re-
              quest.

              Providing -l, --list-only multiple times has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-list-only.

              Example:
               curl --list-only ftp://example.com/dir/
              See also -Q, --quote and -X, --request.

       --local-port <num/range>
              Set  a  preferred single number or range (FROM-TO) of local port
              numbers to use for the connection(s).  Note that port numbers by
              nature  are a scarce resource that will be busy at times so set-
              ting this range to something too narrow might cause  unnecessary
              connection setup failures.

              If  --local-port  is  provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --local-port 1000-3000 https://example.com

              See also -g, --globoff.

       --location-trusted
              (HTTP) Like -L, --location, but will allow sending  the  name  +
              password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This may or
              may not introduce a security breach if the site redirects you to
              a site to which you will send your authentication info (which is
              plaintext in the case of HTTP Basic authentication).

              Providing --location-trusted multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-location-trusted.

              Example:
               curl --location-trusted -u user:password https://example.com

              See also -u, --user.

       -L, --location
              (HTTP)  If  the server reports that the requested page has moved
              to a different location (indicated with a Location: header and a
              3XX  response code), this option will make curl redo the request
              on the new place. If used together with  -i,  --include  or  -I,
              --head, headers from all requested pages will be shown. When au-
              thentication is used, curl only sends  its  credentials  to  the
              initial  host.  If a redirect takes curl to a different host, it
              will not be able to intercept the user+password. See also  --lo-
              cation-trusted  on  how to change this. You can limit the amount
              of redirects to follow by using the --max-redirs option.

              When curl follows a redirect and if the request is  a  POST,  it
              will  send the following request with a GET if the HTTP response
              was 301, 302, or 303. If the response code  was  any  other  3xx
              code, curl will re-send the following request using the same un-
              modified method.

              You can tell curl to not change POST requests to GET after a 30x
              response  by  using  the  dedicated options for that: --post301,
              --post302 and --post303.

              The method set with -X,  --request  overrides  the  method  curl
              would otherwise select to use.

              Providing  -L,  --location  multiple  times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-location.

              Example:
               curl -L https://example.com

              See also --resolve and --alt-svc.

       --login-options <options>
              (IMAP LDAP POP3 SMTP) Specify the login options  to  use  during
              server authentication.

              You  can  use login options to specify protocol specific options
              that may be used during authentication. At  present  only  IMAP,
              POP3  and SMTP support login options. For more information about
              login options please see RFC  2384,  RFC  5092  and  IETF  draft
              draft-earhart-url-smtp-00.txt

              If --login-options is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --login-options 'AUTH=*' imap://example.com

              See also -u, --user. Added in 7.34.0.

       --mail-auth <address>
              (SMTP) Specify a single address. This will be  used  to  specify
              the  authentication  address  (identity)  of a submitted message
              that is being relayed to another server.

              If --mail-auth is provided several times,  the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --mail-auth user@example.come -T mail smtp://example.com/

              See also --mail-rcpt and --mail-from.

       --mail-from <address>
              (SMTP)  Specify  a single address that the given mail should get
              sent from.

              If --mail-from is provided several times,  the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --mail-from user@example.com -T mail smtp://example.com/

              See also --mail-rcpt and --mail-auth.

       --mail-rcpt-allowfails
              (SMTP) When sending data to multiple recipients, by default curl
              will abort SMTP conversation if at least one of  the  recipients
              causes RCPT TO command to return an error.

              The  default  behavior can be changed by passing --mail-rcpt-al-
              lowfails command-line option which will make curl ignore  errors
              and proceed with the remaining valid recipients.

              If  all  recipients  trigger  RCPT  TO failures and this flag is
              specified, curl will still abort the SMTP conversation  and  re-
              turn the error received from to the last RCPT TO command.

              Providing --mail-rcpt-allowfails multiple times has no extra ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --no-mail-rcpt-allowfails.

              Example:
               curl --mail-rcpt-allowfails --mail-rcpt dest@example.com smtp://example.com

              See also --mail-rcpt. Added in 7.69.0.

       --mail-rcpt <address>
              (SMTP) Specify a single email address, user name or mailing list
              name.  Repeat  this option several times to send to multiple re-
              cipients.

              When performing an address verification (VRFY command), the  re-
              cipient  should  be  specified as the user name or user name and
              domain (as per Section 3.5 of RFC5321). (Added in 7.34.0)

              When performing a mailing list expand (EXPN command), the recip-
              ient  should  be  specified using the mailing list name, such as
              "Friends" or "London-Office".  (Added in 7.34.0)

              --mail-rcpt can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --mail-rcpt user@example.net smtp://example.com

              See also --mail-rcpt-allowfails.

       -M, --manual
              Manual. Display the huge help text.

              Providing -M, --manual multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-manual.

              Example:
               curl --manual

              See also -v, --verbose, --libcurl and --trace.

       --max-filesize <bytes>
              (FTP HTTP MQTT) Specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a file to
              download. If the file requested is larger than this  value,  the
              transfer will not start and curl will return with exit code 63.

              A  size  modifier may be used. For example, Appending 'k' or 'K'
              will count  the  number  as  kilobytes,  'm'  or  'M'  makes  it
              megabytes,  while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes. Examples: 200K,
              3m and 1G. (Added in 7.58.0)

              NOTE: The file size is not always known prior to  download,  and
              for such files this option has no effect even if the file trans-
              fer ends up being larger than this given limit.  If  --max-file-
              size is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --max-filesize 100K https://example.com

              See also --limit-rate.

       --max-redirs <num>
              (HTTP)  Set  maximum  number of redirections to follow. When -L,
              --location is used, to prevent  curl  from  following  too  many
              redirects,  by  default,  the  limit is set to 50 redirects. Set
              this option to -1 to make it unlimited.

              If --max-redirs is provided several times, the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --max-redirs 3 --location https://example.com

              See also -L, --location.

       -m, --max-time <fractional seconds>
              Maximum  time  in  seconds that you allow each transfer to take.
              This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from  hanging  for
              hours  due  to slow networks or links going down.  Since 7.32.0,
              this option accepts decimal values, but the actual timeout  will
              decrease in accuracy as the specified timeout increases in deci-
              mal precision.

              If you enable retrying the transfer (--retry) then  the  maximum
              time counter is reset each time the transfer is retried. You can
              use --retry-max-time to limit the retry time.

              The decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.)  as  decimal
              separator  - not the local version even if it might be using an-
              other separator.

              If -m, --max-time is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --max-time 10 https://example.com
               curl --max-time 2.92 https://example.com

              See also --connect-timeout and --retry-max-time.

       --metalink
              This  option was previously used to specify a metalink resource.
              Metalink support has been disabled in curl since 7.78.0 for  se-
              curity reasons.

              If --metalink is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --metalink file https://example.com

              See also -Z, --parallel.

       --negotiate
              (HTTP) Enables Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication.

              This option requires a library built with GSS-API or  SSPI  sup-
              port.  Use  -V,  --version  to  see  if  your curl supports GSS-
              API/SSPI or SPNEGO.

              When using this option, you must also provide a fake -u,  --user
              option  to  activate the authentication code properly. Sending a
              '-u :' is enough as the user name  and  password  from  the  -u,
              --user option are not actually used.

              If  this  option  is  used  several times, only the first one is
              used.

              Providing --negotiate multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --negotiate -u : https://example.com

              See also --basic, --ntlm, --anyauth and --proxy-negotiate.

       --netrc-file <filename>
              This option is similar to -n, --netrc, except that  you  provide
              the  path  (absolute  or  relative)  to the netrc file that curl
              should use. You can only specify one netrc file per invocation.

              It will abide by --netrc-optional if specified.

              If --netrc-file is provided several times, the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --netrc-file netrc https://example.com

              See  also  -n, --netrc, -u, --user and -K, --config. This option
              is mutually exclusive to -n, --netrc.

       --netrc-optional
              Similar to -n, --netrc, but this option makes the  .netrc  usage
              optional and not mandatory as the -n, --netrc option does.

              Providing  --netrc-optional  multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-netrc-optional.

              Example:
               curl --netrc-optional https://example.com

              See also --netrc-file. This option is mutually exclusive to  -n,
              --netrc.

       -n, --netrc
              Makes  curl  scan  the  .netrc  (_netrc  on Windows) file in the
              user's home directory for login name and password. This is typi-
              cally  used for FTP on Unix. If used with HTTP, curl will enable
              user authentication. See netrc(5) and ftp(1) for details on  the
              file  format.  Curl will not complain if that file does not have
              the right permissions (it should be neither  world-  nor  group-
              readable).  The  environment variable "HOME" is used to find the
              home directory.

              A quick and simple example of how to setup  a  .netrc  to  allow
              curl  to  FTP to the machine host.domain.com with user name 'my-
              self' and password 'secret' could look similar to:

               machine host.domain.com
               login myself
               password secret

              Providing -n, --netrc multiple times has no extra effect.   Dis-
              able it again with --no-netrc.

              Example:
               curl --netrc https://example.com

              See  also --netrc-file, -K, --config and -u, --user. This option
              is mutually exclusive to --netrc-file and --netrc-optional.

       -:, --next
              Tells curl to use a separate operation for the following URL and
              associated  options.  This  allows  you  to send several URL re-
              quests, each with their own specific options, for example,  such
              as different user names or custom requests for each.

              -:,  --next  will  reset  all local options and only global ones
              will have their values survive over to the  operation  following
              the  -:,  --next  instruction. Global options include -v, --ver-
              bose, --trace, --trace-ascii and --fail-early.

              For example, you can do both a GET and a POST in a  single  com-
              mand line:

               curl www1.example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com

              -:, --next can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl https://example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com
               curl -I https://example.com --next https://example.net/

              See also -Z, --parallel and -K, --config. Added in 7.36.0.

       --no-alpn
              (HTTPS)  Disable  the ALPN TLS extension. ALPN is enabled by de-
              fault if libcurl was built with an  SSL  library  that  supports
              ALPN.  ALPN is used by a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to negoti-
              ate HTTP/2 support with the server during https sessions.

              Providing --no-alpn multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --alpn.

              Example:
               curl --no-alpn https://example.com

              See  also  --no-npn and --http2. --no-alpn requires that the un-
              derlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in 7.36.0.

       -N, --no-buffer
              Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work sit-
              uations,  curl  will  use a standard buffered output stream that
              will have the effect that it will output the data in chunks, not
              necessarily  exactly  when  the data arrives.  Using this option
              will disable that buffering.

              Providing -N, --no-buffer multiple times has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --buffer.

              Example:
               curl --no-buffer https://example.com

              See also -#, --progress-bar.

       --no-clobber
              When  used  in  conjunction with the -o, --output, -J, --remote-
              header-name, -O, --remote-name,  or  --remote-name-all  options,
              curl avoids overwriting files that already exist. Instead, a dot
              and a number gets appended to the name of the file that would be
              created,  up  to filename.100 after which it will not create any
              file.

              Note that this is the negated option name documented.   You  can
              thus  use --clobber to enforce the clobbering, even if -J, --re-
              mote-header-name or -J is specified.

              Providing --no-clobber multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --clobber.

              Example:
               curl --no-clobber --output local/dir/file https://example.com
              See also -o, --output and -O, --remote-name. Added in 7.83.0.

       --no-keepalive
              Disables  the  use  of keepalive messages on the TCP connection.
              curl otherwise enables them by default.

              Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can
              thus use --keepalive to enforce keepalive.

              Providing  --no-keepalive  multiple  times  has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --keepalive.

              Example:
               curl --no-keepalive https://example.com

              See also --keepalive-time.

       --no-npn
              (HTTPS) In curl 7.86.0 and later, curl never uses NPN.

              Disable the NPN TLS extension. NPN  is  enabled  by  default  if
              libcurl  was built with an SSL library that supports NPN. NPN is
              used by a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to negotiate HTTP/2  sup-
              port with the server during https sessions.

              Providing  --no-npn multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --npn.

              Example:
               curl --no-npn https://example.com

              See also --no-alpn and --http2. --no-npn requires that  the  un-
              derlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in 7.36.0.

       --no-progress-meter
              Option to switch off the progress meter output without muting or
              otherwise affecting warning and informational messages like  -s,
              --silent does.

              Note  that  this  is the negated option name documented. You can
              thus use --progress-meter to enable the progress meter again.

              Providing --no-progress-meter multiple times has  no  extra  ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --progress-meter.

              Example:
               curl --no-progress-meter -o store https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose and -s, --silent. Added in 7.67.0.

       --no-sessionid
              (TLS)  Disable  curl's use of SSL session-ID caching. By default
              all transfers are done using the cache. Note that while  nothing
              should  ever  get  hurt  by attempting to reuse SSL session-IDs,
              there seem to be broken SSL implementations in the wild that may
              require you to disable this in order for you to succeed.

              Note  that  this  is the negated option name documented. You can
              thus use --sessionid to enforce session-ID caching.

              Providing --no-sessionid multiple times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --sessionid.

              Example:
               curl --no-sessionid https://example.com

              See also -k, --insecure.

       --noproxy <no-proxy-list>
              Comma-separated  list  of hosts for which not to use a proxy, if
              one is specified. The only wildcard is  a  single  *  character,
              which  matches  all  hosts,  and effectively disables the proxy.
              Each name in this list is matched as either a domain which  con-
              tains  the  hostname,  or  the hostname itself. For example, lo-
              cal.com would match local.com, local.com:80, and  www.local.com,
              but not www.notlocal.com.

              Since  7.53.0,  This  option overrides the environment variables
              that disable the proxy ('no_proxy' and 'NO_PROXY').  If  there's
              an  environment  variable disabling a proxy, you can set the no-
              proxy list to "" to override it.

              Since 7.86.0, IP addresses specified to this option can be  pro-
              vided  using  CIDR notation: an appended slash and number speci-
              fies the number of "network bits" out of the address to  use  in
              the comparison. For example "192.168.0.0/16" would match all ad-
              dresses starting with "192.168".

              If --noproxy is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --noproxy "www.example" https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy.

       --ntlm-wb
              (HTTP) Enables NTLM much in the style --ntlm does, but hand over
              the authentication to the separate binary  ntlmauth  application
              that is executed when needed.

              Providing --ntlm-wb multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --ntlm-wb -u user:password https://example.com

              See also --ntlm and --proxy-ntlm.

       --ntlm (HTTP)  Enables  NTLM  authentication.  The  NTLM authentication
              method was designed by Microsoft and is used by IIS web servers.
              It  is a proprietary protocol, reverse-engineered by clever peo-
              ple and implemented in curl based on their efforts. This kind of
              behavior  should  not be endorsed, you should encourage everyone
              who uses NTLM to switch to a public and  documented  authentica-
              tion method instead, such as Digest.

              If  you  want to enable NTLM for your proxy authentication, then
              use --proxy-ntlm.

              If this option is used several times,  only  the  first  one  is
              used.

              Providing --ntlm multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --ntlm -u user:password https://example.com

              See  also  --proxy-ntlm.  --ntlm  requires  that  the underlying
              libcurl was built to support TLS. This option is mutually exclu-
              sive to --basic and --negotiate and --digest and --anyauth.

       --oauth2-bearer <token>
              (IMAP  LDAP  POP3  SMTP HTTP) Specify the Bearer Token for OAUTH
              2.0 server authentication. The Bearer Token is used in  conjunc-
              tion  with  the  user name which can be specified as part of the
              --url or -u, --user options.

              The Bearer Token and user name are formatted  according  to  RFC
              6750.

              If --oauth2-bearer is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --oauth2-bearer "mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM" https://example.com

              See also --basic, --ntlm and --digest. Added in 7.33.0.

       --output-dir <dir>
              This option specifies the directory in  which  files  should  be
              stored, when -O, --remote-name or -o, --output are used.

              The  given  output directory is used for all URLs and output op-
              tions on the command line, up until the first -:, --next.

              If the specified target directory does not exist, the  operation
              will fail unless --create-dirs is also used.

              If  --output-dir  is  provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --output-dir "tmp" -O https://example.com

              See also -O, --remote-name and -J,  --remote-header-name.  Added
              in 7.73.0.

       -o, --output <file>
              Write output to <file> instead of stdout. If you are using {} or
              [] to fetch multiple documents, you should quote the URL and you
              can  use  '#' followed by a number in the <file> specifier. That
              variable will be replaced with the current string  for  the  URL
              being fetched. Like in:

               curl "http://{one,two}.example.com" -o "file_#1.txt"

              or use several variables like:

               curl "http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com" -o "#1_#2"

              You  may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you
              have. For example, if you specify two URLs on the  same  command
              line, you can use it like this:

                curl -o aa example.com -o bb example.net

              and  the  order  of the -o options and the URLs does not matter,
              just that the first -o is for the first URL and so  on,  so  the
              above command line can also be written as

                curl example.com example.net -o aa -o bb

              See  also  the --create-dirs option to create the local directo-
              ries dynamically. Specifying the output as '-' (a  single  dash)
              will force the output to be done to stdout.

              To   suppress  response  bodies,  you  can  redirect  output  to
              /dev/null:

                curl example.com -o /dev/null

              Or for Windows use nul:
                curl example.com -o nul

              -o, --output can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl -o file https://example.com
               curl "http://{one,two}.example.com" -o "file_#1.txt"
               curl "http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com" -o "#1_#2"
               curl -o file https://example.com -o file2 https://example.net

              See also -O, --remote-name, --remote-name-all and -J,  --remote-
              header-name.

       --parallel-immediate
              When  doing  parallel  transfers, this option will instruct curl
              that it should rather prefer opening up more connections in par-
              allel at once rather than waiting to see if new transfers can be
              added as multiplexed streams on another connection.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing  --parallel-immediate  multiple times has no extra ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --no-parallel-immediate.

              Example:
               curl --parallel-immediate -Z https://example.com -o file1 https://example.com -o file2

              See also -Z, --parallel and --parallel-max. Added in 7.68.0.

       --parallel-max <num>
              When asked to do parallel transfers, using -Z, --parallel,  this
              option controls the maximum amount of transfers to do simultane-
              ously.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.
              The default is 50.

              If  --parallel-max is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --parallel-max 100 -Z https://example.com ftp://example.com/

              See also -Z, --parallel. Added in 7.66.0.

       -Z, --parallel
              Makes curl perform its transfers in parallel as compared to  the
              regular serial manner.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing -Z, --parallel multiple times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-parallel.

              Example:
               curl --parallel https://example.com -o file1 https://example.com -o file2

              See also -:, --next and -v, --verbose. Added in 7.66.0.

       --pass <phrase>
              (SSH TLS) Passphrase for the private key.

              If  --pass is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --pass secret --key file https://example.com

              See also --key and -u, --user.

       --path-as-is
              Tell curl to not handle sequences of /../ or /./  in  the  given
              URL  path.  Normally curl will squash or merge them according to
              standards but with this option set you tell it not to do that.

              Providing --path-as-is multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-path-as-is.

              Example:
               curl --path-as-is https://example.com/../../etc/passwd

              See also --request-target. Added in 7.42.0.

       --pinnedpubkey <hashes>
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to  use  the  specified  public key file (or
              hashes) to verify the peer. This can be a path to a  file  which
              contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number
              of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by 'sha256//' and sepa-
              rated by ';'.

              When  negotiating  a  TLS  or SSL connection, the server sends a
              certificate indicating its identity. A public key  is  extracted
              from  this certificate and if it does not exactly match the pub-
              lic key provided to this option, curl will abort the  connection
              before sending or receiving any data.

              PEM/DER support:

              7.39.0: OpenSSL, GnuTLS and GSKit

              7.43.0: NSS and wolfSSL

              7.47.0: mbedtls
              sha256 support:

              7.44.0: OpenSSL, GnuTLS, NSS and wolfSSL

              7.47.0: mbedtls

              Other SSL backends not supported.

              If  --pinnedpubkey is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --pinnedpubkey keyfile https://example.com
               curl --pinnedpubkey 'sha256//ce118b51897f4452dc' https://example.com

              See also --hostpubsha256. Added in 7.39.0.

       --post301
              (HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 7231/6.4.2 and not convert POST
              requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection. The
              non-RFC behavior is ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does the
              conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server
              may require a POST to remain a POST after  such  a  redirection.
              This option is meaningful only when using -L, --location.

              Providing --post301 multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-post301.

              Example:
               curl --post301 --location -d "data" https://example.com

              See also --post302, --post303 and -L, --location.

       --post302
              (HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 7231/6.4.3 and not convert POST
              requests into GET requests when following a 302 redirection. The
              non-RFC behavior is ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does the
              conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server
              may require a POST to remain a POST after  such  a  redirection.
              This option is meaningful only when using -L, --location.

              Providing --post302 multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-post302.

              Example:
               curl --post302 --location -d "data" https://example.com

              See also --post301, --post303 and -L, --location.

       --post303
              (HTTP) Tells curl to violate RFC 7231/6.4.4 and not convert POST
              requests  into  GET  requests when following 303 redirections. A
              server may require a POST to remain a POST after a 303 redirect-
              ion. This option is meaningful only when using -L, --location.

              Providing --post303 multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-post303.

              Example:
               curl --post303 --location -d "data" https://example.com

              See also --post302, --post301 and -L, --location.

       --preproxy [protocol://]host[:port]
              Use the specified SOCKS proxy before connecting to  an  HTTP  or
              HTTPS  -x,  --proxy.  In  such a case curl first connects to the
              SOCKS proxy and then connects (through SOCKS)  to  the  HTTP  or
              HTTPS proxy. Hence pre proxy.

              The pre proxy string should be specified with a protocol:// pre-
              fix to  specify  alternative  proxy  protocols.  Use  socks4://,
              socks4a://,  socks5://  or  socks5h://  to  request the specific
              SOCKS version to be used. No protocol specified will  make  curl
              default to SOCKS4.

              If  the  port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is
              assumed to be 1080.

              User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are
              URL  decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special charac-
              ters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.

              If --preproxy is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --preproxy socks5://proxy.example -x http://http.example https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and --socks5. Added in 7.52.0.

       -#, --progress-bar
              Make curl display transfer progress as a simple progress bar in-
              stead of the standard, more informational, meter.

              This progress bar draws a single line of '#'  characters  across
              the screen and shows a percentage if the transfer size is known.
              For transfers without a known size, there  will  be  space  ship
              (-=o=-)  that  moves back and forth but only while data is being
              transferred, with a set of flying hash sign symbols on top.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing -#, --progress-bar multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-progress-bar.

              Example:
               curl -# -O https://example.com

              See also --styled-output.

       --proto-default <protocol>
              Tells curl to use protocol for any URL missing a scheme name.

              An unknown or unsupported  protocol  causes  error  CURLE_UNSUP-
              PORTED_PROTOCOL (1).

              This option does not change the default proxy protocol (http).

              Without this option set, curl guesses protocol based on the host
              name, see --url for details.

              If --proto-default is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proto-default https ftp.example.com

              See also --proto and --proto-redir. Added in 7.45.0.

       --proto-redir <protocols>
              Tells  curl to limit what protocols it may use on redirect. Pro-
              tocols denied by --proto are not overridden by this option.  See
              --proto for how protocols are represented.

              Example, allow only HTTP and HTTPS on redirect:

               curl --proto-redir -all,http,https http://example.com

              By default curl will only allow HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS on re-
              direct (since 7.65.2). Specifying all or +all enables all proto-
              cols on redirects, which is not good for security.

              If  --proto-redir  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proto-redir =http,https https://example.com

              See also --proto.

       --proto <protocols>
              Tells curl to limit what protocols it  may  use  for  transfers.
              Protocols  are evaluated left to right, are comma separated, and
              are each a protocol name or 'all', optionally prefixed  by  zero
              or more modifiers. Available modifiers are:

              +  Permit this protocol in addition to protocols already permit-
                 ted (this is the default if no modifier is used).

              -  Deny this protocol, removing it from the  list  of  protocols
                 already permitted.

              =  Permit  only this protocol (ignoring the list already permit-
                 ted), though subject to later modification by subsequent  en-
                 tries in the comma separated list.

              For example:

              --proto -ftps  uses the default protocols, but disables ftps

              --proto -all,https,+http
                             only enables http and https

              --proto =http,https
                             also only enables http and https

              Unknown  and  disabled  protocols produce a warning. This allows
              scripts to safely rely on being able to disable potentially dan-
              gerous protocols, without relying upon support for that protocol
              being built into curl to avoid an error.

              This option can be used multiple times, in which case the effect
              is  the same as concatenating the protocols into one instance of
              the option.

              If --proto is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --proto =http,https,sftp https://example.com

              See also --proto-redir and --proto-default.

       --proxy-anyauth
              Tells  curl to pick a suitable authentication method when commu-
              nicating with the given HTTP proxy. This might  cause  an  extra
              request/response round-trip.

              Providing --proxy-anyauth multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-anyauth --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy, --proxy-basic and --proxy-digest.

       --proxy-basic
              Tells  curl  to use HTTP Basic authentication when communicating
              with the given proxy. Use --basic for enabling HTTP Basic with a
              remote  host.  Basic  is  the default authentication method curl
              uses with proxies.

              Providing --proxy-basic multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-basic --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy, --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-digest.

       --proxy-cacert <file>
              Same as --cacert but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-cacert is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-cacert CA-file.txt -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See  also  --proxy-capath,  --cacert,  --capath and -x, --proxy.
              Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-capath <dir>
              Same as --capath but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-capath is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-capath /local/directory -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See  also  --proxy-cacert,  -x,  --proxy  and --capath. Added in
              7.52.0.

       --proxy-cert-type <type>
              Same as --cert-type but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-cert-type is provided several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-cert-type PEM --proxy-cert file -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-cert. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-cert <cert[:passwd]>
              Same as -E, --cert but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If  --proxy-cert  is  provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-cert file -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-cert-type. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-ciphers <list>
              Same as --ciphers but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-ciphers is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-CCM8 -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --ciphers, --curves and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-crlfile <file>
              Same as --crlfile but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-crlfile is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-crlfile rejects.txt -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --crlfile and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-digest
              Tells curl to use HTTP Digest authentication when  communicating
              with the given proxy. Use --digest for enabling HTTP Digest with
              a remote host.

              Providing --proxy-digest multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-digest --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

       --proxy-header <header/@file>
              (HTTP) Extra header to include in the request when sending  HTTP
              to a proxy. You may specify any number of extra headers. This is
              the equivalent option to -H, --header but is for proxy  communi-
              cation  only  like  in CONNECT requests when you want a separate
              header sent to the proxy to what is sent to  the  actual  remote
              host.

              curl  will  make  sure  that each header you add/replace is sent
              with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus not add that
              as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage
              returns, they will only mess things up for you.

              Headers specified with this option will not be included  in  re-
              quests that curl knows will not be sent to a proxy.

              Starting  in  7.55.0, this option can take an argument in @file-
              name style, which then adds a header for each line in the  input
              file. Using @- will make curl read the header file from stdin.

              This  option  can  be  used multiple times to add/replace/remove
              multiple headers.

              --proxy-header can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl --proxy-header "X-First-Name: Joe" -x http://proxy https://example.com
               curl --proxy-header "User-Agent: surprise" -x http://proxy https://example.com
               curl --proxy-header "Host:" -x http://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy. Added in 7.37.0.

       --proxy-insecure
              Same as -k, --insecure but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Providing --proxy-insecure multiple times has no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-proxy-insecure.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-insecure -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and -k, --insecure. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-key-type <type>
              Same as --key-type but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If  --proxy-key-type  is  provided  several  times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-key-type DER --proxy-key here -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-key and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-key <key>
              Same as --key but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-key is provided several times,  the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-key here -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-key-type and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-negotiate
              Tells  curl  to  use HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication when
              communicating with the given proxy. Use --negotiate for enabling
              HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) with a remote host.

              Providing --proxy-negotiate multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-negotiate --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-basic.

       --proxy-ntlm
              Tells  curl  to  use HTTP NTLM authentication when communicating
              with the given proxy. Use --ntlm for enabling NTLM with a remote
              host.

              Providing --proxy-ntlm multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-ntlm --proxy-user user:passwd -x http://proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-negotiate and --proxy-anyauth.

       --proxy-pass <phrase>
              Same as --pass but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If  --proxy-pass  is  provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-pass secret --proxy-key here -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and --proxy-key. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-pinnedpubkey <hashes>
              (TLS) Tells curl to  use  the  specified  public  key  file  (or
              hashes)  to verify the proxy. This can be a path to a file which
              contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number
              of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by 'sha256//' and sepa-
              rated by ';'.

              When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection,  the  server  sends  a
              certificate  indicating  its identity. A public key is extracted
              from this certificate and if it does not exactly match the  pub-
              lic  key provided to this option, curl will abort the connection
              before sending or receiving any data.

              If --proxy-pinnedpubkey is provided several times, the last  set
              value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --proxy-pinnedpubkey keyfile https://example.com
               curl --proxy-pinnedpubkey 'sha256//ce118b51897f4452dc' https://example.com

              See also --pinnedpubkey and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.59.0.

       --proxy-service-name <name>
              This  option allows you to change the service name for proxy ne-
              gotiation.

              If --proxy-service-name is provided several times, the last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-service-name "shrubbery" -x proxy https://example.com

              See also --service-name and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.43.0.

       --proxy-ssl-allow-beast
              Same as --ssl-allow-beast but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Providing  --proxy-ssl-allow-beast  multiple  times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-proxy-ssl-allow-beast.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-ssl-allow-beast -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --ssl-allow-beast and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert
              Same as --ssl-auto-client-cert but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Providing --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert multiple times has no ex-
              tra  effect.   Disable it again with --no-proxy-ssl-auto-client-
              cert.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See  also  --ssl-auto-client-cert  and  -x,  --proxy.  Added  in
              7.77.0.

       --proxy-tls13-ciphers <ciphersuite list>
              (TLS)  Specifies which cipher suites to use in the connection to
              your HTTPS proxy when it negotiates TLS 1.3. The list of ciphers
              suites  must  specify  valid  ciphers. Read up on TLS 1.3 cipher
              suite details on this URL:

               https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

              This option is currently used only when curl  is  built  to  use
              OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later. If you are using a different SSL backend
              you can try setting TLS 1.3 cipher suites by using the  --proxy-
              ciphers option.

              If --proxy-tls13-ciphers is provided several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-tls13-ciphers TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 -x proxy https://example.com

              See also --tls13-ciphers and --curves. Added in 7.61.0.

       --proxy-tlsauthtype <type>
              Same as --tlsauthtype but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-tlsauthtype is provided several times, the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-tlsauthtype SRP -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and --proxy-tlsuser. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-tlspassword <string>
              Same as --tlspassword but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If  --proxy-tlspassword  is provided several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-tlspassword passwd -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and --proxy-tlsuser. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-tlsuser <name>
              Same as --tlsuser but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-tlsuser is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-tlsuser smith -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and --proxy-tlspassword. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-tlsv1
              Same as -1, --tlsv1 but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Providing --proxy-tlsv1 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-tlsv1 -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       -U, --proxy-user <user:password>
              Specify  the user name and password to use for proxy authentica-
              tion.

              If you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and do either  Ne-
              gotiate  or NTLM authentication then you can tell curl to select
              the user name and password from your environment by specifying a
              single colon with this option: "-U :".

              On systems where it works, curl will hide the given option argu-
              ment from process listings. This is not enough to  protect  cre-
              dentials  from  possibly getting seen by other users on the same
              system as they  will  still  be  visible  for  a  moment  before
              cleared. Such sensitive data should be retrieved from a file in-
              stead or similar and never used in clear text in a command line.
              If -U, --proxy-user is provided  several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-user name:pwd -x proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-pass.

       -x, --proxy [protocol://]host[:port]
              Use the specified proxy.

              The  proxy string can be specified with a protocol:// prefix. No
              protocol specified or http:// will be treated as HTTP proxy. Use
              socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request a spe-
              cific SOCKS version to be used.

              Unix domain sockets are supported for socks proxy. Set localhost
              for the host part. e.g. socks5h://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

              HTTPS  proxy  support  via https:// protocol prefix was added in
              7.52.0 for OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS.

              Unrecognized and unsupported  proxy  protocols  cause  an  error
              since  7.52.0.   Prior  versions may ignore the protocol and use
              http:// instead.

              If the port number is not specified in the proxy string,  it  is
              assumed to be 1080.

              This  option  overrides  existing environment variables that set
              the proxy to use. If there's an environment variable  setting  a
              proxy, you can set proxy to "" to override it.

              All operations that are performed over an HTTP proxy will trans-
              parently be converted to HTTP. It means  that  certain  protocol
              specific operations might not be available. This is not the case
              if you can tunnel through the proxy, as one with the -p, --prox-
              ytunnel option.

              User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are
              URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special  charac-
              ters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.

              The  proxy host can be specified the same way as the proxy envi-
              ronment variables, including the protocol prefix  (http://)  and
              the embedded user + password.

              When a proxy is used, the active FTP mode as set with -P, --ftp-
              port, cannot be used.

              If -x, --proxy is provided several times,  the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy http://proxy.example https://example.com

              See also --socks5 and --proxy-basic.

       --proxy1.0 <host[:port]>
              Use  the  specified  HTTP  1.0  proxy. If the port number is not
              specified, it is assumed at port 1080.

              The only difference between this and the HTTP proxy  option  -x,
              --proxy,  is that attempts to use CONNECT through the proxy will
              specify an HTTP 1.0 protocol instead of the default HTTP 1.1.

              Providing --proxy1.0 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy1.0 -x http://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy, --socks5 and --preproxy.

       -p, --proxytunnel
              When an HTTP proxy is used -x, --proxy, this  option  will  make
              curl  tunnel through the proxy. The tunnel approach is made with
              the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and requires that the  proxy  al-
              lows direct connect to the remote port number curl wants to tun-
              nel through to.

              To suppress proxy CONNECT response headers when curl is  set  to
              output headers use --suppress-connect-headers.

              Providing  -p, --proxytunnel multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-proxytunnel.

              Example:
               curl --proxytunnel -x http://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy.

       --pubkey <key>
              (SFTP SCP) Public key file name. Allows you to provide your pub-
              lic key in this separate file.

              (As of 7.39.0, curl attempts to automatically extract the public
              key from the private key file, so passing this option is  gener-
              ally not required. Note that this public key extraction requires
              libcurl to be linked against a copy of libssh2 1.2.8  or  higher
              that is itself linked against OpenSSL.)

              If  --pubkey  is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --pubkey file.pub sftp://example.com/

              See also --pass.

       -Q, --quote <command>
              (FTP SFTP) Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP  or  SFTP
              server.  Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer takes place
              (just after the initial PWD command in an FTP  transfer,  to  be
              exact). To make commands take place after a successful transfer,
              prefix them with a dash '-'.

              (FTP only) To make commands be sent after curl has  changed  the
              working  directory,  just  before  the file transfer command(s),
              prefix the command with a '+'. This is not performed when a  di-
              rectory listing is performed.

              You may specify any number of commands.

              By  default  curl  will stop at first failure. To make curl con-
              tinue even if the command fails, prefix the command with an  as-
              terisk  (*). Otherwise, if the server returns failure for one of
              the commands, the entire operation will be aborted.

              You must send syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC 959  de-
              fines  to  FTP  servers,  or one of the commands listed below to
              SFTP servers.

              This option can be used multiple times.

              SFTP is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, curl interprets  SFTP
              quote  commands  itself  before sending them to the server. File
              names may be quoted shell-style to embed spaces or special char-
              acters.  Following  is the list of all supported SFTP quote com-
              mands:

              atime date file
                     The atime command sets the last access time of  the  file
                     named  by  the file operand. The <date expression> can be
                     all sorts of date strings, see  the  curl_getdate(3)  man
                     page for date expression details. (Added in 7.73.0)

              chgrp group file
                     The  chgrp command sets the group ID of the file named by
                     the file operand to the group ID specified by  the  group
                     operand. The group operand is a decimal integer group ID.

              chmod mode file
                     The  chmod  command  modifies  the  file mode bits of the
                     specified file. The mode operand is an octal integer mode
                     number.

              chown user file
                     The chown command sets the owner of the file named by the
                     file operand to the user ID specified by the  user  oper-
                     and. The user operand is a decimal integer user ID.

              ln source_file target_file
                     The ln and symlink commands create a symbolic link at the
                     target_file location pointing to  the  source_file  loca-
                     tion.

              mkdir directory_name
                     The  mkdir command creates the directory named by the di-
                     rectory_name operand.

              mtime date file
                     The mtime command sets the last modification time of  the
                     file named by the file operand. The <date expression> can
                     be all sorts of date strings, see the curl_getdate(3) man
                     page for date expression details. (Added in 7.73.0)

              pwd    The pwd command returns the absolute pathname of the cur-
                     rent working directory.

              rename source target
                     The rename command renames the file or directory named by
                     the  source  operand to the destination path named by the
                     target operand.

              rm file
                     The rm command removes the file specified by the file op-
                     erand.

              rmdir directory
                     The  rmdir  command removes the directory entry specified
                     by the directory operand, provided it is empty.

              symlink source_file target_file
                     See ln.

       -Q, --quote can be used several times in a command line

       Example:
        curl --quote "DELE file" ftp://example.com/foo

       See also -X, --request.

       --random-file <file>
              Deprecated option. This option is ignored by curl since  7.84.0.
              Prior  to that it only had an effect on curl if built to use old
              versions of OpenSSL.

              Specify the path name to file containing what will be considered
              as  random  data. The data may be used to seed the random engine
              for SSL connections.

              If --random-file is provided several times, the last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --random-file rubbish https://example.com

              See also --egd-file.

       -r, --range <range>
              (HTTP FTP SFTP FILE) Retrieve a byte range (i.e. a partial docu-
              ment) from an HTTP/1.1, FTP or SFTP  server  or  a  local  FILE.
              Ranges can be specified in a number of ways.

              0-499     specifies the first 500 bytes

              500-999   specifies the second 500 bytes

              -500      specifies the last 500 bytes

              9500-     specifies the bytes from offset 9500 and forward

              0-0,-1    specifies the first and last byte only(*)(HTTP)

              100-199,500-599
                        specifies two separate 100-byte ranges(*) (HTTP)

              (*)  = NOTE that this will cause the server to reply with a mul-
              tipart response, which will be returned as-is by  curl!  Parsing
              or otherwise transforming this response is the responsibility of
              the caller.

              Only digit characters (0-9) are valid in the 'start' and  'stop'
              fields  of the 'start-stop' range syntax. If a non-digit charac-
              ter is given in the range, the server's response will be unspec-
              ified, depending on the server's configuration.

              You  should also be aware that many HTTP/1.1 servers do not have
              this feature enabled, so that when you attempt to get  a  range,
              you will instead get the whole document.

              FTP  and  SFTP  range  downloads only support the simple 'start-
              stop' syntax (optionally with one of the numbers  omitted).  FTP
              use depends on the extended FTP command SIZE.

              If  -r,  --range  is  provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --range 22-44 https://example.com

              See also -C, --continue-at and -a, --append.

       --rate <max request rate>
              Specify the maximum transfer frequency you allow curl to  use  -
              in number of transfer starts per time unit (sometimes called re-
              quest rate). Without this  option,  curl  will  start  the  next
              transfer as fast as possible.

              If  given  several URLs and a transfer completes faster than the
              allowed rate, curl will wait until the next transfer is  started
              to  maintain  the requested rate. This option has no effect when
              -Z, --parallel is used.

              The request rate is provided as "N/U" where N is an integer num-
              ber  and U is a time unit. Supported units are 's' (second), 'm'
              (minute), 'h' (hour) and 'd' /(day, as in a 24 hour  unit).  The
              default  time  unit, if no "/U" is provided, is number of trans-
              fers per hour.

              If curl is told to allow 10 requests per  minute,  it  will  not
              start  the  next  request until 6 seconds have elapsed since the
              previous transfer was started.

              This function uses millisecond resolution. If the  allowed  fre-
              quency is set more than 1000 per second, it will instead run un-
              restricted.

              When retrying transfers,  enabled  with  --retry,  the  separate
              retry delay logic is used and not this setting.

              If  --rate is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Examples:
               curl --rate 2/s https://example.com
               curl --rate 3/h https://example.com
               curl --rate 14/m https://example.com

              See also --limit-rate and --retry-delay. Added in 7.84.0.

       --raw  (HTTP) When used, it disables all internal HTTP decoding of con-
              tent  or transfer encodings and instead makes them passed on un-
              altered, raw.

              Providing --raw multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable  it
              again with --no-raw.

              Example:
               curl --raw https://example.com

              See also --tr-encoding.

       -e, --referer <URL>
              (HTTP) Sends the "Referrer Page" information to the HTTP server.
              This can also be set with the -H, --header flag of course.  When
              used  with  -L,  --location  you  can  append ";auto" to the -e,
              --referer URL to make curl automatically set  the  previous  URL
              when  it  follows  a Location: header. The ";auto" string can be
              used alone, even if you do not set an initial -e, --referer.

              If -e, --referer is provided several times, the last  set  value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --referer "https://fake.example" https://example.com
               curl --referer "https://fake.example;auto" -L https://example.com
               curl --referer ";auto" -L https://example.com

              See also -A, --user-agent and -H, --header.

       -J, --remote-header-name
              (HTTP) This option tells the -O, --remote-name option to use the
              server-specified Content-Disposition  filename  instead  of  ex-
              tracting  a  filename  from the URL. If the server-provided file
              name contains a path, that will be stripped off before the  file
              name is used.

              The  file is saved in the current directory, or in the directory
              specified with --output-dir.

              If the server specifies a file name and a file  with  that  name
              already  exists  in  the  destination  directory, it will not be
              overwritten and an error will occur.  If  the  server  does  not
              specify a file name then this option has no effect.

              There's  no  attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in the provided
              file name, so this option may provide you with rather unexpected
              file names.

              WARNING:  Exercise  judicious  use of this option, especially on
              Windows. A rogue server could send you the  name  of  a  DLL  or
              other file that could be loaded automatically by Windows or some
              third party software.

              Providing -J, --remote-header-name multiple times has  no  extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-remote-header-name.

              Example:
               curl -OJ https://example.com/file

              See also -O, --remote-name.

       --remote-name-all
              This  option changes the default action for all given URLs to be
              dealt with as if -O, --remote-name were used for each one. So if
              you want to disable that for a specific URL after --remote-name-
              all has been used, you must use "-o -" or --no-remote-name.

              Providing --remote-name-all multiple times has no extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-remote-name-all.

              Example:
               curl --remote-name-all ftp://example.com/file1 ftp://example.com/file2

              See also -O, --remote-name.

       -O, --remote-name
              Write  output to a local file named like the remote file we get.
              (Only the file part of the remote file is used, the path is  cut
              off.)

              The  file will be saved in the current working directory. If you
              want the file saved in a  different  directory,  make  sure  you
              change  the  current working directory before invoking curl with
              this option or use --output-dir.

              The remote file name to use for saving  is  extracted  from  the
              given  URL,  nothing  else,  and if it already exists it will be
              overwritten. If you want the server to be  able  to  choose  the
              file name refer to -J, --remote-header-name which can be used in
              addition to this option. If the server chooses a file  name  and
              that name already exists it will not be overwritten.

              There is no URL decoding done on the file name. If it has %20 or
              other URL encoded parts of the name, they will end up  as-is  as
              file name.

              You  may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you
              have.

              -O, --remote-name can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl -O https://example.com/filename

              See  also  --remote-name-all,  --output-dir  and  -J,  --remote-
              header-name.

       -R, --remote-time
              When  used,  this will make curl attempt to figure out the time-
              stamp of the remote file, and if that is available make the  lo-
              cal file get that same timestamp.

              Providing  -R, --remote-time multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-remote-time.

              Example:
               curl --remote-time -o foo https://example.com

              See also -O, --remote-name and -z, --time-cond.

       --remove-on-error
              When curl returns an error when told to save output in  a  local
              file,  this  option removes that saved file before exiting. This
              prevents curl from leaving a partial file in the case of an  er-
              ror during transfer.

              If the output is not a file, this option has no effect.

              Providing  --remove-on-error multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-remove-on-error.

              Example:
               curl --remove-on-error -o output https://example.com

              See also -f, --fail. Added in 7.83.0.

       --request-target <path>
              (HTTP) Tells curl to use an alternative "target" (path)  instead
              of  using  the  path as provided in the URL. Particularly useful
              when wanting to issue HTTP requests  without  leading  slash  or
              other  data  that  does not follow the regular URL pattern, like
              "OPTIONS *".

              If --request-target is provided  several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --request-target "*" -X OPTIONS https://example.com

              See also -X, --request. Added in 7.55.0.

       -X, --request <method>
              (HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicat-
              ing with the HTTP server. The specified request method  will  be
              used  instead  of  the  method otherwise used (which defaults to
              GET). Read the HTTP 1.1 specification for details  and  explana-
              tions.  Common  additional HTTP requests include PUT and DELETE,
              but related technologies like WebDAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE
              and more.

              Normally  you  do  not need this option. All sorts of GET, HEAD,
              POST and PUT requests are rather invoked by using dedicated com-
              mand line options.

              This  option  only  changes the actual word used in the HTTP re-
              quest, it does not alter the way curl behaves. So for example if
              you  want  to make a proper HEAD request, using -X HEAD will not
              suffice. You need to use the -I, --head option.

              The method string you set with -X, --request will  be  used  for
              all  requests,  which  if you for example use -L, --location may
              cause unintended side-effects when curl does not change  request
              method according to the HTTP 30x response codes - and similar.

              (FTP) Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of LIST when
              doing file lists with FTP.

              (POP3) Specifies a custom POP3 command to use instead of LIST or
              RETR.

              (IMAP)  Specifies  a custom IMAP command to use instead of LIST.
              (Added in 7.30.0)

              (SMTP) Specifies a custom SMTP command to use instead of HELP or
              VRFY. (Added in 7.34.0)

              If  -X,  --request is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl -X "DELETE" https://example.com
               curl -X NLST ftp://example.com/

              See also --request-target.

       --resolve <[+]host:port:addr[,addr]...>
              Provide a custom address for a specific host and port pair.  Us-
              ing  this, you can make the curl requests(s) use a specified ad-
              dress and prevent the otherwise normally resolved address to  be
              used.  Consider  it a sort of /etc/hosts alternative provided on
              the command line. The port number should be the number used  for
              the  specific  protocol  the host will be used for. It means you
              need several entries if you want to provide address for the same
              host but different ports.

              By  specifying '*' as host you can tell curl to resolve any host
              and specific port pair to the specified address. Wildcard is re-
              solved  last so any --resolve with a specific host and port will
              be used first.

              The provided address set by this option will be used even if -4,
              --ipv4 or -6, --ipv6 is set to make curl use another IP version.
              By prefixing the host with a '+' you can make the entry time out
              after curl's default timeout (1 minute).  Note  that  this  will
              only  make  sense for long running parallel transfers with a lot
              of files. In such cases, if this option is used curl will try to
              resolve  the  host as it normally would once the timeout has ex-
              pired.

              Support for providing the IP address within [brackets] was added
              in 7.57.0.

              Support  for providing multiple IP addresses per entry was added
              in 7.59.0.

              Support for resolving with wildcard was added in 7.64.0.

              Support for the '+' prefix was was added in 7.75.0.

              This option can be used many times to add many host names to re-
              solve.

              --resolve can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --resolve example.com:443:127.0.0.1 https://example.com

              See also --connect-to and --alt-svc.

       --retry-all-errors
              Retry on any error. This option is used together with --retry.

              This  option  is the "sledgehammer" of retrying. Do not use this
              option by default (eg in curlrc), there may be unintended conse-
              quences  such as sending or receiving duplicate data. Do not use
              with redirected input or output. You'd be much better  off  han-
              dling  your unique problems in shell script. Please read the ex-
              ample below.

              WARNING: For server compatibility curl attempts to retry  failed
              flaky  transfers  as close as possible to how they were started,
              but this is not possible with redirected input  or  output.  For
              example,  before  retrying  it removes output data from a failed
              partial transfer that was written to  an  output  file.  However
              this is not true of data redirected to a | pipe or > file, which
              are not reset. We strongly suggest you do not  parse  or  record
              output  via  redirect in combination with this option, since you
              may receive duplicate data.

              By default curl will not error on an HTTP response code that in-
              dicates an HTTP error, if the transfer was successful. For exam-
              ple, if a server replies 404 Not Found and the  reply  is  fully
              received  then  that  is not an error. When --retry is used then
              curl will retry on some HTTP response codes that indicate  tran-
              sient  HTTP  errors, but that does not include most 4xx response
              codes such as 404. If you want to retry on  all  response  codes
              that  indicate  HTTP  errors (4xx and 5xx) then combine with -f,
              --fail.

              Providing --retry-all-errors multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-retry-all-errors.

              Example:
               curl --retry 5 --retry-all-errors https://example.com

              See also --retry. Added in 7.71.0.

       --retry-connrefused
              In  addition to the other conditions, consider ECONNREFUSED as a
              transient error too for --retry. This option  is  used  together
              with --retry.

              Providing  --retry-connrefused  multiple  times has no extra ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --no-retry-connrefused.

              Example:
               curl --retry-connrefused --retry 7 https://example.com

              See also --retry and --retry-all-errors. Added in 7.52.0.

       --retry-delay <seconds>
              Make curl sleep this amount of time before  each  retry  when  a
              transfer  has  failed with a transient error (it changes the de-
              fault backoff time algorithm between retries).  This  option  is
              only  interesting if --retry is also used. Setting this delay to
              zero will make curl use the default backoff time.

              If --retry-delay is provided several times, the last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --retry-delay 5 --retry 7 https://example.com

              See also --retry.

       --retry-max-time <seconds>
              The  retry timer is reset before the first transfer attempt. Re-
              tries will be done as usual (see --retry) as long as  the  timer
              has  not  reached this given limit. Notice that if the timer has
              not reached the limit, the request will be made and  while  per-
              forming,  it  may  take  longer  than this given time period. To
              limit a single request's maximum time, use -m,  --max-time.  Set
              this option to zero to not timeout retries.

              If  --retry-max-time  is  provided  several  times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --retry-max-time 30 --retry 10 https://example.com

              See also --retry.

       --retry <num>
              If a transient error is returned when curl tries  to  perform  a
              transfer,  it  will retry this number of times before giving up.
              Setting the number to 0 makes curl do no retries (which  is  the
              default).  Transient  error  means either: a timeout, an FTP 4xx
              response code or an HTTP 408, 429, 500, 502, 503 or 504 response
              code.

              When  curl  is about to retry a transfer, it will first wait one
              second and then for all forthcoming retries it will  double  the
              waiting  time until it reaches 10 minutes which then will be the
              delay between the rest of the retries.  By  using  --retry-delay
              you   disable  this  exponential  backoff  algorithm.  See  also
              --retry-max-time to limit the total time allowed for retries.

              Since curl 7.66.0, curl will comply with  the  Retry-After:  re-
              sponse  header if one was present to know when to issue the next
              retry.

              If --retry is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --retry 7 https://example.com

              See also --retry-max-time.

       --sasl-authzid <identity>
              Use this authorization identity (authzid), during SASL PLAIN au-
              thentication, in addition to the authentication identity  (auth-
              cid) as specified by -u, --user.

              If  the  option is not specified, the server will derive the au-
              thzid from the authcid, but if specified, and depending  on  the
              server  implementation,  it may be used to access another user's
              inbox, that the user has been granted access  to,  or  a  shared
              mailbox for example.

              If  --sasl-authzid is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --sasl-authzid zid imap://example.com/

              See also --login-options. Added in 7.66.0.

       --sasl-ir
              Enable initial response in SASL authentication.

              Providing --sasl-ir multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-sasl-ir.

              Example:
               curl --sasl-ir imap://example.com/

              See also --sasl-authzid. Added in 7.31.0.

       --service-name <name>
              This option allows you to change the service name for SPNEGO.

              Examples:    --negotiate    --service-name   sockd   would   use
              sockd/server-name.

              If --service-name is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --service-name sockd/server https://example.com

              See also --negotiate and --proxy-service-name. Added in 7.43.0.

       -S, --show-error
              When used with -s, --silent, it makes curl show an error message
              if it fails.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing  -S,  --show-error multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-show-error.

              Example:
               curl --show-error --silent https://example.com

              See also --no-progress-meter.

       -s, --silent
              Silent or quiet mode. Do not show progress meter or  error  mes-
              sages.  Makes  Curl  mute. It will still output the data you ask
              for, potentially even to the terminal/stdout unless you redirect
              it.

              Use  -S,  --show-error  in  addition  to  this option to disable
              progress meter but still show error messages.

              Providing -s, --silent multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-silent.

              Example:
               curl -s https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose, --stderr and --no-progress-meter.

       --socks4 <host[:port]>
              Use the specified SOCKS4 proxy. If the port number is not speci-
              fied, it is assumed at port 1080. Using this  socket  type  make
              curl  resolve  the  host  name and passing the address on to the
              proxy.

              To specify proxy on a unix  domain  socket,  use  localhost  for
              host, e.g.  socks4://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

              This  option  overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy, as they
              are mutually exclusive.

              This option is superfluous since you can specify a socks4  proxy
              with -x, --proxy using a socks4:// protocol prefix.

              Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
              the same time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS  proxy.  In
              such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
              nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

              If --socks4 is provided several times, the last set  value  will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --socks4 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks4a, --socks5 and --socks5-hostname.

       --socks4a <host[:port]>
              Use the specified SOCKS4a proxy. If the port number is not spec-
              ified, it is assumed at port 1080. This asks the  proxy  to  re-
              solve the host name.

              To  specify  proxy  on  a  unix domain socket, use localhost for
              host, e.g.  socks4a://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

              This option overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy,  as  they
              are mutually exclusive.

              This option is superfluous since you can specify a socks4a proxy
              with -x, --proxy using a socks4a:// protocol prefix.

              Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
              the  same  time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. In
              such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
              nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

              If  --socks4a is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --socks4a hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks4, --socks5 and --socks5-hostname.

       --socks5-basic
              Tells curl to use username/password authentication when connect-
              ing  to a SOCKS5 proxy.  The username/password authentication is
              enabled by default.  Use --socks5-gssapi to  force  GSS-API  au-
              thentication to SOCKS5 proxies.

              Providing --socks5-basic multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --socks5-basic --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks5. Added in 7.55.0.

       --socks5-gssapi-nec
              As  part of the GSS-API negotiation a protection mode is negoti-
              ated. RFC 1961 says in section 4.3/4.4 it should  be  protected,
              but  the  NEC  reference  implementation  does  not.  The option
              --socks5-gssapi-nec allows the unprotected exchange of the  pro-
              tection mode negotiation.

              Providing  --socks5-gssapi-nec  multiple  times has no extra ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --no-socks5-gssapi-nec.

              Example:
               curl --socks5-gssapi-nec --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks5.

       --socks5-gssapi-service <name>
              The default service name for a socks server is rcmd/server-fqdn.
              This option allows you to change it.

              Examples:   --socks5  proxy-name  --socks5-gssapi-service  sockd
              would use sockd/proxy-name --socks5 proxy-name  --socks5-gssapi-
              service  sockd/real-name  would  use  sockd/real-name  for cases
              where the proxy-name does not match the principal name.

              If --socks5-gssapi-service is provided several times,  the  last
              set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --socks5-gssapi-service sockd --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks5.

       --socks5-gssapi
              Tells  curl  to  use GSS-API authentication when connecting to a
              SOCKS5 proxy.  The GSS-API authentication is enabled by  default
              (if  curl is compiled with GSS-API support).  Use --socks5-basic
              to force username/password authentication to SOCKS5 proxies.

              Providing --socks5-gssapi multiple times has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-socks5-gssapi.

              Example:
               curl --socks5-gssapi --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks5. Added in 7.55.0.

       --socks5-hostname <host[:port]>
              Use  the  specified  SOCKS5 proxy (and let the proxy resolve the
              host name). If the port number is not specified, it  is  assumed
              at port 1080.

              To  specify  proxy  on  a  unix domain socket, use localhost for
              host, e.g.  socks5h://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

              This option overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy,  as  they
              are mutually exclusive.

              This  option is superfluous since you can specify a socks5 host-
              name proxy with -x, --proxy using a socks5h:// protocol prefix.

              Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
              the  same  time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. In
              such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
              nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

              If  --socks5-hostname  is  provided  several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --socks5-hostname proxy.example:7000 https://example.com

              See also --socks5 and --socks4a.

       --socks5 <host[:port]>
              Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy - but resolve the host  name  lo-
              cally.  If  the  port  number is not specified, it is assumed at
              port 1080.

              To specify proxy on a unix  domain  socket,  use  localhost  for
              host, e.g.  socks5://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

              This  option  overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy, as they
              are mutually exclusive.

              This option is superfluous since you can specify a socks5  proxy
              with -x, --proxy using a socks5:// protocol prefix.

              Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
              the same time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS  proxy.  In
              such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
              nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

              This option (as well as --socks4) does not work with IPV6,  FTPS
              or LDAP.

              If  --socks5  is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --socks5 proxy.example:7000 https://example.com

              See also --socks5-hostname and --socks4a.

       -Y, --speed-limit <speed>
              If a transfer is slower than this given speed (in bytes per sec-
              ond)  for  speed-time seconds it gets aborted. speed-time is set
              with -y, --speed-time and is 30 if not set.

              If -Y, --speed-limit is provided several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --speed-limit 300 --speed-time 10 https://example.com

              See also -y, --speed-time, --limit-rate and -m, --max-time.

       -y, --speed-time <seconds>
              If a transfer runs slower than speed-limit bytes per second dur-
              ing a speed-time period, the transfer is aborted. If  speed-time
              is  used,  the default speed-limit will be 1 unless set with -Y,
              --speed-limit.

              This option controls transfers (in both directions) but will not
              affect  slow connects etc. If this is a concern for you, try the
              --connect-timeout option.

              If -y, --speed-time is provided  several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --speed-limit 300 --speed-time 10 https://example.com

              See also -Y, --speed-limit and --limit-rate.

       --ssl-allow-beast
              This option tells curl to not work around a security flaw in the
              SSL3 and TLS1.0 protocols known as BEAST.  If this option is not
              used,  the SSL layer may use workarounds known to cause interop-
              erability problems with some older SSL implementations.

              WARNING: this option loosens the SSL security, and by using this
              flag you ask for exactly that.

              Providing  --ssl-allow-beast multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ssl-allow-beast.

              Example:
               curl --ssl-allow-beast https://example.com

              See also --proxy-ssl-allow-beast and -k, --insecure.

       --ssl-auto-client-cert
              Tell libcurl to automatically locate and use a  client  certifi-
              cate  for authentication, when requested by the server. This op-
              tion is only supported for Schannel (the native Windows SSL  li-
              brary). Prior to 7.77.0 this was the default behavior in libcurl
              with Schannel. Since the server can request any certificate that
              supports  client  authentication  in the OS certificate store it
              could be a privacy violation and unexpected.

              Providing --ssl-auto-client-cert multiple times has no extra ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --no-ssl-auto-client-cert.

              Example:
               curl --ssl-auto-client-cert https://example.com

              See also --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert. Added in 7.77.0.

       --ssl-no-revoke
              (Schannel) This option tells curl to disable certificate revoca-
              tion checks.  WARNING: this option loosens the SSL security, and
              by using this flag you ask for exactly that.

              Providing  --ssl-no-revoke  multiple  times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ssl-no-revoke.

              Example:
               curl --ssl-no-revoke https://example.com

              See also --crlfile. Added in 7.44.0.

       --ssl-reqd
              (FTP IMAP POP3 SMTP LDAP) Require SSL/TLS  for  the  connection.
              Terminates  the connection if the transfer cannot be upgraded to
              use SSL/TLS.

              This option is handled in LDAP since version 7.81.0. It is fully
              supported  by  the  OpenLDAP backend and rejected by the generic
              ldap backend if explicit TLS is required.

              This option is unnecessary if you use a URL scheme that  in  it-
              self  implies  immediate and implicit use of TLS, like for FTPS,
              IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS and LDAPS. Such transfers will  always  fail
              if the TLS handshake does not work.

              This option was formerly known as --ftp-ssl-reqd.

              Providing  --ssl-reqd  multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-ssl-reqd.

              Example:
               curl --ssl-reqd ftp://example.com

              See also --ssl and -k, --insecure.

       --ssl-revoke-best-effort
              (Schannel) This option tells curl to ignore certificate  revoca-
              tion checks when they failed due to missing/offline distribution
              points for the revocation check lists.

              Providing --ssl-revoke-best-effort multiple times has  no  extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-ssl-revoke-best-effort.

              Example:
               curl --ssl-revoke-best-effort https://example.com

              See also --crlfile and -k, --insecure. Added in 7.70.0.

       --ssl  (FTP  IMAP  POP3 SMTP LDAP) Warning: this is considered an inse-
              cure option. Consider using --ssl-reqd instead to be  sure  curl
              upgrades to a secure connection.

              Try  to  use SSL/TLS for the connection. Reverts to a non-secure
              connection if the server does  not  support  SSL/TLS.  See  also
              --ftp-ssl-control and --ssl-reqd for different levels of encryp-
              tion required.

              This option is handled in LDAP since version 7.81.0. It is fully
              supported  by  the  OpenLDAP  backend and ignored by the generic
              ldap backend.

              Please note that a server may close the connection if the  nego-
              tiation does not succeed.

              This  option  was  formerly known as --ftp-ssl. That option name
              can still be used but will be removed in a future version.

              Providing --ssl multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable  it
              again with --no-ssl.

              Example:
               curl --ssl pop3://example.com/

              See also --ssl-reqd, -k, --insecure and --ciphers.

       -2, --sslv2
              (SSL) This option previously asked curl to use SSLv2, but start-
              ing in curl 7.77.0 this instruction is ignored. SSLv2 is  widely
              considered insecure (see RFC 6176).

              Providing -2, --sslv2 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --sslv2 https://example.com

              See  also  --http1.1  and --http2. -2, --sslv2 requires that the
              underlying libcurl was built to support TLS. This option is  mu-
              tually  exclusive  to  -3, --sslv3 and -1, --tlsv1 and --tlsv1.1
              and --tlsv1.2.

       -3, --sslv3
              (SSL) This option previously asked curl to use SSLv3, but start-
              ing  in curl 7.77.0 this instruction is ignored. SSLv3 is widely
              considered insecure (see RFC 7568).

              Providing -3, --sslv3 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --sslv3 https://example.com

              See also --http1.1 and --http2. -3, --sslv3  requires  that  the
              underlying  libcurl was built to support TLS. This option is mu-
              tually exclusive to -2, --sslv2 and -1,  --tlsv1  and  --tlsv1.1
              and --tlsv1.2.

       --stderr <file>
              Redirect  all writes to stderr to the specified file instead. If
              the file name is a plain '-', it is instead written to stdout.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              If  --stderr  is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --stderr output.txt https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose and -s, --silent.

       --styled-output
              Enables the automatic use of bold font styles when writing  HTTP
              headers  to  the terminal. Use --no-styled-output to switch them
              off.

              Styled output requires a terminal that supports bold fonts. This
              feature  is  not present on curl for Windows due to lack of this
              capability.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing  --styled-output  multiple  times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-styled-output.

              Example:
               curl --styled-output -I https://example.com

              See also -I, --head and -v, --verbose. Added in 7.61.0.

       --suppress-connect-headers
              When -p, --proxytunnel is used and a CONNECT request is made  do
              not  output proxy CONNECT response headers. This option is meant
              to be used with -D, --dump-header or  -i,  --include  which  are
              used to show protocol headers in the output. It has no effect on
              debug options such as -v, --verbose or --trace, or  any  statis-
              tics.

              Providing --suppress-connect-headers multiple times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-suppress-connect-headers.

              Example:
               curl --suppress-connect-headers --include -x proxy https://example.com

              See also -D, --dump-header, -i, --include and -p, --proxytunnel.
              Added in 7.54.0.

       --tcp-fastopen
              Enable use of TCP Fast Open (RFC7413).

              Providing  --tcp-fastopen  multiple  times  has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-tcp-fastopen.

              Example:
               curl --tcp-fastopen https://example.com

              See also --false-start. Added in 7.49.0.

       --tcp-nodelay
              Turn on the TCP_NODELAY option. See the curl_easy_setopt(3)  man
              page for details about this option.

              Since  7.50.2,  curl sets this option by default and you need to
              explicitly switch it off if you do not want it on.

              Providing --tcp-nodelay multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-tcp-nodelay.

              Example:
               curl --tcp-nodelay https://example.com

              See also -N, --no-buffer.

       -t, --telnet-option <opt=val>
              Pass options to the telnet protocol. Supported options are:

              TTYPE=<term> Sets the terminal type.

              XDISPLOC=<X display> Sets the X display location.

              NEW_ENV=<var,val> Sets an environment variable.

              -t, --telnet-option can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl -t TTYPE=vt100 telnet://example.com/

              See also -K, --config.
       --tftp-blksize <value>
              (TFTP) Set TFTP BLKSIZE option (must be >512). This is the block
              size that curl will try to use when transferring data to or from
              a TFTP server. By default 512 bytes will be used.

              If  --tftp-blksize is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --tftp-blksize 1024 tftp://example.com/file

              See also --tftp-no-options.

       --tftp-no-options
              (TFTP) Tells curl not to send TFTP options requests.

              This option improves interop with some legacy  servers  that  do
              not  acknowledge  or  properly implement TFTP options. When this
              option is used --tftp-blksize is ignored.

              Providing --tftp-no-options multiple times has no extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-tftp-no-options.

              Example:
               curl --tftp-no-options tftp://192.168.0.1/

              See also --tftp-blksize. Added in 7.48.0.

       -z, --time-cond <time>
              (HTTP  FTP) Request a file that has been modified later than the
              given time and date, or one that has been modified  before  that
              time.  The <date expression> can be all sorts of date strings or
              if it does not match any internal ones, it is taken as  a  file-
              name  and tries to get the modification date (mtime) from <file>
              instead. See the curl_getdate(3) man pages for  date  expression
              details.

              Start the date expression with a dash (-) to make it request for
              a document that is older than the given date/time, default is  a
              document that is newer than the specified date/time.

              If -z, --time-cond is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl -z "Wed 01 Sep 2021 12:18:00" https://example.com
               curl -z "-Wed 01 Sep 2021 12:18:00" https://example.com
               curl -z file https://example.com

              See also --etag-compare and -R, --remote-time.

       --tls-max <VERSION>
              (SSL) VERSION defines maximum supported TLS version. The minimum
              acceptable  version  is  set  by  tlsv1.0,  tlsv1.1,  tlsv1.2 or
              tlsv1.3.

              If the connection is done without TLS, this option  has  no  ef-
              fect. This includes QUIC-using (HTTP/3) transfers.

              default
                     Use up to recommended TLS version.

              1.0    Use up to TLSv1.0.
              1.1    Use up to TLSv1.1.
              1.2    Use up to TLSv1.2.
              1.3    Use up to TLSv1.3.

       If  --tls-max  is  provided  several  times, the last set value will be
       used.

       Examples:
        curl --tls-max 1.2 https://example.com
        curl --tls-max 1.3 --tlsv1.2 https://example.com

       See also --tlsv1.0, --tlsv1.1, --tlsv1.2 and --tlsv1.3.  --tls-max  re-
       quires  that  the underlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in
       7.54.0.

       --tls13-ciphers <ciphersuite list>
              (TLS) Specifies which cipher suites to use in the connection  if
              it  negotiates  TLS 1.3. The list of ciphers suites must specify
              valid ciphers. Read up on TLS 1.3 cipher suite details  on  this
              URL:

               https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

              This  option  is  currently  used only when curl is built to use
              OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later. If you are using a different SSL backend
              you can try setting TLS 1.3 cipher suites by using the --ciphers
              option.

              If --tls13-ciphers is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --tls13-ciphers TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 https://example.com

              See also --ciphers and --curves. Added in 7.61.0.

       --tlsauthtype <type>
              Set  TLS  authentication type. Currently, the only supported op-
              tion  is  "SRP",  for  TLS-SRP  (RFC  5054).  If  --tlsuser  and
              --tlspassword  are specified but --tlsauthtype is not, then this
              option defaults to "SRP". This option works only if the underly-
              ing  libcurl  is  built  with  TLS-SRP  support,  which requires
              OpenSSL or GnuTLS with TLS-SRP support.

              If --tlsauthtype is provided several times, the last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --tlsauthtype SRP https://example.com

              See also --tlsuser.

       --tlspassword <string>
              Set  password  for use with the TLS authentication method speci-
              fied with --tlsauthtype. Requires that --tlsuser also be set.

              This option does not work with TLS 1.3.

              If --tlspassword is provided several times, the last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --tlspassword pwd --tlsuser user https://example.com

              See also --tlsuser.

       --tlsuser <name>
              Set  username  for use with the TLS authentication method speci-
              fied with --tlsauthtype. Requires  that  --tlspassword  also  is
              set.

              This option does not work with TLS 1.3.

              If  --tlsuser is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl --tlspassword pwd --tlsuser user https://example.com

              See also --tlspassword.

       --tlsv1.0
              (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.0 or later when  connect-
              ing to a remote TLS server.

              In  old  versions  of  curl  this option was documented to allow
              _only_ TLS 1.0.  That behavior was inconsistent depending on the
              TLS library. Use --tls-max if you want to set a maximum TLS ver-
              sion.

              Providing --tlsv1.0 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --tlsv1.0 https://example.com

              See also --tlsv1.3. Added in 7.34.0.

       --tlsv1.1
              (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.1 or later when  connect-
              ing to a remote TLS server.

              In  old  versions  of  curl  this option was documented to allow
              _only_ TLS 1.1.  That behavior was inconsistent depending on the
              TLS library. Use --tls-max if you want to set a maximum TLS ver-
              sion.

              Providing --tlsv1.1 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --tlsv1.1 https://example.com

              See also --tlsv1.3 and --tls-max. Added in 7.34.0.

       --tlsv1.2
              (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.2 or later when  connect-
              ing to a remote TLS server.

              In  old  versions  of  curl  this option was documented to allow
              _only_ TLS 1.2.  That behavior was inconsistent depending on the
              TLS library. Use --tls-max if you want to set a maximum TLS ver-
              sion.

              Providing --tlsv1.2 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --tlsv1.2 https://example.com

              See also --tlsv1.3 and --tls-max. Added in 7.34.0.

       --tlsv1.3
              (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.3 or later when  connect-
              ing to a remote TLS server.

              If  the  connection  is done without TLS, this option has no ef-
              fect. This includes QUIC-using (HTTP/3) transfers.

              Note that TLS 1.3 is not supported by all TLS backends.
              Providing --tlsv1.3 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --tlsv1.3 https://example.com

              See also --tlsv1.2 and --tls-max. Added in 7.52.0.

       -1, --tlsv1
              (SSL) Tells curl to use at least TLS version 1.x when  negotiat-
              ing  with  a  remote  TLS  server. That means TLS version 1.0 or
              higher

              Providing -1, --tlsv1 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --tlsv1 https://example.com

              See also --http1.1 and --http2. -1, --tlsv1  requires  that  the
              underlying  libcurl was built to support TLS. This option is mu-
              tually exclusive to --tlsv1.1 and --tlsv1.2 and --tlsv1.3.

       --tr-encoding
              (HTTP) Request a compressed Transfer-Encoding response using one
              of  the  algorithms curl supports, and uncompress the data while
              receiving it.

              Providing --tr-encoding multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-tr-encoding.

              Example:
               curl --tr-encoding https://example.com

              See also --compressed.

       --trace-ascii <file>
              Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, in-
              cluding descriptive information, to the given output  file.  Use
              "-" as filename to have the output sent to stdout.

              This is similar to --trace, but leaves out the hex part and only
              shows the ASCII part of the dump. It makes smaller  output  that
              might be easier to read for untrained humans.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              If --trace-ascii is provided several times, the last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --trace-ascii log.txt https://example.com

              See  also -v, --verbose and --trace. This option is mutually ex-
              clusive to --trace and -v, --verbose.

       --trace-time
              Prepends a time stamp to each trace or verbose  line  that  curl
              displays.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing --trace-time multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-trace-time.

              Example:
               curl --trace-time --trace-ascii output https://example.com

              See also --trace and -v, --verbose.

       --trace <file>
              Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, in-
              cluding descriptive information, to the given output  file.  Use
              "-"  as  filename  to have the output sent to stdout. Use "%" as
              filename to have the output sent to stderr.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              If --trace is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --trace log.txt https://example.com

              See also --trace-ascii and --trace-time. This option is mutually
              exclusive to -v, --verbose and --trace-ascii.

       --unix-socket <path>
              (HTTP) Connect through this Unix domain socket, instead of using
              the network.

              If --unix-socket is provided several times, the last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --unix-socket socket-path https://example.com

              See also --abstract-unix-socket. Added in 7.40.0.

       -T, --upload-file <file>
              This  transfers  the  specified local file to the remote URL. If
              there is no file part in the specified URL, curl will append the
              local file name. NOTE that you must use a trailing / on the last
              directory to really prove to Curl that there is no file name  or
              curl will think that your last directory name is the remote file
              name to use. That will most likely cause the upload operation to
              fail. If this is used on an HTTP(S) server, the PUT command will
              be used.

              Use the file name "-" (a single dash) to use stdin instead of  a
              given  file.   Alternately,  the file name "." (a single period)
              may be specified instead of "-" to  use  stdin  in  non-blocking
              mode  to  allow  reading  server output while stdin is being up-
              loaded.

              You can specify one -T, --upload-file for each URL on  the  com-
              mand  line.  Each -T, --upload-file + URL pair specifies what to
              upload and to where. curl also supports "globbing"  of  the  -T,
              --upload-file  argument,  meaning  that  you can upload multiple
              files to a single URL by using the same URL globbing style  sup-
              ported in the URL.

              When  uploading  to an SMTP server: the uploaded data is assumed
              to be RFC 5322 formatted. It has to feature the necessary set of
              headers  and  mail  body formatted correctly by the user as curl
              will not transcode nor encode it further in any way.

              -T, --upload-file can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl -T file https://example.com
               curl -T "img[1-1000].png" ftp://ftp.example.com/
               curl --upload-file "{file1,file2}" https://example.com

              See also -G, --get and -I, --head.

       --url-query <data>
              (all) This option adds a piece of data, usually a name  +  value
              pair,  to the end of the URL query part. The syntax is identical
              to that used for --data-urlencode with one extension:

              If the argument starts with a '+' (plus), the rest of the string
              is provided as-is unencoded.

              The  query  part of a URL is the one following the question mark
              on the right end.

              --url-query can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl --url-query name=val https://example.com
               curl --url-query =encodethis http://example.net/foo
               curl --url-query name@file https://example.com
               curl --url-query @fileonly https://example.com
               curl --url-query "+name=%20foo" https://example.com

              See also --data-urlencode and -G, --get. Added in 7.87.0.

       --url <url>
              Specify a URL to fetch. This option is  mostly  handy  when  you
              want to specify URL(s) in a config file.

              If  the given URL is missing a scheme name (such as "http://" or
              "ftp://" etc) then curl will make a guess based on the host.  If
              the  outermost  sub-domain  name  matches DICT, FTP, IMAP, LDAP,
              POP3 or SMTP then that protocol will  be  used,  otherwise  HTTP
              will be used. Since 7.45.0 guessing can be disabled by setting a
              default protocol, see --proto-default for details.

              To control where this URL is written, use the  -o,  --output  or
              the -O, --remote-name options.

              WARNING:  On  Windows,  particular  file:// accesses can be con-
              verted to network accesses by the operating system. Beware!

              --url can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --url https://example.com

              See also -:, --next and -K, --config.

       -B, --use-ascii
              (FTP LDAP) Enable ASCII transfer. For FTP, this can also be  en-
              forced  by  using  a  URL  that ends with ";type=A". This option
              causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems.
              Providing -B, --use-ascii multiple times has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-use-ascii.

              Example:
               curl -B ftp://example.com/README

              See also --crlf and --data-ascii.

       -A, --user-agent <name>
              (HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server.
              To encode blanks in the string, surround the string with  single
              quote  marks.  This header can also be set with the -H, --header
              or the --proxy-header options.

              If you give an empty argument to -A, --user-agent (""), it  will
              remove  the  header completely from the request. If you prefer a
              blank header, you can set it to a single space (" ").

              If -A, --user-agent is provided  several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl -A "Agent 007" https://example.com

              See also -H, --header and --proxy-header.

       -u, --user <user:password>
              Specify the user name and password to use for server authentica-
              tion. Overrides -n, --netrc and --netrc-optional.

              If you simply specify the user name,  curl  will  prompt  for  a
              password.

              The  user  name  and  passwords are split up on the first colon,
              which makes it impossible to use a colon in the user  name  with
              this option. The password can, still.

              On systems where it works, curl will hide the given option argu-
              ment from process listings. This is not enough to  protect  cre-
              dentials  from  possibly getting seen by other users on the same
              system as they  will  still  be  visible  for  a  moment  before
              cleared. Such sensitive data should be retrieved from a file in-
              stead or similar and never used in clear text in a command line.
              When using Kerberos V5 with a Windows based  server  you  should
              include  the  Windows domain name in the user name, in order for
              the server to successfully obtain a Kerberos Ticket. If  you  do
              not, then the initial authentication handshake may fail.

              When  using  NTLM,  the user name can be specified simply as the
              user name, without the domain, if there is a single  domain  and
              forest in your setup for example.

              To  specify  the domain name use either Down-Level Logon Name or
              UPN (User Principal Name) formats. For example, EXAMPLE\user and
              user@example.com respectively.

              If  you  use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and perform Ker-
              beros V5, Negotiate, NTLM or Digest authentication then you  can
              tell  curl  to select the user name and password from your envi-
              ronment by specifying a single colon with this option: "-u :".

              If -u, --user is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.
              Example:
               curl -u user:secret https://example.com

              See also -n, --netrc and -K, --config.

       -v, --verbose
              Makes  curl  verbose  during the operation. Useful for debugging
              and seeing what's going on "under the  hood".  A  line  starting
              with  '>'  means  "header  data" sent by curl, '<' means "header
              data" received by curl that is hidden in  normal  cases,  and  a
              line starting with '*' means additional info provided by curl.

              If you only want HTTP headers in the output, -i, --include might
              be the option you are looking for.

              If you think this option still does not give you enough details,
              consider using --trace or --trace-ascii instead.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Use -s, --silent to make curl really quiet.

              Providing -v, --verbose multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-verbose.

              Example:
               curl --verbose https://example.com

              See  also  -i,  --include.  This option is mutually exclusive to
              --trace and --trace-ascii.

       -V, --version
              Displays information about curl and the libcurl version it uses.
              The first line includes the full version of  curl,  libcurl  and
              other 3rd party libraries linked with the executable.

              The  second  line (starts with "Protocols:") shows all protocols
              that libcurl reports to support.

              The third line (starts with "Features:") shows specific features
              libcurl reports to offer. Available features include:

              alt-svc
                     Support for the Alt-Svc: header is provided.

              AsynchDNS
                     This  curl  uses asynchronous name resolves. Asynchronous
                     name resolves can be done using either the c-ares or  the
                     threaded resolver backends.

                     (like EBCDIC)

              Debug  This curl uses a libcurl built with Debug.  This  enables
                     more  error-tracking  and memory debugging etc. For curl-
                     developers only!

              gsasl  The built-in SASL authentication includes  extensions  to

              NTLM_WB
                     NTLM delegation to winbind helper is supported.

              PSL    PSL  is  short for Public Suffix List and means that this
                     curl has been built with  knowledge  about  "public  suf-
                     fixes".

              SPNEGO SPNEGO authentication is supported.

                     over HTTP is supported.

       Providing -V, --version multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it
       again with --no-version.

       Example:
        curl --version

       See also -h, --help and -M, --manual.

       -w, --write-out <format>
              Make curl display information on stdout after a completed trans-
              fer. The format is a string that may contain  plain  text  mixed
              with  any  number of variables. The format can be specified as a
              literal "string", or you can have curl read the  format  from  a
              file  with  "@filename" and to tell curl to read the format from
              stdin you write "@-".

              The variables present in the output format will  be  substituted
              by  the  value or text that curl thinks fit, as described below.
              All variables are specified as %{variable_name} and to output  a
              normal  % you just write them as %%. You can output a newline by
              using \n, a carriage return with \r and a tab space with \t.

              The output will be written to standard output, but this  can  be
              switched to standard error by using %{stderr}.

              Output  HTTP  headers  from  the  most  recent  request by using
              %header{name} where name is the case  insensitive  name  of  the
              header (without the trailing colon). The header contents are ex-
              actly as sent over the network, with leading and trailing white-
              space trimmed. Added in curl 7.84.0.

              NOTE: The %-symbol is a special symbol in the win32-environment,
              where all occurrences of % must be doubled when using  this  op-
              tion.

              The variables available are:

              content_type   The  Content-Type  of  the requested document, if
                             there was any.

              errormsg       The error message. (Added in 7.75.0)

              exitcode       The numerical exitcode of the transfer. (Added in
                             7.75.0)

              filename_effective
                             The  ultimate  filename  that curl writes out to.
                             This is only meaningful if curl is told to  write
                             to  a  file  with  the  -O,  --remote-name or -o,
                             --output option. It's most useful in  combination
                             with the -J, --remote-header-name option.

              ftp_entry_path The initial path curl ended up in when logging on
                             to the remote FTP server.

              header_json    A JSON object with all HTTP response headers from
                             the  recent  transfer. Values are provided as ar-
                             rays, since in the case of multiple headers there
                             can be multiple values.

                             The header names provided in lowercase, listed in
                             order of appearance over the wire. Except for du-
                             plicated  headers.  They are grouped on the first
                             occurrence of that header,  each  value  is  pre-
                             sented in the JSON array.

              http_code      The numerical response code that was found in the
                             last retrieved HTTP(S) or FTP(s) transfer.

              http_connect   The numerical code that was found in the last re-
                             sponse (from a proxy) to a curl CONNECT request.

              http_version   The  http  version  that  was  effectively  used.
                             (Added in 7.50.0)

              json           A JSON object with all available keys.

              local_ip       The IP address of the local end of the  most  re-
                             cently  done  connection  - can be either IPv4 or

                             7.73.0)

              num_redirects  Number of redirects that were followed in the re-
                             quest.

              onerror        The  rest  of  the  output  is  only shown if the
                             transfer returned  a  non-zero  error  (Added  in
                             7.75.0)

              proxy_ssl_verify_result

                             cate verification that was requested. 0 means the
                             verification was successful. (Added in 7.52.0)

              redirect_url   When an HTTP request was made without -L, --loca-
                             tion to follow redirects (or when --max-redirs is
                             met),  this  variable  will show the actual URL a
                             redirect would have gone to.

              referer        The Referer: header, if there was any. (Added  in

                             was effectively used. (Added in 7.52.0)

              size_download  The  total  amount of bytes that were downloaded.
                             This is the size of the body/data that was trans-
                             ferred, excluding headers.

              size_header    The total amount of bytes of the downloaded head-

              speed_download The average download speed that curl measured for
                             the complete download. Bytes per second.

              speed_upload   The average upload speed that curl  measured  for
                             the complete upload. Bytes per second.

              ssl_verify_result
                             The  result of the SSL peer certificate verifica-
                             tion that was requested. 0 means the verification
                             was successful.

              stderr         From  this  point  on, the -w, --write-out output
                             will be written  to  standard  error.  (Added  in
                             7.63.0)

              stdout         From  this  point  on, the -w, --write-out output
                             will be written to standard output.  This is  the
                             default,  but  can  be  used to switch back after
                             switching to stderr.  (Added in 7.63.0)

              time_appconnect
                             The time, in seconds, it took from the start  un-
                             til  the SSL/SSH/etc connect/handshake to the re-
                             mote host was completed.

              time_connect   The time, in seconds, it took from the start  un-
                             til the TCP connect to the remote host (or proxy)
                             was completed.

              time_namelookup
                             The time, in seconds, it took from the start  un-
                             til the name resolving was completed.

              time_pretransfer
                             The  time, in seconds, it took from the start un-
                             til the file transfer was just  about  to  begin.
                             This includes all pre-transfer commands and nego-
                             tiations that are specific to the particular pro-
                             tocol(s) involved.

              time_redirect  The time, in seconds, it took for all redirection
                             steps including name lookup, connect, pretransfer
                             and  transfer  before  the  final transaction was
                             started. time_redirect shows the complete  execu-
                             tion time for multiple redirections.

              time_starttransfer
                             The  time, in seconds, it took from the start un-
                             til the first byte was just about  to  be  trans-
                             ferred.  This  includes time_pretransfer and also
                             the time the server needed to calculate  the  re-
                             sult.

              time_total     The  total time, in seconds, that the full opera-
                             tion lasted.

              url            The URL that was fetched. (Added in 7.75.0)

              urlnum         The URL index number of this transfer, 0-indexed.
                             De-globbed  URLs  share  the same index number as
                             the origin globbed URL. (Added in 7.75.0)

              url_effective  The URL that was fetched last. This is most mean-
                             ingful  if you have told curl to follow location:
                             headers.

              If -w, --write-out is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl -w '%{http_code}\n' https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose and -I, --head.

       --xattr
              When  saving  output  to a file, this option tells curl to store
              certain file metadata in extended  file  attributes.  Currently,
              the URL is stored in the xdg.origin.url attribute and, for HTTP,
              the content type is stored in the mime_type  attribute.  If  the
              file  system  does not support extended attributes, a warning is
              issued.

              Providing --xattr multiple times has no extra  effect.   Disable
              it again with --no-xattr.

              Example:
               curl --xattr -o storage https://example.com

              See also -R, --remote-time, -w, --write-out and -v, --verbose.

FILES
       ~/.curlrc
              Default config file, see -K, --config for details.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variables can be specified in lower case or upper case.
       The lower case version has precedence. http_proxy is an exception as it
       is only available in lower case.

       Using  an  environment variable to set the proxy has the same effect as
       using the -x, --proxy option.

       http_proxy [protocol://]<host>[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use for HTTP.
       HTTPS_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use for HTTPS.

       [url-protocol]_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use for [url-protocol], where the  pro-
              tocol  is  a  protocol  that curl supports and as specified in a
              URL. FTP, FTPS, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, LDAP, etc.

       ALL_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use if no  protocol-specific  proxy  is
              set.

       NO_PROXY <comma-separated list of hosts/domains>
              list  of host names that should not go through any proxy. If set
              to an asterisk '*' only, it matches all hosts. Each name in this
              list is matched as either a domain name which contains the host-
              name, or the hostname itself.

              This environment variable disables use of the  proxy  even  when
              specified  with  the  -x,  --proxy  option. That is NO_PROXY=di-
              rect.example.com  curl  -x  http://proxy.example.com  http://di-
              rect.example.com   accesses   the   target   URL  directly,  and
              NO_PROXY=direct.example.com  curl  -x   http://proxy.example.com
              http://somewhere.example.com accesses the target URL through the
              proxy.

              The list of host names can also  be  include  numerical  IP  ad-
              dresses,  and IPv6 versions should then be given without enclos-
              ing brackets.

              Since 7.86.0, IP addresses can be specified using CIDR notation:
              an  appended  slash  and number specifies the number of "network
              bits" out of the address to use in the comparison.  For  example
              "192.168.0.0/16"   would   match  all  addresses  starting  with
              "192.168".

       APPDATA <dir>
              On Windows, this variable is used when trying to find  the  home
              directory. If the primary home variable are all unset.

       COLUMNS <terminal width>
              If  set,  the specified number of characters will be used as the
              terminal width when the alternative progress-bar  is  shown.  If
              not set, curl will try to figure it out using other ways.

       CURL_CA_BUNDLE <file>
              If set, will be used as the --cacert value.

       CURL_HOME <dir>
              If  set,  is  the first variable curl checks when trying to find
              its home directory. If not set, it continues to  check  XDG_CON-
              FIG_HOME

       CURL_SSL_BACKEND <TLS backend>
              If  curl  was built with support for "MultiSSL", meaning that it
              has built-in support for more than one TLS backend,  this  envi-
              ronment  variable can be set to the case insensitive name of the
              particular backend to use when curl is invoked. Setting  a  name
              that  is not a built-in alternative will make curl stay with the
              default.

              SSL backend names (case-insensitive):  bearssl,  gnutls,  gskit,
              mbedtls, nss, openssl, rustls, schannel, secure-transport, wolf-
              ssl

       HOME <dir>
              If set, this is used to find the home  directory  when  that  is
              needed. Like when looking for the default .curlrc. CURL_HOME and
              XDG_CONFIG_HOME have preference.

       QLOGDIR <directory name>
              If curl was built with HTTP/3 support, setting this  environment
              variable  to  a  local directory will make curl produce qlogs in
              that directory, using file names  named  after  the  destination
              connection  id  (in  hex).  Do  note that these files can become
              rather large. Works with both QUIC backends.

       SHELL  Used on VMS when trying to detect if using a  DCL  or  a  "unix"
              shell.

       SSL_CERT_DIR <dir>
              If set, will be used as the --capath value.

       SSL_CERT_FILE <path>
              If set, will be used as the --cacert value.

       SSLKEYLOGFILE <file name>
              If  you  set this environment variable to a file name, curl will
              store TLS secrets from its connections in that file when invoked
              to enable you to analyze the TLS traffic in real time using net-
              work analyzing tools such as Wireshark. This works with the fol-
              lowing  TLS  backends: OpenSSL, libressl, BoringSSL, GnuTLS, NSS
              and wolfSSL.

       USERPROFILE <dir>
              On Windows, this variable is used when trying to find  the  home
              directory.  If  the  other,  primary, variable are all unset. If
              set, curl will use the path "$USERPROFILE\Application Data".

       XDG_CONFIG_HOME <dir>
              If CURL_HOME is not set, this variable is checked  when  looking
              for a default .curlrc file.

PROXY PROTOCOL PREFIXES
       The  proxy string may be specified with a protocol:// prefix to specify
       alternative proxy protocols.

       If no protocol is specified in the proxy string or if the  string  does
       not match a supported one, the proxy will be treated as an HTTP proxy.

       The supported proxy protocol prefixes are as follows:

       http://
              Makes  it use it as an HTTP proxy. The default if no scheme pre-
              fix is used.

       https://
              Makes it treated as an HTTPS proxy.

       socks4://
              Makes it the equivalent of --socks4

       socks4a://
              Makes it the equivalent of --socks4a

       socks5://
              Makes it the equivalent of --socks5

       socks5h://
              Makes it the equivalent of --socks5-hostname

EXIT CODES
       There are a bunch of different error codes and their corresponding  er-
       ror  messages  that  may  appear under error conditions. At the time of
       this writing, the exit codes are:

       0      Success. The operation completed successfully according  to  the
              instructions.

       1      Unsupported protocol. This build of curl has no support for this
              protocol.

       2      Failed to initialize.

       3      URL malformed. The syntax was not correct.

       4      A feature or option that was needed to perform the  desired  re-
              quest  was not enabled or was explicitly disabled at build-time.
              To make curl able to do this, you probably need another build of
              libcurl.

       5      Could  not  resolve proxy. The given proxy host could not be re-
              solved.

       6      Could not resolve host. The given remote host could not  be  re-
              solved.

       7      Failed to connect to host.

       8      Weird server reply. The server sent data curl could not parse.

       9      FTP  access  denied. The server denied login or denied access to
              the particular resource or directory you wanted to  reach.  Most
              often  you tried to change to a directory that does not exist on
              the server.

       10     FTP accept failed. While waiting for the server to connect  back
              when  an active FTP session is used, an error code was sent over
              the control connection or similar.

       11     FTP weird PASS reply. Curl could not parse the reply sent to the
              PASS request.

       12     During  an  active  FTP  session while waiting for the server to
              connect back to curl, the timeout expired.

       13     FTP weird PASV reply, Curl could not parse the reply sent to the
              PASV request.

       14     FTP  weird  227  format.  Curl  could not parse the 227-line the
              server sent.

       15     FTP cannot use host. Could not resolve the host IP we got in the
              227-line.

       16     HTTP/2 error. A problem was detected in the HTTP2 framing layer.
              This is somewhat generic and can be one out of several problems,
              see the error message for details.

       17     FTP  could  not  set binary. Could not change transfer method to
              binary.

       18     Partial file. Only a part of the file was transferred.

       19     FTP could not download/access the given file, the RETR (or simi-
              lar) command failed.

       21     FTP quote error. A quote command returned error from the server.
       22     HTTP  page not retrieved. The requested URL was not found or re-
              turned another error with the  HTTP  error  code  being  400  or
              above. This return code only appears if -f, --fail is used.

       23     Write  error. Curl could not write data to a local filesystem or
              similar.

       25     FTP could not STOR file. The server denied the  STOR  operation,
              used for FTP uploading.

       26     Read error. Various reading problems.

       27     Out of memory. A memory allocation request failed.

       28     Operation timeout. The specified time-out period was reached ac-
              cording to the conditions.

       30     FTP PORT failed. The PORT command failed. Not  all  FTP  servers
              support  the  PORT  command, try doing a transfer using PASV in-
