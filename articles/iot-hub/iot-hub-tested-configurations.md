# OS Platforms and hardware compatibility

This document describes the SDK compatibility with different OS platforms as well as the specific device configurations included in the [Microsoft Azure Certified for IoT program](#microsoft-azure-certified-for-iot). If you already have a device, please look at the list of included devices in the program to find device-specific information on compatibility. If you're unsure of which device to use, please take a look at the [OS Platform and libraries](#os-platforms) compatibility section.


## OS Platforms

The Azure IoT libraries have been tested on the following operating system platforms:


|Linux/Unix OS platforms  |   Version|

Managed agent code requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5


## Microsoft Azure Certified for IoT

**Microsoft Azure Certified for IoT** is the partner program that connects the broader IoT ecosystem  with Microsoft Azure so that developers and architects understand the compatibility scenarios. Specifically, it provides a trusted list of OS/device combinations to help you get started quickly with an IoT project – whether you’re in a proof of concept or pilot phase. With certified device and operating system combinations, your IoT project can get started quickly, with less work and customization required to make sure devices are compatible with  Azure IoT Suite and Azure IoT Hub.


## Certified for IoT devices

**Certified for IoT** devices have tested compatibility with the Azure IoT SDKs and are ready to be used in your IoT application. Specifically, we identify compatibility based on OS Platform and code language.

#### Devices list

Each device has been certified to work with our SDK in the OS and language chosen by the device manufacturer. For example, BeagleBone Black works on Debian using our C, Javascript and Java language. This means that developers can build applications in any of those languages and OS combinations on the specific devices.

|Device| Tested OS |Language|
|:---------|:----------|:----------|
|Raspberry Pi 2| Raspbian | C, Javascript, Java |
|Raspberry Pi 2| Windows 10 IoT Core|  C, Javascript, C#|
|BeagleBone Black| Debian |C, Javascript, Java|
|BeagleBone Green|Debian |C, Javascript, Java|
|TI CC3200 | TI-RTOS 2.x|C|
|Intel Edison |Yocto |C, Javascript|
|Minnowboard Max |Windows 7,8, 10 |C#|
|Arrow DragonBoard 410c |Windows 10 IoT Core | C#|
|Freescale FRDM K64 |mbed 2.0 | C|
