# Create and delete routes and endpoints by using the Azure portal

This article shows you how to create a route and endpoint in your hub in Azure IoT Hub and then delete your route and endpoint. Learn how to use the Azure portal to create routes and endpoints for Azure Event Hubs, Azure Service Bus queues and topics, Azure Storage, and Azure Cosmos DB.

To learn more about how routing works in IoT Hub, see [Use IoT Hub message routing to send device-to-cloud messages to different endpoints](./iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c.md). To walk through setting up a route that sends messages to storage and then testing on a simulated device, see [Tutorial: Send device data to Azure Storage by using IoT Hub message routing](./tutorial-routing.md?tabs=portal).

## Prerequisites

The procedures that are described in the article use the following resources:

* The Azure portal
* An IoT hub
* An endpoint service in Azure

### Azure portal

This article uses the Azure portal to work with IoT Hub and other Azure services. To learn more about how to use the Azure portal, see [What is the Azure portal?](/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-overview).

### IoT hub

To create an IoT hub route, you need an IoT hub that you created by using Azure IoT Hub. Device messages and events originate in your IoT hub.

Be sure to have the following hub resource to use when you create your IoT hub route:

* An IoT hub in your Azure subscription. If you don't have a hub yet, you can follow the steps in [Create an IoT hub](create-hub.md).

### Endpoint service

To create an IoT hub route, you need at least one other Azure service to use as an endpoint to the route. The endpoint receives device messages and events. You can choose which Azure service you use for an endpoint to connect with your IoT hub route: Event Hubs, Service Bus queues or topics, Azure Storage, or Azure Cosmos DB.

Be sure to have *one* of the following resources to use when you create an endpoint your IoT hub route:

* An Event Hubs resource (namespace and entity). If you need to create a new Event Hubs resource, see [Quickstart: Create an event hub by using the Azure portal](../event-hubs/event-hubs-create.md).

* A Service Bus queue resource (namespace and queue). If you need to create a new Service Bus queue, see [Use the Azure portal to create a Service Bus namespace and queue](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-quickstart-portal.md).

* A Service Bus topic resource (namespace and topic). If you need to create a new Service Bus topic, see [Use the Azure portal to create a Service Bus topic and subscriptions to the topic](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-quickstart-topics-subscriptions-portal.md).

* An Azure Storage resource (account and container). If you need to create a new storage account in Azure, see [Create a storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=azure-portal). When you create a storage account, you have many options, but you need only a new container in your account for this article.

* An Azure Cosmos DB resource (account, database, and container). If you need to create a new instance of Azure Cosmos DB, see [Create an Azure Cosmos DB account](/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/quickstart-portal#create-account). For the API option, select **Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL**.

## Create a route and endpoint

Routes send messages or event logs to an Azure service for storage or processing. Each route has a data source, where the messages or event logs originate, and an endpoint, where the messages or event logs end up. You can use routing queries to filter messages or events before they go to the endpoint. The endpoint can be an event hub, a Service Bus queue or topic, a storage account, or an Azure Cosmos DB resource.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your IoT hub.

2. In the resource menu under **Hub settings**,  select **Message routing** then select **Add**.

3. On the **Endpoint** tab, select an existing endpoint or create a new one by providing the following information:

   # [Cosmos DB](#tab/cosmosdb)

   | Parameter | Value |
   | --------- | ----- |
   | **Endpoint type** | Select **Cosmos DB**. |
   | **Endpoint name** | Provide a unique name for a new endpoint, or select **Select existing** to choose an existing Storage endpoint. |
   | **Cosmos DB account** | Use the drop-down menu to select an existing Cosmos DB account in your subscription. |
   | **Database** | Use the drop-down menu to select an existing database in your Cosmos DB account. |

4. Select **Create + next** to create the endpoint and continue to create a route.

5. On the **Route** tab, create a new route to your endpoint by providing the following information:

   | Parameter | Value |
   | --------- | ----- |
   | **Name** | Provide a unique name for the route. |
   | **Data source** | Use the drop-down menu to select a data source for the route. You can route data from telemetry messages or [non-telemetry events](./iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c.md#non-telemetry-events) |
   | **Routing query** | Optionally, add a query to filter the data before routing. For more information, see [IoT Hub message routing query syntax](./iot-hub-devguide-routing-query-syntax.md). |
