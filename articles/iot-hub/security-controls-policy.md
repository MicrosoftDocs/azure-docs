# Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance controls for Azure IoT Hub

[Regulatory Compliance in Azure Policy](../governance/policy/concepts/regulatory-compliance.md)
provides Microsoft created and managed initiative definitions, known as _built-ins_, for the
**compliance domains** and **security controls** related to different compliance standards. This
page lists the **compliance domains** and **security controls** for Azure IoT Hub. You can assign
the built-ins for a **security control** individually to help make your Azure resources compliant
with the specific standard.
