# X.509 certificates

X.509 certificates are digital documents that represent a user, computer, service, or device. A certificate authority (CA), subordinate CA, or registration authority issues X.509 certificates. The certificates contain the public key of the certificate subject. They don't contain the subject's private key, which must be stored securely. [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280) documents public key certificates, including their fields and extensions. Public key certificates are digitally signed and typically contain the following information:

* Information about the certificate subject
* The public key that corresponds to the subject's private key
* Information about the issuing CA
* The supported encryption and/or digital signing algorithms
* Information to determine the revocation and validity status of the certificate

## Certificate fields

There are three incremental versions of the X.509 certificate standard, and each subsequent version added certificate fields to the standard: 

* Version 1 (v1), published in 1988, follows the initial X.509 standard for certificates.
* Version 2 (v2), published in 1993, adds two fields to the fields included in Version 1.
* Version 3 (v3), published in 2008, represents the current version of the X.509 standard. This version adds support for certificate extensions.

This section is meant as a general reference for the certificate fields and certificate extensions available in X.509 certificates. For more information about certificate fields and certificate extensions, including data types, constraints, and other details, see the [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280) specification.

### Version 1 fields

The following table describes Version 1 certificate fields for X.509 certificates. All of the fields included in this table are available in subsequent X.509 certificate versions.

## Certificate formats

Certificates can be saved in various formats. Azure IoT Hub authentication typically uses the Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) and Personal Information Exchange (PFX) formats. The following table describes commonly used files and formats used to represent certificates.

| Format | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Binary certificate | A raw form binary certificate using Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) ASN.1 encoding. |
| ASCII PEM format | A PEM certificate (.pem) file contains a Base64-encoded certificate beginning with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and ending with `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`. One of the most common formats for X.509 certificates, PEM format is required by IoT Hub when uploading certain certificates, such as device certificates. |
| ASCII PEM key | Contains a Base64-encoded DER key, optionally with more metadata about the algorithm used for password protection. |
| PKCS #7 certificate | A format designed for the transport of signed or encrypted data. It can include the entire certificate chain. [RFC 2315](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2315) defines this format. |
| PKCS #8 key | The format for a private key store. [RFC 5208](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5208) defines this format. |
| PKCS #12 key and certificate | A complex format that can store and protect a key and the entire certificate chain. It's commonly used with a .p12 or .pfx extension. PKCS #12 is synonymous with the PFX format. [RFC 7292](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7292) defines this format. |

## Self-signed certificates

You can authenticate a device to your IoT hub for testing purposes by using two self-signed certificates. This type of authentication is sometimes called *thumbprint authentication* because the certificates are identified by calculated hash values called *fingerprints* or *thumbprints*. These calculated hash values are used by IoT Hub to authenticate your devices.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>We recommend that you use certificates signed by an issuing Certificate Authority (CA), even for testing purposes. Never use self-signed certificates in production.

### Create a self-signed certificate

You can use [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) to create self-signed certificates. The following steps show you how to run OpenSSL commands in a bash shell to create a self-signed certificate and retrieve a certificate fingerprint that can be used for authenticating your device in IoT Hub. 

>[!NOTE]
>If you want to use self-signed certificates for testing, you must create two certificates for each device. 

1. Run the following command to generate a private key and create a PEM-encoded private key (.key) file, replacing the following placeholders with their corresponding values. The private key generated by the following command uses the RSA algorithm with 2048-bit encryption.

    *{KeyFile}*. The name of your private key file.

    ```bash
    openssl genpkey -out {KeyFile} -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
    ```

1. Run the following command to generate a PKCS #10 certificate signing request (CSR) and create a CSR (.csr) file, replacing the following placeholders with their corresponding values. Make sure that you specify the device ID of the IoT device for your self-signed certificate when prompted.

    *{KeyFile}*. The name of your private key file.

    *{CsrFile}*. The name of your CSR file.

    *{DeviceID}*. The name of your IoT device.

    ```bash
    openssl req -new -key {KeyFile} -out {CsrFile}
    
    Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:.
    State or Province Name (full name) []:.
    Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:.
    Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:.
    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:.
    Common Name (eg, your name or your server hostname) []:{DeviceID}
    Email Address []:.
    
    Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
    to be sent with your certificate request
    A challenge password []:.
    An optional company name []:.
    ```

1.  Run the following command to examine and verify your CSR, replacing the following placeholders with their corresponding values. 

    *{CsrFile}*. The name of your certificate file.

    ```bash
    openssl req -text -in {CsrFile} -verify -noout
    ```
    
1. Run the following command to generate a self-signed certificate and create a PEM-encoded certificate (.crt) file, replacing the following placeholders with their corresponding values. The command converts and signs your CSR with your private key, generating a self-signed certificate that expires in 365 days. 

    *{KeyFile}*. The name of your private key file.

    *{CsrFile}*. The name of your CSR file.

    *{CrtFile}*. The name of your certificate file.

    ```bash
    openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in {CsrFile} -signkey {KeyFile} -out {CrtFile}
    ```

1. Run the following command to retrieve the fingerprint of the certificate, replacing the following placeholders with their corresponding values. The fingerprint of a certificate is a calculated hash value that is unique to that certificate. You need the fingerprint to configure your IoT device in IoT Hub for testing.

    *{CrtFile}*. The name of your certificate file.

    ```bash
    openssl x509 -in {CrtFile} -noout -fingerprint
    ```

### Verify certificate manually after upload

When you upload your root certificate authority (CA) certificate or subordinate CA certificate to your IoT hub, you can choose to automatically verify the certificate. If you didn't choose to automatically verify your certificate during upload, your certificate is shown with its status set to **Unverified**. You must perform the following steps to manually verify your certificate. 

1. Select the certificate to view the **Certificate Details** dialog.
 
1. Select **Generate Verification Code** in the dialog.

    :::image type="content" source="media/reference-x509-certificates/certificate-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the certificate details dialog.":::
    
1. Copy the verification code to the clipboard. You must use this verification code as the certificate subject in subsequent steps. For example, if the verification code is `75B86466DA34D2B04C0C4C9557A119687ADAE7D4732BDDB3`, add that as the subject of your certificate as shown in the next step.

1. There are three ways to generate a verification certificate:

    - If you're using the PowerShell script supplied by Microsoft, run `New-CACertsVerificationCert "<verification code>"` to create a certificate named `VerifyCert4.cer`, replacing `<verification code>` with the previously generated verification code. For more information, see [Managing test CA certificates for samples and tutorials](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/main/tools/CACertificates/CACertificateOverview.md) in the GitHub repository for the [Azure IoT Hub Device SDK for C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c).

    - If you're using the Bash script supplied by Microsoft, run `./certGen.sh create_verification_certificate "<verification code>"` to create a certificate named verification-code.cert.pem, replacing `<verification code>` with the previously generated verification code. For more information, see [Managing test CA certificates for samples and tutorials](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/main/tools/CACertificates/CACertificateOverview.md) in the GitHub repository for the Azure IoT Hub Device SDK for C.

    - If you're using OpenSSL to generate your certificates, you must first generate a private key, then generate a certificate signing request (CSR) file. In the following example, replace `<verification code>` with the previously generated verification code:
    
    ```bash
    openssl genpkey -out pop.key -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

    openssl req -new -key pop.key -out pop.csr

    -----
    Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:.
    State or Province Name (full name) []:.
    Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:.
    Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:.
    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:.
    Common Name (eg, your name or your server hostname) []:<verification code>
    Email Address []:
    
    Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
    to be sent with your certificate request
    A challenge password []:
    An optional company name []:
    ```

    Then, create a certificate using the appropriate configuration file for either the root CA or the subordinate CA, and the CSR file. The following example demonstrates how to use OpenSSL to create the certificate from a root CA configuration file and the CSR file.

    ```bash
    openssl ca -config rootca.conf -in pop.csr -out pop.crt -extensions client_ext
    ```

    For more information, see [Tutorial - Create and upload certificates for testing](tutorial-x509-test-certs.md).

1. Select the new certificate in the **Certificate Details** view.

1. After the certificate uploads, select **Verify**. The certificate status should change to **Verified**.
