# Azure IoT Hub monitoring data reference

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-intro](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-intro.md)]

See [Monitor Azure IoT](monitor-iot-hub.md) for details on the data you can collect for IoT Hub and how to use it.

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro.md)]

### Supported metrics for Microsoft.Devices/IoTHubs

The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.Devices/IoTHubs resource type.

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader.md)]
[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Devices/IoTHubs](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/reference/metrics/microsoft-devices-iothubs-metrics-include.md)]

### Supported aggregations

The **Aggregation Type** column in the table corresponds to the default aggregation that is used when the metric is selected for a chart or alert.

:::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-iot-hub-reference/aggregation-type.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing aggregation for metrics.":::

For most metrics, all aggregation types are valid. For count metrics with a **Unit** column value of **Count**, only some aggregations are valid. Count metrics can be one of two types:

- For **Single-point** count metrics, IoT Hub registers a single data point (essentially a 1) every time the measured operation occurs. Azure Monitor then sums these data points over the specified granularity. Examples of **Single-point** metrics are *Telemetry messages sent* and *C2D message deliveries completed*. For these metrics, the only relevant aggregation type is Total (Sum). The portal allows you to choose minimum, maximum, and average. These values are always 1.

- For **Snapshot** count metrics, IoT Hub registers a total count when the measured operation occurs. Currently, there are three **Snapshot** metrics emitted by IoT Hub: *Total number of messages used*, *Total devices*, and *Connected devices*. Because these metrics present a "total" quantity every time, summing them over the specified granularity makes no sense. Azure Monitor limits you to selecting average, minimum, and maximum for the aggregation type for these metrics.

### Supported resource logs for Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/reference/logs/microsoft-devices-iothubs-logs-include.md)]

The following sections list the resource log category types and schemas collected for Azure IoT Hub. Events are emitted only for errors in some categories.

### Cloud-to-device commands category

The cloud-to-device commands category tracks errors that occur at the IoT hub and are related to the cloud-to-device message pipeline. This category includes errors that occur from:

- Sending cloud-to-device messages (like unauthorized sender errors),
- Receiving cloud-to-device messages (like delivery count exceeded errors), and
- Receiving cloud-to-device message feedback (like feedback expired errors).

This category doesn't catch errors when the cloud-to-device message is delivered successfully but then improperly handled by the device.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": " UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",

        }
    ]
}
```

### Cloud-to-device twin operations category

The cloud-to-device twin operations category tracks service-initiated events on device twins. These operations can include get twin, update or replace tags, and update or replace desired properties.

             "location": "Central US"
         }
    ]
}
```

### Device telemetry category

The device telemetry category tracks errors that occur at the IoT hub and are related to the telemetry pipeline. This category includes errors that occur when sending telemetry events (such as throttling) and receiving telemetry events (such as unauthorized reader). This category can't catch errors caused by code running on the device itself.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",

            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Direct methods category

The direct methods category tracks request-response interactions sent to individual devices. These requests are initiated in the cloud.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "send",
            "category": "DirectMethods",
            "level": "Information",
            "durationMs": "1",
            "properties": "{\"deviceId\":<messageSize>, \"RequestSize\": 1, \"ResponseSize\": 1, \"sdkVersion\": \"2017-07-11\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Distributed tracing category (preview)

The distributed tracing category tracks the correlation IDs for messages that carry the trace context header. To fully enable these logs, client-side code must be updated by following [Analyze and diagnose IoT applications end-to-end with IoT Hub distributed tracing (preview)](iot-hub-distributed-tracing.md).

The `correlationId` conforms to the [W3C Trace Context](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context) proposal, where it contains a `trace-id` and a `span-id`.

#### IoT Hub D2C (device-to-cloud) logs

IoT Hub records this log when a message containing valid trace properties arrives at IoT Hub.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "DiagnosticIoTHubD2C",
            "category": "DistributedTracing",
            "correlationId": "00-8cd869a412459a25f5b4f31311223344-0144d2590aacd909-01",
            "level": "Information",
            "resultType": "Success",
            "resultDescription":"Receive message success",
            "durationMs": "",
            "properties": "{\"messageSize\": 1, \"deviceId\":\"<deviceId>\", \"callerLocalTimeUtc\": : \"2017-02-22T03:27:28.633Z\", \"calleeLocalTimeUtc\": \"2017-02-22T03:27:28.687Z\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

Here, `durationMs` isn't calculated as IoT Hub's clock might not be in sync with the device clock, and thus a duration calculation can be misleading. We recommend writing logic using the timestamps in the `properties` section to capture spikes in device-to-cloud latency.

| Property | Type | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **messageSize** | Integer | The size of device-to-cloud message in bytes |
| **deviceId** | String of ASCII 7-bit alphanumeric characters | The identity of the device |
| **callerLocalTimeUtc** | UTC timestamp | The creation time of the message as reported by the device local clock |
| **calleeLocalTimeUtc** | UTC timestamp | The time of message arrival at the IoT Hub's gateway as reported by IoT Hub service side clock |

#### IoT Hub ingress logs

IoT Hub records this log when message containing valid trace properties writes to internal or built-in Event Hubs.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "DiagnosticIoTHubIngress",
            "category": "DistributedTracing",
            "correlationId": "00-8cd869a412459a25f5b4f31311223344-349810a9bbd28730-01",
            "level": "Information",
            "resultType": "Success",
            "resultDescription":"Ingress message success",
            "durationMs": "10",
            "properties": "{\"isRoutingEnabled\": \"true\", \"parentSpanId\":\"0144d2590aacd909\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

In the `properties` section, this log contains additional information about message ingress.

| Property | Type | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **isRoutingEnabled** | String | Either true or false, indicates whether or not message routing is enabled in the IoT Hub |
| **parentSpanId** | String | The [span-id](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/#parent-id) of the parent message, which would be the D2C message trace in this case |

#### IoT Hub egress logs

IoT Hub records this log when [routing](iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c.md) is enabled and the message is written to an [endpoint](iot-hub-devguide-endpoints.md). If routing isn't enabled, IoT Hub doesn't record this log.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "DiagnosticIoTHubEgress",
            "category": "DistributedTracing",
            "correlationId": "00-8cd869a412459a25f5b4f31311223344-98ac3578922acd26-01",
            "level": "Information",
            "resultType": "Success",
            "resultDescription":"Egress message success",
            "durationMs": "10",
            "properties": "{\"endpointType\": \"EventHub\", \"endpointName\": \"myEventHub\", \"parentSpanId\":\"349810a9bbd28730\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

In the `properties` section, this log contains additional information about message ingress.

| Property | Type | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **endpointName** | String | The name of the routing endpoint |
| **endpointType** | String | The type of the routing endpoint |
| **parentSpanId** | String | The [span-id](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/#parent-id) of the parent message, which would be the IoT Hub ingress message trace in this case |

### File upload operations category

The file upload category tracks errors that occur at the IoT hub and are related to file upload functionality. This category includes:

- Errors that occur with the SAS URI, such as when it expires before a device notifies the hub of a completed upload.
- Failed uploads reported by the device.
- Errors that occur when a file isn't found in storage during IoT Hub notification message creation.

This category can't catch errors that directly occur while the device is uploading a file to storage.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "ingress",
            "category": "FileUploadOperations",
            "level": "Error",
            "resultType": "Event status",
            "resultDescription": "MessageDescription",
            "durationMs": "1",
            "properties": "{\"deviceId\":\"<deviceId>\",\"protocol\":\"<protocol>\",\"authType\":\"{\\\"scope\\\":\\\"device\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"sas\\\",\\\"issuer\\\":\\\"iothub\\\",\\\"acceptingIpFilterRule\\\":null}\",\"blobUri\":\"http//bloburi.com\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Jobs operations category

The jobs operations category reports on job requests to update device twins or invoke direct methods on multiple devices. These requests are initiated in the cloud.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "jobCompleted",
            "category": "JobsOperations",
            "level": "Information",
            "durationMs": "1",
            "properties": "{\"jobId\":\"<jobId>\", \"sdkVersion\": \"<sdkVersion>\",\"messageSize\": <messageSize>,\"filter\":\"DeviceId IN ['1414ded9-b445-414d-89b9-e48e8c6285d5']\",\"startTimeUtc\":\"Wednesday, September 13, 2017\",\"duration\":\"0\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Routes category

The [message routing](./iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c.md) category tracks errors that occur during message route evaluation and endpoint health as perceived by IoT Hub. This category includes events such as:

- A rule evaluates to "undefined"
- IoT Hub marks an endpoint as dead
- Any errors received from an endpoint

This category doesn't include specific errors about the messages themselves (like device throttling errors), which are reported under the "device telemetry" category.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time":"2019-12-12T03:25:14Z",
            "resourceId":"/SUBSCRIPTIONS/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/RESOURCEGROUPS/ANON-TEST/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.DEVICES/IOTHUBS/ANONHUB1",
            "operationName":"endpointUnhealthy",
            "category":"Routes",
            "level":"Error",
            "resultType":"403004",
            "resultDescription":"DeviceMaximumQueueDepthExceeded",
            "properties":"{\"deviceId\":null,\"endpointName\":\"anon-sb-1\",\"messageId\":null,\"details\":\"DeviceMaximumQueueDepthExceeded\",\"routeName\":null,\"statusCode\":\"403\"}",
            "location":"westus"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Twin queries category

The twin queries category reports on query requests for device twins that are initiated in the cloud.

```json
{
    "records":
    [
        {
            "time": "UTC timestamp",
            "resourceId": "Resource Id",
            "operationName": "query",
            "category": "TwinQueries",
            "level": "Information",
            "durationMs": "1",
            "properties": "{\"query\":\"<twin query>\",\"sdkVersion\":\"<sdkVersion>\",\"messageSize\":\"<messageSize>\",\"pageSize\":\"<pageSize>\", \"continuation\":\"<true, false>\", \"resultSize\":\"<resultSize>\"}",
            "location": "Resource location"
        }
    ]
}
```
