# Azure Policy built-in policy definitions for Azure IoT Hub

For IoT Hub sample code that shows how to implement common IoT scenarios, see the [IoT Hub quickstarts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/quickstart-send-telemetry-cli). There are quickstarts for multiple programming languages including C, Node.js, and Python.

This page is an index of [Azure Policy](../governance/policy/overview.md) built-in policy
definitions for Azure IoT Hub. For additional Azure Policy built-ins for other services,
see [Azure Policy built-in definitions](../governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies.md).

The name of each built-in policy definition links to the policy definition in the Azure portal. Use
the link in the **Version** column to view the source on the
[Azure Policy GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy).
