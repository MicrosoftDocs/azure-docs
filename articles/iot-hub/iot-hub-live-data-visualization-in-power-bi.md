# Tutorial: Visualize real-time sensor data from Azure IoT Hub using Power BI

You can use Microsoft Power BI to visualize real-time sensor data that your Azure IoT hub receives. To do so, configure an Azure Stream Analytics job to consume the data from IoT Hub and route it to a dataset in Power BI.

:::image type="content" source="./media/iot-hub-live-data-visualization-in-power-bi/end-to-end-diagram.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows the data flow from the device to Power BI." border="false":::

[Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) is a data visualization tool that you can use to perform self-service and enterprise business intelligence (BI) over large data sets. [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics/#overview) is a fully managed, real-time analytics service designed to help you analyze and process fast moving streams of data that can be used to get insights, build reports or trigger alerts and actions.

In this tutorial, you perform the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a consumer group on your IoT hub.
> * Create and configure an Azure Stream Analytics job to read temperature telemetry from your consumer group and send it to Power BI.
> * Create a report of the temperature data in Power BI and share it to the web.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, have the following prerequisites in place:

* Complete one of the [Send telemetry](../iot/tutorial-send-telemetry-iot-hub.md?toc=/azure/iot-hub/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-hub/breadcrumb/toc.json) quickstarts in the development language of your choice. Alternatively, you can use any device app that sends temperature telemetry; for example, the [Raspberry Pi online simulator](raspberry-pi-get-started.md) or one of the [Embedded device tutorials](../iot/tutorial-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub.md). These articles cover the following requirements:

  * An active Azure subscription.
  * An Azure IoT hub in your subscription.
  * A client app that sends messages to your Azure IoT hub.

* A Power BI account. [Try Power BI for free.](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/)

9. You're provided the report link that you can share with anyone for report access and a code snippet that you can use to integrate the report into a blog or website. Copy the link in the **Secure embed code** window and then close the window.

10. Open a web browser and paste the link into the address bar to view your report in the browser.

Microsoft also offers the [Power BI mobile apps](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/documentation/powerbi-power-bi-apps-for-mobile-devices/) for viewing and interacting with your Power BI dashboards and reports on your mobile device.

## Clean up resources

In this tutorial, you created a Stream Analytics job and a dataset in Power BI.

If you plan to complete other tutorials, you may want to keep the resource group and IoT hub, so you can reuse them later.

### Clean up Azure resources

Your Stream Analytics job should be in the same resource group as your IoT hub. If you don't need the IoT hub or the other resources you created any longer, you can delete the entire resource group in the Azure portal. Or, you can delete individual resources.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your resource group.
1. Review the resources in your group. If you want to delete them all, select **Delete resource group**. If you want to delete an individual resource, right-click the resource, select **Delete** from the context menu, and follow the prompts.

To remove the resource group and all of its resources, you can also use the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command:

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name {your resource group}
```

### Clean up Power BI resources

You created a dataset, **PowerBiVisualizationDataSet**, in Power BI. You can delete your dataset and the associated report you created from the Power BI service.

1. Sign in to your [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) account.
1. Select **Workspaces**, then select the name of the workspace that contains your dataset.
1. Hover over the **PowerBiVisualizationDataSet** dataset and select the three horizontal dots that appear to open the **More options** menu.
1. Select **Delete** and follow the prompts. When you remove the dataset, the report is removed as well.
