# PowerShell scripts to manage CA-signed X.509 certificates

The X.509 certificate-based security in the IoT Hub requires you to start with an [X.509 certificate chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509#Certificate_chains_and_cross-certification), which includes the root certificate as well as any intermediate certificates up until the leaf certificate. This *How to* guide walks you through sample PowerShell scripts that use [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) to create and sign X.509 certificates. We recommend you to use this guide for experimentation only, since many of these steps will happen during manufacturing process in the real world. You can use these certificates to simulate security in your Azure IoT hub using the *X.509 Certificate Authentication*. The steps in this guide create certificates locally on your Windows machine. 

## Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes that you have acquired the OpenSSL binaries. You may either
    - download the OpenSSL source code and build the binaries on your machine, or 
    - download and install any [third-party OpenSSL binaries](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries), for example, from [this project on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openssl/).

## Create X.509 certificates
The following steps show an example of how to create the X.509 root certificates locally. 

1. Open a PowerShell window as an *Administrator*. 
2. Navigate to your working directory. Run the following script to set the global variables. 
    ```PowerShell
    $openSSLBinSource = "<full_path_to_the_binaries>\OpenSSL\bin"
    $errorActionPreference    = "stop"

    # Note that these values are for test purpose only
    $_rootCertSubject         = "CN=Azure IoT Root CA"
    $_intermediateCertSubject = "CN=Azure IoT Intermediate {0} CA"
    $_privateKeyPassword      = "123"

    $rootCACerFileName          = "./RootCA.cer"
    $rootCAPemFileName          = "./RootCA.pem"
    $intermediate1CAPemFileName = "./Intermediate1.pem"
    $intermediate2CAPemFileName = "./Intermediate2.pem"
    $intermediate3CAPemFileName = "./Intermediate3.pem"

    $openSSLBinDir              = Join-Path $ENV:TEMP "openssl-bin"

    # Whether to use ECC or RSA.
    $useEcc                     = $true
    ```
3. Run the following script that copies the OpenSSL binaries to your working directory and sets the environment variables:

    ```PowerShell
    function Initialize-CAOpenSSL()
    {
        Write-Host ("Beginning copy of openssl binaries to {0} (and setting up env variables...)" -f $openSSLBinDir)
        if (-not (Test-Path $openSSLBinDir))
        {
            mkdir $openSSLBinDir | Out-Null
        }

        robocopy $openSSLBinSource $openSSLBinDir * /s 
        robocopy $openSSLBinSource . * /s 

        Write-Host "Setting up PATH and other environment variables."
        $ENV:PATH += "; $openSSLBinDir"
        $ENV:OPENSSL_CONF = Join-Path $openSSLBinDir "openssl.cnf"

        Write-Host "Success"
    }
    Initialize-CAOpenSSL
    ```
4. Next, run the following script that searches whether a certificate by the specified *Subject Name* is already installed, and whether OpenSSL is configured correctly on your machine:
    ```PowerShell
    function Get-CACertBySubjectName([string]$subjectName)
    {
        $certificates = gci -Recurse Cert:\LocalMachine\ |? { $_.gettype().name -eq "X509Certificate2" }
        $cert = $certificates |? { $_.subject -eq $subjectName -and $_.PSParentPath -eq "Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\Certificate::LocalMachine\My" }
        if ($NULL -eq $cert)
        {
            throw ("Unable to find certificate with subjectName {0}" -f $subjectName)
        }
    
        write $cert
    }
    function Test-CAPrerequisites()
    {
        $certInstalled = $null
        try
        {
            $certInstalled = Get-CACertBySubjectName $_rootCertSubject
        }
        catch {}

        if ($NULL -ne $certInstalled)
        {
            throw ("Certificate {0} already installed.  Cleanup CA certs 1st" -f $_rootCertSubject)
        }

        if ($NULL -eq $ENV:OPENSSL_CONF)
        {
            throw ("OpenSSL not configured on this system.  Run 'Initialize-CAOpenSSL' (even if you've already done so) to set everything up.")
        }
        Write-Host "Success"
    }
    Test-CAPrerequisites
    ```
    If everything is configured correctly, you should see "Success" message.

## Create X.509 certificate chain
Create a certificate chain with a root CA, for example, "CN=Azure IoT Root CA" that this sample uses, by running the following PowerShell script. This script also updates your Windows OS certificate store, as well creates certificate files in your working directory. 
    1. The following script creates a PowerShell function to create a self signed certificate, for a given *Subject Name* and signing authority. 
    ```PowerShell
    function New-CASelfsignedCertificate([string]$subjectName, [object]$signingCert, [bool]$isASigner=$true)
    {
	    # Build up argument list
	    $selfSignedArgs =@{"-DnsName"=$subjectName; 
	                       "-CertStoreLocation"="cert:\LocalMachine\My";
                           "-NotAfter"=(get-date).AddDays(30); 
	                      }

	    if ($isASigner -eq $true)
	    {
		    $selfSignedArgs += @{"-KeyUsage"="CertSign"; }
            $selfSignedArgs += @{"-TextExtension"= @(("2.5.29.19={text}ca=TRUE&pathlength=12")); }
	    }
        else
        {
            $selfSignedArgs += @{"-TextExtension"= @("2.5.29.37={text}1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2,1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1", "2.5.29.19={text}ca=FALSE&pathlength=0")  }
        }

	    if ($signingCert -ne $null)
	    {
		    $selfSignedArgs += @{"-Signer"=$signingCert }
	    }

        if ($useEcc -eq $true)
        {
            $selfSignedArgs += @{"-KeyAlgorithm"="ECDSA_nistP256";
                             "-CurveExport"="CurveName" }
        }

	    # Now use splatting to process this
	    Write-Host ("Generating certificate {0} which is for prototyping, NOT PRODUCTION.  It will expire in 30 days." -f $subjectName)
	    write (New-SelfSignedCertificate @selfSignedArgs)
    }
    ``` 
    2. The following PowerShell function creates intermediate X.509 certificates using the preceding function as well as the OpenSSL binaries. 
    ```PowerShell
    function New-CAIntermediateCert([string]$subjectName, [Microsoft.CertificateServices.Commands.Certificate]$signingCert, [string]$pemFileName)
    {
        $certFileName = ($subjectName + ".cer")
        $newCert = New-CASelfsignedCertificate $subjectName $signingCert
        Export-Certificate -Cert $newCert -FilePath $certFileName -Type CERT | Out-Null
        Import-Certificate -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\CA" -FilePath $certFileName | Out-Null

        # Store public PEM for later chaining
        openssl x509 -inform deer -in $certFileName -out $pemFileName

        del $certFileName
   
        write $newCert
    }  
    ```
    3. The following PowerShell function creates the X.509 certificate chain. Read [Certificate chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509#Certificate_chains_and_cross-certification) for more information.
    ```PowerShell
    function New-CACertChain()
    {
        Write-Host "Beginning to install certificate chain to your LocalMachine\My store"
        $rootCACert =  New-CASelfsignedCertificate $_rootCertSubject $null
    
        Export-Certificate -Cert $rootCACert -FilePath $rootCACerFileName  -Type CERT
        Import-Certificate -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\Root" -FilePath $rootCACerFileName

        openssl x509 -inform der -in $rootCACerFileName -out $rootCAPemFileName

        $intermediateCert1 = New-CAIntermediateCert ($_intermediateCertSubject -f "1") $rootCACert $intermediate1CAPemFileName
        $intermediateCert2 = New-CAIntermediateCert ($_intermediateCertSubject -f "2") $intermediateCert1 $intermediate2CAPemFileName
        $intermediateCert3 = New-CAIntermediateCert ($_intermediateCertSubject -f "3") $intermediateCert2 $intermediate3CAPemFileName
        Write-Host "Success"
    }    
    ```
    This script creates a file named *RootCA.cer* in your working directory. 
    4. Finally, use the PowerShell functions above to create the X.509 certificate chain, by running the command `New-CACertChain` in your PowerShell window.

## Proof of possession of your X.509 CA certificate

This script performs the *Proof of Possession* flow for your X.509 certificate. 

In the PowerShell window on your desktop, run the following code:
    ```PowerShell
    function New-CAVerificationCert([string]$requestedSubjectName)
    {
        $cnRequestedSubjectName = ("CN={0}" -f $requestedSubjectName)
        $verifyRequestedFileName = ".\verifyCert4.cer"
        $rootCACert = Get-CACertBySubjectName $_rootCertSubject
        Write-Host "Using Signing Cert:::" 
        Write-Host $rootCACert
    
        $verifyCert = New-CASelfsignedCertificate $cnRequestedSubjectName $rootCACert $false

        Export-Certificate -cert $verifyCert -filePath $verifyRequestedFileName -Type Cert
        if (-not (Test-Path $verifyRequestedFileName))
        {
            throw ("Error: CERT file {0} doesn't exist" -f $verifyRequestedFileName)
        }
    
        Write-Host ("Certificate with subject {0} has been output to {1}" -f $cnRequestedSubjectName, (Join-Path (get-location).path $verifyRequestedFileName)) 
    }
    New-CAVerificationCert "<your verification code>"
    ```
   This creates a certificate with the given subject name, signed by the CA, as a file named *VerifyCert4.cer* in your working directory. This certificate file will help validate with your IoT hub that you have the signing permission (that is, the private key) of this CA.

## Create leaf X.509 certificate for your device

This section shows you can use a PowerShell script that creates a leaf device certificate and the corresponding certificate chain. 

In the PowerShell window on your local machine, run the following script to create a CA-signed X.509 certificate for this device:
    ```PowerShell
    function New-CADevice([string]$deviceName, [string]$signingCertSubject=$_rootCertSubject)
    {
        $cnNewDeviceSubjectName = ("CN={0}" -f $deviceName)
        $newDevicePfxFileName = ("./{0}.pfx" -f $deviceName)
        $newDevicePemAllFileName      = ("./{0}-all.pem" -f $deviceName)
        $newDevicePemPrivateFileName  = ("./{0}-private.pem" -f $deviceName)
        $newDevicePemPublicFileName   = ("./{0}-public.pem" -f $deviceName)
    
        $signingCert = Get-CACertBySubjectName $signingCertSubject ## "CN=Azure IoT CA Intermediate 1 CA"

        $newDeviceCertPfx = New-CASelfSignedCertificate $cnNewDeviceSubjectName $signingCert $false
    
        $certSecureStringPwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $_privateKeyPassword -Force -AsPlainText

        # Export the PFX of the cert we've just created.  The PFX is a format that contains both public and private keys.
        Export-PFXCertificate -cert $newDeviceCertPfx -filePath $newDevicePfxFileName -password $certSecureStringPwd
        if (-not (Test-Path $newDevicePfxFileName))
        {
            throw ("Error: CERT file {0} doesn't exist" -f $newDevicePfxFileName)
        }

        # Begin the massaging.  First, turn the PFX into a PEM file which contains public key, private key, and other attributes.
        Write-Host ("When prompted for password by openssl, enter the password as {0}" -f $_privateKeyPassword)
        openssl pkcs12 -in $newDevicePfxFileName -out $newDevicePemAllFileName -nodes

        # Convert the PEM to get formats we can process
        if ($useEcc -eq $true)
        {
            openssl ec -in $newDevicePemAllFileName -out $newDevicePemPrivateFileName
        }
        else
        {
            openssl rsa -in $newDevicePemAllFileName -out $newDevicePemPrivateFileName
        }
        openssl x509 -in $newDevicePemAllFileName -out $newDevicePemPublicFileName
 
        Write-Host ("Certificate with subject {0} has been output to {1}" -f $cnNewDeviceSubjectName, (Join-Path (get-location).path $newDevicePemPublicFileName)) 
    }
    ```
   Then run `New-CADevice "<yourTestDevice>"` in your PowerShell window, using the friendly name that you used to create your device. When prompted for the password for the CA's private key, enter "123". This creates a _<yourTestDevice>.pfx_ file in your working directory.
