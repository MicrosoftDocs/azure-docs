# Quickstart: Control a device connected to an IoT hub

In this quickstart, you use a direct method to control a simulated device connected to your IoT hub. IoT Hub is an Azure service that lets you manage your IoT devices from the cloud and ingest high volumes of device telemetry to the cloud for storage or processing. You can use direct methods to remotely change the behavior of devices connected to your IoT hub.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you called a direct method on a device from a service application, and responded to the direct method call in a simulated device application.

To learn how to route device-to-cloud messages to different destinations in the cloud, continue to the next tutorial.
