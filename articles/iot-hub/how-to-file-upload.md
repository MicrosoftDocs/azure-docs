# Upload files from a device to the cloud with Azure IoT Hub

This article demonstrates how to:

* Use file upload capabilities of IoT Hub to upload a file to Azure Blob Storage, using an Azure IoT device and service SDKs.
* Notify IoT Hub that the file was successfully uploaded and create a backend service to receive file upload notifications from IoT Hub, using the Azure IoT service SDKs.

In some scenarios, you can't easily map the data your devices send into the relatively small device-to-cloud messages that IoT Hub accepts. The file upload capabilities in IoT Hub enable you to move large or complex data to the cloud. For example:

* Videos
* Large files that contain images
* Vibration data sampled at high frequency
* Some form of preprocessed data

These files are typically batch processed in the cloud, using tools such as [Azure Data Factory](../data-factory/introduction.md) or the [Hadoop](../hdinsight/index.yml) stack. When you need to upload files from a device, you can still use the security and reliability of IoT Hub. This article shows you how.

This article is meant to complement runnable SDK samples that are referenced from within this article.

For more information, see:

* [Overview of file uploads with IoT Hub](iot-hub-devguide-file-upload.md)

## Prerequisites

* **An IoT hub**. Some SDK calls require the IoT Hub primary connection string, so make a note of the connection string.

* **A registered device**. Some SDK calls require the device primary connection string, so make a note of the connection string.

* IoT Hub **Service Connect** permission - To receive file upload notification messages, your backend service needs the **Service Connect** permission. By default, every IoT Hub is created with a shared access policy named **service** that grants this permission. For more information, see [Connect to an IoT hub](/azure/iot-hub/create-hub?&tabs=portal#connect-to-an-iot-hub).

* Configure file upload in your IoT hub by linking an **Azure Storage account** and **Azure Blob Storage container**. You can configure these using the [Azure portal](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-configure-file-upload), [Azure CLI](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-configure-file-upload-cli), or [Azure PowerShell](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-configure-file-upload-powershell).
