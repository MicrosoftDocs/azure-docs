# Trace Azure IoT device-to-cloud messages by using distributed tracing (preview)

Use distributed tracing (preview) in IoT Hub to monitor IoT messages as they pass through Azure services. IoT Hub is one of the first Azure services to support distributed tracing. As more Azure services support distributed tracing, you're able to trace Internet of Things (IoT) messages throughout the Azure services involved in your solution. For more information about the feature, see [What is distributed tracing?](/azure/azure-monitor/app/distributed-trace-data).

When you enable distributed tracing for IoT Hub, you can:

- Monitor the flow of each message through IoT Hub by using [trace context](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context). Trace context includes correlation IDs that allow you to correlate events from one component with events from another component. You can apply it for a subset or all IoT device messages by using a [device twin](iot-hub-devguide-device-twins.md).
- Log the trace context to [Azure Monitor Logs](monitor-iot-hub.md).
- Measure and understand message flow and latency from devices to IoT Hub and routing endpoints.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Distributed tracing an Azure IoT Hub is currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure IoT hub created in one of the following regions.

  - North Europe
  - Southeast Asia
  - West US 2

- A device registered in your IoT hub. If you don't have a device in your IoT hub, follow the steps in [Register a device](create-connect-device.md#register-a-device) and save the device connection string to use in this article.

- This article assumes that you're familiar with sending telemetry messages to your IoT hub.

- The latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Public preview limits and considerations

Consider the following limitations to determine if this preview feature is right for your scenarios:

- The proposal for the W3C Trace Context standard is currently a working draft.
- The only development language that the client SDK currently supports is C, in the [public preview branch of the Azure IoT device SDK for C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/public-preview/readme.md)
- Cloud-to-device twin capability isn't available for the [IoT Hub basic tier](iot-hub-scaling.md). However, IoT Hub still logs to Azure Monitor if it sees a properly composed trace context header.
- To ensure efficient operation, IoT Hub imposes a throttle on the rate of logging that can occur as part of distributed tracing.
- The distributed tracing feature is supported only for IoT hubs created in the following regions:

  - North Europe
  - Southeast Asia
  - West US 2

## Understand Azure IoT distributed tracing

Many IoT solutions, including the [Azure IoT reference architecture](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/iot), generally follow a variant of the [microservice architecture](/azure/architecture/microservices/). As an IoT solution grows more complex, you end up using a dozen or more microservices. These microservices might or might not be from Azure.

Pinpointing where IoT messages are dropping or slowing down can be challenging. For example, imagine that you have an IoT solution that uses five different Azure services and 1,500 active devices. Each device sends 10 device-to-cloud messages per second, for a total of 15,000 messages per second. But you notice that your web app sees only 10,000 messages per second. How do you find the culprit?

For you to reconstruct the flow of an IoT message across services, each service should propagate a *correlation ID* that uniquely identifies the message. After Azure Monitor collects correlation IDs in a centralized system, you can use those IDs to see message flow. This method is called the [distributed tracing pattern](/azure/architecture/microservices/logging-monitoring#distributed-tracing).

To support wider adoption for distributed tracing, Microsoft is contributing to [W3C standard proposal for distributed tracing](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/). When distributed tracing support for IoT Hub is enabled, it follows this flow for each generated message:

1. A message is generated on the IoT device.
1. The IoT device decides (with help from the cloud) that this message should be assigned with a trace context.
1. The SDK adds a `tracestate` value to the message property, which contains the time stamp for message creation.
1. The IoT device sends the message to IoT Hub.
1. The message arrives at the IoT Hub gateway.
1. IoT Hub looks for the `tracestate` value in the message properties and checks whether it's in the correct format. If so, IoT Hub generates a globally unique `trace-id` value for the message and a `span-id` value for the "hop." IoT Hub records these values in the [IoT Hub distributed tracing logs](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#distributed-tracing-category-preview) under the `DiagnosticIoTHubD2C` operation.
1. When the message processing is finished, IoT Hub generates another `span-id` value and logs it, along with the existing `trace-id` value, under the `DiagnosticIoTHubIngress` operation.
1. If routing is enabled for the message, IoT Hub writes it to the custom endpoint. IoT Hub logs another `span-id` value with the same `trace-id` value under the `DiagnosticIoTHubEgress` category.

## Configure distributed tracing in an IoT hub

In this section, you configure an IoT hub to log distributed tracing attributes (correlation IDs and time stamps).

1. Go to your IoT hub in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. On the left pane for your IoT hub, scroll down to the **Monitoring** section and select **Diagnostics settings**.

1. Select **Add diagnostic setting**.

1. In the **Diagnostic setting name** box, enter a name for a new diagnostic setting. For example, enter **DistributedTracingSettings**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/iot-hub-distributed-tracing/diagnostic-setting-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to add a name for your diagnostic settings." lightbox="media/iot-hub-distributed-tracing/diagnostic-setting-name.png":::

1. Choose one or more of the following options under **Destination details** to determine where to send logging information:

    - **Archive to a storage account**: Configure a storage account to contain the logging information.
    - **Stream to an event hub**: Configure an event hub to contain the logging information.
    - **Send to Log Analytics**: Configure a Log Analytics workspace to contain the logging information.

1. In the **Logs** section, select the operations that you want to log.

   Include **Distributed Tracing** and configure a **Retention** period for how many days you want the logging retained. Log retention affects storage costs.

   :::image type="content" source="media/iot-hub-distributed-tracing/select-distributed-tracing.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where the Distributed Tracing operation is for IoT Hub diagnostic settings.":::

1. Select **Save**.

1. (Optional) To see the messages flow to different places, set up [routing rules to at least two different endpoints](iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c.md).

After the logging is turned on, IoT Hub records a log when a message that contains valid trace properties is encountered in any of the following situations:

- The message arrives at the IoT hub's gateway.
- The IoT hub processes the message.
- The message is routed to custom endpoints. Routing must be enabled.

To learn more about these logs and their schemas, see [Monitor IoT Hub](monitor-iot-hub.md) and [Distributed tracing in IoT Hub resource logs](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#distributed-tracing-category-preview).

## Update sampling options

To change the percentage of messages to be traced from the cloud, you must update the device twin. You can make updates by using the JSON editor in the Azure portal or the IoT Hub service SDK. The following subsections provide examples.

### Update a single device

You can use the Azure portal or the Azure IoT Hub extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to update the sampling rate of a single device.

#### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

1. Go to your IoT hub in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and then select **Devices** from the **Device management** section of the menu.

1. Choose your device.

1. Select the gear icon under **Distributed Tracing (preview)**. In the panel that opens:

   1. Select the **Enable** option. 
   1. For **Sampling rate**, choose a percentage between 0 and 100.
   1. Select **Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/iot-hub-distributed-tracing/enable-distributed-tracing.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to enable distributed tracing in the Azure portal." lightbox="media/iot-hub-distributed-tracing/enable-distributed-tracing.png":::

1. Wait a few seconds, and then select **Refresh**. If the device successfully acknowledges your changes, a sync icon with a check mark appears.

#### [VS Code](#tab/vscode)

1. With Visual Studio Code installed, install the latest version of the [Azure IoT Hub extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-toolkit).

1. Open Visual Studio Code, and go to the **Explorer** tab and the **Azure IoT Hub** section.

1. Select the ellipsis (...) next to **Azure IoT Hub** to see a submenu. Choose the **Select IoT Hub** option to retrieve your IoT hub from Azure.

   In the pop-up window that appears at the top of Visual Studio Code, you can select your subscription and IoT hub.

   See a demonstration on the [vscode-azure-iot-toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azure-iot-toolkit/wiki/Select-IoT-Hub) GitHub page.

1. Expand your device under **Devices**. Right-click **Distributed Tracing Setting (Preview)**, and then select **Update Distributed Tracing Setting (Preview)**.

1. In the pop-up pane that appears at the top of the window, select **Enable**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/iot-hub-distributed-tracing/enable-distributed-tracing-vsc.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to enable distributed tracing in the Azure IoT Hub extension.":::

   **Enable Distributed Tracing: Enabled** now appears under **Distributed Tracing Setting (Preview)** > **Desired**.

1. In the pop-up pane that appears for the sampling rate, enter an integer between 0 and 100, then select **Enter**.

    ![Screenshot that shows entering a sampling rate](./media/iot-hub-distributed-tracing/update-distributed-tracing-setting-3.png)

    **Sample rate: 100(%)** now appears under **Distributed Tracing Setting (Preview)** > **Desired**.

---

### Bulk update multiple devices

To update the distributed tracing sampling configuration for multiple devices, use [automatic device configuration](./iot-hub-automatic-device-management.md). Follow this twin schema:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "desired": {
            "azureiot*com^dtracing^1": {
                "sampling_mode": 1,
                "sampling_rate": 100
            }
        }
    }
}
```

| Element name | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------------|----------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `sampling_mode` | Yes | Integer | Two mode values are currently supported to turn sampling on and off. `1` is on, and `2` is off. |
| `sampling_rate` | Yes | Integer | This value is a percentage. Only values from `0` to `100` (inclusive) are permitted.  |

## Query and visualize traces

To see all the traces logged by an IoT hub, query the log store that you selected in diagnostic settings. This section shows how to query by using Log Analytics.

If you set up [Log Analytics with resource logs](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#send-to-azure-storage), query by looking for logs in the `DistributedTracing` category. For example, this query shows all the logged traces:

```Kusto
// All distributed traces 
AzureDiagnostics 
| where Category == "DistributedTracing" 
| project TimeGenerated, Category, OperationName, Level, CorrelationId, DurationMs, properties_s 
| order by TimeGenerated asc  
```

Here are a few example logs in Log Analytics:

| Time generated | Operation name | Category | Level | Correlation ID | Duration in milliseconds | Properties |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2018-02-22T03:28:28.633Z | DiagnosticIoTHubD2C | DistributedTracing | Informational | 00-8cd869a412459a25f5b4f31311223344-0144d2590aacd909-01 |  | `{"deviceId":"AZ3166","messageSize":"96","callerLocalTimeUtc":"2018-02-22T03:27:28.633Z","calleeLocalTimeUtc":"2018-02-22T03:27:28.687Z"}` |
| 2018-02-22T03:28:38.633Z | DiagnosticIoTHubIngress | DistributedTracing | Informational | 00-8cd869a412459a25f5b4f31311223344-349810a9bbd28730-01 | 20 | `{"isRoutingEnabled":"false","parentSpanId":"0144d2590aacd909"}` |
| 2018-02-22T03:28:48.633Z | DiagnosticIoTHubEgress | DistributedTracing | Informational | 00-8cd869a412459a25f5b4f31311223344-349810a9bbd28730-01 | 23 | `{"endpointType":"EventHub","endpointName":"myEventHub", "parentSpanId":"0144d2590aacd909"}` |

To understand the types of logs, see [Azure IoT Hub distributed tracing logs](monitor-iot-hub-reference.md#distributed-tracing-category-preview).

## Run a sample application

In this section, you prepare a development environment for use with the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c). Then, you modify one of the samples to enable distributed tracing on your device's telemetry messages.

These instructions are for building the sample on Windows. For other environments, see [Compile the C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/master/iothub_client/readme.md#compile) or [Prepackaged C SDK for Platform Specific Development](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/master/iothub_client/readme.md#prepackaged-c-sdk-for-platform-specific-development).

### Clone the source code and initialize

1. Install the [Desktop development with C++](/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=vs-2019&preserve-view=true) workload for Visual Studio 2022. Visual Studio 2019 is also supported.

1. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/). Ensure that it's in your `PATH` by entering `cmake -version` from a command prompt.

1. Open a command prompt or Git Bash shell. Run the following commands to clone the latest release of the public-preview branch of the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) GitHub repository:

    ```cmd
    git clone -b public-preview https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git
    cd azure-iot-sdk-c
    git submodule update --init
    ```

    Expect this operation to take several minutes to finish.

1. Run the following commands from the `azure-iot-sdk-c` directory to create a `cmake` subdirectory and go to the `cmake` folder:

    ```cmd
    mkdir cmake
    cd cmake
    cmake ..
    ```

    If CMake can't find your C++ compiler, you might encounter build errors while running the preceding command. If that happens, try running the command in the [Visual Studio command prompt](/dotnet/framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs).

    After the build succeeds, the last few output lines will look similar to the following output:

    ```cmd
    $ cmake ..
    -- Building for: Visual Studio 15 2017
    -- Selecting Windows SDK version 10.0.16299.0 to target Windows 10.0.17134.
    -- The C compiler identification is MSVC 19.12.25835.0
    -- The CXX compiler identification is MSVC 19.12.25835.0

    ...

    -- Configuring done
    -- Generating done
    -- Build files have been written to: E:/IoT Testing/azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake
    ```

### Edit the telemetry sample to enable distributed tracing

In this section, you edit the [iothub_ll_telemetry_sample.c](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/tree/public-preview/iothub_client/samples/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample) sample in the SDK repository to enable distributed tracing. Or, you can copy an already edited version of the sample from the [azure-iot-distributed-tracing-sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-iot-distributed-tracing-sample/blob/master/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample-c/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample.c) repository.

1. Use an editor to open the `azure-iot-sdk-c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample.c` source file.

1. Find the declaration of the `connectionString` constant:

   :::code language="c" source="~/samples-iot-distributed-tracing/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample-c/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample.c" range="56-60" highlight="2":::

   Replace the value of the `connectionString` constant with the device connection string that you saved in the [Register a device](../iot/tutorial-send-telemetry-iot-hub.md?toc=/azure/iot-hub/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-hub/breadcrumb/toc.json#register-a-device) section of the quickstart for sending telemetry.

1. Find the line of code that calls `IoTHubDeviceClient_LL_SetConnectionStatusCallback` to register a connection status callback function before the send message loop. Add code under that line to call `IoTHubDeviceClient_LL_EnablePolicyConfiguration` and enable distributed tracing for the device:

   :::code language="c" source="~/samples-iot-distributed-tracing/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample-c/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample.c" range="144-152" highlight="5":::

   The `IoTHubDeviceClient_LL_EnablePolicyConfiguration` function enables policies for specific IoT Hub features that are configured via [device twins](./iot-hub-devguide-device-twins.md). After you enable `POLICY_CONFIGURATION_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING` by using the extra line of code, the tracing behavior of the device will reflect distributed tracing changes made on the device twin.

1. To keep the sample app running without using up all your quota, add a one-second delay at the end of the send message loop:

   :::code language="c" source="~/samples-iot-distributed-tracing/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample-c/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample.c" range="177-186" highlight="8":::

### Compile and run

1. Go to the `iothub_ll_telemetry_sample` project directory from the CMake directory (`azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake`) that you created earlier, and compile the sample:

   ```cmd
   cd iothub_client/samples/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample
   cmake --build . --target iothub_ll_telemetry_sample --config Debug
   ```

1. Run the application. The device sends telemetry that supports distributed tracing.

   ```cmd
   Debug/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample.exe
   ```

1. Keep the app running. You can observe the messages being sent to IoT Hub in the console window.

For a client app that can receive sampling decisions from the cloud, try the [iothub_devicetwin_sample.c](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-iot-distributed-tracing-sample/tree/master/iothub_devicetwin_sample-c) sample in the distributed tracing sample repo.

### Workaround for non-Microsoft clients

Implementing the distributed tracing feature without using the C SDK is more complex. We don't recommend it.

First, you must implement all the IoT Hub protocol primitives in your messages by following the developer guide [Create and read IoT Hub messages](iot-hub-devguide-messages-construct.md). Then, edit the protocol properties in the MQTT and AMQP messages to add `tracestate` as a system property.

Specifically:

- For MQTT, add `%24.tracestate=timestamp%3d1539243209` to the message topic. Replace `1539243209` with the creation time of the message in Unix time-stamp format. As an example, refer to the implementation [in the C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/6633c5b18710febf1af7713cf1a336fd38f623ed/iothub_client/src/iothubtransport_mqtt_common.c#L761).
- For AMQP, add `key("tracestate")` and `value("timestamp=1539243209")` as message annotation. For a reference implementation, see the [uamqp_messaging.c](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/6633c5b18710febf1af7713cf1a336fd38f623ed/iothub_client/src/uamqp_messaging.c#L527) file.

To control the percentage of messages that contain this property, implement logic to listen to cloud-initiated events such as twin updates.
