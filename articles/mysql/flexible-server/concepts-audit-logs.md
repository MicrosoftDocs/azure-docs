# Track database activity with Audit Logs in Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-mysql-flexible-server](../includes/applies-to-mysql-flexible-server.md)]

Azure Database for MySQL flexible server provides users with the ability to configure audit logs. Audit logs can be used to track database-level activity including connection, admin, DDL, and DML events. These types of logs are commonly used for compliance purposes.

## Configure audit logging

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It is recommended to only log the event types and users required for your auditing purposes to ensure your server's performance isn't heavily impacted and a minimum amount of data is collected.

By default, audit logs are disabled. To enable them, set the `audit_log_enabled` server parameter to *ON*. This can be configured using the Azure portal or Azure CLI.

Other parameters you can adjust to control audit logging behavior include:

- `audit_log_events`: controls the events to be logged. See below table for specific audit events.
- `audit_log_include_users`: MySQL users to be included for logging. The default value for this parameter is empty, which will include all the users for logging. This has higher priority over `audit_log_exclude_users`. Max length of the parameter is 512 characters.
- `audit_log_exclude_users`: MySQL users to be excluded from logging. Max length of the parameter is 512 characters.

> [!NOTE]  
> `audit_log_include_users` has higher priority over `audit_log_exclude_users`. For example, if `audit_log_include_users` = `demouser` and `audit_log_exclude_users` = `demouser`, the user will be included in the audit logs because `audit_log_include_users` has higher priority.

| **Event** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `CONNECTION` | - Connection initiation (successful or unsuccessful)<br />- User reauthentication with different user/password during session<br />- Connection termination |
| `DML_SELECT` | SELECT queries |
| `DML_NONSELECT` | INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE queries |
| `DML` | DML = DML_SELECT + DML_NONSELECT |
| `DDL` | Queries like "DROP DATABASE" |
| `DCL` | Queries like "GRANT PERMISSION" |
| `ADMIN` | Queries like "SHOW STATUS" |
| `GENERAL` | All in DML_SELECT, DML_NONSELECT, DML, DDL, DCL, and ADMIN |
| `TABLE_ACCESS` | - Table read statements, such as SELECT or INSERT INTO ... SELECT<br/>- Table delete statements, such as DELETE or TRUNCATE TABLE<br/>- Table insert statements, such as INSERT or REPLACE<br/>- Table update statements, such as UPDATE |

## Access audit logs

Audit logs are integrated with Azure Monitor diagnostic settings. Once you've enabled audit logs on your flexible server, you can emit them to Azure Monitor logs, Azure Event Hubs, or Azure Storage. To learn more about diagnostic settings, see the [diagnostic logs documentation](../../azure-monitor/essentials/platform-logs-overview.md). To learn more about how to enable diagnostic settings in the Azure portal, see the [audit log portal article](tutorial-configure-audit.md#set-up-diagnostics).

> [!NOTE]  
> Premium Storage accounts aren't supported if you send the logs to Azure storage via diagnostics and settings.

The following sections describe the output of MySQL audit logs based on the event type. Depending on the output method, the fields included and the order in which they appear may vary.

## Analyze logs in Azure Monitor Logs

Once your audit logs are piped to Azure Monitor Logs through Diagnostic Logs, you can perform further analysis of your audited events. Below are some sample queries to help you get started. Make sure to update the below with your server name.

- List GENERAL events on a particular server

    ```kusto
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where Resource  == '<your server name>' //Server name must be in Upper case
    | where Category == 'MySqlAuditLogs' and event_class_s == "general_log"
    | project TimeGenerated, Resource, event_class_s, event_subclass_s, event_time_t, user_s , ip_s , sql_text_s
    | order by TimeGenerated asc nulls last
    ```

- List CONNECTION events on a particular server

    ```kusto
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where Resource  == '<your server name>' //Server name must be in Upper case
    | where Category == 'MySqlAuditLogs' and event_class_s == "connection_log"
    | project TimeGenerated, Resource, event_class_s, event_subclass_s, event_time_t, user_s , ip_s , sql_text_s
    | order by TimeGenerated asc nulls last
    ```

- Summarize audited events on a particular server

    ```kusto
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where Resource  == '<your server name>' //Server name must be in Upper case
    | where Category == 'MySqlAuditLogs'
    | project TimeGenerated, Resource, event_class_s, event_subclass_s, event_time_t, user_s , ip_s , sql_text_s
    | summarize count() by event_class_s, event_subclass_s, user_s, ip_s
    ```

- Graph the audit event type distribution on a particular server

    ```kusto
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where Resource  == '<your server name>' //Server name must be in Upper case
    | where Category == 'MySqlAuditLogs'
    | project TimeGenerated, Resource, event_class_s, event_subclass_s, event_time_t, user_s , ip_s , sql_text_s
    | summarize count() by Resource, bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
    | render timechart
    ```

- List audited events across all Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instances with Diagnostic Logs enabled for audit logs

    ```kusto
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where Category == 'MySqlAuditLogs'
    | project TimeGenerated, Resource, event_class_s, event_subclass_s, event_time_t, user_s , ip_s , sql_text_s
    | order by TimeGenerated asc nulls last
    ```
