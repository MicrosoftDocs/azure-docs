# Restore an Azure Database for MySQL server using Azure CLI
This sample CLI script restores a single Azure Database for MySQL server to a previous point in time.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to run the CLI locally, this article requires Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Check the version by running `az --version`. See [Install Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to install or upgrade your version of Azure CLI. 

## Sample script
In this sample script, edit the highlighted lines to update the admin username and password to your own. Replace the subscription ID used in the `az monitor` commands with your own subscription ID.
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/mysql/backup-restore-pitr/backup-restore.sh?highlight=15-16 "Restore Azure Database for MySQL.")]

## Clean up deployment
Use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it after the script has been run. 
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/mysql/backup-restore-pitr/delete-mysql.sh  "Delete the resource group.")]

## Script explanation
This script uses the commands outlined in the following table:

| **Command** | **Notes** |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az mysql server create](/cli/azure/mysql/server#az-mysql-server-create) | Creates a MySQL server that hosts the databases. |
| [az mysql server restore](/cli/azure/mysql/server#az-mysql-server-restore) | Restore a server from backup. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
