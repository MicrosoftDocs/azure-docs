# How to download your Azure billing invoice and daily usage data
The billing invoice and daily usage is downloadable from the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions). Only the account administrator has permission to get to the billing invoice and usage information. To find out who is the account administrator of the subscription, see the [Transferring ownership of an Azure subscription - FAQ](billing-subscription-transfer.md#faq).

## Get invoice and usage from Azure Account Center
1. Sign into the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions) as the account administrator.
2. Select the subscription for which you want the invoice and usage information.
3. Select **BILLING HISTORY**.

## <a name="noinvoice"></a> Why don't I see an invoice for the last billing period?
There could be several reasons that you don't see an invoice:
- You have a monthly credit amount with your subscription that you didn't exceed or you have a free trial. An invoice isn't generated unless you owe money.
- It's less than 30 days from the day you subscribed to Azure.
- The invoice isn't generated yet. Wait until the end of the billing period.
