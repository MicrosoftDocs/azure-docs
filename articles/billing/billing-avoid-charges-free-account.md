# Avoid getting charged for your Azure free account

Azure free account gives you $200 in Azure credits for the first 30 days and a limited quantity of free services for 12 months. For more information, see [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). Depending on the status of your credit, you may use your credit or get charged for usage beyond the free services and quantities.

## You still have active Azure free account credit 
If you still have Azure credit that hasn't expired, Azure uses your credit to pay for usage beyond the free services and quantities.

## Your credit ran out or has expired
If your credit ran out or expired at the end of 30 days, Azure disables your subscription. To continue using Azure services, you must upgrade your subscription to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription. For more information, see [Upgrade your Free Trial Azure subscription to Pay-As-You-Go](billing-upgrade-azure-subscription.md). After you upgrade, your subscription still has access to free services for 12 months. You only get charged for usage beyond the free services and quantities.


Let's look at some of the reasons you can incur charges on your Azure free account.


### Your usage exceeds the limits of free services included with your Azure free account

You get a limited quantity of free services each month with your Azure free account. The free quantity expires at the end of the month and doesn't roll over to the next month. For example, you get 5 GB of File storage each month. If in a month, you only use 2 GB, the remaining 3 GB doesn't roll over to the next month. To avoid getting charged, keep your usage within the limits. To learn about limits of free services, see [What is Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/free-account-faq/). To check your free service usage, see [Check usage of free services included with Azure free Account](billing-check-free-service-usage.md). 

### You are using services not included for free with your Azure free account

You get charged pay-as-you-go rates for using services, which are not included for free with your Azure free account. To learn about services included with free account, see [What is Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/free-account-faq/). You can check the usage for the services you are using either on the Azure portal or through the Azure usage file. To learn more, see [Regularly check the portal for cost breakdown and burn rate](billing-getting-started.md#costs) and [Download usage from the Account Center](billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date.md). 

### You have reached the end of your 12 months free services

Your free services and quantities expire at the end of 12 months. You can find out the expiration date on the Azure portal.

1.	Log in to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com).

2.	From left navigation area, select **All services**.

3.	Select **Subscriptions**.

4.	Select the subscription that you created when you signed up for free account.

5.  Scroll down to find free services grid. Click the tooltip located on the top left of the grid.

Once your free services and quantities are expired, Azure charges you pay-as-you-go rates for any services you are using. You can use the Azure portal to delete the resources for the services that you don't use. If you don’t intend to use any Azure service, you can [cancel your subscription](billing-how-to-cancel-azure-subscription.md).
