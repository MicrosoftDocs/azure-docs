# Submit a request to pay Azure subscription by invoice

You can change the payment method for your Azure subscription to invoice by submitting a request to Azure support. Once your request is approved, you are provided instructions on how to set up your subscription for the invoice payment method. 

## Request Pay by invoice

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Select **Help + support** > **New support request**.

2. Select **Billing** as the issue type, select the subscription, which you want to pay by invoice, select a support plan, and then select **Next**.
3. In the **Problem** blade, select **Pay by Invoice** in the **Problem Type** box.
4. Enter the following information in the **Details** box, and then select **Next**.

    - Company name
    - Billing address
    - [Account administrator's email address](billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator.md#check-the-account-administrator-of-the-subscription)
    

5. Verify your contact information and preferred contact method, and then click **Create**.

If we need to run a credit check because of the amount of credit that you need, we send you a credit check application. After you submit the application, the credit application can take 5-7 days to process.
