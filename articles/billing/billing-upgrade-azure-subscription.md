# Upgrade your Azure free account or Azure for Students Starter subscription

If you have a [Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) or an [Azure for Students Starter](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0144p/) subscription, you can upgrade to an [individual subscription with pay-as-you-go rates](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) in the Azure portal. If you have an Azure for Students Starter subscription and are eligible for a Free Trial, you can upgrade to Free Trial.

1. Choose a support plan for your subscription. To learn more about support plans, see [Azure support plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/us/support/plans/).

1. Click **Upgrade**.

If you want to [transfer the subscription](billing-subscription-transfer.md) after upgrading, you must wait until the subscription offer ID changes to **MS-AZR-003P**. The offer ID changes when:

* You consume all the remaining credit, or
* 30 days pass since the start of the free trial
