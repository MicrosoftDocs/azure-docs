# Customer intent: As an API program manager, I want to integrate my Azure API Management instance with my API center and synchronize API Management APIs to my inventory.

# Synchronize APIs from an API Management instance (preview)

This article shows how to integrate an API Management instance so that the instances's APIs are continuously kept up to date in your [API center](overview.md) inventory. 

## About integrating an API Management instance

Although you can use the Azure CLI to [import](import-api-management-apis.md) APIs on demand from Azure API Management to Azure API Center, integrating (linking) an API Management instance enables continuous synchronization so that the API inventory stays up to date. Azure API Center can also synchronize APIs from sources including [Amazon API Gateway](synchronize-aws-gateway-apis.md). 

When you integrate an API Management instance as an API source, the following happens:

1. All APIs, and optionally API definitions (specs), from the API Management instance are added to the API center inventory.
1. You configure an [environment](key-concepts.md#environment) of type *Azure API Management* in the API center. 
1. An associated [deployment](key-concepts.md#deployment) is created for each synchronized API definition from API Management. 

API Management APIs automatically synchronize to the API center whenever existing APIs' settings change (for example, new versions are added), new APIs are created, or APIs are deleted. This synchronization is one-way from API Management to your Azure API center, meaning API updates in the API center aren't synchronized back to the API Management instance.

> [!NOTE]
> * Integration of Azure API Management is currently in preview.
> * There are [limits](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=/azure/api-center/toc.json&bc=/azure/api-center/breadcrumb/toc.json#azure-api-center-limits) for the number of integrated API Management instances (API sources).
> * API updates in API Management typically synchronize to your API center within minutes, but synchronization can take up to 24 hours.
> * API definitions also synchronize to the API center if you select the option to include them during integration.

### Entities synchronized from API Management

[!INCLUDE [synchronized-properties-api-source](includes/synchronized-properties-api-source.md)]

## Prerequisites

* An API center in your Azure subscription. If you haven't created one, see [Quickstart: Create your API center](set-up-api-center.md).

* An Azure API Management instance, in the same or a different subscription. The instance must be in the same directory. 

* For Azure CLI:
    [!INCLUDE [include](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

    [!INCLUDE [install-apic-extension](includes/install-apic-extension.md)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > Azure CLI command examples in this article can run in PowerShell or a bash shell. Where needed because of different variable syntax, separate command examples are provided for the two shells.

## Assign the managed identity the API Management Service Reader role

[!INCLUDE [configure-managed-identity-apim-reader](includes/configure-managed-identity-apim-reader.md)]

## Integrate an API Management instance 

You can integrate an API Management instance using the portal or the Azure CLI.

#### [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your API center.
1. Under **Assets**, select **Environments**.
1. Select **Links (preview)** > **+ Create a link**.
1. In the **Link your Azure API Management Service** page:
    1. Select the **Subscription**, **Resource group**, and **Azure API Management service** that you want to integrate.
    1. In **Link details**, enter an identifier.
    1. In **Environment details**, enter an **Environment title** (name), **Environment type**, and optional **Description**.
    1. In **API Details**:
        1. Select a **Lifecycle** for the synchronized APIs. (You can update this value for the APIs after they're added to your API center.)
        1. Optionally, select whether to include API definitions with the synchronized APIs.
1. Select **Create**.

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Run the [az apic integration create apim](/cli/azure/apic/integration/create#az-apic-integration-create-apim) command to integrate an API Management instance to your API center. 

* Provide the names of the resource group, API center, and integration.  

* If the API Management instance and the API center are in the same resource group, you can provide the API Management instance name as the value of `azure-apim`; otherwise, provide the Azure resource ID. 

```azurecli
az apic integration create apim \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --service-name <api-center-name> \
    --integration-name <apim-integration-name> \
    --azure-apim <apim-instance-name>
``` 
---

The environment is added in your API center. The API Management APIs are imported to the API center inventory.
