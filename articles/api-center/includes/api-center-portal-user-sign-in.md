## Enable sign-in to portal by Microsoft Entra users and groups 

Users must sign in to see the APIs in your API center. To enable sign-in, assign the **Azure API Center Data Reader** role to users or groups in your organization, scoped to your API center.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, you and other administrators of the API center don't have access to APIs in the API Center portal. Be sure to assign the **Azure API Center Data Reader** role to yourself and other administrators.  

For detailed prerequisites and steps to assign a role to users and groups, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.yml). Brief steps follow:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your API center.
1. In the left menu, select **Access control (IAM)** > **+ Add role assignment**.
1. In the **Add role assignment** pane, set the values as follows:
    1. On the **Role** page, search for and select **Azure API Center Data Reader**. Select **Next**.
    1. On the **Members** page, In **Assign access to**, select **User, group, or service principal** > **+ Select members**.
    1. On the **Select members** page, search for and select the users or groups to assign the role to. Click **Select** and then **Next**.
    1. Review the role assignment, and select **Review + assign**.

> [!NOTE]
> To streamline access configuration for new users, we recommend that you assign the role to a Microsoft Entra group and configure a dynamic group membership rule. To learn more, see [Create or update a dynamic group in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/users/groups-create-rule).

After you configure access to the portal, configured users can sign in to the portal and view the APIs in your API center.

> [!NOTE]
> The first user to sign in to the portal is prompted to consent to the permissions requested by the API Center portal app registration. Thereafter, other configured users aren't prompted to consent.
