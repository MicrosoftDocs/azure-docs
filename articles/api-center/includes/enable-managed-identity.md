## Enable a managed identity in your API center

For this scenario, your API center uses a [managed identity](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) to access Azure resources. Depending on your needs, enable either a system-assigned or one or more user-assigned managed identities. 

The following examples show how to enable a system-assigned managed identity by using the Azure portal or the Azure CLI. At a high level, configuration steps are similar for a user-assigned managed identity. 

#### [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the [portal](https://azure.microsoft.com), navigate to your API center.
1. In the left menu, under **Security**, select **Managed identities**.
1. Select **System assigned**, and set the status to **On**.
1. Select **Save**.

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Set the system-assigned identity in your API center using the following [az apic update](/cli/azure/apic#az-apic-update) command. Substitute the names of your API center and resource group:

```azurecli 
az apic update --name <api-center-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --identity '{"type": "SystemAssigned"}'
```
