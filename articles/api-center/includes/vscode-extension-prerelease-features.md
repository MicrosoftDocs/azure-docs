When installing the extension from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apidev.azure-api-center&ssr=false#overview), you can choose to install the release version or a pre-release version. Switch between the two versions at any time by using the extension's **Manage** button context menu in the Extensions view.
