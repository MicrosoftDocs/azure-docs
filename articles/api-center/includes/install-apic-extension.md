> [!NOTE]
> `az apic` commands require the `apic-extension` Azure CLI extension. If you haven't used `az apic` commands, the extension can be installed dynamically when you run your first `az apic` command, or you can install the extension manually. Learn more about [Azure CLI extensions](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).
>
> See the [release notes](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions/blob/main/src/apic-extension/HISTORY.rst) for the latest changes and updates in the `apic-extension`.
