  Export API definition from API Center to Copilot Studio as a connector

introduction: |
  You can export an API definition from your Azure API center as a [connector in Microsoft Copilot Studio](/connectors/overview) (preview). Copilot Studio is a graphical, low-code tool for building agents and agent flows and is part of the Microsoft Power Platform family.
  
  In Microsoft Copilot Studio, citizen developers can use the exported connector as a custom connector to [extend the capabilities of AI agents](/microsoft-copilot-studio/copilot-connectors-in-copilot-studio).

  In this article, you create a custom connector from an OpenAPI definition associated with an API in an API center.  

prerequisites:
  summary: |

  dependencies:
    - An API center instance. You can [create one](set-up-api-center.md) in the Azure portal.
    - An API registered in the API center inventory. The API must have a version associated with a [deployment](configure-environments-deployments.md), and it must have an API definition in OpenAPI 2.0 format.
    - A Power Platform [environment](/power-apps/powerapps-overview#power-apps-for-admins).
    - A Microsoft Copilot Studio [license](/microsoft-copilot-studio/requirements-licensing-subscriptions).

      - |
        Select the **API definition** to use for the connector.
      - |
        Optionally, if you configured [API access settings](https://aka.ms/apicenter/docs/access) for the API version in your API center, select an available **Security requirement** type to use for the connector.

        The connector is now available for use in Microsoft Copilot Studio.
    
        After creating the connector:
        
        - You can [test the connector](/connectors/custom-connectors/define-openapi-definition#test-the-connector) in Power Automate or Power Apps. 
        
        - After testing, use the connector in [Microsoft Copilot Studio](/microsoft-copilot-studio/) to create applications and workflows.
