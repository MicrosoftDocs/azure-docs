# Customer intent: As an API program manager, I want to enable an Azure-managed portal for developers and other API stakeholders in my organization to discover the APIs in my organization's API center.

# Set up your API Center portal

This article shows you how to set up the *API Center portal* (preview), an Azure-managed website that developers and other stakeholders in your organization can use to discover the APIs in your [API center](overview.md). Signed-in users can browse and filter APIs and view API details such as API definitions and documentation. User access to API information is based on Microsoft Entra ID and Azure role-based access control.

> Both Azure API Management and Azure API Center provide API portal experiences for developers. [Compare the portals](#api-management-and-api-center-portals)

## Create Microsoft Entra app registration

[!INCLUDE [api-center-portal-app-registration](includes/api-center-portal-app-registration.md)]

## Configure and publish the API Center portal

After you create the API Center portal app registration, you need to configure and publish the API center portal. Complete the following steps in the Azure portal. 

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your API center.
1. In the left menu, under **API Center portal**, select **Portal settings**.
    :::image type="content" source="media/set-up-api-center-portal/configure-portal-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of API Center portal settings in the Azure portal." lightbox="media/set-up-api-center-portal/configure-portal-settings.png":::
1. On the **Identity provider** tab, select **Start set up**. On the screen that appears, do the following:
    1. In **Client ID**, enter the **Application (client) ID** from the app registration you created in the previous section.
    1. Confirm that the **Redirect URI** is the value you configured in the app registration. 
    1. Select **Save + publish**.
1. On the **Site profile** tab, enter a website name that you want to appear in the top bar of the API Center portal. Select **Save + publish**.
1. On the **API visibility** tab, optionally add filters for APIs that you want to make discoverable in the portal. Select **Save + publish**. [Learn more about API visibility](#api-visibility)

You can now access the API Center portal:
* On the **Portal settings** page, select **View API Center portal** to open the portal in a new tab. 
* Or, enter the following URL in your browser, replacing `<service-name>` and `<location>` with the name of your API center and the location where it's deployed:<br/>
    `https://<service-name>.portal.<location>.azure-api-center.ms`

### API visibility

API visibility settings control which APIs are discoverable (visible) to API Center portal users. The API Center portal uses the data plane API to retrieve and display APIs, and by default retrieves all APIs in your API center. Visibility settings apply to all users of the API Center portal.

To make only specific APIs visible, go to the **API visibility** tab in the API Center portal settings. Here, add filter conditions for APIs based on built-in or custom API [metadata](metadata.md) properties. For instance, you can choose to display APIs only of certain types (like REST or GraphQL) or based on certain specification formats (such as OpenAPI). Additionally, you can select values of custom metadata properties that categorize your APIs.

## Enable sign-in to portal by Microsoft Entra users and groups 

[!INCLUDE [api-center-portal-user-sign-in](includes/api-center-portal-user-sign-in.md)]

## Enable access to test console for APIs

You can configure user settings to granularly authorize access to APIs and their specific versions in your API center. For example, configure certain API versions to use API keys for authentication, and create an access policy that permits only specific users to authenticate using those keys. This policy also applies to the "Try this API" capability for APIs in the API Center portal, ensuring that only portal users with the appropriate access policy can use the test console for those API versions. [Learn more about authorizing access to APIs](authorize-api-access.md)

## API discovery and consumption in the API Center portal

The API Center portal supports and streamlines the work of developers who use and create APIs within your organization. Signed-in users can:

* **Search for APIs** by name or using [AI-assisted semantic search](#search-with-ai) 

* **Filter APIs** by type or lifecycle stage

* **View API details and definitions** including endpoints, methods, parameters, and response formats

* **Download API definitions** to a local computer or open them in Visual Studio Code

* **Try out APIs** that support API key authentication or OAuth 2.0 authorization

## Search with AI

In the Standard plan of Azure API Center, the API Center portal supplements basic name-based API search with AI-assisted *semantic search* built on API names and descriptions. Users can search for APIs using natural language queries, making it easier to find APIs based on their intent. For example, if a developer searches for "I need an API for inventory management," the portal can suggest relevant APIs, even if their names or descriptions don't include those exact words.

> [!TIP]
> If you're using the Free plan of Azure API Center, you can [upgrade easily](frequently-asked-questions.yml#how-do-i-upgrade-my-api-center-from-the-free-plan-to-the-standard-plan) to the Standard plan to enable full service features including semantic search in the API Center portal.

To use AI-assisted search when signed in to the API Center portal, click in the search box, select **Search with AI**, and enter a query.
