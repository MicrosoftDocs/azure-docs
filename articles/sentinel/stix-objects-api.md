# Import threat intelligence to Microsoft Sentinel with the upload API (Preview)

Import threat intelligence to use in Microsoft Sentinel with the upload API. Whether you're using a threat intelligence platform or a custom application, use this document as a supplemental reference to the instructions in [Connect your TIP with the upload API](connect-threat-intelligence-upload-api.md). Installing the data connector isn't required to connect to the API. The threat intelligence you can import includes indicators of compromise and other STIX domain objects.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is currently in PREVIEW. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
>

Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) is a language for expressing cyber threat and observable information. Enhanced support for the following domain objects is included with the upload API:

- indicator
- attack pattern
- threat actor
- identity
- relationship

For more information, see [Introduction to STIX](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro.html). 

> [!NOTE]
> The previous upload indicators API is now legacy. If you need to reference that API while transitioning to this new upload API, see [Legacy upload indicators API](upload-indicators-api.md).

## Call the API

A call to the upload API has five components:

1. The request URI
1. HTTP request message header
1. HTTP request message body
1. Optionally process the HTTP response message header
1. Optionally process the HTTP response message body

## Register your client application with Microsoft Entra ID

In order to authenticate to Microsoft Sentinel, the request to the upload API requires a valid Microsoft Entra access token. For more information on application registration, see [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) or see the basic steps as part of the [Connect threat intelligence with upload API](connect-threat-intelligence-upload-api.md#register-an-azure-ad-application) setup.

This API requires the calling Microsoft Entra application to be granted the Microsoft Sentinel contributor role at the workspace level.

## Create the request

This section covers the first three of the five components discussed earlier. You first need to acquire the access token from Microsoft Entra ID, which you use to assemble your request message header.

### Acquire an access token

Acquire a Microsoft Entra access token with [OAuth 2.0 authentication](../active-directory/fundamentals/auth-oauth2.md). [V1.0 and V2.0](/entra/identity-platform/access-tokens#token-formats) are valid tokens accepted by the API.

The version of the token (v1.0 or v2.0) received is determined by the `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property in the [app manifest](/entra/identity-platform/reference-app-manifest#manifest-reference) of the API that your application is calling. If `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` is set to 1, then your application receives a v1.0 token.

Use Microsoft Authentication Library [(MSAL)](/entra/identity-platform/msal-overview) to acquire either a v1.0 or v2.0 access token. Or, send requests to the REST API in the following format:
- POST `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{{tenantId}}/oauth2/v2.0/token`
- Headers for using Microsoft Entra App:
- grant_type: "client_credentials"
- client_id: {Client ID of Microsoft Entra App}
- client_secret: {secret of Microsoft Entra App}
- scope: `"https://management.azure.com/.default"`

If `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` in the app manifest is set to 1, your application receives a v1.0 access token even though it's calling the v2 token endpoint.

The resource/scope value is the audience of the token. This API only accepts the following audiences:
- `https://management.core.windows.net/`
- `https://management.core.windows.net`
- `https://management.azure.com/`
- `https://management.azure.com`


### Assemble the request message

#### Request URI 
API versioning: `api-version=2024-02-01-preview`<br>
Endpoint: `https://api.ti.sentinel.azure.com/workspaces/{workspaceId}/threat-intelligence-stix-objects:upload?api-version={apiVersion}`<br>
Method: `POST`<br>

#### Request header
`Authorization`: Contains the OAuth2 bearer token<br>
`Content-Type`: `application/json`

#### Request body
The JSON object for the body contains the following fields:

|Field name	|Data Type	|Description|
|---|---|---|
| `sourcesystem` (required) | string | Identify your source system name. The value `Microsoft Sentinel` is restricted.|
| `stixobjects` (required) | array | An array of STIX objects in [STIX 2.0 or 2.1 format](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#_muftrcpnf89v) |

Create the array of STIX objects using the STIX format specification. Some of the STIX property specifications are expanded here for your convenience with links to the relevant STIX document sections. Also note some properties, while valid for STIX, don't have corresponding object schema properties in Microsoft Sentinel.

#### Common properties

All the objects you import with the upload API share these common properties.

|Property Name	|Type |	Description |
|----|----|----|
|`id` (required)| string | An ID used to identify the STIX object. See section [2.9](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#_64yvzeku5a5c) for specifications on how to create an `id`. The format looks something like `indicator--<UUID>`|
|`spec_version` (optional) | string | STIX object version. This value is required in the STIX specification, but since this API only supports STIX 2.0 and 2.1, when this field isn't set, the API defaults to `2.1`|
|`type` (required)|	string | The value of this property *must* be a supported STIX object.|
|`created` (required) | timestamp | See section [3.2](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#_xzbicbtscatx) for specifications of this common property.|
|`created_by_ref` (optional) | string | The created_by_ref property specifies the ID property of the entity that created this object.<br><br>If this attribute is omitted, the source of this information is undefined. For object creators who wish to remain anonymous, keep this value undefined.|
|`modified` (required) | timestamp | See section [3.2](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#_xzbicbtscatx) for specifications of this common property.|
|`revoked` (optional) | boolean | Revoked objects are no longer considered valid by the object creator. Revoking an object is permanent; future versions of the object with this `id` *must not* be created.<br><br>The default value of this property is false.|
|`labels` (optional) | list of strings | The `labels` property specifies a set of terms used to describe this object. The terms are user-defined or trust-group defined. These labels display as **Tags** in Microsoft Sentinel.|
|`confidence` (optional) | integer | The `confidence` property identifies the confidence that the creator has in the correctness of their data. The confidence value *must* be a number in the range of 0-100.<br><br>[Appendix A](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#_1v6elyto0uqg) contains a table of normative mappings to other confidence scales that *must* be used when presenting the confidence value in one of those scales.<br><br>If the confidence property isn't present, then the confidence of the content is unspecified.|
|`lang` (optional) | string | The `lang` property identifies the language of the text content in this object. When present, it *must* be a language code conformant to [RFC5646](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#kix.yoz409d7eis1). If the property isn't present, then the language of the content is `en` (English).<br><br>This property *should* be present if the object type contains translatable text properties (for example, name, description).<br><br>The language of individual fields in this object *might* override the `lang` property in granular markings (see section [7.2.3](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#_robezi5egfdr)).|
|`object_marking_refs` (optional, including TLP) | list of strings | The `object_marking_refs` property specifies a list of ID properties of marking-definition objects that apply to this object. For example, use the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) marking definition ID to designate the sensitivity of the indicator source. For details of what marking-definition IDs to use for TLP content, see section [7.2.1.4](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_yd3ar14ekwrs)<br><br>In some cases, though uncommon, marking definitions themselves might be marked with sharing or handling guidance. In this case, this property *must not* contain any references to the same Marking Definition object (that is, it can't contain any circular references).<br><br>See section [7.2.2](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#_bnienmcktc0n) for further definition of data markings.|
|`external_references` (optional) | list of object | The `external_references` property specifies a list of external references which refers to non-STIX information. This property is used to provide one or more URLs, descriptions, or IDs to records in other systems.|
|`granular_markings` (optional) | list of [granular-marking](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#_robezi5egfdr) | The `granular_markings` property helps define parts of the indicator differently. For example, the indicator language is English, `en` but the description is German, `de`.<br><br>In some cases, though uncommon, marking definitions themselves might be marked with sharing or handling guidance. In this case, this property *must not* contain any references to the same Marking Definition object (that is, it can't contain any circular references).<br><br>See section [7.2.3](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#_robezi5egfdr) for further definition of data markings.|

For more information, see [STIX common properties](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_xzbicbtscatx).

### Process the response message

The response header contains an HTTP status code. Reference this table for more information about how to interpret the API call result.

|Status code  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**200**     |   Success. The API returns 200 when one or more STIX objects are successfully validated and published. |
|**400**     |   Bad format. Something in the request isn't correctly formatted.    |
|**401**     |   Unauthorized. |
|**404**     |   File not found. Usually this error occurs when the workspace ID isn't found.   |
|**429**     |   The max number of requests in a minute has been exceeded.   |
|**500**     |   Server error. Usually an error in the API or Microsoft Sentinel services.

The response body is an array of error messages in JSON format:

|Field name | Data Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
|errors	| Array of error objects | List of validation errors |

**Error object**

|Field name | Data Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
|recordIndex | int | Index of the STIX objects in the request |
|errorMessages | Array of strings | Error messages |


## Throttling limits for the API

All limits are applied per user:
- 100 objects per request. 
- 100 requests per minute.

If there are more requests than the limit, a `429` http status code in the response header is returned with the following response body:
```json
{
    "statusCode": 429,
    "message": "Rate limit is exceeded. Try again in <number of seconds> seconds."
}
```
Approximately 10,000 objects per minute is the maximum throughput before a throttling error is received. 

### Sample indicator request body

The following example shows how to represent two indicators in the STIX specification. `Test Indicator 2` highlights the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) set to white with the mapped object marking, and clarifying its description and labels are in English.

                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Sample response body with validation error
If all STIX objects are validated successfully, an HTTP 200 status is returned with an empty response body. 

If validation fails for one or more objects, the response body is returned with more information. For example, if you send an array with four indicators, and the first three are good but the fourth doesn't have an `id` (a required field), then an HTTP status code 200 response is generated along with the following body:

```json
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "recordIndex":3, 
            "errorMessages": [
                "Error for Property=id: Required property is missing. Actual value: NULL."
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
The objects are sent as an array, so the `recordIndex` begins at `0`.

### Other samples

#### Sample indicator

In this example, the indicator is marked with the green TLP. More extension attributes of `toxicity` and `rank` are also included. Although these properties aren't in the Microsoft Sentinel schema for indicators, ingesting an object with these properties doesn't trigger an error. The properties simply aren't referenced or indexed in the workspace.
