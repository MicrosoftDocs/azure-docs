#Customer intent: As a security analyst, I want to understand the Network normalization schema so that I can effectively analyze and unify network event data for better threat detection and response.

# Microsoft Sentinel network normalization schema (Legacy version - Public preview)

The network normalization schema is used to describe reported network events, and is used by Microsoft Sentinel to enable unifying analytics.

For more information, see [Normalization and the Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM)](normalization.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article relates to version 0.1 of the network normalization schema, which was released as a preview before ASIM was available. [Version 0.2.x](normalization-schema-network.md) of the network normalization schema aligns with ASIM and provides other enhancements.

## Terminology

The following terminology is used in Microsoft Sentinel schemas:

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| **Reporting device** | The system sending the records to Microsoft Sentinel. It may not be the subject system of the record. |
| **Record** | A unit of data sent from the reporting device. This unit of data is often referred to as `log`, `event`, or `alert`, but can also have other types.|
|

## Data types and formats

The following table provides guidance for normalizing data values, which is required for normalized fields, and recommended for other fields.

| Data type | Physical type | Format and value |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| **Date/Time** | One of the following, depending on the ingest method capability used, in descending priority:<ul><li>Log Analytics built-in datetime type</li><li>An integer field using Log Analytics datetime numerical representation</li><li>A string field using Log Analytics datetime numerical representation</li></ul> | Log Analytics datetime representation. <br></br>Log Analytics date and time representation is similar in nature but different than Unix time representation. Refer to these conversion guidelines. <br><br>The date and time must be adjusted for time zones. |
| **MAC Address** | String | Colon-Hexadecimal notation |
| **IP Address** | IP Address | The schema does not have separate IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Any IP address field may include either an IPv4 address or IPv6 address:<ul><li>IPv4 in a dot-decimal notation</li><li>IPv6 in 8 hextets notation, allowing for the short forms described here.</li></ul> |
| **User** | String | The following 3 user fields are available:<ul><li>User name</li><li>User UPN</li><li>User domain</li></ul> |
| **User ID** | String | The following 2 user IDs are currently supported:<ul><li>User SID</li><li>Microsoft Entra ID</li></ul> |
| **Device** | String | The following 3 device/host columns are supported:<ul><li>ID</li><li>Name</li><li>Fully qualified domain name (FQDN)</li></ul> |
| **Country** | String | A string using ISO 3166-1, according to the following priorities:<ul><li>Alpha-2 codes, such as `US` for the United States</li><li>Alpha-3 codes, such as `USA` for the United States</li><li>Short name</li></ul> |
| **Region** | String | The country/region subdivision name using ISO 3166-2 |
| **City** | String | |
| **Longitude** | Double | ISO 6709 coordinate representation (signed decimal) |
| **Latitude** | Double | ISO 6709 coordinate representation (signed decimal) |
| **Hash Algorithm** | String | The following 4 hash columns are supported:<ul><li>MD5</li><li>SHA1</li><li>SHA256</li><li>SHA512</li></ul> |
| **File Type** | String | The type of the file type:<ul><li>Extension</li><li>Class</li><li>NamedType</li></ul> |
|

## <a name="changes"></a>Differences between the version 0.1 and version 0.2

The original version of the Microsoft Sentinel Network session normalization schema, version 0.1, was released as a preview before ASIM was available.

Differences between version 0.1, documented in this article, and [version 0.2.x](normalization-schema-network.md) include:

- In version 0.2, unifying and source-specific parser names have been changed to conform to a standard ASIM naming convention.
- Version 0.2 adds specific guidelines and unifying parsers to accommodate specific device types.

The following sections describe how [version 0.2.x](normalization-schema-network.md) differs for specific fields.

### Added fields in version 0.2

The following fields were added in [version 0.2.x](normalization-schema-network.md) and do not exist in version 0.1:

### Removed fields in version 0.2

The following fields exist in version 0.1 only, and were removed in [version 0.2.x](normalization-schema-network.md):

|Reason  |Removed fields  |
|---------|---------|
|**Removed because duplicates exist, without the `Dvc` string in the field name**     |  - DstDvcIpAddr<br> - DstDvcMacAddr<br>- SrcDvcIpAddr<br>- SrcDvcMacAddr       |
|**Removed to align with ASIM handling of URLs**     |  - UrlHostname       |
|**Removed because these fields are not typically provided as part of Network Session events.**<br><br>If an event includes these fields, use the [Process Event schema](normalization-schema-process-event.md) to understand how to describe device properties. |     - SrcDvcOs<br>-&nbsp;SrcDvcModelName<br>-&nbsp;SrcDvcModelNumber<br>- DvcMacAddr<br>- DvcOs         |
|**Removed to align with ASIM file representation guidance**     |   - FilePath<br>- FileExtension      |
|**Removed as this field indicates that a different schema should be used, such as the [Authentication schema](normalization-schema-authentication.md).**     |  - CloudAppOperation       |
|**Removed as it duplicates `DstHostname`**     |  - DstDomainHostname         |
