# CEF and CommonSecurityLog field mapping

The following tables map Common Event Format (CEF) field names to the names they use in Microsoft Sentinel's CommonSecurityLog, and might be helpful when you're working with a CEF data source in Microsoft Sentinel. For more information, see [Ingest syslog and CEF messages to Microsoft Sentinel with the Azure Monitor Agent](connect-cef-syslog-ama.md).
