# The Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) DNS normalization schema reference (Public preview)

The DNS information model is used to describe events reported by a DNS server or a DNS security system, and is used by Microsoft Sentinel to enable source-agnostic analytics.

For more information, see [Normalization and the Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM)](normalization.md).

## Schema overview

The ASIM DNS schema represents DNS protocol activity. Both DNS servers and devices sending DNS requests to a DNS server log DNS activity. The DNS protocol activity includes DNS queries, DNS server updates, and DNS bulk data transfers. Since the schema represents protocol activity, it's governed by RFCs and officially assigned parameter lists, which are referenced in this article when appropriate. The DNS schema doesn't represent DNS server audit events. 

The most important activity reported by DNS servers is a DNS query, for which the `EventType` field is set to `Query`.   

The most important fields in a DNS event are:

- [DnsQuery](#query), which reports the domain name for which the query was issued.

- The [SrcIpAddr](#srcipaddr) (aliased to [IpAddr](#ipaddr)), which represents the IP address from which the request was generated. DNS servers typically provide the SrcIpAddr field, but DNS clients sometimes don't provide this field and only provide the [SrcHostname](#srchostname) field. 

- [EventResultDetails](#eventresultdetails), which reports whether the request was successful and if not, why.

- When available, [DnsResponseName](#responsename), which holds the answer provided by the server to the query. ASIM doesn't require parsing the response, and its format varies between sources. 

    To use this field in source-agnostic content, search the content with the `has` or `contains` operators.

DNS events collected on client device may also include [User](#user) and [Process](#process) information. 

## Guidelines for collecting DNS events

DNS is a unique protocol in that it may cross a large number of computers. Also, since DNS uses UDP, requests and responses are de-coupled and aren't directly related to each other.

The following image shows a simplified DNS request flow, including four segments. A real-world request can be more complex, with more segments involved.

:::image type="content" source="media/normalization/dns-request-flow.png" alt-text="Simplified DNS request flow.":::

Since request and response segments aren't directly connected to each other in the DNS request flow, full logging can result in significant duplication.

The most valuable segment to log is the response to the client. The response provides the domain name queries, the lookup result, and the IP address of the client. While many DNS systems log only this segment, there is value in logging the other parts. For example, a DNS cache poisoning attack often takes advantage of fake responses from an upstream server.

If your data source supports full DNS logging and you've chosen to log multiple segments, adjust your queries to prevent data duplication in Microsoft Sentinel.

For example, you might modify your query with the following normalization:

```kusto
_Im_Dns | where SrcIpAddr != "127.0.0.1" and EventSubType == "response"
```

## Parsers

For more information about ASIM parsers, see the [ASIM parsers overview](normalization-parsers-overview.md).

### Out-of-the-box parsers

To use parsers that unify all ASIM out-of-the-box parsers, and ensure that your analysis runs across all the configured sources, use the unifying parser `_Im_Dns` as the table name in your query.

For the list of the DNS parsers Microsoft Sentinel provides out-of-the-box refer to the [ASIM parsers list](normalization-parsers-list.md#dns-parsers).

### Add your own normalized parsers

When implementing custom parsers for the Dns information model, name your KQL functions using the format `vimDns<vendor><Product>`. Refer to the article [Managing ASIM parsers](normalization-manage-parsers.md) to learn how to add your custom parsers to the DNS unifying parser.

### Filtering parser parameters

The DNS parsers support [filtering parameters](normalization-about-parsers.md#optimizing-parsing-using-parameters). While these parameters are optional, they can improve your query performance.

The following filtering parameters are available:

| Name     | Type      | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **starttime** | datetime | Filter only DNS queries that ran at or after this time. |
| **endtime** | datetime | Filter only DNS queries that finished running at or before this time. |
| **srcipaddr** | string | Filter only DNS queries from this source IP address. |
| **domain_has_any**| dynamic/string | Filter only DNS queries where the `domain` (or `query`) has any of the listed domain names, including as part of the event domain. The length of the list is limited to 10,000 items.
| **responsecodename** | string | Filter only DNS queries for which the response code name matches the provided value. <br>For example: `NXDOMAIN` |
| **response_has_ipv4** | string | Filter only DNS queries in which the response field includes the provided IP address or IP address prefix. Use this parameter when you want to filter on a single IP address or prefix. <br><br>Results aren't returned for sources that don't provide a response.|
| **response_has_any_prefix** | dynamic| Filter only DNS queries in which the response field includes any of the listed IP addresses or IP address prefixes. Prefixes should end with a `.`, for example: `10.0.`. <br><br>Use this parameter when you want to filter on a list of IP addresses or prefixes. <br><br>Results aren't returned for sources that don't provide a response. The length of the list is limited to 10,000 items. |
| **eventtype**| string | Filter only DNS queries of the specified type. If no value is specified, only lookup queries are returned. |


For example, to filter only DNS queries from the last day that failed to resolve the domain name, use:

```kusto
_Im_Dns (responsecodename = 'NXDOMAIN', starttime = ago(1d), endtime=now())
```

To filter only DNS queries for a specified list of domain names, use:

```kusto
let torProxies=dynamic(["tor2web.org", "tor2web.com", "torlink.co"]);
_Im_Dns (domain_has_any = torProxies)
```

Some parameter can accept both list of values of type `dynamic` or a single string value. To pass a literal list to parameters that expect a dynamic value, explicitly use a [dynamic literal](/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/dynamic?view=microsoft-sentinel&preserve-view=true#dynamic-literals). For example: `dynamic(['192.168.','10.'])`

## Normalized content

For a full list of analytics rules that use normalized DNS events, see [DNS query security content](normalization-content.md#dns-query-security-content).

## Schema details

The DNS information model is aligned with the [OSSEM DNS entity schema](https://github.com/OTRF/OSSEM/blob/master/docs/cdm/entities/dns.md).

For more information, see the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) DNS parameter reference](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml).

| **EventType** | Mandatory | Enumerated | Indicates the operation reported by the record. <br><br> For DNS records, this value would be the [DNS op code](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml). <br><br>Example: `Query`|
| **EventSubType** | Optional | Enumerated | Either `request` or `response`. <br><br>For most sources, [only the responses are logged](#guidelines-for-collecting-dns-events), and therefore the value is often **response**.  |
| <a name=eventresultdetails></a>**EventResultDetails** | Mandatory | Enumerated | For DNS events, this field provides the [DNS response code](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml). <br><br>**Notes**:<br>- IANA doesn't define the case for the values, so analytics must normalize the case.<br> - If the source provides only a numerical response code and not a response code name, the parser must include a lookup table to enrich with this value. <br>- If this record represents a request and not a response, set to **NA**. <br><br>Example: `NXDOMAIN` |
| **EventSchemaVersion** | Mandatory | String | The version of the schema documented here is **0.1.7**. |
| **EventSchema** | Mandatory | String | The name of the schema documented here is **Dns**. |

### DNS specific fields

| Field | Class | Type | Description |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| <a name=query></a>**DnsQuery** | Mandatory | String | The domain that the request tries to resolve. <br><br>**Notes**:<br> - Some sources send valid FQDN queries in a different format. For example, in the DNS protocol itself, the query includes a dot (**.**) at the end, which must be removed.<br>- While the DNS protocol limits the type of value in this field to an FQDN, most DNS servers allow any value, and this field is therefore not limited to FQDN values only. Most notably, DNS tunneling attacks may use invalid FQDN values in the query field.<br>- While the DNS protocol allows for multiple queries in a single request, this scenario is rare, if it's found at all. If the request has multiple queries, store the first one in this field, and then and optionally keep the rest in the [AdditionalFields](normalization-common-fields.md#additionalfields) field.<br><br>Example: `www.malicious.com` |
| <a name="domain"></a>**Domain** | Alias | | Alias to [DnsQuery](#query). |
| **DnsQueryType** | Optional | Integer | The [DNS Resource Record Type codes](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml). <br><br>Example: `28`|
| **DnsQueryTypeName** | Recommended | Enumerated | The [DNS Resource Record Type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml) names. <br><br>**Notes**:<br> - IANA doesn't define the case for the values, so analytics must normalize the case as needed.<br>- The value `ANY` is supported for the response code 255.<br> - The value `TYPExxxx` is supported for unmapped response codes, where `xxxx` is the numerical value of the response code, as reported by the BIND DNS server.<br> -If the source provides only a numerical query type code and not a query type name, the parser must include a lookup table to enrich with this value.<br><br>Example: `AAAA`|
| <a name=responsename></a>**DnsResponseName** | Optional | String | The content of the response, as included in the record.<br> <br> The DNS response data is inconsistent across reporting devices, is complex to parse, and has less value for source-agnostic analytics. Therefore the information model doesn't require parsing and normalization, and Microsoft Sentinel uses an auxiliary function to provide response information. For more information, see [Handling DNS response](#handling-dns-response).|
| <a name=responsecodename></a>**DnsResponseCodeName** |  Alias | | Alias to [EventResultDetails](#eventresultdetails) |
| **DnsResponseCode** | Optional | Integer | The [DNS numerical response code](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml). <br><br>Example: `3`|
| <a name="transactionidhex"></a>**TransactionIdHex** | Recommended | String | The DNS query unique ID as assigned by the DNS client, in hexadecimal format. Note that this value is part of the DNS protocol and different from [DnsSessionId](#dnssessionid), the network layer session ID, typically assigned by the reporting device. |
| <a name="networkprotocol"></a>**NetworkProtocol** | Optional | Enumerated | The transport protocol used by the network resolution event. The value can be **UDP** or **TCP**, and is most commonly set to **UDP** for DNS. <br><br>Example: `UDP`|

### Inspection fields

The following fields are used to represent an inspection, which a DNS security device performed. The threat related fields represent a single threat that is associated with either the source address, the destination address, one of the IP addresses in the response or the DNS query domain. If more than one threat was identified as a threat, information about other IP addresses can be stored in the field `AdditionalFields`.

| Field | Class | Type | Description |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| <a name=UrlCategory></a>**UrlCategory** |  Optional | String | A DNS event source may also look up the category of the requested Domains. The field is called **UrlCategory** to align with the Microsoft Sentinel network schema. <br><br>**DomainCategory** is added as an alias that's fitting to DNS. <br><br>Example: `Educational \\ Phishing` |
| **DomainCategory** | Alias | | Alias to [UrlCategory](#UrlCategory). |
| <a name="networkrulename"></a>**NetworkRuleName** | Optional | String | The name or ID of the rule which identified the threat.<br><br> Example: `AnyAnyDrop` |
| <a name="networkrulenumber"></a>**NetworkRuleNumber** | Optional | Integer | The number of the rule which identified the threat.<br><br>Example: `23` |
| **Rule** | Alias | String | Either the value of [NetworkRuleName](#networkrulename) or the value of [NetworkRuleNumber](#networkrulenumber). If the value of [NetworkRuleNumber](#networkrulenumber) is used, the type should be converted to string. |
| **ThreatId** | Optional | String | The ID of the threat or malware identified in the network session.<br><br>Example: `Tr.124` |
| **ThreatCategory** | Optional | String | If a DNS event source also provides DNS security, it may also evaluate the DNS event. For example, it can search for the IP address or domain in a threat intelligence database, and assign the domain or IP address with a Threat Category. |
| **ThreatIpAddr** | Optional | IP Address | An IP address for which a threat was identified. The field [ThreatField](#threatfield) contains the name of the field **ThreatIpAddr** represents. If a threat is identified in the [Domain](#domain) field, this field should be empty. |
| <a name="threatfield"></a>**ThreatField** | Conditional | Enumerated | The field for which a threat was identified. The value is either `SrcIpAddr`, `DstIpAddr`, `Domain`, or `DnsResponseName`. |
| **ThreatName** | Optional | String | The name of the threat identified, as reported by the reporting device. | 
| **ThreatConfidence** | Optional | Integer | The confidence level of the threat identified, normalized to a value between 0 and a 100.| 
| **ThreatOriginalConfidence** | Optional | String |  The original confidence level of the threat identified, as reported by the reporting device.|

## Source-specific discrepancies 

The goal of normalizing is to ensure that all sources provide consistent telemetry. A source that doesn't provide the required telemetry, such as mandatory schema fields, cannot be normalized. However, sources that typically provide all required telemetry, even if there are some discrepancies, can be normalized. Discrepancies may affect the completeness of query results.

The following table lists known discrepancies:

| Source | Discrepancies |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Microsoft DNS Server Collected using the DNS connector and the Log Analytics Agent | The connector doesn't provide the mandatory DnsQuery field for original event ID 264 (Response to a dynamic update). The data is available at the source, but not forwarded by the connector. |
| Corelight Zeek | Corelight Zeek may not provide the mandatory DnsQuery field. We have observed such behavior in certain cases in which the DNS response code name is `NXDOMAIN`. |


## Handling DNS response

In most cases, logged DNS events don't include response information, which may be large and detailed. If your record includes more response information, store it in the [ResponseName](#responsename) field as it appears in the record.

You can also provide an extra KQL function called `_imDNS<vendor>Response_`, which takes the unparsed response as input and returns dynamic value with the following structure:

```kusto
[
    {
        "part": "answer"
        "query": "yahoo.com."
        "TTL": 1782
        "Class": "IN"
        "Type": "A"
        "Response": "74.6.231.21"
    }
    {
        "part": "authority"
        "query": "yahoo.com."
        "TTL": 113066
        "Class": "IN"
        "Type": "NS"
        "Response": "ns5.yahoo.com"
    }
    ...
]
```

The fields in each dictionary in the dynamic value correspond to the fields in each DNS response. The `part` entry should include either `answer`, `authority`, or `additional` to reflect the part in the response that the dictionary belongs to.

> [!TIP]
> To ensure optimal performance, call the `imDNS<vendor>Response` function only when needed, and only after an initial filtering to ensure better performance.
>

## Handling DNS flags

Parsing and normalization aren't required for flag data. Instead, store the flag data provided by the reporting device in the [Flags](#flags) field. If determining the value of individual flags is straight forward, you can also use the dedicated flags fields. 

You can also provide an extra KQL function called `_imDNS<vendor>Flags_`, which takes the unparsed response, or dedicated flag fields, as input and returns a dynamic list, with Boolean values that represent each flag in the following order:

- Authenticated (AD)
- Authoritative (AA)
- Checking Disabled (CD)
- Recursion Available (RA)
- Recursion Desired (RD)
- Truncated (TC)
- Z
