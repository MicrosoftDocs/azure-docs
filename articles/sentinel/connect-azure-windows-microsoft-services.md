# Connect Microsoft Sentinel to Azure, Windows, Microsoft, and Amazon services

Microsoft Sentinel uses the Azure foundation to provide built-in, service-to-service support for data ingestion from many Azure and Microsoft 365 services, Amazon Web Services, and various Windows Server services. There are a few different methods through which these connections are made.

## Types of connections

Data connectors for Microsoft Sentinel are grouped into the following types of connectors:

- **API-based** connections
- **Diagnostic settings** connections, some of which are managed by Azure Policy
- **Windows agent**-based connections

See the [data connector reference](data-connectors-reference.md) to find available data connectors and their related information page. You'll find information that's unique to each connector like Log Analytics tables for data storage and a link to the installation instructions.

The following articles present information that is common to each group of connectors for Microsoft services.
