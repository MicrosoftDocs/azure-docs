# Azure Sentinel Authentication normalization schema reference (Public preview)

The Authentication information model is used to describe events related to user authentication, sign-in, and sign-out. Authentication events are sent by many reporting devices, usually as part of the event stream alongside other events.

For example, Windows sends several authentication events alongside other OS activity events. As a result, in most cases the authentication events are stored in different Azure Sentinel tables and are normalized using a KQL function, which also filters only the relevant authentication events.

Authentication events include both events from systems that focus on authentication such as VPN gateways or domain controllers, and direct authentication to an end system, such as a computer or firewall.

For more information about normalization in Azure Sentinel, see [Normalization and the Azure Sentinel Information Model (ASIM)](normalization.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Authentication normalization schema is currently in public preview.
> This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Parsers

Azure Sentinel provides the following built-in, product-specific authentication event parsers: 

- **Windows sign-ins** reported as Security Events (4624, 4625, 4634, and 4647), collected using the Log Analytics Agent or Azure Monitor Agent.
- **Windows sign-ins** reported by Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoint, collected using the Microsoft 365 Defender connector.
- **Azure Active Directory sign-ins**, collected using the Azure Active Directory connector. Separate parsers are provided for regular, Non-Interactive, Managed Identities and Service Principles Sign-ins.
- **AWS sign-ins**, collected using the AWS CloudTrail connector.
- **Okta authentication**, collected using the Okta connector.

To use the source-agnostic parser that unify all of listed parsers and ensure that you analyze across all the configured sources, use **imAuthentication** as the table name in your query.

Deploy the [source-agnostic and source-specific parsers](normalization.md#parsers) from the [Azure Sentinel GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/AzSentinelAuth).



## Normalized content

Support for the Authentication normalization schema also includes support for the following built-in analytics rules with normalized authentication parsers:

- User Login from Different Countries within 3 hours (Uses Authentication Normalization)
- Potential Password Spray Attack (Uses Authentication Normalization)
- Brute force attack against user credentials (Uses Authentication Normalization)

Normalized authentication analytic rules are unique as they detect attacks across sources. So, for example, if a user logged in to different, unrelated systems, from different countries, Azure Sentinel will now detect this threat.

## Schema details

The Authentication information model is aligned with the [OSSEM logon entity schema](https://github.com/OTRF/OSSEM/blob/master/docs/cdm/entities/logon.md).

In the following tables, *Type* refers to a logical type. For more information, see [Logical types](normalization.md#logical-types).

### Log Analytics Fields

The following fields are generated by Log Analytics for each record, and you can override them when creating a custom connector.

|Field  |Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|<a name ="timegenerated"></a>**TimeGenerated**     |  datetime       |The time the event was generated by the reporting device.         |
|**_ResourceId**     | guid        |  The Azure Resource ID of the reporting device or service, or the log forwarder resource ID for events forwarded using Syslog, CEF, or WEF.       |
|     |         |         |

> [!NOTE]
> Log Analytics also adds other fields that are less relevant to security use cases. For more information, see [Standard columns in Azure Monitor Logs](../azure-monitor/logs/log-standard-columns.md).

### Event Fields

Event fields are common to all schemas and describe the activity itself and the reporting device.

| Field               | Class       | Type       |  Description        |
|---------------------|-------------|------------|--------------------|
| **EventMessage**        | Optional    | String     |     A general message or description, either included in or generated from the record.   |
| **EventCount**          | Mandatory   | Integer    |     The number of events described by the record. <br><br>This value is used when the source supports aggregation, and a single record may represent multiple events. <br><br>For other sources, set to `1`. <br><br>**Note**: This field is included for the sake of consistency, but it's not usually used for authentication events.  |
| **EventStartTime**      | Mandatory   | Date/time  |      If the source supports aggregation and the record represents multiple events, this field specifies the time that the first event was generated. Otherwise, this field aliases the [TimeGenerated](#timegenerated) field.<br><br>**Note**: This field is included for the sake of consistency, but it's not usually used for authentication events.  |

| <a name ="eventresultdetails"></a>**EventResultDetails**         | Optional   | String |  One of the following values: <br><br>-	`No such user or password`. This value should be used also when the original event reports that there is no such user, without reference to a password. <br>-	`Incorrect password`<br>-	`Account expired`<br>-	`Password expired`<br>-	`User locked`<br>-	`User disabled`<br>-	`Logon violates policy`. This value should be used when the original event reports, for example: MFA required, logon outside of working hours, conditional access restrictions, or too frequent attempts.<br>-	`Session expired`<br>-	`Other`<br><br>**Note**: The value may be provided in the source record using different terms, which should be normalized to these values.|

## Authentication-specific fields

The fields listed in the table below are specific to Authentication events, but are similar to fields in other schemas and follow similar naming conventions.

Authentication events reference the following entities:

- **Actor**
- **ActingApp**
- **SrcDvc**
- **TargetUser**
- **TargetApp**
- **TargetDvc**

The relationship between these entities is best demonstrated as follows:

An **Actor**, running an *Acting Application* (**ActingApp**) on a *Source Device* (**SrcDvc**), attempts to authenticate  a **TargetUser** to a *Target Application* (**TargetApp**) on a *Target Device* (**TargetDvc**).
