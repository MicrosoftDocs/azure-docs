# Install a Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP applications

The Microsoft Sentinel solutions for SAP applications include an SAP data connector, which collects logs from your SAP systems and sends them to your Microsoft Sentinel workspace, and out-of-the-box security content, which helps you gain insight into your organization's SAP environment and detect and respond to security threats. Installing your solution is a required step before you can configure your data connector.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Sentinel's agentless data connector for SAP is currently in **LIMITED PREVIEW**. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Prerequisites

To deploy a Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP applications from the content hub, you need:

- A Log Analytics workspace enabled for Microsoft Sentinel.
- Read and write permissions to the workspace. For more information, see [Roles and permissions in Microsoft Sentinel](../roles.md).

Make sure that you also review the [prerequisites for deploying Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP applications](prerequisites-for-deploying-sap-continuous-threat-monitoring.md), especially [Azure prerequisites](prerequisites-for-deploying-sap-continuous-threat-monitoring.md#azure-prerequisites).

:::zone pivot="connection-agentless"

## Install the solution

Installing the **Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP** makes both the data connector agent and the agentless data connector available to you from the Microsoft Sentinel **Configuration > Data connectors** page. The solution also deploys security content, such as the **SAP -Audit Controls** workbook and SAP-related analytics rules.
 
1. [Install the solution via the Azure marketplace](https://portal.azure.com/#create/sentinel4sap.sentinel4sap-previewsentinel4sap) after receiving a notification of onboarding. 
 
1. On the **Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP applications** page, select **Create** to define deployment settings. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/deploy-sap-security-content/sap-solution.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP applications solution pane." lightbox="./media/deploy-sap-security-content/sap-solution.png":::

1. On the default **Basics** tab, scroll down to select where to install the solution. If you're working with [the Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP applications in multiple workspaces](cross-workspace.md), select **Some of the data is on a different workspace**, and then define your target workspace, your SOC workspace, and SAP workspace. For example:

    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/deploy-sap-security-content/sap-multi-workspace.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to configure the Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP applications to work across multiple workspaces.":::

1. Select **Review + create** or **Next** to browse through the solution components. When you're ready, select **Create**

    The deployment process can take a few minutes. After the deployment is finished, you can view the deployed content in Microsoft Sentinel.

> [!TIP]
> If you want the SAP and SOC data to be kept on the same workspace with no additional access controls, do not select **Some of the data is on a different workspace**. In such cases, for more information, see [SAP and SOC data maintained in the same workspace](cross-workspace.md#sap-and-soc-data-maintained-in-the-same-workspace).

For more information, see [Discover and manage Microsoft Sentinel out-of-the-box content](../sentinel-solutions-deploy.md).

Installing the **Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP** makes both the data connector agent and the agentless data connector available to you from the Microsoft Sentinel **Configuration > Data connectors** page. The solution also deploys security content, such as the **SAP -Audit Controls** workbook and SAP-related analytics rules.
 
1. In the Microsoft Sentinel **Content hub**, search for **SAP** to install the **SAP applications** solution. 
 
1. On the **Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP applications** page, select **Create** to define deployment settings. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/deploy-sap-security-content/sap-solution.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP applications solution pane." lightbox="./media/deploy-sap-security-content/sap-solution.png":::

## View deployed content

When the deployment is finished, display your new content by browsing again to the Microsoft Sentinel for SAP applications solution from the **Content hub**. Alternatively:

- For the [built-in SAP workbooks](sap-solution-security-content.md#built-in-workbooks), in Microsoft Sentinel, go to **Threat Management** > **Workbooks** > **Templates**.

- For a series of [SAP-related analytics rules](sap-solution-security-content.md#built-in-analytics-rules), go to **Configuration** > **Analytics** **Rule templates**.

Your data connector doesn't appear as connected until you [configure your data connector](deploy-data-connector-agent-container.md) and complete the connection.
