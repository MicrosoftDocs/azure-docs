# Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP BTP: security content reference

This article details the security content available for the Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP BTP.

Available security content currently includes a built-in workbook and analytics rules. You can also add SAP-related [watchlists](../watchlists.md) to use in your search, detection rules, threat hunting, and response playbooks.

## SAP BTP workbook

The BTP Activity Workbook provides a dashboard overview of BTP activity.

The **Overview** tab shows: 

- An overview of BTP subaccounts, helping analysts identify the most active accounts and the type of ingested data. 
- Subaccount sign-in activity, helping analysts identify spikes and trends that might be associated with sign-in failures in SAP Business Application Studio (BAS). 
- Timeline of BTP activity and number of BTP security alerts, helping analysts search for any correlation between the two.
 
The **Identity Management** tab shows a grid of identity management events, such as user and security role changes, in a human-readable format. The search bar lets you quickly find specific changes.
