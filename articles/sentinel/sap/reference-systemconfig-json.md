#Customer intent: As an SAP BASIS team member, I want to understand the configuration options in the systemconfig.json file so that I can properly set up and manage the data collector for SAP applications.

# Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP applications data connector agent `systemconfig.json` file reference

The *systemconfig.json* file is used to configure the behavior of the Microsoft Sentinel for SAP applications data connector agent when [deployed from the command line](deploy-command-line.md). This article describes the options available in each section of the configuration file.

Content in this article is intended for your **SAP BASIS** teams, and is only relevant when your data connector agent is deployed from the command line. We recommend [deploying your data connector agent from the portal](deploy-data-connector-agent-container.md) instead.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP applications uses the *systemconfig.json* file for agent versions released on or after June 22, 2023. For previous agent versions, you must still use the *[systemconfig.ini file](reference-systemconfig.md)*.

## Overall file structure

The following code shows the overall structure of the `systemconfig.json` file:

```json
{ 

"<SID_GUID>": { 

    "secrets_source": {...},

    "abap_central_instance": {...},

    "azure_credentials": {...},

    "file_extraction_abap": {...},

    "file_extraction_java": {...},

    "logs_activation_status" {...},

    "connector_configuration": {...},

    "abap_table_selector": {...}

...

}
```

The following table describes each overall section in the `systemconfig.json` file:

| Section name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| [Secrets source](#secrets-source) | Defines where credentials are stored. |
| [ABAP central instance](#abap-central-instance) | Defines general options of the SAP instance to connect to. |
| [Azure credentials](#azure-credentials) | Defines credentials to connect to Azure Log Analytics. |
| [File extraction ABAP](#file-extraction-abap) | Defines logs and credentials that are extracted from ABAP servers using the SAPControl interface. |
| [File extraction JAVA](#file-extraction-java) | Defines logs and credentials that are extracted from JAVA servers using the SAPControl interface. |
| [Logs activation status](#logs-activation-status) | Defines which logs are extracted from ABAP. |
| [Connector configuration](#connector-configuration) | Defines miscellaneous connector options. |
| [ABAP table selector](#abap-table-selector) | Defines which user master data logs get extracted from the ABAP system. |
