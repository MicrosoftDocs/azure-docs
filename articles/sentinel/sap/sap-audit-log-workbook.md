# Monitor and track user audit activity across SAP systems

This article describes the **SAP - Security Audit log and Initial Access** workbook, used for monitoring and tracking user audit activity across your SAP systems. Use the workbook to get a bird's eye view of user audit activity, better secure your SAP systems, and gain quick visibility into suspicious actions. Drill down into suspicious events as needed.

Use the workbook either for ongoing monitoring of your SAP systems, or to review the systems following a security incident or other suspicious activity.

For example:

Content in this article is intended for your **security** team.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using the **SAP - Security Audit log and Initial Access** workbook, you must have:

- A Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP installed and a data connector configured. For more information, see [Deploy a Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP applications](deployment-overview.md).

- The **SAP - Security Audit log and Initial Access** workbook installed in your Log Analytics workspace enabled for Microsoft Sentinel. For more information, see [Visualize and monitor your data by using workbooks in Microsoft Sentinel](../monitor-your-data.md).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The **SAP - Security Audit log and Initial Access** workbook is hosted by the workspace where the Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP applications were installed. By default, both the SAP and the SOC data is assumed to be on the workspace that hosts the workbook.
    >
    > If the SOC data is on a different workspace than the workspace hosting the workbook, make sure to include the subscription for that workspace, and select the SOC workspace from **Azure audit and activity workspace**.

- At least one incident in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace, with at least one entry available in the `SecurityIncident` table. This doesn't need to be an SAP incident, and you can generate a demo incident using a basic analytics rule if you don't have another one.

- If your Microsoft Entra data is in a different Log Analytics workspace, make sure you select the relevant subscriptions and workspaces at the top of the workbook, under **Azure audit and activities**.

We recommend that you configure auditing for *all* messages from the audit log, instead of only specific logs. Ingestion cost differences are generally minimal and the data is useful for Microsoft Sentinel detections and in post-compromise investigations and hunting. For more information, see [Configure SAP auditing](preparing-sap.md#configure-sap-auditing).

## Supported filters

The **SAP - Security Audit log and Initial Access** workbook supports the following filters to help you focus on the data you need:

- **Time Range**. From four hours to 90 days.  
- **System Roles**. The SAP system roles, for example: Development.
- **System Usage**. For example: SAP GTS.
- **SAP systems**. You can select all systems, a specific system, or select multiple systems.

If you select systems that aren't configured in the [*SAP systems* watchlist](sap-solution-security-content.md#available-watchlists), the workbook shows an error, specifying the systems with issues. In this case, [configure the watchlist](deployment-solution-configuration.md#configure-watchlists) to correctly include these systems.

## Logon analysis report data

The **Logon analysis report** tab on the **SAP - Security Audit log and Initial Access** workbook shows data about sign-in failures, such as anomalous data, Microsoft Entra data, and more. 

The data is based on the [*SAP systems* watchlist](sap-solution-security-content.md#available-watchlists).

The **Logon analysis report** tab includes the following areas:

- [Logon analysis](#logon-analysis)
- [Logon failures - anomaly detection](#logon-failures---anomaly-detection)
- [Logon failures - trends](#logon-failures---trends)

### Logon analysis

The **Logon analysis**  area shows regarding user sign-ins. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/sap-audit-log-workbook/logon-analysis.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Logon Analysis area of the SAP Audit workbook." lightbox="media/sap-audit-log-workbook/logon-analysis.png":::

The following table describes each metric in the **Logon analysis** area:

|Area  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Unique user logons per system**     |Shows the number of unique sign-ins for each SAP system, and a graph with the sign-in trends over the selected time for each system. <br><br>For example: the 012 system has 1.4-K unique logon attempts in the last 14 days, and in these 14 days the graph shows a relatively rising sign-in trend.         |
|**Logon types trend**     |Shows a trend of the number of sign ins according to type, for example, login via dialog. <br><br>Hover over the graph to show the number of logons for different dates.|
|**Logon failures Vs. success by unique users - trend**     |Shows a trend of successful and failed sign ins in the selected period. <br><br>Hover over the graph to show the amount of successful and failed sign ins for different dates.|

### Logon failures - anomaly detection

The areas under **Anomaly detection - filtering out noisy failed login attempts** show login failure data for SAP systems and users. To see only data flagged by, select **Anomalous only** next to **Failed logons** on the right.

For more information, see [Monitor the SAP audit log](sap-solution-security-content.md#monitor-the-sap-audit-log).

For example:

The following table describes each metric in the **Anomaly detection** area:

|Area  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
| **Logon failure rate** > **Logon failure anomalies** > **Unique User failed logons per SAP system**     |  Shows the number of unique failed sign ins for each SAP system.       |
|**SAP and Active Directory are better together**     |    The **Anomalous login failures** table shows a combination of Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Entra data, listing users according to risk, with the most risky users at the top. <br><br>For each user, the table shows: <br>- A timeline of failed sign-in attempts<br>- A timeline showing at which point an anomalous failed attempt occurred<br>- The type of anomaly<br>- The user's email address<br>- The Microsoft Entra risk indicator<br>- The number of incidents and alerts in Microsoft Sentinel  <br><br> Select a user's row to see a list of related alerts and incidents. Microsoft Entra risk events are listed under **Azure audit and signin risks for user**.   |
|**Logon failure rate per system**     |  Shows the selected SAP systems, grouped by type, with the number of failures in the selected period. <br><br>The system's color indicates the number of failed attempts: Green for a few suspicious sign-in attempts, and red for more.<br><br>Select a system to see a list of failed sign-ins, with details about the failures.      |

In the following screenshot, note the data shown when the first line is selected in the **Anomalous login failures** table. The specific alerts and incident URLs are shown in the **Incidents/alerts overview for user** table.
