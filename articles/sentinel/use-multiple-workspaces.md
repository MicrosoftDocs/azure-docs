# Set up multiple workspaces and tenants in Microsoft Sentinel

When you planned your deployment, you determined whether a multiple workspace architecture is relevant for your environment. If your environment requires multiple workspaces, you can now set them up as part of your deployment. For more information, see [Prepare for multiple workspaces and tenants in Microsoft Sentinel](prepare-multiple-workspaces.md).

In this article, you learn how to set up Microsoft Sentinel to extend across multiple workspaces and tenants. This article is part of the [Deployment guide for Microsoft Sentinel](deploy-overview.md).

## Options for using multiple workspaces

After you set up your environment to extend across workspaces, you can: 

- **Manage and monitor your cross-workspace architecture**: Query and analyze your data across workspaces and tenants. 
  - To work in the Azure portal, see [Extend Microsoft Sentinel across workspaces and tenants](extend-sentinel-across-workspaces-tenants.md).
  - If your organization onboards Microsoft Sentinel to the Microsoft Defender portal, see [Microsoft Defender multitenant management](/defender-xdr/mto-overview).

For Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal, you can:

- **Manage multiple workspaces with workspace manager**: Centrally manage multiple workspaces within one or more Azure tenants. For more information, see [Centrally manage multiple Microsoft Sentinel workspaces with workspace manager](workspace-manager.md).

Only one Microsoft Sentinel workspace per tenant is currently supported in the Microsoft Defender portal. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender multitenant management](/defender-xdr/mto-overview).
