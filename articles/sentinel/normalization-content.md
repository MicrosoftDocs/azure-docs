#Customer intent: As a security analyst, I want to use ASIM-supported content in Microsoft Sentinel so that I can enhance threat detection and response capabilities using normalized security data.

# Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) security content  (Public preview)

Normalized security content in Microsoft Sentinel includes analytics rules, hunting queries, and workbooks that work with unifying normalization parsers.

<a name="builtin"></a>You can find normalized, built-in content in Microsoft Sentinel galleries and [solutions](sentinel-solutions-catalog.md), create your own normalized content, or modify existing content to use normalized data.

This article lists built-in Microsoft Sentinel content that has been configured to support the Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM).  While links to the Microsoft Sentinel GitHub repository are provided below as a reference, you can also find these rules in the [Microsoft Sentinel Analytics rule gallery](detect-threats-built-in.md). Use the linked GitHub pages to copy any relevant hunting queries.

To understand how normalized content fits within the ASIM architecture, refer to the [ASIM architecture diagram](normalization.md#asim-components).

> [!TIP]
> Also watch the [Deep Dive Webinar on Microsoft Sentinel Normalizing Parsers and Normalized Content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaqblyjQW6k) or review the [slides](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AnEPjr8tHcNmjGtoRPQ2XYe3wQDz?e=R3dWeM). For more information, see [Next steps](#next-steps).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ASIM is currently in PREVIEW. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
