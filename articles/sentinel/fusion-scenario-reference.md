# Scenarios detected by the Microsoft Sentinel Fusion engine

This document lists the types of scenario-based multistage attacks, grouped by threat classification, that Microsoft Sentinel detects using the Fusion correlation engine.

Since [Fusion](fusion.md) correlates multiple signals from various products to detect advanced multistage attacks, successful Fusion detections are presented as **Fusion incidents** on the Microsoft Sentinel **Incidents** page and not as **alerts**, and are stored in the *Incidents* table in **Logs** and not in the *SecurityAlerts* table.

In order to enable these Fusion-powered attack detection scenarios, any data sources listed must be ingested to your Log Analytics workspace. For scenarios with scheduled analytics rules, follow the instructions in [Configure scheduled analytics rules for Fusion detections](configure-fusion-rules.md#configure-scheduled-analytics-rules-for-fusion-detections).

> [!NOTE]
> Some of these scenarios are in **PREVIEW**. They will be so indicated.


## Compute resource abuse

<a name='multiple-vm-creation-activities-following-suspicious-azure-active-directory-sign-in'></a>

### Multiple VM creation activities following suspicious Microsoft Entra sign-in
This scenario is currently in **PREVIEW**.

**MITRE ATT&CK tactics:** Initial Access, Impact 

**MITRE ATT&CK techniques:** Valid Account (T1078), Resource Hijacking (T1496)

**Data connector sources:** Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, Microsoft Entra ID Protection

**Description:** Fusion incidents of this type indicate that an anomalous number of VMs were created in a single session following a suspicious sign-in to a Microsoft Entra account. This type of alert indicates, with a high degree of confidence, that the account noted in the Fusion incident description has been compromised and used to create new VMs for unauthorized purposes, such as running crypto mining operations. The permutations of suspicious Microsoft Entra sign-in alerts with the multiple VM creation activities alert are:

- **Impossible travel to an atypical location leading to multiple VM creation activities**

- **Sign-in event from an unfamiliar location leading to multiple VM creation activities**

- **Sign-in event from an infected device leading to multiple VM creation activities**

- **Sign-in event from an anonymous IP address leading to multiple VM creation activities**

- **Sign-in event from user with leaked credentials leading to multiple VM creation activities**


## Credential access
(New threat classification)

### Multiple passwords reset by user following suspicious sign-in
This scenario makes use of alerts produced by **scheduled analytics rules**.

This scenario is currently in **PREVIEW**.

**MITRE ATT&CK tactics:** Initial Access, Credential Access

**MITRE ATT&CK techniques:** Valid Account (T1078), Brute Force (T1110)

**Data connector sources:** Microsoft Sentinel (scheduled analytics rule), Microsoft Entra ID Protection

**Description:** Fusion incidents of this type indicate that a user reset multiple passwords following a suspicious sign-in to a Microsoft Entra account. This evidence suggests that the account noted in the Fusion incident description has been compromised and was used to perform multiple password resets in order to gain access to multiple systems and resources. Account manipulation (including password reset) may aid adversaries in maintaining access to credentials and certain permission levels within an environment. The permutations of suspicious Microsoft Entra sign-in alerts with multiple passwords reset alerts are:

- **Impossible travel to an atypical location leading to multiple passwords reset**

- **Sign-in event from an unfamiliar location leading to multiple passwords reset**

- **Sign-in event from an infected device leading to multiple passwords reset**

- **Sign-in event from an anonymous IP leading to multiple passwords reset**

- **Sign-in event from user with leaked credentials leading to multiple passwords reset**

<a name='suspicious-sign-in-coinciding-with-successful-sign-in-to-palo-alto-vpn-by-ip-with-multiple-failed-azure-ad-sign-ins'></a>

**Description:** Fusion incidents of this type indicate that an outbound connection request was made via a PowerShell command, and following that, anomalous inbound activity was detected by the Palo Alto Networks Firewall. This evidence suggests that an attacker has likely gained access to your network and is trying to perform malicious actions. Connection attempts by PowerShell that follow this pattern could be an indication of malware command and control activity, requests for the download of additional malware, or an attacker establishing remote interactive access. As with all “living off the land” attacks, this activity could be a legitimate use of PowerShell. However, the PowerShell command execution followed by suspicious inbound Firewall activity increases the confidence that PowerShell is being used in a malicious manner and should be investigated further. In Palo Alto logs, Microsoft Sentinel focuses on [threat logs](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/8-1/pan-os-admin/monitoring/view-and-manage-logs/log-types-and-severity-levels/threat-logs), and traffic is considered suspicious when threats are allowed (suspicious data, files, floods, packets, scans, spyware, URLs, viruses, vulnerabilities, wildfire-viruses, wildfires). Also reference the Palo Alto Threat Log corresponding to the [Threat/Content Type](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/8-1/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/threat-log-fields.html) listed in the Fusion incident description for additional alert details.

### Suspicious remote WMI execution followed by anomalous traffic flagged by Palo Alto Networks firewall
This scenario is currently in **PREVIEW**.

**MITRE ATT&CK tactics:** Execution, Discovery

**MITRE ATT&CK techniques:** Windows Management Instrumentation (T1047)

**Data connector sources:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (formerly MDATP), Microsoft Sentinel (scheduled analytics rule)

**Description:** Fusion incidents of this type indicate that Windows Management Interface (WMI) commands were remotely executed on a system, and following that, suspicious inbound activity was detected by the Palo Alto Networks Firewall. This evidence suggests that an attacker may have gained access to your network and is attempting to move laterally, escalate privileges, and/or execute malicious payloads. As with all “living off the land” attacks, this activity could be a legitimate use of WMI. However, the remote WMI command execution followed by suspicious inbound Firewall activity increases the confidence that WMI is being used in a malicious manner and should be investigated further. In Palo Alto logs, Microsoft Sentinel focuses on [threat logs](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/8-1/pan-os-admin/monitoring/view-and-manage-logs/log-types-and-severity-levels/threat-logs), and traffic is considered suspicious when threats are allowed (suspicious data, files, floods, packets, scans, spyware, URLs, viruses, vulnerabilities, wildfire-viruses, wildfires). Also reference the Palo Alto Threat Log corresponding to the [Threat/Content Type](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/8-1/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/threat-log-fields.html) listed in the Fusion incident description for additional alert details.

### Suspicious PowerShell command line following suspicious sign-in
