# Microsoft Sentinel in the Microsoft Defender portal

Microsoft Defender provides a unified cybersecurity solution that integrates endpoint protection, cloud security, identity protection, email security, threat intelligence, exposure management, and SIEM into a centralized platform. It uses AI-driven defense to help organizations anticipate and stop attacks, ensuring efficient and effective security operations.

Microsoft Sentinel is generally available in the Microsoft Defender portal, either with [Microsoft Defender XDR](/microsoft-365/security/defender), or on its own, delivering a unified experience across SIEM and XDR for faster and more accurate threat detection and response, simplified workflows, and enhanced operational efficiency.

This article describes the Microsoft Sentinel experience in the Defender portal. We recommend that customers using Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal move into Microsoft Defender to take advantage of the unified security operations available and the latest capabilities. For more information, see [Transition your Microsoft Sentinel environment to the Defender portal](move-to-defender.md).


## New and improved capabilities

The following table describes the new or improved capabilities available in the Defender portal with the integration of Microsoft Sentinel. Microsoft continues to innovate in this new experience with features that might be exclusive to the Defender portal.

| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ---------- |
| **Streamlined operations** | Manage all security incidents, alerts, and investigations from a single, unified interface.<br><br>- **Unified entity pages** for devices, users, IP addresses, and Azure resources in the Defender portal display information from Microsoft Sentinel and Defender data sources. These entity pages give you an expanded context for your investigations of incidents and alerts in the Defender portal.<br><br>- **Unified incidents** let you manage and investigate security incidents in a single location and from a single queue in the Defender portal. Use Security Copilot to summarize, respond, and report. Unified incidents include data from the breadth of sources, AI analytics tools of security information and event management (SIEM), and context and mitigation tools offered by extended detection and response (XDR).<br><br>- Use **Advanced hunting** to query from a single portal across different data sets to make hunting more efficient and remove the need for context-switching. Use Security Copilot to help generate your KQL, view and query all data including data from Microsoft security services and Microsoft Sentinel, and then use all your existing Microsoft Sentinel workspace content, including queries and functions, to investigate. | - [Investigate entities with entity pages in Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/entity-pages)<br><br>-  [Incident response in the Microsoft Defender portal](/microsoft-365/security/defender/incidents-overview)<br><br>- [Investigate Microsoft Sentinel incidents in Security Copilot](sentinel-security-copilot.md)<br><br>- [Advanced hunting in the Microsoft Defender portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2264410)<br>[Security Copilot in advanced hunting](/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-security-copilot) |

## Limited or unavailable capabilities with Microsoft Sentinel only in the Defender portal

When you onboard Microsoft Sentinel to the Defender portal without Defender XDR or other services enabled, the following capabilities are limited or unavailable:

- [Microsoft Security Exposure Management](/security-exposure-management/)
- [Custom detection rules](/defender-xdr/custom-detections-overview), provided by Microsoft Defender XDR
- The [Action center](/defender-xdr/m365d-action-center), provided by Microsoft Defender XDR

## Quick reference

Some Microsoft Sentinel capabilities, like the unified incident queue, are integrated with Microsoft Defender XDR in the Defender portal. Many other Microsoft Sentinel capabilities are available in the **Microsoft Sentinel** section of the Defender portal.

The following image shows the  Microsoft Sentinel  menu in the Defender portal:
