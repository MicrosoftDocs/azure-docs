# Monitor the health and audit the integrity of your analytics rules

To ensure comprehensive, uninterrupted, and tampering-free threat detection in your Microsoft Sentinel service, keep track of your analytics rules' health and integrity and keep them functioning optimally, by monitoring their [execution insights](monitor-optimize-analytics-rule-execution.md#view-analytics-rule-insights), by querying the health and audit logs, and by [using manual rerun to test and optimize your rules](monitor-optimize-analytics-rule-execution.md#use-cases-and-benefits-of-rule-rerun).

Set up notifications of health and audit events for relevant stakeholders, who can then take action. For example, define and send email or Microsoft Teams messages, create new tickets in your ticketing system, and so on.

This article describes how to use Microsoft Sentinel's [auditing and health monitoring features](health-audit.md) to keep track of your analytics rules' health and integrity from within Microsoft Sentinel.

For information on rule insights and manual rerunning of rules, see [Monitor and optimize the execution of your scheduled analytics rules](monitor-optimize-analytics-rule-execution.md).

> The *SentinelHealth* and *SentinelAudit* data tables are currently in **PREVIEW**. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Summary

- **Microsoft Sentinel analytics rule health logs:**

    - This log captures events that record the running of analytics rules, and the end result of these runnings&mdash;if they succeeded or failed, and if they failed, why. 
    - The log also records, for each running of an analytics rule: 
        - How many events were captured by the rule's query.
        - Whether the number of events passed the threshold defined in the rule, causing the rule to fire an alert.

    These logs are collected in the *SentinelHealth* table in Log Analytics.
    
- **Microsoft Sentinel analytics rule audit logs:**

    - This log captures events that record changes made to any analytics rule, including the following details:
        - The name of the rule that was changed.
        - Which properties of the rule were changed.
        - The state of the rule settings before and after the change.
        - The user or identity that made the change.
        - The source IP and date/time of the change.
        - ...and more.
    
    These logs are collected in the *SentinelAudit* table in Log Analytics.

## Use the SentinelHealth and SentinelAudit data tables (Preview)

To get audit and health data from the tables described above, you must first turn on the Microsoft Sentinel health feature for your workspace. For more information, see [Turn on auditing and health monitoring for Microsoft Sentinel](enable-monitoring.md).

Once the health feature is turned on, the *SentinelHealth* data table is created at the first success or failure event generated for your automation rules and playbooks.

### Understanding SentinelHealth and SentinelAudit table events

The following types of analytics rule health events are logged in the *SentinelHealth* table:

- **Scheduled analytics rule run**.

- **NRT analytics rule run**.

    For more information, see [SentinelHealth table columns schema](health-table-reference.md#sentinelhealth-table-columns-schema).

The following types of analytics rule audit events are logged in the *SentinelAudit* table:

- **Create or update analytics rule**.

- **Analytics rule deleted**.

    For more information, see [SentinelAudit table columns schema](audit-table-reference.md#sentinelaudit-table-columns-schema).

### Run queries to detect health and integrity issues

For best results, you should build your queries on the **pre-built functions** on these tables, ***_SentinelHealth()*** and ***_SentinelAudit()***, instead of querying the tables directly. These functions ensure the maintenance of your queries' backward compatibility in the event of changes being made to the schema of the tables themselves.

As a first step, your queries should filter the tables for data related to analytics rules. Use the `SentinelResourceType` parameter.

```kusto
_SentinelHealth()
| where SentinelResourceType == "Analytics Rule"
```

If you want, you can further filter the list for a particular kind of analytics rule. Use the `SentinelResourceKind` parameter for this.

```kusto
| where SentinelResourceKind == "Scheduled"

# OR

| where SentinelResourceKind == "NRT"
```

Here are some sample queries to help you get started:

- Find rules that didn't run successfully:

    ```kusto
    _SentinelHealth()
    | where SentinelResourceType == "Analytics Rule"
    | where Status != "Success"
    ``` 

- Find rules that have been "[auto-disabled](troubleshoot-analytics-rules.md#issue-a-scheduled-rule-failed-to-execute-or-appears-with-auto-disabled-added-to-the-name)":

    ```kusto
    _SentinelHealth()
    | where SentinelResourceType == "Analytics Rule"
    | where Reason == "The analytics rule is disabled and was not executed."
    ``` 

- Count the rules and runnings that succeeded or failed, by reason:

    ```kusto
    _SentinelHealth()
    | where SentinelResourceType == "Analytics Rule"
    | summarize Occurrence=count(), Unique_rule=dcount(SentinelResourceId) by Status, Reason
    ``` 
 
- Find rule deletion activity:

    ```kusto
    _SentinelAudit()
    | where SentinelResourceType =="Analytic Rule"
    | where Description =="Analytics rule deleted"
    ```

- Find activity on rules, by rule name and activity name:

    ```kusto
    _SentinelAudit()
    | where SentinelResourceType =="Analytic Rule"
    | summarize Count= count() by RuleName=SentinelResourceName, Activity=Description
    ```

- Find activity on rules, by caller name (the identity that performed the activity):

    ```kusto
    _SentinelAudit()
    | where SentinelResourceType =="Analytic Rule"
    | extend Caller= tostring(ExtendedProperties.CallerName)
    | summarize Count = count() by Caller, Activity=Description
    ```

 See more information on the following items used in the preceding examples, in the Kusto documentation:
- [***where*** operator](/kusto/query/where-operator?view=microsoft-sentinel&preserve-view=true)
- [***summarize*** operator](/kusto/query/summarize-operator?view=microsoft-sentinel&preserve-view=true)
- [***tostring()*** function](/kusto/query/tostring-function?view=microsoft-sentinel&preserve-view=true)
- [***count()*** aggregation function](/kusto/query/count-aggregation-function?view=microsoft-sentinel&preserve-view=true)
- [***dcount()*** aggregation function](/kusto/query/dcount-aggregation-function?view=microsoft-sentinel&preserve-view=true)

### Statuses, errors and suggested steps

For either **Scheduled analytics rule run** or **NRT analytics rule run**, you may see any of the following statuses and descriptions:
- **Success**: Rule executed successfully, generating `<n>` alert(s).

- **Success**: Rule executed successfully, but did not reach the threshold (`<n>`) required to generate an alert.

- **Failure**: These are the possible descriptions for rule failure, and what you can do about them.
