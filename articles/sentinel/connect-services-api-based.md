# Connect Microsoft Sentinel to other Microsoft services with an API-based data connector

This article describes how to make API-based connections to Microsoft Sentinel. Microsoft Sentinel uses the Azure foundation to provide built-in, service-to-service support for data ingestion from many Azure and Microsoft 365 services, Amazon Web Services, and various Windows Server services. There are a few different methods through which these connections are made.

This article presents information that is common to the group of API-based data connectors.

## Connect to Microsoft services via API-based connectors

1. From the Microsoft Sentinel navigation menu, select **Data connectors**.

1. Select your service from the data connectors gallery, and then select **Open Connector Page** on the preview pane.

1. Select **Connect** to start streaming events and/or alerts from your service into Microsoft Sentinel.

1. If on the connector page there is a section titled **Create incidents - recommended!**, select **Enable** if you want to automatically create incidents from alerts.

You can find and query the data for each service using the table names that appear in the section for the service's connector in the [Data connectors reference](data-connectors-reference.md) page.
