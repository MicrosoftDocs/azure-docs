# About Microsoft Sentinel Out-of-the-box content

Microsoft Sentinel *content* is Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution components that enable customers to ingest data, monitor, alert, hunt, investigate, respond, and connect with different products, platforms, and services.

Content in Microsoft Sentinel includes any of the following types:

- **[Data connectors](connect-data-sources.md)** provide log ingestion from different sources into Microsoft Sentinel
- **[Parsers](normalization-about-parsers.md)** provide log formatting/transformation into [Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM)](normalization.md) formats, supporting usage across various Microsoft Sentinel content types and scenarios
- **[Workbooks](get-visibility.md)** provide monitoring, visualization, and interactivity with data in Microsoft Sentinel, highlighting meaningful insights for users
- **[Analytics rules](detect-threats-built-in.md)** provide alerts that point to relevant SOC actions via incidents
- **[Hunting queries](hunting.md)** are used by SOC teams to proactively hunt for threats in Microsoft Sentinel
- **[Notebooks](notebooks.md)** help SOC teams use advanced hunting features in Jupyter and Azure Notebooks
- **[Watchlists](watchlists.md)** support the ingestion of *specific* data for enhanced threat detection and reduced alert fatigue
- **[Playbooks and Azure Logic Apps custom connectors](automate-responses-with-playbooks.md)** provide features for automated investigation, remediation, and response scenarios in Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft Sentinel offers these content types as *solutions* and *standalone* items. *Solutions* are packages of Microsoft Sentinel content or Microsoft Sentinel API integrations, which fulfill an end-to-end product, domain, or industry vertical scenario in Microsoft Sentinel. Both solutions and standalone items are discoverable and managed from the Content hub.

You can either customize out-of-the-box (OOTB) content for your own needs, or you can create your own solution with content to share with others in the community. For more information, see the [Microsoft Sentinel Solutions Build Guide](https://aka.ms/sentinelsolutionsbuildguide) for solutions' authoring and publishing.

## Discover and manage Microsoft Sentinel content

Use the Microsoft Sentinel **Content hub** to centrally discover and install out-of-the-box (OOTB) content.

The Microsoft Sentinel Content hub provides in-product discoverability, single-step deployment, and enablement of end-to-end product, domain, and/or vertical OOTB solutions and content in Microsoft Sentinel.

- Filter by [categories](#categories-for-microsoft-sentinel-out-of-the-box-content-and-solutions) and other parameters, or use the powerful text search, to find the content that works best for your organization's needs. 

   The **Content hub** also indicates the [support model](#support-models-for-microsoft-sentinel-out-of-the-box-content-and-solutions) applied to each piece of content, as some content is maintained by Microsoft and others are maintained by partners or the community.

- Manage updates for out-of-the-box content in the **Content hub**. Or, for custom content, manage updates from the **Repositories** page. For more information, see [Discover and manage Microsoft Sentinel out-of-the-box content](sentinel-solutions-deploy.md).

- Customize out-of-the-box content for your own needs, or create custom content, including analytics rules, hunting queries, notebooks, workbooks, and more. 

  Manage your custom content directly in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace by using the Microsoft Sentinel API or from your own source control repository. For more information, see [Microsoft Sentinel API](/rest/api/securityinsights/) and [Deploy custom content from your repository](ci-cd.md).

### Why content hub solutions?

Microsoft Sentinel *solutions* are packaged integrations that deliver end-to-end product value for one or more domain or vertical scenarios in the content hub.

The solutions experience, powered by [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace), helps you discover and deploy the content you want. For more information on authoring and publishing solutions in the Azure Marketplace, see the [Microsoft Sentinel Solutions Build Guide](https://aka.ms/sentinelsolutionsbuildguide).

- **Packaged content** are collections of one or more components of Microsoft Sentinel content, such as data connectors, workbooks, analytics rules, playbooks, hunting queries, watchlists, parsers, and more.

- **Integrations** include services or tools built using Microsoft Sentinel or Azure Log Analytics APIs that support integrations between Azure and existing customer applications, or migrate data, queries, and more, from those applications into Microsoft Sentinel.

You can also use solutions to install packages of out-of-the-box (OOTB) content in a single step, where the content is often ready to use immediately. Providers and partners use Sentinel solutions to add value to their customers' investments by delivering combined product, domain, or vertical value.

Use the Content hub to centrally discover and deploy solutions and OOTB content in a scenario-driven manner.
