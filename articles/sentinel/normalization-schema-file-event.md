#Customer intent: As a security analyst, I want to understand the ASIM File Event normalization schema so that I can effectively monitor and analyze file activity across different systems.

# The Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) File Event normalization schema reference (Public preview)

The File Event normalization schema is used to describe file activity such as creating, modifying, or deleting files or documents. Such events are reported by operating systems, file storage systems such as Azure Files, and document management systems such as Microsoft SharePoint.

For more information about normalization in Microsoft Sentinel, see [Normalization and the Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM)](normalization.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The File Event normalization schema is currently in PREVIEW. This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and is not recommended for production workloads.
>
> The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Parsers

### Deploying and using file activity parsers

Deploy the ASIM File Activity parsers from the [Microsoft Sentinel GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/DeployASIM). To query across all File Activity sources, use the unifying parser `imFileEvent` as the table name in your query. 

For more information about using ASIM parsers, see the [ASIM parsers overview](normalization-parsers-overview.md).
For the list of the file activity parsers Microsoft Sentinel provides out-of-the-box refer to the [ASIM parsers list](normalization-parsers-list.md#file-activity-parsers) 

### Add your own normalized parsers

When implementing custom parsers for the File Event information model, name your KQL functions using the following syntax: `imFileEvent<vendor><Product`.

Refer to the article [Managing ASIM parsers](normalization-manage-parsers.md) to learn how to add your custom parsers to the file activity  unifying parser.


## Normalized content

For a full list of analytics rules that use normalized File Activity events, see [File Activity security content](normalization-content.md#file-activity-security-content).

## Schema overview

The File Event information model is aligned to the [OSSEM Process entity schema](https://github.com/OTRF/OSSEM/blob/master/docs/cdm/entities/file.md).

The File Event schema references the following entities, which are central to file activities:

- **Actor**. The user that initiated the file activity
- **ActingProcess**. The process used by the Actor to initiate the file activity
- **TargetFile**. The file on which the operation was performed
- **Source File (SrcFile)**. Stores file information prior to the operation.

The relationship between these entities is best demonstrated as follows: An **Actor** performs a file operation using an **Acting Process**, which modifies the **Source File** to **Target File**. 

For example: `JohnDoe` (**Actor**) uses `Windows File Explorer` (**Acting process**) to rename `new.doc` (**Source File**) to `old.doc` (**Target File**).

|Type  |Example  |Notes  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Windows Local**     |   `C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe`      |      Since Windows path names are case insensitive, this type implies that the value is case insensitive.   |
