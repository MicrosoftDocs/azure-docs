# Tutorial: Detect threats by using analytics rules in Microsoft Sentinel

As a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) service, Microsoft Sentinel is responsible for detecting security threats to your organization. It does this by analyzing the massive volumes of data generated by all of your systems' logs.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up a Microsoft Sentinel analytics rule from a template to search for exploits of the Apache Log4j vulnerability across your environment. The rule will frame user accounts and IP addresses found in your logs as trackable entities, surface notable pieces of information in the alerts generated by the rules, and package alerts as incidents to be investigated.

When you complete this tutorial, you'll be able to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Create an analytics rule from a template
> - Customize a rule's query and settings
> - Configure the three types of alert enrichment
> - Choose automated threat responses for your rules


## Prerequisites

## Sign in to the Azure portal and Microsoft Sentinel

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. From the Search bar, search for and select **Microsoft Sentinel**.

1. Search for and select your workspace from the list of available Microsoft Sentinel workspaces.

## Install a solution from the content hub

1. In Microsoft Sentinel, on the left-hand side menu under **Content management**, select **Content hub**.


1. Search for and select the solution **Log4j Vulnerability Detection**.

1. From the toolbar at the top of the page, select :::image type="icon" source="media/tutorial-log4j-detection/install-update-button.png"::: **Install/Update**.

## Create a scheduled analytics rule from a template

1. In Microsoft Sentinel, on the left-hand side menu under **Configuration**, select **Analytics**.

1. From the **Analytics** page, select the **Rule templates** tab.

1. In the search field at the top of the list of rule templates, enter **log4j**.

1. From the filtered list of templates, select **Log4j vulnerability exploit aka Log4Shell IP IOC**. From the details pane, select **Create rule**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-log4j-detection/find-template-create-rule.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to search for and locate template and create analytics rule." lightbox="media/tutorial-log4j-detection/find-template-create-rule.png":::

    The **Analytics rule wizard** will open.

1. In the **General** tab, in the **Name** field, enter **Log4j vulnerability exploit aka Log4Shell IP IOC - Tutorial-1**.

1. Leave the rest of the fields on this page as they are. These are the defaults, but we will add customization to the alert name at a later stage.

    If you don’t want the rule to run immediately, select **Disabled**, and the rule will be added to your **Active rules** tab and you can enable it from there when you need it.

1. Select **Next : Set rule logic**.
   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-log4j-detection/general-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the General tab of the Analytics rule wizard.":::

## Review rule query logic and configuration of settings

- In the **Set rule logic** tab, review the query as it appears under the **Rule query** heading. 

    To see more of the query text at one time, select the diagonal double-arrow icon at the upper right corner of the query window to expand the window to a larger size.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-log4j-detection/set-rule-logic-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Set rule logic tab of the Analytics rule wizard." lightbox="media/tutorial-log4j-detection/set-rule-logic-tab.png":::

## Enrich alerts with entities and other details

1. Under **Alert enrichment**, keep the **Entity mapping** settings as they are. Note the three mapped entities.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-log4j-detection/entity-mappings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of existing entity mapping settings.":::

1. In the **Custom details** section, let's add the timestamp of each occurrence to the alert, so you can see it right in the alert details, without having to drill down.
    1. Type **timestamp** in the **Key** field. This will be the property name in the alert.
    1. Select **timestamp** from the **Value** drop-down list.

1. In the **Alert details** section, let's customize the alert name so that the timestamp of each occurrence appears in the alert title.

    In the **Alert name format** field, enter **Log4j vulnerability exploit aka Log4Shell IP IOC at {{timestamp}}**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-log4j-detection/custom-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of custom details and alert details configurations.":::

## Review remaining settings

1. Review the remaining settings on the **Set rule logic** tab. There's no need to change anything, though you can if you'd like to change the interval, for example. Just make sure that the lookback period matches the interval in order to maintain continuous coverage.

    - **Query scheduling:**
        - Run query every **1 hour**.
        - Lookup data from the last **1 hour**.

    - **Alert threshold:**
        - Generate alert when number of query results **is greater than 0**.

    - **Event grouping:**
        - Configure how rule query results are grouped into alerts: **Group all events into a single alert**.

    - **Suppression:**
        - Stop running query after alert is generated: **Off**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-log4j-detection/remaining-rule-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of remaining rule logic settings for analytics rule.":::

1. Select **Next : Incident settings**.

## Review the incident creation settings

1. Review the settings on the **Incident settings** tab. There's no need to change anything, unless, for example, you have a different system for incident creation and management, in which case you'd want to disable incident creation.

    - **Incident settings:**
        - Create incidents from alerts triggered by this analytics rule: **Enabled**.

    - **Alert grouping:**
        - Group related alerts, triggered by this analytics rule, into incidents: **Disabled**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-log4j-detection/incident-settings-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Incident settings tab of the Analytics rule wizard.":::

1. Select **Next : Automated response**.

## Set automated responses and create the rule

In the **Automated response** tab:

1. Select **+ Add new** to create a new automation rule for this analytics rule. This will open the **Create new automation rule** wizard.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-log4j-detection/add-automation-rule.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Automated response tab in Analytics rule wizard.":::

1. In the **Automation rule name** field, enter **Log4J vulnerability exploit detection - Tutorial-1**.

1. Leave the **Trigger** and **Conditions** sections as they are.

1. Under **Actions**, select **Add tags** from the drop-down list.
    1. Select **+ Add tag**.
    1. Enter **Log4J exploit** in the text box and select **OK**.

1. Leave the **Rule expiration** and **Order** sections as they are.

1. Select **Apply**. You'll soon see your new automation rule in the list in the **Automated response** tab.

1. Select **Next : Review** to review all the settings for your new analytics rule. When the "Validation passed" message appears, select **Create**. Unless you set the rule to **Disabled** in the **General** tab above, the rule will run immediately.

    Select the image below for a display of the full review (most of the query text was clipped for viewability).

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-log4j-detection/review-and-create-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Review and Create tab of the Analytics rule wizard.":::

## Verify the success of the rule
  
1. To view the results of the alert rules you create, go to the **Incidents** page.

1. To filter the list of incidents to those generated by your analytics rule, enter the name (or part of the name) of the analytics rule you created in the **Search** bar.

1. Open an incident whose title matches the name of the analytics rule. See that the flag you defined in the automation rule was applied to the incident.

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this analytics rule, delete (or at least disable) the analytics and automation rules you created with the following steps:

1. In the **Analytics** page, select the **Active rules** tab.

1. Enter the name (or part of the name) of the analytics rule you created in the **Search** bar.  
    (If it doesn't show up, make sure any filters are set to **Select all**.)

1. Mark the check box next to your rule in the list, and select **Delete** from the top banner.  
    (If you don't want to delete it, you can select **Disable** instead.)

1. In the **Automation** page, select the **Automation rules** tab.

1. Enter the name (or part of the name) of the automation rule you created in the **Search** bar.  
    (If it doesn't show up, make sure any filters are set to **Select all**.)

1. Mark the check box next to your automation rule in the list, and select **Delete** from the top banner.  
    (If you don't want to delete it, you can select **Disable** instead.)
