# Enable data connector for Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence
Bring public, open source and high fidelity indicators of compromise (IOC) generated by Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (MDTI) into your Microsoft Sentinel workspace with the MDTI data connectors. With a simple one-click setup, use the TI from the standard and premium MDTI data connectors to monitor, alert and hunt.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence data connector and the Premium Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence data connector are currently in PREVIEW. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

For more information about the benefits of the standard and premium MDTI data connectors, see [Understand threat intelligence](understand-threat-intelligence.md#add-threat-indicators-to-microsoft-sentinel-with-the-microsoft-defender-threat-intelligence-data-connector).

## Prerequisites
- In order to install, update and delete standalone content or solutions in content hub, you need the **Microsoft Sentinel Contributor** role at the resource group level.
- To configure these data connectors, you must have read and write permissions to the Microsoft Sentinel workspace.

## Install the Threat Intelligence solution in Microsoft Sentinel

To import threat indicators into Microsoft Sentinel from standard and premium MDTI, follow these steps:

1. For Microsoft Sentinel in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), under **Content management**, select **Content hub**. <br>For Microsoft Sentinel in the [Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/), select **Microsoft Sentinel** > **Content management** > **Content hub**.
