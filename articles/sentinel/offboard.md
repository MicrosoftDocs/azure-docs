# Remove Microsoft Sentinel from your Log Analytics workspace

If you no longer want to use Microsoft Sentinel, this article explains how to remove it from your Log Analytics workspace.

If you instead want to offboard Microsoft Sentinel from the Defender portal, see [Offboard Microsoft Sentinel](/defender-xdr/microsoft-sentinel-onboard?#offboard-microsoft-sentinel).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, review [Implications of removing Microsoft Sentinel from your workspace](offboard-implications.md).

## Remove Microsoft Sentinel

Complete the following steps to remove Microsoft Sentinel from your Log Analytics workspace.

1. Before removing Sentinel, note that you will no longer have visibility to manage Sentinel tables, such as setting extended data retention, in the Log Analytics Tables UI. Please consider per-table retention to 90 days or less to avoid data retention charges for the Sentinel data that Log Analytics will store, but which you can no longer access after Sentinel is removed. 

1. For Microsoft Sentinel in the [Azure portal](https://portal.microsoft.com), under **Configuration**, select **Settings**.<br>On the **Settings** page, select the **Settings** tab. <br><br> For Microsoft Sentinel in the [Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/), select **System** > **Settings** > **Microsoft Sentinel**.

1. Select **Remove Microsoft Sentinel**.

## Clean up resources in the Azure portal (optional)

If you don't want to keep the workspace and the data collected for Microsoft Sentinel, delete the resources associated with the workspace in the Azure portal.


- Delete just the individual resources within the associated resource group that you no longer need. For more information, see [Delete resource](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/delete-resource-group?tabs=azure-portal#delete-resource).
- Or, if you don't need any of the resources in the associated resource group, delete the resource group. For more information, see [Delete resource group](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/delete-resource-group?tabs=azure-portal).
