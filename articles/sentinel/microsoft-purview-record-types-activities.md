# Microsoft Purview Information Protection connector reference - audit log record types and activities support

This article lists supported audit log record types and activities when using the Microsoft Purview Information Protection connector with Microsoft Sentinel.

When you use the [Microsoft Purview Information Protection connector](connect-microsoft-purview.md), you stream audit logs into the  
`MicrosoftPurviewInformationProtection` standardized table. Data is 
gathered through the [Office Management API](/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-schema), which uses a structured schema.
