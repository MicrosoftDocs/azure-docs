# Azure Sentinel solutions catalog

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Azure Sentinel solutions experience is currently in **PREVIEW**, as are all individual solution packages. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

[Azure Sentinel solutions](sentinel-solutions.md) provide a consolidated way to acquire Azure Sentinel content - like data connectors, workbooks, analytics, and automation - in your workspace with a single deployment step.

##  Currently available solutions

The following solutions are now available from Azure Sentinel. They are all free to install, though usual charges apply for data ingestion, Logic Apps use, and so on.


| Solution | Description |
| - | - |
| **Azure Firewall Solution for Sentinel** | Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. It's a fully stateful firewall-as-a-service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability.  This Azure Firewall solution in Sentinel provides built-in customizable threat detection on top of Azure Sentinel. The solution contains a workbook, detections, hunting queries and playbooks. |
| **Azure Sentinel 4 Dynamics 365** | The Continuous Threat Monitoring for Dynamics 365 solution provides you with ability to collect Dynamics 365 logs, gain visibility of activities within Dynamics 365 and analyze them to detect threats and malicious activities. The solution includes a data connector, workbooks, analytics rules, and hunting queries. |
| **Azure Sentinel for SQL PaaS**| This solution provides built-in customizable threat detection for Azure SQL PaaS services on top of Azure Sentinel, based on SQL Audit log and with seamless integration to alerts from Azure Defender for SQL.|
| **Azure Sentinel for Teams** | Teams serves a central role in both communication and data sharing in the Microsoft 365 Cloud. Because the Teams service touches on so many underlying technologies in the Cloud, it can benefit from human and automated analysis not only when it comes to hunting in logs, but also in real-time monitoring of meetings. Azure Sentinel offers admins these solutions. The solution includes analytics rules, hunting queries, and playbooks. |
| **Box Solution** | [Box](https://www.box.com/overview) is a single, secure, easy-to-use platform built for the entire content lifecycle, from file creation and sharing, to co-editing, signature, classification, and retention. |
|**Checkpoint Azure Sentinel Solutions** |The Check Point Logic App Connector and Playbooks allow customers to easily find and deploy pre-packaged Check Point connectors and playbooks directly from Azure Sentinel. Users can configure Azure Sentinel’s SOAR playbooks to automatically remediate threats using CloudGuard security gateways and on-premises Check Point Gateways, enhancing the security functionality of both Microsoft Azure and of Check Point CloudGuard. <br><br>The Check Point Logic App Connector and Playbooks can also provide automated remediation. Customers can configure SOAR playbooks to automatically trigger Check Point CloudGuard security gateways to update security policies, block malicious traffic, and more. By taking advantage of the Check Point Management API, the connector can automate these security operations tasks, which can be not only a time-saver for IT staff, network administrators, and security personnel, but also dramatically reduces the window that attackers can take advantage of security issues—because those problems don’t have to be fixed manually. This can help minimize the organization’s attack surface while saving hours of time for Network and Security Administrators, Security Analysts, DevOps/DevSecOps teams, and more. The pre-defined playbooks will also eliminate the need to write individual API calls and can easily integrate Check Point playbooks with all native Azure services and hundreds of existing logic app connectors. |
