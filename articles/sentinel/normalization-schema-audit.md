#Customer intent: As a security analyst, I want to understand the ASIM Audit Events normalization schema so that I can effectively monitor and analyze audit trails across various information systems.

# The Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) Audit Events normalization schema reference (Public preview)

The Microsoft Sentinel Audit events normalization schema represents events associated with the audit trail of information systems. The audit trail logs system configuration activities and policy changes. Such changes are often performed by system administrators, but can also be performed by users when configuring the settings of their own applications.

Every system logs audit events alongside its core activity logs. For example, a Firewall will log events about the network sessions is processes, and audit events about configuration changes applied to the Firewall itself.

For more information about normalization in Microsoft Sentinel, see [Normalization and the Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM)](normalization.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Audit Event normalization schema is currently in *preview*. This feature is provided without a service level agreement. We don't recommend it for production workloads.

## Schema overview

The main fields of an audit event are:
- The object, which may be, for example, a managed resource or policy rule, that the event focuses on, represented by the field [Object](#object). The field [ObjectType](#objecttype) specifies the type of the object.
- The application context of the object, represented by the field [TargetAppName](#targetappname), which is aliased by [Application](#application).
- The operation performed on the object, represented by the fields [EventType](#eventtype) and [Operation](#operation). While [Operation](#operation) is the value the source reported, [EventType](#eventtype) is a normalized version that is more consistent across sources.
- The old and new values for the object, if applicable, represented by [OldValue](#oldvalue) and [NewValue](#newvalue) respectively.

Audit events also reference the following entities, which are involved in the configuration operation:

- **Actor** - The user performing the configuration operation.
- **TargetApp** - The application or system for which the configuration operation applies.
- **Target** - The system on which **TargetApp*** is running.
- **ActingApp** - The application used by the **Actor** to perform the configuration operation.
- **Src** - The system used by the **Actor** to initiate the configuration operation, if different than **Target**.

The descriptor `Dvc` is used for the reporting device, which is the local system for sessions reported by an endpoint, and the intermediary or security device in other cases. 


## Parsers

### Deploying and using audit events parsers

Deploy the ASIM audit events parsers from the [Microsoft Sentinel GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/DeployASIM). To query across all audit event sources, use the unifying parser `imAuditEvent` as the table name in your query. 

For more information about using ASIM parsers, see the [ASIM parsers overview](normalization-parsers-overview.md).
For the list of the audit event parsers Microsoft Sentinel provides out-of-the-box refer to the [ASIM parsers list](normalization-parsers-list.md#audit-event-parsers) 

### Add your own normalized parsers

When implementing custom parsers for the File Event information model, name your KQL functions using the following syntax: `imAuditEvent<vendor><Product>`. Refer to the article [Managing ASIM parsers](normalization-manage-parsers.md) to learn how to add your custom parsers to the audit event unifying parser.

### Filtering parser parameters

The audit events parsers support [filtering parameters](normalization-about-parsers.md#optimizing-parsing-using-parameters). While these parameters are optional, they can improve your query performance.

The following filtering parameters are available:

| Name     | Type      | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **starttime** | datetime | Filter only events that ran at or after this time. This parameter uses the `TimeGenerated` field as the time designator of the event. |
| **endtime** | datetime | Filter only events queries that finished running at or before this time. This parameter uses the `TimeGenerated` field as the time designator of the event. |
| **srcipaddr_has_any_prefix** | dynamic | Filter only events from this source IP address, as represented in the [SrcIpAddr](#srcipaddr) field. |
| **eventtype_in**| string | Filter only events in which the event type, as represented in the [EventType](#eventtype) field is any of the terms provided. |
| **eventresult**| string | Filter only events in which the event result, as represented in the [EventResult](normalization-common-fields.md#eventresult) field is equal to the parameter value. |
| **actorusername_has_any** | dynamic/string | Filter only events in which the [ActorUsername](#actorusername) includes any of the terms provided. | 
| **operation_has_any** | dynamic/string | Filter only events in which [Operation](#operation) field includes any of the terms provided. | 
| **object_has_any** | dynamic/string | Filter only events in which [Object](#object) field includes any of the terms provided. | 
| **newvalue_has_any** | dynamic/string | Filter only events in which [NewValue](#object) field includes any of the terms provided. | 

Some parameter can accept both list of values of type `dynamic` or a single string value. To pass a literal list to parameters that expect a dynamic value, explicitly use a [dynamic literal](/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/dynamic?view=microsoft-sentinel&preserve-view=true#dynamic-literals). For example: `dynamic(['192.168.','10.'])`

For example, to filter only audit events with the terms `install` or `update` in their [Operation](#operation) field, from the last day , use:

```kusto
imAuditEvent (operation_has_any=dynamic(['install','update']), starttime = ago(1d), endtime=now())
```

## Schema details

### Common ASIM fields

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Fields common to all schemas are described in detail in the [ASIM Common Fields](normalization-common-fields.md) article.

#### Common fields with specific guidelines

The following list mentions fields that have specific guidelines for Audit Events:


| Field               | Class       | Type       |  Description        |
|---------------------|-------------|------------|--------------------|
| <a name="eventtype"></a> **EventType** | Mandatory | Enumerated | Describes the operation audited by the event using a normalized value. Use [EventSubType](#eventsubtype) to provide further details, which the normalized value does not convey, and [Operation](#operation). to store the operation as reported by the reporting device.<br><br> For Audit Event records, the allowed values are:<br> - `Set`<br>- `Read`<br>- `Create`<br>- `Delete`<br>- `Execute`<br>- `Install`<br>- `Clear`<br>- `Enable`<br>- `Disable`<br>- `Other` <br><br>Audit events represent a large variety of operations, and the `Other` value enables mapping operations that have no corresponding `EventType`. However, the use of `Other` limits the usability of the event and should be avoided if possible.   |
| <a name="eventsubtype"></a> **EventSubType** | Optional | String | Provides further details, which the normalized value in [EventType](#eventtype) does not convey. |
| **EventSchema** | Mandatory | String | The name of the schema documented here is `AuditEvent`. |
