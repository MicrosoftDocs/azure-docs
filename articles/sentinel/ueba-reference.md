#Customer intent: As a security analyst, I want to understand the data sources and enrichments used by the User and Entity Behavior Analytics service so that I can effectively detect and investigate anomalies in user and entity behavior.

# Microsoft Sentinel UEBA reference

This reference article lists the input data sources for the User and Entity Behavior Analytics service in Microsoft Sentinel. It also describes the enrichments that UEBA adds to entities, providing needed context to alerts and incidents.

[!INCLUDE [unified-soc-preview](includes/unified-soc-preview.md)]

## UEBA data sources

These are the data sources from which the UEBA engine collects and analyzes data to train its ML models and set behavioral baselines for users, devices, and other entities. UEBA then looks at data from these sources to find anomalies and glean insights.

| Data source | Events |
| ----------- | ------ |
| **Microsoft Entra ID**<br>Sign-in logs | All |
| **Microsoft Entra ID**<br>Audit logs | ApplicationManagement<br>DirectoryManagement<br>GroupManagement<br>Device<br>RoleManagement<br>UserManagementCategory |
| **Azure Activity logs** | Authorization<br>AzureActiveDirectory<br>Billing<br>Compute<br>Consumption<br>KeyVault<br>Devices<br>Network<br>Resources<br>Intune<br>Logic<br>Sql<br>Storage |
| **Windows Security events**<br>*WindowsEvent* or<br>*SecurityEvent* | 4624: An account was successfully logged on<br>4625: An account failed to log on<br>4648: A logon was attempted using explicit credentials<br>4672: Special privileges assigned to new logon<br>4688: A new process has been created |

## UEBA enrichments

This section describes the enrichments UEBA adds to Microsoft Sentinel entities, along with all their details, that you can use to focus and sharpen your security incident investigations. These enrichments are displayed on [entity pages](entity-pages.md#how-to-use-entity-pages) and can be found in the following Log Analytics tables, the contents and schema of which are listed below:

- The **[BehaviorAnalytics](#behavioranalytics-table)** table is where UEBA's output information is stored.

    The following three dynamic fields from the BehaviorAnalytics table are described in the [entity enrichments dynamic fields](#entity-enrichments-dynamic-fields) section below.

    - The [UsersInsights](#usersinsights-field) and  [DevicesInsights](#devicesinsights-field) fields contain entity information from Active Directory / Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft Threat Intelligence sources.

    - The [ActivityInsights](#activityinsights-field) field contains entity information based on the behavioral profiles built by Microsoft Sentinel's entity behavior analytics. 

        <a name="baseline-explained"></a>User activities are analyzed against a baseline that is dynamically compiled each time it's used. Each activity has its own defined lookback period from which the dynamic baseline is derived. The lookback period is specified in the [**Baseline**](#activityinsights-field) column in this table.

- The **[IdentityInfo](#identityinfo-table)** table is where identity information synchronized to UEBA from Microsoft Entra ID (and from on-premises Active Directory via Microsoft Defender for Identity) is stored.

### IdentityInfo table

After you [enable and configure UEBA](enable-entity-behavior-analytics.md) for your Microsoft Sentinel workspace, user data from your Microsoft identity providers is synchronized to the *IdentityInfo* table in Log Analytics for use in Microsoft Sentinel.

Those identity providers are either or both of the following, depending on which you selected when you configured UEBA:

- Microsoft Entra ID (cloud-based)
- Microsoft Active Directory (on-premises, requires Microsoft Defender for Identity))

You can query the *IdentityInfo* table in analytics rules, hunting queries, and workbooks, enhancing your analytics to fit your use cases and reducing false positives.

While the initial synchronization may take a few days, once the data is fully synchronized:

- Every 14 days, Microsoft Sentinel re-synchronizes with your entire Microsoft Entra ID (and your on-premises Active Directory, if applicable) to ensure that stale records are fully updated.

- Besides these regular full synchronizations, whenever changes are made to your user profiles, groups, and built-in roles in Microsoft Entra ID, the affected user records are re-ingested and updated in the *IdentityInfo* table within 15-30 minutes. This ingestion is billed at regular rates. For example:

    - A user attribute, such as display name, job title, or email address, was changed. A new record for this user is ingested into the *IdentityInfo* table, with the relevant fields updated.

    - Group A has 100 users in it. 5 users are added to the group or removed from the group. In this case, those 5 user records are re-ingested, and their *GroupMembership* fields updated.

    - Group A has 100 users in it. Ten users are added to Group A. Also, groups A1 and A2, each with 10 users, are added to Group A. In this case, 30 user records are re-ingested and their *GroupMembership* fields updated. This happens because group membership is transitive, so changes to groups affect all their subgroups.

    - Group B (with 50 users) is renamed to Group BeGood. In this case, 50 user records are re-ingested and their *GroupMembership* fields updated. If there are subgroups in that group, the same happens for all their members' records.

- Default retention time in the *IdentityInfo* table is 30 days.

#### Limitations

- The *AssignedRoles* field supports only built-in roles.

- The *GroupMembership* field supports listing up to 500 groups per user, including subgroups. If a user is a member of more than 500 groups, only the first 500 are synchronized with the *IdentityInfo* table. The groups are not evaluated in any particular order, though, so at each new synchronization (every 14 days), it's possible that a different set of groups will be updated to the user record.

- When a user is deleted, that user's record is not immediately deleted from the *IdentityInfo* table. The reason for this is that one of this table's purposes is to audit changes to user records. Therefore, we want this table to have a record of a user being deleted, which can only happen if the user record in the *IdentityInfo* table still exists, even though the actual user (say, in Entra ID) is deleted.

    Deleted users can be identified by the presence of a value in the `deletedDateTime` field. So if you need a query to show you a list of users, you can filter out deleted users by adding `| where IsEmpty(deletedDateTime)` to the query.

    At a certain interval of time after a user was deleted, the user's record is eventually removed from the *IdentityInfo* table as well.

- When a group is deleted, or if a group with more than 100 members has its name changed, that group's member user records are not updated. If a different change causes one of those users' records to be updated, the updated group information will be included at that point.

#### Other versions of the IdentityInfo table

There are actually multiple versions of the *IdentityInfo* table:

- The **Log Analytics** schema version, discussed in this article, serves Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal. It's available to those customers who enabled UEBA.

- The **Advanced hunting** schema version serves the Microsoft Defender portal via Microsoft Defender for Identity. It's available to customers of Microsoft Defender XDR, with or without Microsoft Sentinel, and to customers of Microsoft Sentinel by itself in the Defender portal.

    UEBA doesn't have to be enabled in order to have access to this table. However, for customers without UEBA enabled, the fields populated by UEBA data aren't visible or available.

    For more information, see the [documentation of the *Advanced hunting* version of this table](/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-identityinfo-table).

- **As of May 2025**, customers of [Microsoft Sentinel in the Microsoft Defender portal](microsoft-sentinel-defender-portal.md) *with UEBA enabled* **begin using a new release** of the *Advanced hunting* version. This new release includes all the UEBA fields from the Log Analytics version as well as some new fields, and is referred to as the **unified version** or the **unified IdentityInfo table**.

    Defender portal customers without UEBA enabled, or without Microsoft Sentinel at all, continue to use the [prior release of the *Advanced hunting* version](/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-identityinfo-table), without the UEBA-generated fields.

    For more information on the unified version, see [IdentityInfo in the *Advanced hunting* documentation](/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-identityinfo-table).

#### Schema

The table in the following "Log Analytics schema" tab describes the user identity data included in the **IdentityInfo** table in Log Analytics in the Azure portal. 

If you're onboarding Microsoft Sentinel to the Defender portal, select the "Compare to unified schema" tab to view the changes that could potentially affect the queries in your threat detection rules and hunts.
