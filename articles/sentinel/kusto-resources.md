# Useful resources for working with Kusto Query Language in Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft Sentinel uses Azure Monitor's Log Analytics environment and the Kusto Query Language (KQL) to build the queries that undergird much of its functionality, from analytics rules to workbooks to hunting. This article lists resources that can help you skill-up in working with Kusto Query Language, giving you more tools to work with Microsoft Sentinel, whether as a security engineer or analyst.
