## Deprecated Sentinel data connectors


> [!NOTE]
> The following table lists the deprecated and legacy data connectors. Deprecated connectors are no longer supported.



<a name="deprecated-github-enterprise-audit-log"></a><details><summary>**[Deprecated] GitHub Enterprise Audit Log**</summary>

**Supported by:** [Microsoft Corporation](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/)

The GitHub audit log connector provides the capability to ingest GitHub logs into Microsoft Sentinel. By connecting GitHub audit logs into Microsoft Sentinel, you can view this data in workbooks, use it to create custom alerts, and improve your investigation process. 

 **Note:** If you intended to ingest GitHub subscribed events into Microsoft Sentinel, please refer to GitHub (using Webhooks) Connector from "**Data Connectors**" gallery.

<p>NOTE: This data connector has been deprecated, consider moving to the CCF data connector available in the solution which replaces ingestion via the <a href='/azure/azure-monitor/logs/custom-logs-migrate' >deprecated HTTP Data Collector API</a>.</p>

**Log Analytics table(s):**  

|Table|DCR support|Lake-only ingestion|
|---|---|---|
|`GitHubAuditLogPolling_CL`|Yes|Yes|

**Data collection rule support:** [Workspace transform DCR](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/tutorial-workspace-transformations-portal)

**Prerequisites:**

- **GitHub API personal access token**: You need a GitHub personal access token to enable polling for the organization audit log. You may use either a classic token with 'read:org' scope OR a fine-grained token with 'Administration: Read-only' scope.
- **GitHub Enterprise type**: This connector will only function with GitHub Enterprise Cloud; it will not support GitHub Enterprise Server. <br><br>

<a name="deprecated-infoblox-soc-insight-data-connector-via-legacy-agent"></a><details><summary>**[Deprecated] Infoblox SOC Insight Data Connector via Legacy Agent**</summary>

**Supported by:** [Infoblox](https://support.infoblox.com/)

The Infoblox SOC Insight Data Connector allows you to easily connect your Infoblox BloxOne SOC Insight data with Microsoft Sentinel. By connecting your logs to Microsoft Sentinel, you can take advantage of search & correlation, alerting, and threat intelligence enrichment for each log. 

This data connector ingests Infoblox SOC Insight CDC logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.

**Microsoft recommends installation of Infoblox SOC Insight Data Connector via AMA Connector.** The legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and should only be installed where AMA is not supported.

 Using MMA and AMA on the same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost. [More details](/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).

<a name="syslog-via-legacy-agent"></a><details><summary>**Syslog via Legacy Agent**</summary>

**Supported by:** [Microsoft Corporation](https://support.microsoft.com/)

Syslog is an event logging protocol that is common to Linux. Applications will send messages that may be stored on the local machine or delivered to a Syslog collector. When the Agent for Linux is installed, it configures the local Syslog daemon to forward messages to the agent. The agent then sends the message to the workspace.
