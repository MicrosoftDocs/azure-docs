Microsoft Sentinel is [generally available in the Microsoft Defender portal](../microsoft-sentinel-defender-portal.md), including for customers without Microsoft Defender XDR or an E5 license. This means that you can use Microsoft Sentinel in the Defender portal even if you aren't using other Microsoft Defender services.

Starting in **July 2026**, Microsoft Sentinel will be supported in the Defender portal only, and any remaining customers using the Azure portal will be automatically redirected. There are no changes in API usage.

If you're currently using Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal, we recommend that you start planning your transition to the Defender portal now to ensure a smooth transition and take full advantage of the [unified security operations experience offered by Microsoft Defender](/unified-secops-platform/overview-unified-security).
