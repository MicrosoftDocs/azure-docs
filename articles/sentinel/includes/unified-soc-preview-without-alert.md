Starting in **July 2026**, all customers using Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal will be [redirected to the Defender portal and will use Microsoft Sentinel in the Defender portal only](../overview.md#microsoft-sentinel-in-the-azure-portal-retirement-timeline). Starting in **July 2025**, many new users are also automatically [onboarded and redirected from the Azure portal to the Defender portal](../overview.md#changes-for-new-customers-starting-july-2025). If you're still using Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal, we recommend that you start planning your [transition to the Defender portal](../move-to-defender.md) to ensure a smooth transition and take full advantage of the [unified security operations experience offered by Microsoft Defender](/unified-secops-platform/overview-unified-security).
