> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your organization uses Customer-Managed Keys (CMK) for data encryption, be aware that CMK isn't fully supported for data stored in the Microsoft Sentinel data lake during the preview period. Any data ingested into the data lake, such as custom tables or transformed data is encrypted using Microsoft-managed keys. Onboarding to the Microsoft Sentinel data lake during the preview period may not fully align with your organization's encryption policies or data protection standards.
