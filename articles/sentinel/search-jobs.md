#Customer intent: As a security analyst, I want to search and analyze historical log data across large datasets so that I can investigate and identify specific events.

# Search across long time spans in large datasets

Use a search job when you start an investigation to find specific events in logs up to seven years ago. You can search events across all your logs, including events in Analytics, Basic, and Archived log plans. Filter and look for events that match your criteria.

- For more information on search job concepts and limitations, see [Start an investigation by searching large datasets](investigate-large-datasets.md) and [Search jobs in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/search-jobs).

- Search jobs across certain data sets might incur extra charges. For more information, see [Microsoft Sentinel pricing page](billing.md).

## Start a search job

Go to **Search** in Microsoft Sentinel from the Azure portal or the Microsoft Defender portal to enter your search criteria. Depending on the size of the target dataset, search times vary. While most search jobs take a few minutes to complete, searches across massive data sets that run up to 24 hours are also supported. 

1. For Microsoft Sentinel in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), under **General**, select **Search**. <br>For Microsoft Sentinel in the [Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/), select **Microsoft Sentinel** > **Search**.
1. Select the **Table** menu and choose a table for your search.
1. In the **Search** box, enter a search term.

1. Resolve any KQL issues indicated by a squiggly red line in the editor.
1. When you're ready to start the search job, select **Search job**.
1. Enter a new table name to store the search job results.
1. Select **Run a search job**.

1. Wait for the notification **Search job is done** to view the results.

## View search job results

View the status and results of your search job by going to the **Saved Searches** tab.

1. In Microsoft Sentinel, select **Search** > **Saved Searches**.

1. On the search card, select **View search results**.

   By default, you see all the results that match your original search criteria.

1. To refine the list of results returned from the search table, select **Add filter**.

1. As you're reviewing your search job results, select **Add bookmark**, or select the bookmark icon to preserve a row. Adding a bookmark allows you to tag events, add notes, and attach these events to an incident for later reference.
