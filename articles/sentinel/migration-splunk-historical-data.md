# Export historical data from Splunk

This article describes how to export your historical data from Splunk. After you complete the steps in this article, you can [select a target platform](migration-ingestion-target-platform.md) to host the exported data, and then [select an ingestion tool](migration-ingestion-tool.md) to migrate the data.

You can export data from Splunk in several ways. Your selection of an export method depends on the data volumes involved and your level of interactivity. For example, exporting a single, on-demand search via Splunk Web might be appropriate for a low-volume export. Alternatively, if you want to set up a higher-volume, scheduled export, the SDK and REST options work best. 

For large exports, the most stable method for data retrieval is `dump` or the Command Line Interface (CLI). You can export the logs to a local folder on the Splunk server or to another server accessible by Splunk.  

To export your historical data from Splunk, use one of the [Splunk export methods](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.2.5/Search/Exportsearchresults). The output format should be CSV. 

## CLI example

This CLI example searches for events from the `_internal` index that occur during the time window that the search string specifies. The example then specifies to output the events in a CSV format to the **data.csv** file.You can export a maximum of 100 events by default. To increase this number, set the `-maxout` argument. For example, if you set `-maxout` to `0`, you can export an unlimited number of events.

This CLI command exports data recorded between 23:59 and 01:00 on September 14, 2021 to a CSV file: 

```
splunk search "index=_internal earliest=09/14/2021:23:59:00 latest=09/16/2021:01:00:00 " -output csv > c:/data.csv  
```
## dump example

This `dump` command exports all events from the `bigdata` index to the `YYYYmmdd/HH/host` location under the `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/run/splunk/dispatch/<sid>/dump/` directory on a local disk. The command uses `MyExport` as the prefix for export filenames, and outputs the results to a CSV file. The command partitions the exported data using the `eval` function before the `dump` command.

```
index=bigdata | eval _dstpath=strftime(_time, "%Y%m%d/%H") + "/" + host | dump basefilename=MyExport format=csv 
```
## Next steps

- [Select a data ingestion tool](migration-ingestion-tool.md)
