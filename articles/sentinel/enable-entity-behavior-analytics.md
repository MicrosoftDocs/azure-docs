#Customer intent: As a security analyst, I want to configure User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) in Microsoft Sentinel so that I can detect and analyze anomalous activities more effectively.

# Enable User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) in Microsoft Sentinel

In the previous deployment step, you enabled the Microsoft Sentinel security content you need to protect your systems. In this article, you learn how to enable and use the UEBA feature to streamline the analysis process. This article is part of the [Deployment guide for Microsoft Sentinel](deploy-overview.md).

As Microsoft Sentinel collects logs and alerts from all of its connected data sources, it analyzes them and builds baseline behavioral profiles of your organization’s entities (such as users, hosts, IP addresses, and applications) across time and peer group horizon. Using various techniques and machine learning capabilities, Microsoft Sentinel can then identify anomalous activity and help you determine whether an asset is compromised. Learn more about [UEBA](identify-threats-with-entity-behavior-analytics.md).

## Prerequisites

To enable or disable this feature (these prerequisites aren't required to use the feature):

- Your user must be assigned to the Microsoft Entra ID **Security Administrator** role in your tenant or the equivalent permissions.

- Your user must be assigned at least one of the following **Azure roles** ([Learn more about Azure RBAC](roles.md)):
    - **Microsoft Sentinel Contributor** at the workspace or resource group levels.
    - **Log Analytics Contributor** at the resource group or subscription levels.

- Your workspace must not have any Azure resource locks applied to it. [Learn more about Azure resource locking](../azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources.md).

> [!NOTE]
> - No special license is required to add UEBA functionality to Microsoft Sentinel, and there's no extra cost for using it.
> - However, since UEBA generates new data and stores it in new tables that UEBA creates in your Log Analytics workspace, **additional data storage charges** apply. 

## How to enable User and Entity Behavior Analytics

- Users of Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal, follow the instructions in the **Azure portal** tab.
- Users of Microsoft Sentinel as part of the Microsoft Defender portal, follow the instructions in the **Defender portal** tab.

1. Go to the **Entity behavior configuration** page.


    # [Azure portal](#tab/azure)

    Use any one of these three ways to get to the **Entity behavior configuration** page:

    - Select **Entity behavior** from the Microsoft Sentinel navigation menu, then select **Entity behavior settings** from the top menu bar.

    - Select **Settings** from the Microsoft Sentinel navigation menu, select the **Settings** tab, then under the **Entity behavior analytics** expander, select **Set UEBA**.

    - From the Microsoft Defender XDR data connector page, select the **Go the UEBA configuration page** link.

    # [Defender portal](#tab/defender)

    To get to the **Entity behavior configuration** page:

    1. From the Microsoft Defender portal navigation menu, select **Settings** > **Microsoft Sentinel** > **SIEM workspaces**.
    1. Select the workspace you want to configure.
    1. From the workspace configuration page, select **Entity behavior analytics** > **Configure UEBA**. 

    ---

1. On the **Entity behavior configuration** page, toggle on **Turn on UEBA feature**.

1. Select the directory services from which you want to synchronize user entities with Microsoft Sentinel.

    - **Active Directory** on-premises (Preview)
    - **Microsoft Entra ID**

    To sync user entities from on-premises Active Directory, you must onboard your Azure tenant to Microsoft Defender for Identity (either standalone or as part of Microsoft Defender XDR) and you must have the MDI sensor installed on your Active Directory domain controller. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity prerequisites](/defender-for-identity/prerequisites).

1. Select **Connect all data sources** to connect all eligible data sources, or select specific data sources from the list.

    You can only enable these data sources from the Defender and the Azure portals:
    - Signin Logs
    - Audit Logs
    - Azure Activity    
    - Security Events

    You can enable these data sources from the Defender portal only (preview):
    
    - AAD Managed Identity Signin logs (Microsoft Entra ID)
    - AAD Service Principal Signin logs (Microsoft Entra ID)
    - AWS CloudTrail
    - Device Logon Events
    - Okta CL
    - GCP Audit Logs

    For more information about UEBA data sources and anomalies, see [Microsoft Sentinel UEBA reference](./ueba-reference.md) and [UEBA anomalies](./anomalies-reference.md#ueba-anomalies).

    > [!NOTE]
    > After enabling UEBA, you can enable supported data sources for UEBA directly from the data connector pane, or from the Defender portal Settings page, as described in this article.

1. Select **Connect**. 

1. Enable anomaly detection in your Sentinel workspace:

    1. From the Microsoft Defender portal navigation menu, select **Settings** > **Microsoft Sentinel** > **SIEM workspaces**.
    1. Select the workspace you want to configure.
    1. From the workspace configuration page, select **Anomalies** and toggle on **Detect Anomalies**.
