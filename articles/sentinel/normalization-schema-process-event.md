#Customer intent: As a security analyst, I want to use the Process Event normalization schema so that I can standardize and analyze process activity data across different sources for better threat detection and response.

# The Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) Process Event normalization schema reference (Public preview)

The Process Event normalization schema is used to describe the operating system activity of running and terminating a process. Such events are reported by operating systems and security systems, such as EDR (End Point Detection and Response) systems.

A process, as defined by OSSEM, is a containment and management object that represents a running instance of a program. While processes themselves do not run, they do manage threads that run and execute code.

For more information about normalization in Microsoft Sentinel, see [Normalization and the Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM)](normalization.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Process Event normalization schema is currently in PREVIEW. This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and is not recommended for production workloads.
>
> The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
>

## Parsers

To use the unifying parsers that unify all of listed parsers and ensure that you analyze across all the configured sources, use the following table names in your queries:

- **imProcessCreate** for queries that require process creation information. These queries are the most common case.
- **imProcessTerminate** for queries that require process termination information.

For the list of the Process Event parsers Microsoft Sentinel provides out-of-the-box refer to the [ASIM parsers list](normalization-parsers-list.md#process-event-parsers). 

Deploy the Authentication parsers from the [Microsoft Sentinel GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/AzSentinelProcessEvents).

For more information, see [ASIM parsers overview](normalization-parsers-overview.md).

## Add your own normalized parsers

When implementing custom process event parsers, name your KQL functions using the following syntax: `imProcessCreate<vendor><Product>` and `imProcessTerminate<vendor><Product>`. Replace `im` with `ASim` for the parameter-less version.

Add your KQL function to the unifying parsers as described in [Managing ASIM parsers](normalization-manage-parsers.md).

### Filtering parser parameters

The `im` and `vim*` parsers support [filtering parameters](normalization-about-parsers.md#optimizing-parsing-using-parameters). While these parsers are optional, they can improve your query performance.

The following filtering parameters are available:

| Name     | Type      | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **starttime** | datetime | Filter only process events occurred at or after this time. |
| **endtime** | datetime | Filter only process events queries that occurred at or before this time. |
| **commandline_has_any** | dynamic | Filter only process events for which the command line executed has **any** of the listed values. The length of the list is limited to 10,000 items. |
| **commandline_has_all**| dynamic | Filter only process events for which the command line executed has **all** of the listed values.. The length of the list is limited to 10,000 items.
| **commandline_has_any_ip_prefix** | dynamic | Filter only process events for which the command line executed has **all** of the listed IP addresses or IP address prefixes. Prefixes should end with a `.`, for example: `10.0.`. The length of the list is limited to 10,000 items.  |
| **actingprocess_has_any** | dynamic | Filter only process events for which the acting process name, which includes the entire process path, has any of the listed values. The length of the list is limited to 10,000 items. |
| **targetprocess_has_any** | dynamic| Filter only process events for which the target process name, which includes the entire process path, has any of the listed values. The length of the list is limited to 10,000 items.  |
| **parentprocess_has_any** | dynamic | Filter only process events for which the target process name, which includes the entire process path, has any of the listed values. The length of the list is limited to 10,000 items.  |
| **targetusername_has** or **actorusername_has** | string| Filter only process events for which the target username (for process create events), or actor username (for process terminate events) has any of the listed values. The length of the list is limited to 10,000 items. |
| **dvcipaddr_has_any_prefix** | dynamic | Filter only process events for which the device IP address matches any of the listed IP addresses or IP address prefixes. Prefixes should end with a `.`, for example: `10.0.`. The length of the list is limited to 10,000 items.| 
| **dvchostname_has_any**| dynamic | Filter only process events for which the device hostname, or device FQDN is available,  has any of the listed values. The length of the list is limited to 10,000 items. | 
| **eventtype**| string | Filter only process events of the specified type. |




or example, to filter only authentication events from the last day to a specific user, use:

```kusto
imProcessCreate (targetusername_has = 'johndoe', starttime = ago(1d), endtime=now())
```

> [!TIP]
> To pass a literal list to parameters that expect a dynamic value, explicitly use a [dynamic literal](/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/dynamic?view=microsoft-sentinel&preserve-view=true#dynamic-literals). For example: `dynamic(['192.168.','10.'])`.

For a full list of analytics rules that use normalized process events, see [Process Event security content](normalization-content.md#process-activity-security-content).

## Schema details

The Process Event information model is aligned to the [OSSEM Process entity schema](https://github.com/OTRF/OSSEM/blob/master/docs/cdm/entities/process.md).

### Process Event-specific fields

The fields listed in the table below are specific to Process events, but are similar to fields in other schemas and follow similar naming conventions.

The process event schema references the following entities, which are central to process creation and termination activity:

- **Actor** - The user that initiated the process creation or termination.
- **ActingProcess** - The process used by the Actor to initiate the process creation or termination.
- **TargetProcess** - The new process.
- **TargetUser** - The user whose credentials are used to create the new process.
- **ParentProcess** - The process that initiated the Actor Process.
