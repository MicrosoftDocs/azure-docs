#Customer intent: As a security analyst, I want to visualize and monitor data on a unified dashboard so that I can efficiently track incidents, automation, data records, and analytics in my environment.

# Visualize collected data on the Overview page

After connecting your data sources to Microsoft Sentinel, use the **Overview** page to view, monitor, and analyze activities across your environment. This article describes the widgets and graphs available on Microsoft Sentinel's **Overview** dashboard.

[!INCLUDE [unified-soc-preview](includes/unified-soc-preview.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Make sure that you have reader access to Microsoft Sentinel resources. For more information, see [Roles and permissions in Microsoft Sentinel](roles.md).

## Access the Overview page

If your workspace is onboarded to the Microsoft Defender portal, select **General > Overview**. Otherwise, select **Overview** directly. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/get-visibility/dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Microsoft Sentinel Overview dashboard.":::

Data for each section of the dashboard is precalculated, and the last refresh time is shown at the top of each section. Select **Refresh** at the top of the page to refresh the entire page.

## View incident data

To help reduce noise and minimize the number of alerts you need to review and investigate, Microsoft Sentinel uses a fusion technique to correlate alerts into *incidents*. Incidents are actionable groups of related alerts for you to investigate and resolve.

The following image shows an example of the **Incidents** section on the **Overview** dashboard:

:::image type="content" source="./media/qs-get-visibility/incidents.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Incidents section in the Microsoft Sentinel Overview page." lightbox="./media/qs-get-visibility/incidents.png":::

The **Incidents** section lists the following data:

- The number of new, active, and closed incidents over the last 24 hours.
- The total number of incidents of each severity.
- The number of closed incidents of each type of closing classification.
- Incident statuses by creation time, in four hour intervals.
- The mean time to acknowledge an incident and the mean time to close an incident, with a link to the SOC efficiency workbook.

Select **Manage incidents** to jump to the Microsoft Sentinel **Incidents** page for more details.

## View automation data

After deploying automation with Microsoft Sentinel, monitor your workspace's automation in the **Automation** section of the **Overview** dashboard.

:::image type="content" source="./media/qs-get-visibility/automation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Automation section in the Microsoft Sentinel Overview page." lightbox="./media/qs-get-visibility/automation.png":::

- Start with a summary of the automation rules activity: Incidents closed by automation, the time the automation saved, and related playbooks health.

   Microsoft Sentinel calculates the time saved by automation by finding the average time that a single automation saved, multiplied by the number of incidents resolved by automation. The formula is as follows:

   `(avgWithout - avgWith) * resolvedByAutomation`

   Where:

   - **avgWithout** is the average time it takes for an incident to be resolved without automation.
   - **avgWith** is the average time it takes for an incident to be resolved by automation.
   - **resolvedByAutomation** is the number of incidents that are resolved by automation.

- Below the summary, a graph summarizes the numbers of actions performed by automation, by type of action.

- At the bottom of the section, find a count of the active automation rules with a link to the **Automation** page. 

Select the **configure automation rules** link to the jump the **Automation** page, where you can configure more automation.

## View status of data records, data collectors, and threat intelligence

In the **Data** section of the **Overview** dashboard, track information on data records, data collectors, and threat intelligence.

:::image type="content" source="./media/qs-get-visibility/data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Data section in the Microsoft Sentinel Overview page." lightbox="./media/qs-get-visibility/data.png":::

View the following details:

- The number of records that Microsoft Sentinel collected in the last 24 hours, compared to the previous 24 hours, and anomalies detected in that time period.

- A summary of your data connector status, divided by unhealthy and active connectors. **Unhealthy connectors** indicate how many connectors have errors. **Active connectors** are connectors with data streaming into Microsoft Sentinel, as measured by a query included in the connector.

- Threat intelligence records in Microsoft Sentinel, by indicator of compromise.

Select **Manage connectors** to jump to the **Data connectors** page, where you can view and manage your data connectors.

## View analytics data

Track data for your analytics rules in the **Analytics** section of the **Overview** dashboard.

:::image type="content" source="./media/qs-get-visibility/analytics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Analytics section in the Microsoft Sentinel Overview page.":::

The number of analytics rules in Microsoft Sentinel are shown by status, including enabled, disabled, and autodisabled.

Select the **MITRE view** link to jump to the **MITRE ATT&CK**, where you can view how your environment is protected against MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. Select the **manage analytics rules** link to jump to the **Analytics** page, where you can view and manage the rules that configure how alerts are triggered.
