# [Recommended] Infoblox SOC Insight Data Connector via AMA connector for Microsoft Sentinel

The Infoblox SOC Insight Data Connector allows you to easily connect your Infoblox BloxOne SOC Insight data with Microsoft Sentinel. By connecting your logs to Microsoft Sentinel, you can take advantage of search & correlation, alerting, and threat intelligence enrichment for each log. 

This data connector ingests Infoblox SOC Insight CDC logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector.**

   Workspace Key

Parsers

>This data connector depends on a parser based on a Kusto Function to work as expected called [**InfobloxCDC_SOCInsights**](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Solutions/Infoblox%20SOC%20Insights/Parsers/InfobloxCDC_SOCInsights.yaml) which is deployed with the Microsoft Sentinel Solution.

SOC Insights

>This data connector assumes you have access to Infoblox BloxOne Threat Defense SOC Insights. You can find more information about SOC Insights [**here**](https://docs.infoblox.com/space/BloxOneThreatDefense/501514252/SOC+Insights).

Infoblox Cloud Data Connector

>This data connector assumes an Infoblox Data Connector host has already been created and configured in the Infoblox Cloud Services Portal (CSP). As the [**Infoblox Data Connector**](https://docs.infoblox.com/display/BloxOneThreatDefense/Deploying+the+Data+Connector+Solution) is a feature of BloxOne Threat Defense, access to an appropriate BloxOne Threat Defense subscription is required. See this [**quick-start guide**](https://www.infoblox.com/wp-content/uploads/infoblox-deployment-guide-data-connector.pdf) for more information and licensing requirements.
