## Prerequisites

To integrate with Trend Vision One (using Azure Functions) make sure you have: 

- **Microsoft.Web/sites permissions**: Read and write permissions to Azure Functions to create a Function App is required. [See the documentation to learn more about Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/).
- **Trend Vision One API Token**: A Trend Vision One API Token is required. See the documentation to learn more about the [Trend Vision One API](https://automation.trendmicro.com/xdr/home).


## Vendor installation instructions


> [!NOTE]
   >  This connector uses Azure Functions to connect to the Trend Vision One API to pull its logs into Microsoft Sentinel. This might result in additional data ingestion costs. Check the [Azure Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/) for details.


>**(Optional Step)** Securely store workspace and API authorization key(s) or token(s) in Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. [Follow these instructions](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Function App.


**STEP 1 - Configuration steps for the Trend Vision One API**

 [Follow these instructions](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/enterprise/trend-micro-xdr-help/ObtainingAPIKeys) to create an account and an API authentication token.


**STEP 2 - Use the below deployment option to deploy the connector and the associated Azure Function**

>**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying the Trend Vision One connector, have the Workspace ID and Workspace Primary Key (can be copied from the following), as well as the Trend Vision One API Authorization Token, readily available.



Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template Deployment
