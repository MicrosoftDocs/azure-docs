## Prerequisites

To integrate with Bitsight data connector (using Azure Functions) make sure you have: 

- **Microsoft.Web/sites permissions**: Read and write permissions to Azure Functions to create a Function App is required. [See the documentation to learn more about Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/).
- **REST API Credentials/permissions**: BitSight API Token is required.  See the documentation to [learn more](https://help.bitsighttech.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014888388-API-Token-Management) about API Token.


## Vendor installation instructions


> [!NOTE]
   >  This connector uses Azure Functions to connect to the BitSight API to pull its logs into Microsoft Sentinel. This might result in additional data ingestion costs. Check the [Azure Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/) for details.


**(Optional Step)** Securely store workspace and API authorization key(s) or token(s) in Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. [Follow these instructions](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Function App.


**STEP 1 - Steps to Create/Get Bitsight API Token**

 Follow these instructions to get a BitSight API Token.
 1. For SPM App: Refer to the [User Preference](https://service.bitsight.com/app/spm/account) tab of your Account page, 
		Go to Settings > Account > User Preferences > API Token.
 2. For TPRM App: Refer to the [User Preference](https://service.bitsight.com/app/tprm/account) tab of your Account page, 
		Go to Settings > Account > User Preferences > API Token.
 3. For Classic BitSight: Go to your [Account](https://service.bitsight.com/settings) page, 
		Go to Settings > Account > API Token.


**STEP 2 - App Registration steps for the Application in Microsoft Entra ID**

 This integration requires an App registration in the Azure portal. Follow the steps in this section to create a new application in Microsoft Entra ID:
 1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
 2. Search for and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.
 3. Under **Manage**, select **App registrations > New registration**.
 4. Enter a display **Name** for your application.
 5. Select **Register** to complete the initial app registration.
 6. When registration finishes, the Azure portal displays the app registration's Overview pane. You see the **Application (client) ID** and **Tenant ID**. The client ID and Tenant ID is required as configuration parameters for the execution of BitSight Data Connector.

**STEP 3 - Add a client secret for application in Microsoft Entra ID**

 Sometimes called an application password, a client secret is a string value required for the execution of BitSight Data Connector. Follow the steps in this section to create a new Client Secret:
 1. In the Azure portal, in **App registrations**, select your application.
 2. Select **Certificates & secrets > Client secrets > New client secret**.
 3. Add a description for your client secret.
 4. Select an expiration for the secret or specify a custom lifetime. Limit is 24 months.
 5. Select **Add**. 
 6. *Record the secret's value for use in your client application code. This secret value is never displayed again after you leave this page.* The secret value is required as configuration parameter for the execution of BitSight Data Connector. 

**Reference link:** [/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret)


**STEP 4 - Assign role of Contributor to application in Microsoft Entra ID**

 Follow the steps in this section to assign the role:
 1. In the Azure portal, Go to **Resource Group** and select your resource group.
 2. Go to **Access control (IAM)** from left panel.
 3. Click on **Add**, and then select **Add role assignment**.
 4. Select **Contributor** as role and click on next.
 5. In **Assign access to**, select `User, group, or service principal`.
 6. Click on **add members** and type **your app name** that you have created and select it.
 7. Now click on **Review + assign** and then again click on **Review + assign**.

**STEP 5 - Choose ONE from the following two deployment options to deploy the connector and the associated Azure Function**

**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying the BitSight data connector, have the Workspace ID and Workspace Primary Key (can be copied from the following) readily available.., as well as the BitSight API Token.



Option 1 - Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template

Use this method for automated deployment of the BitSight connector.

1. Click the **Deploy to Azure** button below. 

	[![Deploy To Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://aka.ms/sentinel-BitSight-azuredeploy)
2. Select the preferred **Subscription**, **Resource Group** and **Location**. 
3. Enter the below information : 
	- Function Name 
	- Workspace ID 
	- Workspace Key 
	- API_token 
	- Companies 
	- Azure_Client_Id 
	- Azure_Client_Secret 
	- Azure_Tenant_Id 
	- Portfolio_Companies_Table_Name 
	- Alerts_Table_Name 
	- Breaches_Table_Name 
	- Company_Table_Name 
	- Company_Rating_Details_Table_Name 
	- Diligence_Historical_Statistics_Table_Name 
	- Diligence_Statistics_Table_Name 
	- Findings_Summary_Table_Name 
	- Findings_Table_Name 
	- Graph_Table_Name 
	- Industrial_Statistics_Table_Name 
	- Observation_Statistics_Table_Name 
	- Log Level 
	- Schedule 
	- Schedule_Portfolio 
4. Mark the checkbox labeled **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**. 
5. Click **Purchase** to deploy.

Option 2 - Manual Deployment of Azure Functions

Use the following step-by-step instructions to deploy the BitSight data connector manually with Azure Functions (Deployment via Visual Studio Code).


**1. Deploy a Function App**

**NOTE:** You will need to [prepare VS code](/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-python#prerequisites) for Azure function development.

1. Download the [Azure Function App](https://aka.ms/sentinel-BitSight-functionapp) file. Extract archive to your local development computer.
2. Start VS Code. Choose File in the main menu and select Open Folder.
3. Select the top level folder from extracted files.
4. Choose the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the **Azure: Functions** area, choose the **Deploy to function app** button.
If you aren't already signed in, choose the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the **Azure: Functions** area, choose **Sign in to Azure**
If you're already signed in, go to the next step.
5. Provide the following information at the prompts:

	a. **Select folder:** Choose a folder from your workspace or browse to one that contains your function app.

	b. **Select Subscription:** Choose the subscription to use.

	c. Select **Create new Function App in Azure** (Don't choose the Advanced option)

	d. **Enter a globally unique name for the function app:** Type a name that is valid in a URL path. The name you type is validated to make sure that it's unique in Azure Functions. (e.g. BitSightXXXXX).

	e. **Select a runtime:** Choose Python 3.8 or above.

	f. Select a location for new resources. For better performance and lower costs choose the same [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) where Microsoft Sentinel is located.

6. Deployment will begin. A notification is displayed after your function app is created and the deployment package is applied.
7. Go to Azure Portal for the Function App configuration.


**2. Configure the Function App**

1. In the Function App, select the Function App Name and select **Configuration**.
2. In the **Application settings** tab, select **+ New application setting**.
3. Add each of the following application settings individually, with their respective values (case-sensitive): 
	- Workspace ID 
	- Workspace Key 
	- API_token 
	- Companies 
	- Azure_Client_Id 
	- Azure_Client_Secret 
	- Azure_Tenant_Id 
	- Portfolio_Companies_Table_Name 
	- Alerts_Table_Name 
	- Breaches_Table_Name 
	- Company_Table_Name 
	- Company_Rating_Details_Table_Name 
	- Diligence_Historical_Statistics_Table_Name 
	- Diligence_Statistics_Table_Name 
	- Findings_Summary_Table_Name 
	- Findings_Table_Name 
	- Graph_Table_Name 
	- Industrial_Statistics_Table_Name 
	- Observation_Statistics_Table_Name 
	- Log Level
