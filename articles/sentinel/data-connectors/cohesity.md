## Prerequisites

To integrate with Cohesity (using Azure Functions) make sure you have: 

- **Microsoft.Web/sites permissions**: Read and write permissions to Azure Functions to create a Function App is required. [See the documentation to learn more about Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/).
- **Azure Blob Storage connection string and container name**: Azure Blob Storage connection string and container name


## Vendor installation instructions


> [!NOTE]
   >  This connector uses Azure Functions that connect to the Azure Blob Storage and KeyVault. This might result in additional costs. Check the [Azure Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/), [Azure Blob Storage pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/) and [Azure KeyVault pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/key-vault/) for details.


>**(Optional Step)** Securely store workspace and API authorization key(s) or token(s) in Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. [Follow these instructions](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Functions App.


**STEP 1 - Get a Cohesity DataHawk API key (see troubleshooting [instruction 1](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Solutions/CohesitySecurity/Data%20Connectors/Helios2Sentinel/IncidentProducer))**


**STEP 2 - Register Azure app ([link](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/RegisteredApps)) and save Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID, and Secret Value ([instructions](/azure/healthcare-apis/register-application)). Grant it Azure Storage (user_impersonation) permission. Also, assign the 'Microsoft Sentinel Contributor' role to the application in the appropriate subscription.**


**STEP 3 - Deploy the connector and the associated Azure Functions**.
