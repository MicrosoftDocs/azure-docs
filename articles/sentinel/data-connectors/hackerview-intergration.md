## Prerequisites

To integrate with HackerView Intergration (using Azure Functions) make sure you have: 

- **Microsoft.Web/sites permissions**: Read and write permissions to Azure Functions to create a Function App is required. [See the documentation to learn more about Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/).


## Vendor installation instructions


> [!NOTE]
   >  This connector uses Azure Functions to connect to a '' to pull its logs into Microsoft Sentinel. This might result in additional data ingestion costs. Check the [Azure Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/) for details.


>**(Optional Step)** Securely store workspace and API authorization key(s) or token(s) in Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. [Follow these instructions](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Function App.


**STEP 1 - Configuration steps for the 'HackerView' API**

The provider should provide or link to detailed steps to configure the 'HackerView' API endpoint so that the Azure Function can authenticate to it successfully, get its authorization key or token, and pull the appliance's logs into Microsoft Sentinel.


**STEP 2 - Choose ONE from the following two deployment options to deploy the connector and the associated Azure Function**

>**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying the 'HackerView' connector, have the Workspace ID  and Workspace Primary Key (can be copied from the following), as well as the 'HackerView' API authorization key(s) readily available.




**Option 1 - Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template**

Use this method for automated deployment of the 'HackerView' connector.

1. Click the **Deploy to Azure** button below. 

	[![Deploy To Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://aka.ms/sentinel-CTM360-HV-azuredeploy) [![Deploy to Azure Gov](https://aka.ms/deploytoazuregovbutton)](https://aka.ms/sentinel-CTM360-HV-azuredeploy-gov)
2. Select the preferred **Subscription**, **Resource Group** and **Location**. 
3. Enter the **Workspace ID**, **Workspace Key**, **API **, 'and/or Other required fields'. 
>Note: If using Azure Key Vault secrets for any of the values above, use the`@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri={Security Identifier})`schema in place of the string values. Refer to [Key Vault references documentation](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) for further details. 
4. Mark the checkbox labeled **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**. 
5. Click **Purchase** to deploy.


**Option 2 - Manual Deployment of Azure Functions**

 Use the following step-by-step instructions to deploy the 'HackerView' connector manually with Azure Functions.

Option 2 - Manual Deployment of Azure Functions

Use the following step-by-step instructions to deploy the CTM360 CBS data connector manually with Azure Functions (Deployment via Visual Studio Code).


**1. Deploy a Function App**

> **NOTE:** You will need to [prepare VS code](/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-python) for Azure function development.

1. Download the [Azure Function App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CTM360-Integrations/Azure-Sentinel/ctm360-HV-CBS-azurefunctionapp/Solutions/CTM360/Data%20Connectors/HackerView/AzureFunctionCTM360_HV.zip) file. Extract archive to your local development computer.
2. Start VS Code. Choose File in the main menu and select Open Folder.
3. Select the top level folder from extracted files.
4. Choose the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the **Azure: Functions** area, choose the **Deploy to function app** button.
If you aren't already signed in, choose the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the **Azure: Functions** area, choose **Sign in to Azure**
If you're already signed in, go to the next step.
5. Provide the following information at the prompts:

	a. **Select folder:** Choose a folder from your workspace or browse to one that contains your function app.

	b. **Select Subscription:** Choose the subscription to use.

	c. Select **Create new Function App in Azure** (Don't choose the Advanced option)

	d. **Enter a globally unique name for the function app:** Type a name that is valid in a URL path. The name you type is validated to make sure that it's unique in Azure Functions. (e.g. CTIXYZ).

	e. **Select a runtime:** Choose Python 3.8.

	f. Select a location for new resources. For better performance and lower costs choose the same [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) where Microsoft Sentinel is located.

6. Deployment will begin. A notification is displayed after your function app is created and the deployment package is applied.
7. Go to Azure Portal for the Function App configuration.


**2. Configure the Function App**

1. In the Function App, select the Function App Name and select **Configuration**.
2. In the **Application settings** tab, select **+ New application setting**.
3. Add each of the following application settings individually, with their respective string values (case-sensitive):  
		CTM360AccountID
		WorkspaceID
		WorkspaceKey
		CTM360Key
		FUNCTION_NAME
		logAnalyticsUri  - Use logAnalyticsUri to override the log analytics API endpoint for dedicated cloud. For example, for public cloud, leave the value empty; for Azure GovUS cloud environment, specify the value in the following format: `https://<CustomerId>.ods.opinsights.azure.us`.
3. Once all application settings have been entered, click **Save**.
