# Zoom Reports (using Azure Functions) connector for Microsoft Sentinel

The [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) Reports data connector provides the capability to ingest [Zoom Reports](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/rest/reference/zoom-api/methods/#tag/Reports) events into Microsoft Sentinel through the REST API. Refer to [API documentation](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/) for more information. The connector provides ability to get events which helps to examine potential security risks, analyze your team's use of collaboration, diagnose configuration problems and more.

## Prerequisites

To integrate with Zoom Reports (using Azure Functions) make sure you have: 

- **Microsoft.Web/sites permissions**: Read and write permissions to Azure Functions to create a Function App is required. [See the documentation to learn more about Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/).
- **REST API Credentials/permissions**: **AccountID**, **ClientID** and **ClientSecret** are required for Zoom API. [See the documentation to learn more about Zoom API](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/internal-apps/create/). [Follow the instructions for Zoom API configurations](https://aka.ms/sentinel-zoomreports-readme).


## Vendor installation instructions


> [!NOTE]
   >  This connector uses Azure Functions to connect to the Zoom API to pull its logs into Microsoft Sentinel. This might result in additional data ingestion costs. Check the [Azure Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/) for details.


>**(Optional Step)** Securely store workspace and API authorization key(s) or token(s) in Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. [Follow these instructions](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Function App.


**NOTE:** This data connector depends on a parser based on a Kusto Function to work as expected which is deployed as part of the solution. To view the function code in Log Analytics, open Log Analytics/Microsoft Sentinel Logs blade, click Functions and search for the alias Zoom and load the function code or click [here](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Solutions/ZoomReports/Parsers/Zoom.yaml). The function usually takes 10-15 minutes to activate after solution installation/update.


**STEP 1 - Configuration steps for the Zoom API**

 [Follow the instructions](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/internal-apps/create/) to obtain the credentials. 



**STEP 2 - Choose ONE from the following two deployment options to deploy the connector and the associated Azure Function**

>**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying the Zoom Reports data connector, have the Workspace ID and Workspace Primary Key (can be copied from the following).
