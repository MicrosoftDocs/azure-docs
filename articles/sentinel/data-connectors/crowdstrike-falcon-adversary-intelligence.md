# CrowdStrike Falcon Adversary Intelligence (using Azure Functions) connector for Microsoft Sentinel

The [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/) Falcon Indicators of Compromise connector retrieves the Indicators of Compromise from the Falcon Intel API and uploads them [Microsoft Sentinel Threat Intel](/azure/sentinel/understand-threat-intelligence).

   ```



## Prerequisites

To integrate with CrowdStrike Falcon Adversary Intelligence (using Azure Functions) make sure you have: 

- **Microsoft.Web/sites permissions**: Read and write permissions to Azure Functions to create a Function App is required. [See the documentation to learn more about Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/).
- **CrowdStrike API Client ID and Client Secret**: **CROWDSTRIKE_CLIENT_ID**, **CROWDSTRIKE_CLIENT_SECRET**, **CROWDSTRIKE_BASE_URL**. CrowdStrike credentials must have Indicators (Falcon Intelligence) read scope.


## Vendor installation instructions


**STEP 1 - [Generate CrowdStrike API credentials](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/tech-center/get-access-falcon-apis/).**



Make sure 'Indicators (Falcon Intelligence)' scope has 'read' selected


**STEP 2 - [Register an Entra App](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) with client secret.**



Provide the Entra App principal with 'Microsoft Sentinel Contributor' role assignment on the respective log analytics workspace. [How to assign roles on Azure](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).


**STEP 3 - Choose ONE from the following two deployment options to deploy the connector and the associated Azure Function**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before deploying the CrowdStrike Falcon Indicator of Compromise connector, have the Workspace ID (can be copied from the following).


Option 1 - Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template

Use this method for automated deployment of the CrowdStrike Falcon Adversary Intelligence connector using an ARM template.

1. Select the following **Deploy to Azure** button. 

	[![Deploy To Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://aka.ms/sentinel-CrowdStrikeFalconAdversaryIntelligence-azuredeploy)
2. Provide the following parameters: CrowdStrikeClientId, CrowdStrikeClientSecret, CrowdStrikeBaseUrl, WorkspaceId, TenantId, Indicators, AadClientId, AadClientSecret, LookBackDays

Option 2 - Manual Deployment of Azure Functions

Use the following step-by-step instructions to deploy the CrowdStrike Falcon Adversary Intelligence connector manually with Azure Functions (Deployment via Visual Studio Code).


**1. Deploy a Function App**

You need to [prepare VS Code](/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-python#prerequisites) for Azure function development.

1. Download the [Azure Function App](https://aka.ms/sentinel-CrowdStrikeFalconAdversaryIntelligence-Functionapp) file. Extract archive to your local development computer.
2. Start VS Code. Choose File in the main menu and select Open Folder.
3. Select the top level folder from extracted files.
4. Choose the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the **Azure: Functions** area, choose the **Deploy to function app** button.
If you aren't already signed in, choose the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the **Azure: Functions** area, choose **Sign in to Azure**
If you're already signed in, go to the next step.
5. Provide the following information at the prompts:

	a. **Select folder:** Choose a folder from your workspace or browse to one that contains your function app.

	b. **Select Subscription:** Choose the subscription to use.

	c. Select **Create new Function App in Azure** (Don't choose the Advanced option)

	d. **Enter a globally unique name for the function app:** Type a name that is valid in a URL path. The name you type is validated to make sure that it's unique in Azure Functions. (e.g. CrowdStrikeFalconIOCXXXXX).

	e. **Select a runtime:** Choose Python 3.9.

	f. Select a location for new resources. For better performance and lower costs choose the same [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) where Microsoft Sentinel is located.

6. Deployment will begin. A notification is displayed after your function app is created and the deployment package is applied.
7. Go to Azure portal for the Function App configuration.


**2. Configure the Function App**

1. In the Function App, select the Function App Name and select **Configuration**.
2. In the **Application settings** tab, select **New application setting**.
3. Add each of the following application settings individually, with their respective string values (case-sensitive): 

   - CROWDSTRIKE_CLIENT_ID
   - CROWDSTRIKE_CLIENT_SECRET
   - CROWDSTRIKE_BASE_URL
   - TENANT_ID
   - INDICATORS
   - WorkspaceKey
   - AAD_CLIENT_ID
   - AAD_CLIENT_SECRET
   - LOOK_BACK_DAYS
   - WORKSPACE_ID  
4. Once all application settings are entered, select **Save**.
