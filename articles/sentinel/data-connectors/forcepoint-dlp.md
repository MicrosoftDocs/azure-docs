# Forcepoint DLP connector for Microsoft Sentinel

The Forcepoint DLP (Data Loss Prevention) connector allows you to automatically export DLP incident data from Forcepoint DLP into Microsoft Sentinel in real-time. This enriches visibility into user activities and data loss incidents, enables further correlation with data from Azure workloads and other feeds, and improves monitoring capability with Workbooks inside Microsoft Sentinel.
