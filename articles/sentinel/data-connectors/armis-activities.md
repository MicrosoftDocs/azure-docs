# Armis Activities (using Azure Functions) connector for Microsoft Sentinel

The [Armis](https://www.armis.com/) Activities connector gives the capability to ingest Armis device Activities into Microsoft Sentinel through the Armis REST API. Refer to the API documentation: `https://<YourArmisInstance>.armis.com/api/v1/doc` for more information. The connector provides the ability to get device activity information from the Armis platform. Armis uses your existing infrastructure to discover and identify devices without having to deploy any agents. Armis detects what all devices are doing in your environment and classifies those activities to get a complete picture of device behavior. These activities are analyzed for an understanding of normal and abnormal device behavior and used to assess device and network risk.

## Prerequisites

To integrate with Armis Activities (using Azure Functions) make sure you have: 

- **Microsoft.Web/sites permissions**: Read and write permissions to Azure Functions to create a Function App is required. [See the documentation to learn more about Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/).
- **REST API Credentials/permissions**: **Armis Secret Key** is required.  See the documentation to learn more about API on the `https://<YourArmisInstance>.armis.com/api/v1/doc`


## Vendor installation instructions


> [!NOTE]
   >  This connector uses Azure Functions to connect to the Armis API to pull its logs into Microsoft Sentinel. This might result in additional data ingestion costs. Check the [Azure Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/) for details.


>**(Optional Step)** Securely store workspace and API authorization key(s) or token(s) in Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. [Follow these instructions](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Function App.


**NOTE:** This data connector depends on a parser based on a Kusto Function to work as expected which is deployed as part of the solution. To view the function code in Log Analytics, open Log Analytics/Microsoft Sentinel Logs blade, click Functions and search for the alias ArmisActivities and load the function code or click [here](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Solutions/Armis/Parsers/ArmisActivities.yaml). The function usually takes 10-15 minutes to activate after solution installation/update.


**STEP 1 - Configuration steps for the Armis API**

 Follow these instructions to create an Armis API secret key.
 1. Log into your Armis instance
 2. Navigate to Settings -> API Management
 3. If the secret key has not already been created, press the Create button to create the secret key
 4. To access the secret key, press the Show button
 5. The secret key can now be copied and used during the Armis Activities connector configuration


**STEP 2 - Choose ONE from the following two deployment options to deploy the connector and the associated Azure Function**

>**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying the Armis Activities data connector, have the Workspace ID and Workspace Primary Key (can be copied from the following) readily available.., as well as the Armis API Authorization Key(s)



Option 1 - Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template

Use this method for automated deployment of the Armis connector.

1. Click the **Deploy to Azure** button below. 

	[![Deploy To Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://aka.ms/sentinel-ArmisActivitiesAPI-azuredeploy) [![Deploy to Azure Gov](https://aka.ms/deploytoazuregovbutton)](https://aka.ms/sentinel-ArmisActivitiesAPI-azuredeploy-gov)
2. Select the preferred **Subscription**, **Resource Group** and **Location**. 
3. Enter the below information : 
	- Function Name 
	- Workspace ID 
	- Workspace Key 
	- Armis Secret Key 
	- Armis URL `https://<armis-instance>.armis.com/api/v1/` 
	- Armis Activity Table Name 
	- Armis Schedule 
	- Avoid Duplicates (Default: false) 
4. Mark the checkbox labeled **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**. 
5. Click **Purchase** to deploy.

Option 2 - Manual Deployment of Azure Functions

Use the following step-by-step instructions to deploy the Armis Activity data connector manually with Azure Functions (Deployment via Visual Studio Code).


**1. Deploy a Function App**

> **NOTE:** You will need to [prepare VS code](/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-python#prerequisites) for Azure function development.

1. Download the [Azure Function App](https://aka.ms/sentinel-ArmisActivitiesAPI-functionapp) file. Extract archive to your local development computer.
2. Start VS Code. Choose File in the main menu and select Open Folder.
3. Select the top level folder from extracted files.
4. Choose the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the **Azure: Functions** area, choose the **Deploy to function app** button.
If you aren't already signed in, choose the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the **Azure: Functions** area, choose **Sign in to Azure**
If you're already signed in, go to the next step.
5. Provide the following information at the prompts:

	a. **Select folder:** Choose a folder from your workspace or browse to one that contains your function app.

	b. **Select Subscription:** Choose the subscription to use.

	c. Select **Create new Function App in Azure** (Don't choose the Advanced option)

	d. **Enter a globally unique name for the function app:** Type a name that is valid in a URL path. The name you type is validated to make sure that it's unique in Azure Functions. (e.g. ARMISXXXXX).

	e. **Select a runtime:** Choose Python 3.8 or above.

	f. Select a location for new resources. For better performance and lower costs choose the same [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) where Microsoft Sentinel is located.

6. Deployment will begin. A notification is displayed after your function app is created and the deployment package is applied.
7. Go to Azure Portal for the Function App configuration.


**2. Configure the Function App**

1. In the Function App, select the Function App Name and select **Configuration**.
2. In the **Application settings** tab, select **+ New application setting**.
3. Add each of the following application settings individually, with their respective values (case-sensitive): 
	- Workspace ID 
	- Workspace Key 
	- Armis Secret Key 
	- Armis URL `https://<armis-instance>.armis.com/api/v1/` 
	- Armis Activity Table Name 
	- Armis Schedule 
	- Avoid Duplicates (Default: false) 
	- logAnalyticsUri (optional) 
 - Use logAnalyticsUri to override the log analytics API endpoint for dedicated cloud. For example, for public cloud, leave the value empty; for Azure GovUS cloud environment, specify the value in the following format: `https://<CustomerId>.ods.opinsights.azure.us`.
4. Once all application settings have been entered, click **Save**.
