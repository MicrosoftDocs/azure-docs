- **Microsoft.Web/sites permissions**: Read and write permissions to Azure Functions to create a Function App is required. [See the documentation to learn more about Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/).
- **API credentials**: Your Secure Practice API key pair is also needed, which are created in the [settings in the admin portal](https://manage.securepractice.co/settings/security).
