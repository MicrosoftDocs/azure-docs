## Prerequisites

To integrate with Dataminr Pulse Alerts Data Connector (using Azure Functions) make sure you have: 

- **Azure Subscription**: Azure Subscription with owner role is required to register an application in Microsoft Entra ID and assign role of contributor to app in resource group.
- **Microsoft.Web/sites permissions**: Read and write permissions to Azure Functions to create a Function App is required. [See the documentation to learn more about Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/).
- **Required Dataminr Credentials/permissions**: 

a. Users must have a valid Dataminr Pulse API **client ID** and **secret** to use this data connector.

 b. One or more Dataminr Pulse Watchlists must be configured in the Dataminr Pulse website.


## Vendor installation instructions


> [!NOTE]
   >  This connector uses Azure Functions to connect to the DataminrPulse in which logs are pushed via Dataminr RTAP and it will ingest logs into Microsoft Sentinel. Furthermore, the connector will fetch the ingested data from the custom logs table and create Threat Intelligence Indicators into Microsoft Sentinel Threat Intelligence. This might result in additional data ingestion costs. Check the [Azure Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/) for details.


>**(Optional Step)** Securely store workspace and API authorization key(s) or token(s) in Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. [Follow these instructions](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Function App.


**STEP 1- Credentials for the Dataminr Pulse Client ID and Client Secret**

**STEP 6 - Choose ONE from the following two deployment options to deploy the connector and the associated Azure Function**

>**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying the Dataminr Pulse Microsoft Sentinel data connector, have the Workspace ID and Workspace Primary Key (can be copied from the following) readily available.



Option 1 - Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template

Use this method for automated deployment of the DataminrPulse connector.

1. Click the **Deploy to Azure** button below. 

	[![Deploy To Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://aka.ms/sentinel-DataminrPulseAlerts-azuredeploy)
2. Select the preferred **Subscription**, **Resource Group** and **Location**. 
3. Enter the below information : 
		Function Name 
		Workspace ID 
		Workspace Key 
		AlertsTableName 
		BaseURL 
		ClientId 
		ClientSecret 
		AzureClientId 
		AzureClientSecret 
		AzureTenantId 
		AzureResourceGroupName 
		AzureWorkspaceName 
		AzureSubscriptionId 
		Schedule 
		LogLevel 
 
4. Mark the checkbox labeled **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**. 
5. Click **Purchase** to deploy.

Option 2 - Manual Deployment of Azure Functions

Use the following step-by-step instructions to deploy the Dataminr Pulse Microsoft Sentinel data connector manually with Azure Functions (Deployment via Visual Studio Code).

1) Deploy a Function App

> [!NOTE]
   > You will need to [prepare VS code](/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-python#prerequisites) for Azure function development.

1. Download the [Azure Function App](https://aka.ms/sentinel-DataminrPulseAlerts-functionapp) file. Extract archive to your local development computer.
2. Start VS Code. Choose File in the main menu and select Open Folder.
3. Select the top level folder from extracted files.
4. Choose the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the **Azure: Functions** area, choose the **Deploy to function app** button.
If you aren't already signed in, choose the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the **Azure: Functions** area, choose **Sign in to Azure**
If you're already signed in, go to the next step.
5. Provide the following information at the prompts:

	a. **Select folder:** Choose a folder from your workspace or browse to one that contains your function app.

	b. **Select Subscription:** Choose the subscription to use.

	c. Select **Create new Function App in Azure** (Don't choose the Advanced option)

	d. **Enter a globally unique name for the function app:** Type a name that is valid in a URL path. The name you type is validated to make sure that it's unique in Azure Functions. (e.g. DmPulseXXXXX).

	e. **Select a runtime:** Choose Python 3.8 or above.

	f. Select a location for new resources. For better performance and lower costs choose the same [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) where Microsoft Sentinel is located.

6. Deployment will begin. A notification is displayed after your function app is created and the deployment package is applied.
7. Go to Azure Portal for the Function App configuration.

2) Configure the Function App

1. In the Function App, select the Function App Name and select **Configuration**.
2. In the **Application settings** tab, select **+ New application setting**.
3. Add each of the following application settings individually, with their respective values (case-sensitive): 
		Function Name 
		Workspace ID 
		Workspace Key 
		AlertsTableName 
		BaseURL 
		ClientId 
		ClientSecret
		AzureClientId 
		AzureClientSecret 
		AzureTenantId 
		AzureResourceGroupName 
		AzureWorkspaceName 
		AzureSubscriptionId 
		Schedule 
		LogLevel
		logAnalyticsUri (optional) 
 - Use logAnalyticsUri to override the log analytics API endpoint for dedicated cloud. For example, for public cloud, leave the value empty; for Azure GovUS cloud environment, specify the value in the following format: `https://<CustomerId>.ods.opinsights.azure.us`.
4. Once all application settings have been entered, click **Save**.


**STEP 7 - Post Deployment steps**



1) Get the Function app endpoint

1. Go to Azure function Overview page and Click on **"Functions"** in the left blade.
2. Click on the function called **"DataminrPulseAlertsHttpStarter"**.
3. Go to **"GetFunctionurl"** and copy the function url.
4. Replace **{functionname}**  with **"DataminrPulseAlertsSentinelOrchestrator"** in copied function url.

2) To add integration settings in Dataminr RTAP using the function URL

1. Open any API request tool like Postman.
2. Click on '+' to create a new request.
3. Select HTTP request method as **'POST'**.
4. Enter the url prepapred in **point 1)**, in the request URL part.
5. In Body, select raw JSON and provide request body as below(case-sensitive): 
		{ 
		 "integration-settings": "ADD", 
		 "url": "`(URL part from copied Function-url)`", 
		 "token": "`(value of code parameter from copied Function-url)`" 
		}
6. After providing all required details, click **Send**.
7. You will receive an integration setting ID in the HTTP response with a status code of 200.
8. Save **Integration ID** for future reference.


*Now we are done with the adding integration settings for Dataminr RTAP. Once the Dataminr RTAP send an alert data, Function app is triggered and you should be able to see the Alerts data from the Dataminr Pulse into LogAnalytics workspace table called "DataminrPulse_Alerts_CL".*
