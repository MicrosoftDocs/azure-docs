# Cognni connector for Microsoft Sentinel

The Cognni connector offers a quick and simple integration with Microsoft Sentinel. You can use Cognni to autonomously map your previously unclassified important information and detect related incidents. This allows you to recognize risks to your important information, understand the severity of the incidents, and investigate the details you need to remediate, fast enough to make a difference.
