## Vendor installation instructions


This connector reads data from the jamfprotect_CL table created by Jamf Protect in a Microsoft Analytics Workspace, if the [data forwarding](https://docs.jamf.com/jamf-protect/documentation/Data_Forwarding_to_a_Third_Party_Storage_Solution.html?hl=sentinel#task-4227) option is enabled in Jamf Protect then raw event data is sent to the Microsoft Sentinel Ingestion API.
