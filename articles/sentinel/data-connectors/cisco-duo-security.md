# Cisco Duo Security (using Azure Functions) connector for Microsoft Sentinel

The Cisco Duo Security data connector provides the capability to ingest [authentication logs](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#authentication-logs), [administrator logs](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#administrator-logs), [telephony logs](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#telephony-logs), [offline enrollment logs](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#offline-enrollment-logs) and [Trust Monitor events](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#trust-monitor) into Microsoft Sentinel using the Cisco Duo Admin API. Refer to [API documentation](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi) for more information.

## Prerequisites

To integrate with Cisco Duo Security (using Azure Functions) make sure you have: 

- **Microsoft.Web/sites permissions**: Read and write permissions to Azure Functions to create a Function App is required. [See the documentation to learn more about Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/).
- **Cisco Duo API credentials**: Cisco Duo API credentials with permission *Grant read log* is required for Cisco Duo API. See the [documentation](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#first-steps) to learn more about creating Cisco Duo API credentials.


## Vendor installation instructions


> [!NOTE]
   >  This connector uses Azure Functions to connect to the Cisco Duo API to pull logs into Microsoft Sentinel. This might result in additional data ingestion costs. Check the [Azure Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/) for details.


>**(Optional Step)** Securely store workspace and API authorization key(s) or token(s) in Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. [Follow these instructions](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Function App.


> [!NOTE]
   >  This data connector depends on a parser based on a Kusto Function to work as expected [**CiscoDuo**](https://aka.ms/sentinel-CiscoDuoSecurity-parser) which is deployed with the Microsoft Sentinel Solution.


**STEP 1 - Obtaining Cisco Duo Admin API credentials**

1. Follow [the instructions](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#first-steps) to obtain **integration key**, **secret key**, and **API hostname**. Use **Grant read log** permission in the 4th step of [the instructions](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#first-steps).


**STEP 2 - Choose ONE from the following two deployment options to deploy the connector and the associated Azure Function**

>**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying the data connector, have the Workspace ID and Workspace Primary Key (can be copied from the following), as well as Azure Blob Storage connection string and container name, readily available.



Option 1 - Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template

Use this method for automated deployment of the data connector using an ARM Template.

1. Click the **Deploy to Azure** button below. 

	[![Deploy To Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://aka.ms/sentinel-CiscoDuoSecurity-azuredeploy) [![Deploy to Azure Gov](https://aka.ms/deploytoazuregovbutton)](https://aka.ms/sentinel-CiscoDuoSecurity-azuredeploy-gov)
2. Select the preferred **Subscription**, **Resource Group** and **Location**. 
3. Enter the **Cisco Duo Integration Key**, **Cisco Duo Secret Key**, **Cisco Duo API Hostname**, **Cisco Duo Log Types**, **Microsoft Sentinel Workspace Id**, **Microsoft Sentinel Shared Key**
4. Mark the checkbox labeled **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**.
5. Click **Purchase** to deploy.

Option 2 - Manual Deployment of Azure Functions

Use the following step-by-step instructions to deploy the data connector manually with Azure Functions (Deployment via Visual Studio Code).
