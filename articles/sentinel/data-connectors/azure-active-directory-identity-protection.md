# Microsoft Entra ID Protection connector for Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft Entra ID Protection provides a consolidated view at risk users, risk events and vulnerabilities, with the ability to remediate risk immediately, and set policies to auto-remediate future events. The service is built on Microsoft’s experience protecting consumer identities and gains tremendous accuracy from the signal from over 13 billion logins a day. Integrate Microsoft Entra ID Protection alerts with Microsoft Sentinel to view dashboards, create custom alerts, and improve investigation. For more information, see the [Microsoft Sentinel documentation ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2220065&wt.mc_id=sentinel_dataconnectordocs_content_cnl_csasci).
