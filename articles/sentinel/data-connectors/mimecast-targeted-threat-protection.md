## Prerequisites

To integrate with Mimecast Targeted Threat Protection (using Azure Functions) make sure you have: 

- **Microsoft.Web/sites permissions**: Read and write permissions to Azure Functions to create a Function App is required. [See the documentation to learn more about Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/).
- **REST API Credentials/permissions**: You need to have the following pieces of information to configure the integration:
- mimecastEmail: Email address of a dedicated Mimecast admin user
- mimecastPassword: Password for the dedicated Mimecast admin user
- mimecastAppId: API Application Id of the Mimecast Microsoft Sentinel app registered with Mimecast
- mimecastAppKey: API Application Key of the Mimecast Microsoft Sentinel app registered with Mimecast
- mimecastAccessKey: Access Key for the dedicated Mimecast admin user
- mimecastSecretKey: Secret Key for the dedicated Mimecast admin user
- mimecastBaseURL: Mimecast Regional API Base URL

> The Mimecast Application Id, Application Key, along with the Access Key and Secret keys for the dedicated Mimecast admin user are obtainable via the Mimecast Administration Console: Administration | Services | API and Platform Integrations.

> The Mimecast API Base URL for each region is documented here: https://integrations.mimecast.com/documentation/api-overview/global-base-urls/


## Vendor installation instructions

Resource group

You need to have a resource group created with a subscription you are going to use.

Functions app

You need to have an Azure App registered for this connector to use
1. Application Id
2. Tenant Id
3. Client Id
4. Client Secret


> [!NOTE]
   >  This connector uses Azure Functions to connect to a Mimecast API to pull its logs into Microsoft Sentinel. This might result in additional data ingestion costs. Check the [Azure Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/) for details.


>**(Optional Step)** Securely store workspace and API authorization key(s) or token(s) in Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. [Follow these instructions](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Function App.

Configuration:

**STEP 1 - Configuration steps for the Mimecast API**

Go to ***Azure portal ---> App registrations ---> [your_app] ---> Certificates & secrets ---> New client secret*** and create a new secret (save the Value somewhere safe right away because you will not be able to preview it later)


**STEP 2 - Deploy Mimecast API Connector**

>**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying the Mimecast API connector, have the Workspace ID  and Workspace Primary Key (can be copied from the following), as well as the Mimecast API authorization key(s) or Token, readily available.



Deploy the Mimecast Targeted Threat Protection Data Connector:


1. Click the **Deploy to Azure** button below. 

	[![Deploy To Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://aka.ms/sentinel-MimecastTTP-azuredeploy)
2. Select the preferred **Subscription**, **Resource Group** and **Location**. 
3. Enter the following fields:
 - appName: Unique string that will be used as id for the app in Azure platform
 - objectId: Azure portal ---> Azure Active Directory ---> more info ---> Profile -----> Object ID
 - appInsightsLocation(default): westeurope
 - mimecastEmail: Email address of dedicated user for this integraion
 - mimecastPassword: Password for dedicated user
 - mimecastAppId: Application Id from the Microsoft Sentinel app registered with Mimecast
 - mimecastAppKey: Application Key from the Microsoft Sentinel app registered with Mimecast
 - mimecastAccessKey: Access Key for the dedicated Mimecast user
 - mimecastSecretKey: Secret Key for dedicated Mimecast user
 - mimecastBaseURL: Regional Mimecast API Base URL
 - activeDirectoryAppId: Azure portal ---> App registrations ---> [your_app] ---> Application ID
 - activeDirectoryAppSecret: Azure portal ---> App registrations ---> [your_app] ---> Certificates & secrets ---> [your_app_secret]
 - workspaceId: Azure portal ---> Log Analytics Workspaces ---> [Your workspace] ---> Agents ---> Workspace ID (or you can copy workspaceId from above) 
 - workspaceKey:  Azure portal ---> Log Analytics Workspaces ---> [Your workspace] ---> Agents ---> Primary Key (or you can copy workspaceKey from above) 
 - AppInsightsWorkspaceResourceID : Azure portal ---> Log Analytics Workspaces ---> [Your workspace] ---> Properties ---> Resource ID 

 >Note: If using Azure Key Vault secrets for any of the values above, use the`@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri={Security Identifier})`schema in place of the string values. Refer to [Key Vault references documentation](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) for further details.

4. Mark the checkbox labeled **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**. 
5. Click **Purchase** to deploy.

6. Go to ***Azure portal ---> Resource groups ---> [your_resource_group] --->  [appName](type: Storage account) ---> Storage Explorer ---> BLOB CONTAINERS ---> TTP checkpoints ---> Upload*** and create empty files on your machine named attachment-checkpoint.txt, impersonation-checkpoint.txt, url-checkpoint.txt and select them for upload (this is done so that date_range for TTP logs are stored in consistent state)
