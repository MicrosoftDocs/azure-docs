# 1Password (using Azure Functions) connector for Microsoft Sentinel

The [1Password](https://www.1password.com) solution for Microsoft Sentinel enables you to ingest sign-in attempts, item usage, and audit events from your 1Password Business account using the [1Password Events Reporting API](https://developer.1password.com/docs/events-api). This allows you to monitor and investigate events in 1Password in Microsoft Sentinel along with the other applications and services your organization uses.

**Underlying Microsoft Technologies used:**

This solution depends on the following technologies, and some of which may be in [Preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) state or may incur additional ingestion or operational costs:

[Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/#overview)

   ```



## Prerequisites

To integrate with 1Password (using Azure Functions) make sure you have: 

- **Microsoft.Web/sites permissions**: Read and write permissions to Azure Functions to create a Function App is required. [See the documentation to learn more about Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/).
- **1Password Events API Token**: A 1Password Events API Token is required. [See the documentation to learn more about the 1Password API](https://developer.1password.com/docs/events-api/reference). 
- A 1Password Business account is required.


## Vendor installation instructions


> [!NOTE]
>  This connector uses Azure Functions to connect to 1Password to pull logs into Microsoft Sentinel. This might result in additional data ingestion costs from Azure. Check the [Azure Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/) for details.

**(Optional Step)** Securely store workspace and API authorization key(s) or token(s) in Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. [Follow these instructions](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Function App.


**STEP 1 - Configuration steps for the 1Password Events Reporting API**

[Follow these instructions](https://support.1password.com/events-reporting/#appendix-issue-or-revoke-bearer-tokens) provided by 1Password to obtain an Events Reporting API Token. A 1Password Business account is required.


**STEP 2 - Deploy the functionApp using DeployToAzure button to create the table, data collection rule, and the associated Azure Function**

**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying the 1Password connector, a custom table needs to be created.

Option 1 - Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template

This method provides an automated deployment of the 1Password connector using an ARM Tempate.

1. Click the **Deploy to Azure** button below. 

	[![Deploy To Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://aka.ms/sentinel-OnePassword-azuredeploy)
2. Select the preferred **Subscription**, **Resource Group**, and **Location**. 
3. Enter the **Workspace Name**, **Workspace Name**, **1Password Events API Key**, and **URI**.
     - The default **Time Interval** is set to five (5) minutes. If you'd like to modify the interval, you can adjust the Function App Timer Trigger accordingly (in the function.json file, post deployment) to prevent overlapping data ingestion.
     - If using Azure Key Vault secrets for any of the values above, use the`@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri={Security Identifier})`schema in place of the string values. Refer to [Key Vault references documentation](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) for further details. 
4. Mark the checkbox labeled **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**. 
5. Click **Purchase** to deploy.
