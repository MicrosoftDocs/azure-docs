# NXLog LinuxAudit connector for Microsoft Sentinel

The [NXLog LinuxAudit](https://docs.nxlog.co/refman/current/im/linuxaudit.html) data connector supports custom audit rules and collects logs without auditd or any other user-space software. IP addresses and group/user IDs are resolved to their respective names making [Linux audit](https://docs.nxlog.co/userguide/integrate/linux-audit.html) logs more intelligible to security analysts. This REST API connector can efficiently export Linux security events to Microsoft Sentinel in real-time.
