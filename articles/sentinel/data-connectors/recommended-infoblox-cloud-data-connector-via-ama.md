## Vendor installation instructions


>**IMPORTANT:** This Microsoft Sentinel data connector assumes an Infoblox Data Connector host has already been created and configured in the Infoblox Cloud Services Portal (CSP). As the [**Infoblox Data Connector**](https://docs.infoblox.com/display/BloxOneThreatDefense/Deploying+the+Data+Connector+Solution) is a feature of Threat Defense, access to an appropriate Threat Defense subscription is required. See this [**quick-start guide**](https://www.infoblox.com/wp-content/uploads/infoblox-deployment-guide-data-connector.pdf) for more information and licensing requirements.

1. Linux Syslog agent configuration

Install and configure the Linux agent to collect your Common Event Format (CEF) Syslog messages and forward them to Microsoft Sentinel.

> Notice that the data from all regions will be stored in the selected workspace

1.1 Select or create a Linux machine

Select or create a Linux machine that Microsoft Sentinel will use as the proxy between your security solution and Microsoft Sentinel this machine can be on your on-prem environment, Azure or other clouds.

1.2 Install the CEF collector on the Linux machine

Install the Microsoft Monitoring Agent on your Linux machine and configure the machine to listen on the necessary port and forward messages to your Microsoft Sentinel workspace. The CEF collector collects CEF messages on port 514 TCP.

> 1. Make sure that you have Python on your machine using the following command: python -version.

> 2. You must have elevated permissions (sudo) on your machine.

   Run the following command to install and apply the CEF collector:

   `sudo wget -O cef_installer.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/DataConnectors/CEF/cef_installer.py&&sudo python cef_installer.py {0} {1}`

2. Configure Infoblox to send Syslog data to the Infoblox Cloud Data Connector to forward to the Syslog agent

Follow the steps below to configure the Infoblox CDC to send  data to Microsoft Sentinel via the Linux Syslog agent.
1. Navigate to **Manage > Data Connector**.
2. Click the **Destination Configuration** tab at the top.
3. Click **Create > Syslog**. 
 - **Name**: Give the new Destination a meaningful **name**, such as **Microsoft-Sentinel-Destination**.
 - **Description**: Optionally give it a meaningful **description**.
 - **State**: Set the state to **Enabled**.
 - **Format**: Set the format to **CEF**.
 - **FQDN/IP**: Enter the IP address of the Linux device on which the Linux agent is installed.
 - **Port**: Leave the port number at **514**.
 - **Protocol**: Select desired protocol and CA certificate if applicable.
 - Click **Save & Close**.
4. Click the **Traffic Flow Configuration** tab at the top.
5. Click **Create**.
 - **Name**: Give the new Traffic Flow a meaningful **name**, such as **Microsoft-Sentinel-Flow**.
 - **Description**: Optionally give it a meaningful **description**. 
 - **State**: Set the state to **Enabled**. 
 - Expand the **Service Instance** section. 
    - **Service Instance**: Select your desired Service Instance for which the Data Connector service is enabled. 
 - Expand the **Source Configuration** section.  
    - **Source**: Select **BloxOne Cloud Source**. 
    - Select all desired **log types** you wish to collect. Currently supported log types are:
      - Threat Defense Query/Response Log
      - Threat Defense Threat Feeds Hits Log
      - DDI Query/Response Log
      - DDI DHCP Lease Log
 - Expand the **Destination Configuration** section.  
    - Select the **Destination** you just created. 
 - Click **Save & Close**. 
6. Allow the configuration some time to activate.

3. Validate connection

Follow the instructions to validate your connectivity:

Open Log Analytics to check if the logs are received using the CommonSecurityLog schema.

>It may take about 20 minutes until the connection streams data to your workspace.

If the logs are not received, run the following connectivity validation script:

> 1. Make sure that you have Python on your machine using the following command: python -version

>2. You must have elevated permissions (sudo) on your machine

   Run the following command to validate your connectivity:

   `sudo wget  -O cef_troubleshoot.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/DataConnectors/CEF/cef_troubleshoot.py&&sudo python cef_troubleshoot.py  {0}`

4. Secure your machine 

Make sure to configure the machine's security according to your organization's security policy
