## Vendor installation instructions


> [!NOTE]
   >  This connector uses Azure Functions to connect to Feedly to pull IoCs into Microsoft Sentinel. This might result in additional data ingestion costs. Check the [Azure Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/) for details.

(Optional Step) Securely store workspace and API authorization key(s) or token(s) in Azure Key Vault.

Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. [Follow these instructions](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Function App.

Step 1 - Get your Feedly API token

Go to https://feedly.com/i/team/api and generate a new API token for the connector.

Step 2 - Deploy the connector

Choose ONE from the following two deployment options to deploy the connector and the associated Azure Function**

>**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying the Feedly connector, have the Workspace ID and Workspace Primary Key (can be copied from the following), as well as the Feedly API Token, readily available.

3. Enter the SentinelWorkspaceId, SentinelWorkspaceKey, FeedlyApiKey, FeedlyStreamIds, DaysToBackfill. 
>Note: If using Azure Key Vault secrets for any of the values above, use the`@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri={Security Identifier})`schema in place of the string values. Refer to [Key Vault references documentation](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) for further details. 
4. Mark the checkbox labeled **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**.
