# Dynatrace Runtime Vulnerabilities connector for Microsoft Sentinel

This connector uses the [Dynatrace Security Problem REST API](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/application-security/vulnerabilities/get-vulnerabilities) to ingest detected runtime vulnerabilities into Microsoft Sentinel Log Analytics.
