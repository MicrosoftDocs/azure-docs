   >  This data connector depends on a parser based on a Kusto Function to work as expected. Follow the steps for each Parser to create the Kusto Functions alias : [**ExchangeConfiguration**](https://aka.ms/sentinel-ESI-ExchangeConfiguration-Online-parser) and [**ExchangeEnvironmentList**](https://aka.ms/sentinel-ESI-ExchangeEnvironmentList-Online-parser) 

**STEP 1 - Parsers deployment**
