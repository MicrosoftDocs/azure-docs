# Windows Forwarded Events connector for Microsoft Sentinel

You can stream all Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) logs from the Windows Servers connected to your Microsoft Sentinel workspace using Azure Monitor Agent (AMA).
	This connection enables you to view dashboards, create custom alerts, and improve investigation.
	This gives you more insight into your organizationâ€™s network and improves your security operation capabilities. For more information, see the [Microsoft Sentinel documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2219963&wt.mc_id=sentinel_dataconnectordocs_content_cnl_csasci).
