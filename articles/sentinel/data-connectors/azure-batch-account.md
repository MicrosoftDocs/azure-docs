# Azure Batch Account connector for Microsoft Sentinel

Azure Batch Account is a uniquely identified entity within the Batch service. Most Batch solutions use Azure Storage for storing resource files and output files, so each Batch account is usually associated with a corresponding storage account. This connector lets you stream your Azure Batch account diagnostics logs into Microsoft Sentinel, allowing you to continuously monitor activity. For more information, see the [Microsoft Sentinel documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2224103&wt.mc_id=sentinel_dataconnectordocs_content_cnl_csasci).
