## Prerequisites

To integrate with Cisco Umbrella (using Azure Functions) make sure you have: 

- **Microsoft.Web/sites permissions**: Read and write permissions to Azure Functions to create a Function App is required. [See the documentation to learn more about Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/).
- **Amazon S3 REST API Credentials/permissions**: **AWS Access Key Id**, **AWS Secret Access Key**, **AWS S3 Bucket Name** are required for Amazon S3 REST API.


## Vendor installation instructions


> [!NOTE]
   >  This connector uses Azure Functions to connect to the Amazon S3 REST API to pull logs into Microsoft Sentinel. This might result in additional data ingestion costs. Check the [Azure Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/) for details.


> [!NOTE]
   >  This connector has been updated to support [cisco umbrella version 5 and version 6.](https://docs.umbrella.com/deployment-umbrella/docs/log-formats-and-versioning)


>**(Optional Step)** Securely store workspace and API authorization key(s) or token(s) in Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. [Follow these instructions](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Functions App.


> [!NOTE]
   >  This connector uses a parser based on a Kusto Function to normalize fields. [Follow these steps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Parsers/CiscoUmbrella/Cisco_Umbrella) to create the Kusto function alias **Cisco_Umbrella**.


**STEP 1 - Configuration of the Cisco Umbrella logs collection**

[See documentation](https://docs.umbrella.com/deployment-umbrella/docs/log-management#section-logging-to-amazon-s-3) and follow the instructions for set up logging and obtain credentials.


**STEP 2 - Choose ONE from the following two deployment options to deploy the connector and the associated Azure Functions**

>**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying the Cisco Umbrella data connector, have the Workspace ID and Workspace Primary Key (can be copied from the following), as well as the Amazon S3 REST API Authorization credentials, readily available.
