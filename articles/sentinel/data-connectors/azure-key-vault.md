# Azure Key Vault connector for Microsoft Sentinel

Azure Key Vault is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, or cryptographic keys.   This connector lets you stream your Azure Key Vault diagnostics logs into Microsoft Sentinel, allowing you to continuously monitor activity in all your instances. For more information, see the [Microsoft Sentinel documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2220125&wt.mc_id=sentinel_dataconnectordocs_content_cnl_csasci).
