## Prerequisites

To integrate with Fortinet FortiNDR Cloud (using Azure Functions) make sure you have: 

- **Microsoft.Web/sites permissions**: Read and write permissions to Azure Functions to create a Function App is required. [See the documentation to learn more about Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/).

- **API Credentials**: **FortiNDR Cloud API Token**, **FortiNDR Cloud Account UUID** are required to retrieve detection data.


## Vendor installation instructions


> [!NOTE]
   >  This connector uses Azure Functions to connect to the FortiNDR Cloud API to pull logs into Microsoft Sentinel. This might result in additional data ingestion costs. Check the [Azure Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/) for details.


>**(Optional Step)** Securely store workspace and API authorization key(s) or token(s) in Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. [Follow these instructions](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Function App.


> [!NOTE]
   >  This connector uses a parser based on a Kusto Function to normalize fields. [Follow these steps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Solutions/Fortinet%20FortiNDR%20Cloud/Parsers/Fortinet_FortiNDR_Cloud.md) to create the Kusto function alias **Fortinet_FortiNDR_Cloud**.


**STEP 1 - Configuration steps for the Fortinet FortiNDR Cloud Logs Collection**

The provider should provide or link to detailed steps to configure the 'PROVIDER NAME APPLICATION NAME' API endpoint so that the Azure Function can authenticate to it successfully, get its authorization key or token, and pull the appliance's logs into Microsoft Sentinel.


**STEP 2 - Choose ONE from the following two deployment options to deploy the connector and the associated Azure Function**

>**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying the Fortinet FortiNDR Cloud connector, have the Workspace ID  and Workspace Primary Key (can be copied from the following), as well as the as well as the FortiNDR Cloud API credentials (available in FortiNDR Cloud account management), readily available.
