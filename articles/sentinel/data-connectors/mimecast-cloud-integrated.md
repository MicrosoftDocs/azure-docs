## Prerequisites

To integrate with Mimecast Cloud Integrated (using Azure Functions) make sure you have: 

- **Azure Subscription**: Azure Subscription with owner role is required to register an application in Microsoft Entra ID and assign role of contributor to app in resource group.
- **Microsoft.Web/sites permissions**: Read and write permissions to Azure Functions to create a Function App is required. [See the documentation to learn more about Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/).
- **REST API Credentials/permissions**: See the documentation to learn more about API on the [Rest API reference](https://integrations.mimecast.com/documentation/)


## Vendor installation instructions

Resource group

You need to have a resource group created with a subscription you are going to use.

Functions app

You need to have an Azure App registered for this connector to use
1. Application Id
2. Tenant Id
3. Client Id
4. Client Secret


> [!NOTE]
   >  This connector uses Azure Functions to connect to a Mimecast API to pull its logs into Microsoft Sentinel. This might result in additional data ingestion costs. Check the [Azure Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/) for details.


>**(Optional Step)** Securely store workspace and API authorization key(s) or token(s) in Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. [Follow these instructions](/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Function App.

Configuration:

**STEP 1 - Configuration steps for the Mimecast API**

Go to ***Azure portal ---> App registrations ---> [your_app] ---> Certificates & secrets ---> New client secret*** and create a new secret (save the Value somewhere safe right away because you will not be able to preview it later)


**STEP 2 - Deploy Mimecast API Connector**

>**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying the Mimecast API connector, have the Workspace ID  and Workspace Primary Key (can be copied from the following), as well as the Mimecast API authorization key(s) or Token, readily available.
