|**Build a connector**|Microsoft Sentinel is built on data. Most solutions start with bringing the data from a customer’s environment into Microsoft Sentinel. To understand how to build a connector, refer to the following resources. <br><br> For more information, see:<br> [Guide to Building Microsoft Sentinel Data Experiences](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/DataConnectors/ReadMe.md) <br>[Webinar: Creating Data Connectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXCh17rgtLU) <br>[Microsoft Sentinel Tech Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/microsoft-sentinel/blog/microsoftsentinelblog) |
|**Build your content**|In addition to data, your solution can offer a rich array of other components to help customers get the most out of your data. For example, you can offer detections, workbooks, playbooks, and hunting queries to make your offering readily usable by customers. <br><br> For more information, see:<br> [What can you contribute and how can you create contributions?](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/wiki)|
|**Open GitHub pull request**|Once your solution is ready for review, raise a pull request (PR) in the Microsoft Sentinel solutions repository. Microsoft Sentinel engineering staff reviews your PR for best practices. <br><br> For more information, see:<br> [Create a Microsoft Sentinel Pull Request](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel?tab=readme-ov-file#pull-request)|

## Test your solution 
Once the solution is built, you need to test it to ensure that it meets the quality standards and is ready for publishing. The Microsoft Sentinel engineering staff reviews your solution and provides feedback.

|Step| Description|

|**Resolve technical feedback**|After you open your pull request, a member of the Microsoft Sentinel engineering staff reviews it for best practices. If more changes are needed before publishing, you find the necessary changes described in the comments attached to the pull request.|
|**Microsoft merges PR & generates package**|Upon the successful completion of all technical feedback, Microsoft Sentinel engineering staff merges the pull request into the main branch, and generates the final package you need to submit with your offer.|

## Publish to Azure Commercial Marketplace
Once your solution is built, tested, and certified, you can publish it to the Azure Commercial Marketplace. This section provides guidance on how to publish your solution.

|Step| Description|
|--|--|
|**Create an offer**|After your solution is merged into the Microsoft Sentinel solutions repository, you’re ready to create an offer in the commercial marketplace. For more information on how to publish your solution, see the following resources. <br><br> For more information, see:<br> [Publish Solutions to Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/publish-sentinel-solutions)|
|**Test Offer Preview**|During the preview creation phase, we create a version of your offer that is accessible only to the preview audience you specified. Creating a preview offer ensures that specific audiences test your solution before your solution is broadly shared with all customers. <br><br> For more information, see:<br> [Status of Microsoft Sentinel solution after publishing in the Microsoft Partner center](/azure/sentinel/sentinel-solutions-post-publish-tracking)|
|**'Go Live' to Publish Offer**|Ensure that you validated all aspects of your solution in preview phase before you make the offer live.

|**Fix certification issues**|Offers submitted to the commercial marketplace must be certified before being published. If your offer fails any of the checks or if you aren't eligible to submit an offer of that type, a certification failure report is sent to your email address. The errors also show up within Action Center in Partner Center. For more information, see [Certification issues](/azure/sentinel/sentinel-solutions-post-publish-tracking#step-4-certification). After the issues are fixed, you can resubmit the offer for certification. This triggers the review process again and once the offer passes certification. Your solution is published to the marketplace and available for customers in Microsoft Sentinel content hub within two working days.|

## Preview
After your solution is published to the Azure Commercial Marketplace, you can make it available to customers in preview mode. This section provides guidance on how to make your solution available to customers in preview mode.

|--|--|
|**Inform customers**|Socialize the availability of your solution with your customers so that they can test and provide feedback on the solution.|
|**Resolve support issues**|As customers use the preview version of your solution, they might encounter issues. Be prepared to address these issues as they arise. In addition to issues, customers might also request new features or enhancements. Depending on the feedback, you need to iterate on your solution before making it generally available.|
|**Continue for four weeks**|We recommend keeping your solution in preview for at least four weeks to gather feedback from customers and address any issues that arise.|

## Go to Market (GTM)
After your solution is in preview for at least four weeks and you address any issues that customers encounter, you can make your solution generally available to all customers.

|Step| Description|
