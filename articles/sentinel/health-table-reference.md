#Customer intent: As a security engineer, I want to understand the fields in the SentinelHealth table so that I can monitor the health and performance of my SIEM resources effectively.

# Microsoft Sentinel health tables reference 

This article describes the fields in the *SentinelHealth* table used for monitoring the health of Microsoft Sentinel resources. With the Microsoft Sentinel [health monitoring feature](health-audit.md), you can keep tabs on the proper functioning of your SIEM and get information on any health drifts in your environment. 

Learn how to query and use the health table for deeper monitoring and visibility of actions in your environment:
- For [data connectors](monitor-data-connector-health.md)
- For [automation rules and playbooks](monitor-automation-health.md)
- For [analytics rules](monitor-analytics-rule-integrity.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The *SentinelHealth* data table is currently in **PREVIEW**. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

Microsoft Sentinel's health monitoring feature covers different kinds of resources (see the resource types in the **SentinelResourceType** field in the first table below). Many of the data fields in the following tables apply across resource types, but some have specific applications for each type. The descriptions below will indicate one way or the other.

## SentinelHealth table columns schema

The following table describes the columns and data generated in the SentinelHealth data table:

| ColumnName               | ColumnType     | Description                                                   |

## Extended properties

### Data connectors

For `Data fetch status change` events with a success indicator, the bag contains a ‘DestinationTable’ property to indicate where data from this resource is expected to land. For failures, the contents vary depending on the failure type. 

### Automation rules
