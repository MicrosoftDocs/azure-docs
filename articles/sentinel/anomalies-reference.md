# Anomalies detected by the Microsoft Sentinel machine learning engine

Microsoft Sentinel detects anomalies by analyzing the behavior of users in an environment over a period of time and constructing a baseline of legitimate activity. Once the baseline is established, any activity outside the normal parameters is considered anomalous and therefore suspicious.

Microsoft Sentinel uses two models to create baselines and detect anomalies.

- [UEBA anomalies](#ueba-anomalies)
- [Machine learning-based anomalies](#machine-learning-based-anomalies)

This article lists the anomalies that Microsoft Sentinel detects using various machine learning models.


In the [Anomalies](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/anomalies) table:
- The `rulename` column indicates the rule Sentinel used to identify each anomaly. 
- The `score` column contains a numerical value between 0 and 1, which quantifies the degree of deviation from the expected behavior. Higher scores indicate greater deviation from the baseline and are more likely to be true anomalies. Lower scores might still be anomalous, but are less likely to be significant or actionable.


> [!NOTE]
> These anomaly detections are discontinued as of March 26, 2024, due to low quality of results:
> - Domain Reputation Palo Alto anomaly
> - Multi-region logins in a single day via Palo Alto GlobalProtect

## UEBA anomalies

Sentinel UEBA detects anomalies based on dynamic baselines created for each entity across various data inputs. Each entity's baseline behavior is set according to its own historical activities, those of its peers, and those of the organization as a whole. Anomalies can be triggered by the correlation of different attributes such as action type, geo-location, device, resource, ISP, and more.

You must [enable UEBA and anomaly detection in your Sentinel workspace](enable-entity-behavior-analytics.md) to detect UEBA anomalies.

UEBA detects anomalies based on these anomaly rules:

### UEBA Anomalous Account Access Removal

**Description:** An attacker may interrupt the availability of system and network resources by blocking access to accounts used by legitimate users. The attacker might delete, lock, or manipulate an account (for example, by changing its credentials) to remove access to it.

### UEBA Anomalous Account Creation

**Description:** Adversaries may create an account to maintain access to targeted systems. With a sufficient level of access, creating such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access without requiring persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.

| Attribute                        | Value                                                              |

### UEBA Anomalous Account Manipulation

**Description:** Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain access to target systems. These actions include adding new accounts to high-privileged groups. Dragonfly 2.0, for example, added newly created accounts to the administrators group to maintain elevated access. The query below generates an output of all high-Blast Radius users performing "Update user" (name change) to privileged role, or ones that changed users for the first time.

| Attribute                        | Value                                                              |

### UEBA Anomalous Authentication (Preview)

**Description:** Unusual authentication activity across signals from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Entra ID, including device logons, managed identity sign-ins, and service principal authentications from Microsoft Entra ID. These anomalies may suggest credential misuse, non-human identity abuse, or lateral movement attempts outside typical access patterns.

### UEBA Anomalous Data Destruction

**Description:** Adversaries may destroy data and files on specific systems or in large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services, and network resources. Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives.

| Attribute                        | Value                                                              |

### UEBA Anomalous Logon in AwsCloudTrail (Preview)

**Description:** Unusual logon activity in Amazon Web Services (AWS) services based on CloudTrail events such as ConsoleLogin and other authentication-related attributes. Anomalies are determined by deviations in user behavior based on attributes like geolocation, device fingerprint, ISP, and access method, and may indicate unauthorized access attempts or potential policy violations.

## Machine learning-based anomalies

Microsoft Sentinel's customizable, machine learning-based anomalies can identify anomalous behavior with analytics rule templates that can be put to work right out of the box. While anomalies don't necessarily indicate malicious or even suspicious behavior by themselves, they can be used to improve detections, investigations, and threat hunting.

### Anomalous Azure operations

**Description:** This detection algorithm collects 21 days' worth of data on Azure operations grouped by user to train this ML model. The algorithm then generates anomalies in the case of users who performed sequences of operations uncommon in their workspaces. The trained ML model scores the operations performed by the user and considers anomalous those whose score is greater than the defined threshold.

### Detect machine generated network beaconing behavior

**Description:** This algorithm identifies beaconing patterns from network traffic connection logs based on recurrent time delta patterns. Any network connection towards untrusted public networks at repetitive time deltas is an indication of malware callbacks or data exfiltration attempts. The algorithm will calculate the time delta between consecutive network connections between the same source IP and destination IP, as well as the number of connections in a time-delta sequence between the same sources and destinations. The percentage of beaconing is calculated as the connections in time-delta sequence against total connections in a day.
