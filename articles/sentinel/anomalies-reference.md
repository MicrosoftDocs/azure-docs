# Anomalies detected by the Microsoft Sentinel machine learning engine

This article lists the anomalies that Microsoft Sentinel detects using different machine learning models.

Anomaly detection works by analyzing the behavior of users in an environment over a period of time and constructing a baseline of legitimate activity. Once the baseline is established, any activity outside the normal parameters is considered anomalous and therefore suspicious.

Microsoft Sentinel uses two different models to create baselines and detect anomalies.

## UEBA anomalies

Sentinel UEBA detects anomalies based on dynamic baselines created for each entity across various data inputs. Each entity's baseline behavior is set according to its own historical activities, those of its peers, and those of the organization as a whole. Anomalies can be triggered by the correlation of different attributes such as action type, geo-location, device, resource, ISP, and more.

You must [enable the UEBA feature](enable-entity-behavior-analytics.md) for UEBA anomalies to be detected.

## Machine learning-based anomalies

Microsoft Sentinel's customizable, machine learning-based anomalies can identify anomalous behavior with analytics rule templates that can be put to work right out of the box. While anomalies don't necessarily indicate malicious or even suspicious behavior by themselves, they can be used to improve detections, investigations, and threat hunting.

### Anomalous scanning activity

**Description:** This algorithm looks for port scanning activity, coming from a single source IP to one or more destination IPs, that is not normally seen in a given environment.

The algorithm takes into account whether the IP is public/external or private/internal, and the event is marked accordingly. Only private-to-public or public-to-private activity is considered at this time. Scanning activity can indicate an attacker attempting to determine available services in an environment that can be potentially exploited and used for ingress or lateral movement. A high number of source ports and high number of destination ports from a single source IP to either a single or multiple destination IP or IPs can be interesting and indicate anomalous scanning. Additionally, if there is a high ratio of destination IPs to the single source IP this can indicate anomalous scanning.

Configuration details:
- Job run default is daily, with hourly bins.  
    The algorithm uses the following configurable defaults to limit the results based on hourly bins.
- Included device actions - accept, allow, start
- Excluded ports - 53, 67, 80, 8080, 123, 137, 138, 443, 445, 3389
- Distinct destination port count >= 600
- Distinct source port count >= 600
- Distinct source port count divided by distinct destination port, ratio converted to percent >= 99.99
- Source IP (always 1) divided by destination IP, ratio converted to percent >= 99.99

### Anomalous web request activity

**Description:** This algorithm groups W3CIISLog events into hourly sessions grouped by site name and URI stem. The machine learning model identifies sessions with unusually high numbers of requests that triggered 5xx-class response codes in the last day. 5xx-class codes are an indication that some application instability or error condition has been triggered by the request. They can be an indication that an attacker is probing the URI stem for vulnerabilities and configuration issues, performing some exploitation activity such as SQL injection, or leveraging an unpatched vulnerability. This algorithm uses 6 days of data for training.

### Detect machine generated network beaconing behavior

**Description:** This algorithm identifies beaconing patterns from network traffic connection logs based on recurrent time delta patterns. Any network connection towards untrusted public networks at repetitive time deltas is an indication of malware callbacks or data exfiltration attempts. The algorithm will calculate the time delta between consecutive network connections between the same source IP and destination IP, as well as the number of connections in a time-delta sequence between the same sources and destinations. The percentage of beaconing is calculated as the connections in time-delta sequence against total connections in a day.

### Unusual network communication on commonly used ports

**Description:** This algorithm identifies unusual network communication on commonly used ports, comparing daily traffic to a baseline from the previous 7 days. This includes traffic on commonly used ports (22, 53, 80, 443, 8080, 8888), and compares daily traffic to the mean and standard deviation of several network traffic attributes calculated over the baseline period. The traffic attributes considered are daily total events, daily data transfer and number of distinct source IP addresses per port. An anomaly is triggered when the daily values are greater than the configured number of standard deviations above the mean.

### Unusual web traffic detected with IP in URL path

**Description:** This algorithm identifies unusual web requests listing an IP address as the host. The algorithm finds all web requests with IP addresses in the URL path and compares them with the previous week of data to exclude known benign traffic. After excluding known benign traffic, it triggers an anomaly only after exceeding certain thresholds with configured values such as total web requests, numbers of URLs seen with same host destination IP address, and number of distinct source IPs within the set of URLs with the same destination IP address. This type of request can indicate an attempt to bypass URL reputation services for malicious purposes.
