# Microsoft Sentinel operational guide

This article lists the operational activities that we recommend security operations (SOC) teams and security administrators plan for and run as part of their regular security activities with Microsoft Sentinel. For more information about managing your security operations, see [Security operations overview](/security/operations/overview).

## Daily tasks

Schedule the following activities daily.

| Task | description |
| --- | --- |
| **Triage and investigate incidents** | Review the Microsoft Sentinel **Incidents** page to check for new incidents generated by the currently configured analytics rules, and start investigating any new incidents. For more information, see:<li>[Navigate, triage, and manage Microsoft Sentinel incidents in the Azure portal](incident-navigate-triage.md)<li>[Investigate Microsoft Sentinel incidents in depth in the Azure portal](investigate-incidents.md) |
| **Explore hunting queries and bookmarks** | Explore results for all built-in queries, and update existing hunting queries and bookmarks. Manually generate new incidents or update old incidents if applicable. For more information, see:<li>[Create your own incidents manually in Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal (Preview)](create-incident-manually.md)<li>[Hunt for threats with Microsoft Sentinel](hunting.md)<li>[Keep track of data during hunting with Microsoft Sentinel](bookmarks.md) |
| **Analytics rules** | Review and enable new analytics rules as applicable, including both newly released or newly available rules from recently deployed solutions. For more information, see:<li>[Create scheduled analytics rules from templates](create-analytics-rule-from-template.md)<li>[About Microsoft Sentinel content and solutions](sentinel-solutions.md)<br><br>Monitor the health and optimize the execution of your analytics rules.

| **Data connectors** | Review the health status of your data connectors to ensure that data is flowing. Check for new connectors, and review ingestion to ensure set limits aren't exceeded. For more information, see [Monitor the health of your data connectors](monitor-data-connector-health.md). |
| **Azure Monitor Agent** | Verify that servers and workstations are actively connected to the workspace, and troubleshoot and remediate any failed connections. For more information, see [Azure Monitor Agent overview](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-overview). |
