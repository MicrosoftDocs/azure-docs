# Azure Sentinel File Event normalization schema reference (Public preview)

The File Event normalization schema is used to describe file activity such as creating, modifying or deleting files or documents. Such events are reported by operating systems, file storage systems such as Azure Files, and document management systems such as Microsoft SharePoint.

For more information about normalization in Azure Sentinel, see [Normalization and the Azure Sentinel Information Model (ASIM)](normalization.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The File Event normalization schema is currently in public preview.
> This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Parsers

Azure Sentinel provides the following built-in, product-specific file event parsers:

- **Sysmon file activity events** (Events 11, 23, and 26), collected using the Log Analytics Agent or Azure Monitor Agent.
- **Microsoft Office 365 Sharepoint and OneDrive events**, collected using the Office Activity connector.
- **Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoints file events**
- **Azure Storage**, including Blob, File, Queue, and Table Storage.

To use the source-agnostic parser that unifies all of the built-in parsers, and ensure that your analysis runs across all the configured sources, use imFileEvent as the table name in your query.

Deploy the [source-agnostic and source-specific parsers](normalization.md#parsers) from the [Azure Sentinel GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/AzSentinelFileEvent).

## Add your own normalized parsers


When implementing custom parsers for the File Event information model, name your KQL functions using the following syntax: `imFileEvent<vendor><Product`.

Add your KQL function to the `imFileEvent` source-agnostic parser to ensure that any content using the File Event model also uses your new parser.

## Normalized content for process activity data

The following Azure Sentinel **Analytics rules** works with any file activity that's normalized using the Azure Sentinel Information Model:

- SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA backdoor hashes (Normalized File Events)
- Exchange Server Vulnerabilities Disclosed March 2021 IoC Match
- HAFNIUM UM Service writing suspicious file
- NOBELIUM - Domain, Hash and IP IOCs - May 2021
- SUNSPOT log file creation 

For more information, see [Create custom analytics rules to detect threats](/azure/sentinel/articles/sentinel/detect-threats-custom.md).


## Schema details

The File Event information model is aligned is the [OSSEM Process entity schema](https://github.com/OTRF/OSSEM/blob/master/docs/cdm/entities/file.md).

### Log Analytics fields

The following fields are generated by Log Analytics for each record, and can be overridden when creating a custom connector.

| Field         | Type     | Discussion      |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <a name="timegenerated"></a>**TimeGenerated** | datetime | The time the event was generated by the reporting device.|
| **_ResourceId**   | guid     | The Azure Resource ID of the reporting device or service, or the log forwarder resource ID for events forwarded using Syslog, CEF or WEF. |
| | | |

> [!NOTE]
> Log Analytics also adds other fields that are less relevant to security use cases. For more information, see [Standard columns in Azure Monitor Logs](../azure-monitor/logs/log-standard-columns.md).
>

## Event fields

Event fields are common to all schemas and describe the activity itself and the reporting device.

| Field               | Class       | Type       |  Description       |
|---------------------|-------------|------------|--------------------|

### File event specific fields

The fields listed in the table below are specific to File events, but are similar to fields in other schemas and follow similar naming conventions.

The File Event schema references the following entities, which are central to file activities:

- **Actor**. The user that initiated the file activity
- **ActingProcess**. The process used by the Actor to initiate the file activity
- **TargetFile**. The file on which the operation was performed
- **Source File (SrcFile)**. Stores file information prior to the operation.

The relationship between these entities is best demonstrated as follows: An **Actor** performs a file operation using an **Acting Process**, which modifies the **Source File** to **Target File**. 

For example: `JohnDoe` (**Actor**) uses `Windows File Explorer` (**Acting process**) to rename `new.doc` (**Source File**) to `old.doc` (**Target File**).

| Field          | Class        | Type       | Description   |
|---------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| **ActingProcessCommandLine** |Optional  |String  | The command line used to run the acting process. <br><br>Example: `"choco.exe" -v` |
|**ActingProcessGuid** |Optional     | String     |  A generated unique identifier (GUID) of the acting process. Enables identifying the process across systems.  <br><br> Example: `EF3BD0BD-2B74-60C5-AF5C-010000001E00`            |
| **ActingProcessId**| Mandatory    | Integer        | The process ID (PID) of the acting process.<br><br>Example:  `48610176`           <br><br>**Note**: The type is defined as *string* to support varying systems, but on Windows and Linux this value must be numeric. <br><br>If you are using a Windows or Linux machine and used a different type, make sure to convert the values. For example, if you used a hexadecimal value, convert it to a decimal value.    |
| <a name="actingprocessname"></a>**ActingProcessName**              | Optional     | String     |   The name of the acting process. This name is commonly derived from the image or executable file that's used to define the initial code and data that's mapped into the process' virtual address space.<br><br>Example: `C:\Windows\explorer.exe`  |
|**Process**| Alias| | Alias to [ActingProcessName](#actingprocessname)|
| <a name="actoruserid"></a>**ActorUserId**    | Recommended  | String     |   A unique ID of the **Actor**. The specific ID depends on the system generating the event. For more information, see [The User entity](normalization.md#the-user-entity).  <br><br>Example: `S-1-5-18`    |
| **ActorUserIdType**| Recommended  | String     |  The type of the ID stored in the [ActorUserId](#actoruserid) field. For more information, see [The User entity](normalization.md#the-user-entity). <br><br>Example: `SID`         |

|**User** | Alias| | Alias to the [ActorUsername](#actorusername) field. <br><br>Example: `CONTOSO\dadmin`|
| **ActorUserType**|Optional | Enumerated| The type of **Actor**. Supported values include: <br><br>- `Regular`<br>- `Machine`<br>- `Admin`<br>- `System`<br>- `Application`<br>- `Service Principal`<br>- `Other` <br><br>**Note**: The source may provide only a value for the [ActorOriginalUserType](#actororiginalusertype) field, which must be analyzed to get the **ActorUserType** value.|

## Path structure

The path should be normalized to match one of the following formats. The format the value is normalized to will be reflected in the respective **FilePathType** field.

|Type  |Example  |Notes  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Windows Local**     |   `C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe`      |      Since Windows path names are case insensitive, this type implies that the value is case insensitive.   |
|**Windows Share**     |      `\\Documents\My Shapes\Favorites.vssx`   | Since Windows path names are case insensitive, this type implies that the value is case insensitive.        |
|**Unix**     |  `/etc/init.d/networking`       |     Since Unix path names are case sensitive, this type implies the value is case sensitive.  <br><br>- Use this type for AWS S3. Concatenate the bucket and key names to create the path. <br><br>- Use this type for Azure Blob storage object keys.   |
|**URL**     |  `https://1drv.ms/p/s!Av04S_*********we`       | Use when the file path is available as a URL. URLs are not limited to http or https as the scheme, Any valid value, including an FTP value, p is valid.         |
|     |         |         |
