# Monitor Zero Trust (TIC 3.0) security architectures with Microsoft Sentinel

[!INCLUDE [zero-trust-principles](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/security/zero-trust-principles.md)]

This article describes how to use the Microsoft Sentinel **Zero Trust (TIC 3.0)** solution, which helps governance and compliance teams monitor and respond to Zero Trust requirements according to the [TRUSTED INTERNET CONNECTIONS (TIC) 3.0](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/programs/trusted-internet-connections-tic) initiative. 

[Microsoft Sentinel solutions](sentinel-solutions.md) are sets of bundled content, pre-configured for a specific set of data. The **Zero Trust (TIC 3.0)** solution includes a workbook, analytics rules, and a playbook, which provide an automated visualization of Zero Trust principles, cross-walked to the Trust Internet Connections framework, helping organizations to monitor configurations over time.

> [!NOTE]
> Get a comprehensive view of your organization's Zero Trust status with the Zero Trust initiative in Microsoft Exposure Management. For more information, see [Rapidly modernize your security posture for Zero Trust | Microsoft Learn](/security/zero-trust/adopt/rapidly-modernize-security-posture#in-product-dashboards-and-reports).

## The Zero Trust solution and the TIC 3.0 framework

Zero Trust and TIC 3.0 aren't the same, but they share many common themes and together provide a common story. The Microsoft Sentinel solution for **Zero Trust (TIC 3.0)** offers detailed crosswalks between Microsoft Sentinel and the Zero Trust model with the TIC 3.0 framework. These crosswalks help users to better understand the overlaps between the two.

While the Microsoft Sentinel solution for **Zero Trust (TIC 3.0)** provides best practice guidance, Microsoft doesn't guarantee nor imply compliance. All Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) requirements, validations, and controls are governed by the [Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/programs/trusted-internet-connections-tic).

The **Zero Trust (TIC 3.0)** solution provides visibility and situational awareness for control requirements delivered with Microsoft technologies in predominantly cloud-based environments. Customer experience will vary by user, and some panes may require additional configurations and query modification for operation.

Recommendations don't imply coverage of respective controls, as they're often one of several courses of action for approaching requirements, which is unique to each customer. Recommendations should be considered a starting point for planning full or partial coverage of respective control requirements.

The Microsoft Sentinel solution for **Zero Trust (TIC 3.0)** is useful for any of the following users and use cases:

- **Security governance, risk, and compliance professionals**, for compliance posture assessment and reporting
- **Engineers and architects**, who need to design Zero Trust and TIC 3.0-aligned workloads
- **Security analysts**, for alert and automation building
- **Managed security service providers (MSSPs)** for consulting services
- **Security managers**, who need to review requirements, analyze reporting, evaluating capabilities
