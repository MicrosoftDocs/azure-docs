#Customer intent: As a security operations analyst, I want to match my security data with Microsoft threat intelligence so I can generate high fidelity alerts and incidents.

# Use matching analytics to detect threats

Take advantage of threat intelligence produced by Microsoft to generate high-fidelity alerts and incidents with the **Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence Analytics** rule. This built-in rule in Microsoft Sentinel matches indicators with Common Event Format (CEF) logs, Windows DNS events with domain and IPv4 threat indicators, syslog data, and more.

## Prerequisites

You must install one or more of the supported data connectors to produce high-fidelity alerts and incidents. A premium Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence license isn't required. Install the appropriate solutions from the **Content hub** to connect these data sources:

  - Common Event Format (CEF) via Legacy Agent
  - Syslog via Legacy Agent
  - Microsoft 365 (formerly, Office 365)
  - Azure activity logs
  - Windows DNS via AMA
  - ASIM Network sessions

  For example, depending on your data source, you might use the following solutions and data connectors:

  |Solution |Data connector  |
  |---------|---------|
  |[Common Event Format solution for Sentinel](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/azuresentinel.azure-sentinel-solution-commoneventformat?tab=Overview) | [Common Event Format connector for Microsoft Sentinel](data-connectors/common-event-format-cef.md)|
  |[Windows Server DNS](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/azuresentinel.azure-sentinel-solution-dns?tab=Overview)  |[DNS connector for Microsoft Sentinel](data-connectors/dns.md) |
  |[Syslog solution for Sentinel](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/azuresentinel.azure-sentinel-solution-syslog?tab=Overview)  |[Syslog connector for Microsoft Sentinel](data-connectors/syslog.md)  |
  |[Microsoft 365 solution for Sentinel](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/azuresentinel.azure-sentinel-solution-office365?tab=Overview) | [Office 365 connector for Microsoft Sentinel](data-connectors/office-365.md)    |

## Configure the matching analytics rule

Matching analytics is configured when you enable the **Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence Analytics** rule.

1. Under the **Configuration** section, select the **Analytics** menu.

1. Select the **Rule templates** tab.

1. In the search window, enter **threat intelligence**.

1. Select the **Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence Analytics** rule template.

1. Select **Create rule**. The rule details are read only, and the default status of the rule is enabled.

1. Select **Review** > **Create**.

## Data sources and indicators

Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence AnalyticsÂ matches your logs with domain, IP, and URL indicators in the following ways:

- **CEF logs** ingested into the Log Analytics `CommonSecurityLog` table match URL and domain indicators if populated in the `RequestURL` field, and IPv4 indicators in the `DestinationIP` field.
- **Syslog events**, where `Facility == "cron"` ingested into the `Syslog` table matches domain and IPv4 indicators directly from the `SyslogMessage` field.
- **Office activity logs** ingested into the `OfficeActivity` table match IPv4 indicators directly from the `ClientIP` field.
- **Azure activity logs** ingested into the `AzureActivity` table match IPv4 indicators directly from the `CallerIpAddress` field.
- **ASIM DNS logs** ingested into the `ASimDnsActivityLogs` table match domain indicators if populated in the `DnsQuery` field, and IPv4 indicators in the `DnsResponseName` field.
- **ASIM Network Sessions** ingested into the `ASimNetworkSessionLogs` table match IPv4 indicators if populated in one or more of the following fields: `DstIpAddr`, `DstNatIpAddr`, `SrcNatIpAddr`, `SrcIpAddr`, `DvcIpAddr`.

## Triage an incident generated by matching analytics

If Microsoft's analytics finds a match, any alerts generated are grouped into incidents.

Use the following steps to triage through the incidents generated by the **Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence Analytics** rule:

1. In the Microsoft Sentinel workspace where you enabled the **Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence Analytics** rule, select **Incidents**, and search for **Microsoft Threat Intelligence Analytics**.

    Any incidents that are found appear in the grid.

1. Select **View full details** to view entities and other details about the incident, such as specific alerts.

    Here's an example.

    :::image type="content" source="media/use-matching-analytics-to-detect-threats/matching-analytics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of incident generated by matching analytics with details pane.":::

1. Observe the severity assigned to the alerts and the incident. Depending on how the indicator is matched, an appropriate severity is assigned to an alert from `Informational` to `High`. For example, if the indicator is matched with firewall logs that allowed the traffic, a high-severity alert is generated. If the same indicator was matched with firewall logs that blocked the traffic, the generated alert is low or medium.

    Alerts are then grouped on a per-observable basis of the indicator. For example, all alerts generated in a 24-hour time period that match the `contoso.com` domain are grouped into a single incident with a severity assigned based on the highest alert severity.

1. Observe the indicator information. When a match is found, the indicator is published to the Log Analytics `ThreatIntelligenceIndicators` table, and it appears on the **Threat Intelligence** page. For any indicators published from this rule, the source is defined as **Microsoft Threat Intelligence Analytics**.

Here's an example of the `ThreatIntelligenceIndicators` table.

Here's an example of the **Threat Intelligence** page.

## Get more context from Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence

Along with high-fidelity alerts and incidents, some Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence indicators include a link to a reference article in the Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence community portal.
