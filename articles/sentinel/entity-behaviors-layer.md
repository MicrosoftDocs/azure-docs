# Translate raw security logs to behavioral insights using UEBA behaviors in Microsoft Sentinel

The User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) behavior layer in Microsoft Sentinel aggregates and summarizes high-volume raw logs into clear, plain-language patterns of security actions, explaining “who did what to whom” in a structured way.

Unlike alerts or anomalies, behaviors don’t necessarily indicate risk - they create an abstraction layer that optimizes your data for investigations, hunting, and detection by enhancing:

- **Efficiency**: Reduce investigation time by stitching related events into cohesive stories.
- **Clarity**: Translate noisy, low-level logs into plain-language summaries.
- **Context**: Add MITRE ATT&CK mapping and entity roles for instant security relevance.
- **Consistency**: Provide a unified schema across diverse log sources.

This abstraction layer enables faster threat detection, investigation, and response across your security operations, without requiring deep familiarity with every log source. 

This article explains how the UEBA behaviors layer works, how to enable the behaviors layer, and how to use behaviors to enhance security operations.  

Watch the [UEBA behaviors webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqbxmGdMP7c) for a full overview and demo of the UEBA behaviors layer.

## How the UEBA behaviors layer works

Behaviors are part of Microsoft Sentinel’s [User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)](../sentinel/identify-threats-with-entity-behavior-analytics.md) capabilities, providing normalized, contextualized activity summaries that complement anomaly detection and enrich investigations. 

### Compare behaviors, anomalies, and alerts
This table shows how behaviors differ from anomalies and alerts:

| **Capability**   | **What it represents** | **Purpose** |
|---------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Anomalies** | Patterns that deviate from established baselines | Highlight unusual or suspicious activity |
| **Alerts**    | Signal a potential security issue requiring attention | Trigger incident response workflows |
| **Behaviors** | Neutral, structured summaries of activity - normal or abnormal- based on time windows or triggers, enriched with MITRE ATT&CK mappings and entity roles | Provide context and clarity for investigations, hunting, and detection |

### Behavior types and records

When you [enable the UEBA behaviors layer](#enable-the-ueba-behaviors-layer), Microsoft Sentinel processes supported security logs you collect into your Sentinel workspace in near real-time and summarizes two types of behavioral patterns:

| **Behavior type** | **Description** | **Examples** | **Use case** |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Aggregated behaviors** | Detect volume-based patterns by collecting related events over time windows | <ul><li>User accessed 50+ resources in 1 hour</li><li>Login attempts from 10+ different IP addresses</li></ul> | Convert high-volume logs into actionable security insights. This behavior type excels at identifying unusual activity levels. |
| **Sequenced behaviors** | Identify multi-step patterns or complex attack chains that aren't obvious when you look at individual events | Access key created > used from new IP > privileged API calls | Detect sophisticated attack sequences and multi-stage threats. |

The UEBA behaviors layer summarizes behaviors at tailored time intervals specific to each behavior's logic, creating behavior records immediately when it identifies patterns or when the time windows close.

Each behavior record includes:

- **A simple, contextual description**: A natural language explanation of what happened in security-relevant terms - for example, who did *what* to *whom*, and *why it matters*.
- **Unified schema and references to the underlying raw logs**: All behaviors use a consistent data structure across different products and log types, so analysts don't need to translate different log formats or join high-volume tables.
- **MITRE ATT&CK mapping**: Every behavior is tagged with relevant MITRE tactics and techniques, providing industry-standard context at a glance. You don't just see *what* happened, but also *how it fits* in an attack framework or timeline.
- **Entity relationship mapping**: Each behavior identifies involved entities (users, hosts, IP addresses) and their roles (actor, target, or other).

### The behaviors abstraction layer

This diagram illustrates how the UEBA behaviors layer transforms raw logs into structured behavior records that enhance security operations:

### Behavior storage and tables

The UEBA behaviors layer stores behavior records in two types of tables:

- A *behavior information* table, which contains the behavior title, description, MITRE mappings, categories, and links to raw logs, and
- A *behavior‑related entities* table, which lists all entities involved in the behavior and their roles.

These tables integrate seamlessly with your existing workflows for detection rules, investigations, and incident analysis. They process all types of security activity—not just suspicious events—and provide comprehensive visibility into both normal and anomalous behavior patterns.

For information about using behaviors tables, see [Best practices and troubleshooting tips for querying behaviors](#best-practices-and-troubleshooting-tips-for-querying-behaviors).  


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Generative AI powers the UEBA Behaviors layer to create and scale the insights it provides. Microsoft designed the Behaviors feature based on **privacy and responsible AI principles** to ensure transparency and explainability. Behaviors don't introduce new compliance risks or opaque "black box" analytics into your SOC. For details about how AI is applied in this feature and Microsoft’s approach to responsible AI, see [Responsible AI FAQ for the Microsoft UEBA behaviors layer](https://aka.ms/miscrosoftsentinelbehaviors).

## Use cases and examples

Here's how analysts, hunters, and detection engineers can use behaviors during investigations, hunting, and alert creation.

### Investigation and incident enrichment

Behaviors give SOC analysts immediate clarity about what happened around an alert, without pivoting across multiple raw log tables.

- **Workflow without behaviors:** Analysts often need to reconstruct timelines manually by querying event‑specific tables and stitching results together.

  *Example*: An alert fires on a suspicious AWS activity. The analyst queries the `AWSCloudTrail` table, then pivots to firewall data to understand what the user or host did. This requires knowledge of each schema and slows triage.

- **Workflow with behaviors:** The UEBA behaviors layer automatically aggregates related events into behavior entries that can be attached to an incident or queried on demand.

  *Example:* An alert indicates possible credential exfiltration. In the `BehaviorInfo` table, the analyst sees the behavior **Suspicious mass secret access via AWS IAM by User123** mapped to **MITRE Technique T1552 (Unsecured Credentials)**. The UEBA behaviors layer generated this behavior by aggregating 20 AWS log entries. The analyst immediately understands that User123 accessed many secrets – crucial context to escalate the incident – without manually reviewing all 20 log entries.

### Threat hunting

Behaviors allow hunters to search on TTPs and activity summaries, rather than writing complex joins or normalizing raw logs by themselves.

- **Workflow without behaviors:** Hunts require complex KQL, table joins, and familiarity with every data source format. Important activity might be buried in large datasets with little built‑in security context. 

  *Example:* Hunting for signs of reconnaissance might require scanning `AWSCloudTrail` events *and* certain firewall connection patterns separately. Context exists mostly in incidents and alerts, making proactive hunting harder.

- **Workflow with behaviors:** Behaviors are normalized, enriched, and mapped to MITRE tactics and techniques. Hunters can search for meaningful patterns without depending on each source’s schema.

  A hunter can filter the BehaviorInfo table by tactic (`Categories`), technique, title, or entity. For example:

  ```kusto
  BehaviorInfo 
  | where Categories has "Discovery" 
  | summarize count() by Title 
  ```

  Hunters can also: 
  
  - Identify rare behaviors, using `count distinct` on the `Title` field.
  - Explore an interesting behavior type, identify the entities involved, and investigate further. 
  - Drill down to raw logs using the `BehaviorId` and `AdditionalFields` columns, which often reference the underlying raw logs.

  *Example:* A hunter searching for stealthy credential access queries for behaviors with “enumerate credentials” in the `Title` column. The results return a few instances of **"Attempted credential dump from Vault by user AdminJoe"** (derived from `CyberArk` logs). Although alerts weren't fired, this behavior is uncommon for AdminJoe and prompts further investigation - something that's difficult to detect in verbose Vault audit logs.

  Hunters can also hunt by: 
  
  - MITRE tactic:

    ```kusto    
    // Find behaviors by MITRE tactic
    BehaviorInfo
    | where Categories == "Lateral Movement"
    ```

  - Technique:

    ```kusto
    // Find behaviors by MITRE technique
    BehaviorInfo
    | where AttackTechniques has "T1078" // Valid Accounts
    | extend AF = parse_json(AdditionalFields)
    | extend TableName = tostring(AF.TableName)
    | project TimeGenerated, Title, Description, TableName
    ```

  - Specific user:

    ```kusto
    // Find all behaviors for a specific user over last 7 days
    BehaviorInfo
    | join kind=inner BehaviorEntities on BehaviorId
    | where TimeGenerated >= ago(7d)
    | where EntityType == "User" and AccountUpn == "user@domain.com"
    | project TimeGenerated, Title, Description, Categories
    | order by TimeGenerated desc
    ```

  - Rare behaviors (potential anomalies):

    ```kusto
    // Find rare behaviors (potential anomalies)
    BehaviorInfo
    | where TimeGenerated >= ago(30d)
    | summarize Count=count() by Title
    | where Count < 5 // Behaviors seen less than 5 times
    | order by Count asc
    ```

### Alerting and automation

Behaviors simplify rule logic by providing normalized, high‑quality signals with built‑in context, and enable new correlation possibilities.

- **Workflow without behaviors:** Cross‑source correlation rules are complex because each log format is different. Rules often require:

  - Normalization logic
  - Schema‑specific conditions
  - Multiple separate rules
  - Reliance on alerts rather than raw activity

  Automation might also trigger too frequently if it's driven by low‑level events.

- **Workflow with behaviors:** Behaviors already aggregate related events and include MITRE mappings, entity roles, and consistent schemas, so detection engineers can create simpler, clearer detection rules. 
  
  *Example:* To alert on a potential key compromise and privilege escalation sequence, a detection engineer writes a detection rule using this logic: *"Alert if a user has a 'Creation of new AWS access key' behavior followed by an 'Elevation of privileges in AWS' behavior within 1 hour."* 
  
  Without the UEBA behaviors layer, this rule would require stitching together raw `AWSCloudTrail` events and interpreting them in the rule logic. With behaviors, it's straightforward and resilient to log schema changes because the schema is unified.

  Behaviors also serve as reliable triggers for automation. Instead of creating alerts for non-risky activities, use behaviors to trigger automation - for example, to send an email or initiate verification.

## Supported data sources and behaviors

The list of supported data sources and vendors or services that send logs to these data sources is evolving.
The UEBA behaviors layer automatically aggregates insights for all supported vendors based on the logs you collect.

The UEBA behaviors layer currently focuses on these non-Microsoft data sources that traditionally lack easy behavioral context in Microsoft Sentinel: 

| Data source | Supported vendors, services, and logs | Connector | Supported behaviors |
|-------------|---------------------------|-------|----------------|
| [CommonSecurityLog](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/commonsecuritylog)<sup>1</sup> | <ul><li>Cyber Ark Vault</li><li>Palo Alto Threats</li></ul> |   | <ul><li>[CommonSecurityLog behaviors](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Sentinel%20Behaviors/Behaviors%20Rules/commonsecuritylog_behaviors.md)</li></ul> |
| [AWSCloudTrail](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/awscloudtrail) | <ul><li>EC2</li><li>IAM</li><li>S3</li><li>EKS</li><li>Secrets Manager</li></ul> |<ul><li>[Amazon Web Services](../sentinel/data-connectors-reference.md#amazon-web-services)</li><li>[Amazon Web Services S3](../sentinel/data-connectors-reference.md#amazon-web-services-s3)</li></ul> | <ul><li>[AWS CloudTrail behaviors](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Sentinel%20Behaviors/Behaviors%20Rules/aws_cloudtrail_behaviors.md)</li></ul> |
|[GCPAuditLogs](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/gcpauditlogs) |<ul><li>Admin activity logs</li><li>Data access logs</li><li>Access transparency logs</li></ul>|<ul><li>[GCP Pub/Sub Audit Logs](../sentinel/data-connectors-reference.md#gcp-pubsub-audit-logs)</li></ul>| <ul><li>[GCP Audit Logs behaviors](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Sentinel%20Behaviors/Behaviors%20Rules/gcp_auditlogs_behaviors.md)</li></ul> |


<sup>1</sup> `CommonSecurityLog` can contain logs from many vendors. The UEBA behaviors layer only generates behaviors for **supported vendors and log types**. If the table receives logs from an unsupported vendor, you won't see any behaviors even though the data source is connected.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must enable these sources separately from other UEBA capabilities. For example, if you enabled AWSCloudTrail for UEBA analytics and anomalies, you still need to enable it separately for behaviors.


## Prerequisites

To use the UEBA behaviors layer, you need:

- A Microsoft Sentinel workspace that's onboarded to the Defender portal.
- Ingest one or more of the [supported data sources](#supported-data-sources-and-behaviors) into the Analytics tier. For more information about data tiers, see [Manage data tiers and retention in Microsoft Sentinel](../sentinel/manage-data-overview.md#how-data-tiers-and-retention-work).

## Permissions required 

To enable and use the UEBA behaviors layer, you need these permissions:

| **User action**                                              | **Permission required**                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Enable behaviors | At least the **Security Administrator** role in Microsoft Entra ID and the **Microsoft Sentinel Contributor** role in your Sentinel workspace. |
| Query behaviors tables                                         | <ul><li>**Security Reader** or **Security Operator** role in Microsoft Entra ID to run Advanced Hunting queries in the Defender portal.</li><li>**Read** access to the `BehaviorInfo` and `BehaviorEntities` tables in your Sentinel workspace.</li><li>**Read** access to source tables to drill down to raw events.</li></ul> |

For more information about unified RBAC in the Defender portal, see [Microsoft Defender XDR Unified role-based access control (RBAC)](/defender-xdr/manage-rbac).

## Enable the UEBA behaviors layer 

To start aggregating UEBA behaviors, **make sure to connect at least one supported data source**. The UEBA behaviors layer only aggregates behaviors when supported data sources are connected and actively sending logs to the Analytics tier.

To enable the UEBA behaviors layer in your workspace:

1. In the Defender portal, select **System > Settings > Microsoft Sentinel > SIEM workspaces**.
1. Select the Sentinel workspace where you want to enable the UEBA behaviors layer.
1. Select **Enable behavior analytics > Configure UEBA > New! Behaviors layer**.
1. Toggle on **Enable Behaviors layer**.
1. Select **Connect all data sources** or select the specific data sources from the list.

    If you haven't yet connected any supported data sources to your Sentinel workspace, select **Go to Content Hub** to find and connect the relevant connectors.

    :::image type="content" source="media/entity-behaviors-layer/behaviors-enable.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Enable Behaviors layer page in the Defender portal." lightbox="media/entity-behaviors-layer/behaviors-enable.png":::

1. Select **Connect**.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > You can currently enable behaviors in a single workspace in your tenant.

## Pricing model

Using the UEBA behaviors layer results in the following costs:

- **No extra license cost:** Behaviors are included as part of Microsoft Sentinel. You don’t need a separate SKU, UEBA add‑on, or additional licensing. If your workspace is connected to Sentinel and onboarded to the Defender portal, you can use behaviors at no extra feature cost.

- **Log data ingestion charges:** Behavior records are stored in the `SentinelBehaviorInfo` and `SentinelBehaviorEntities` tables in your Sentinel workspace. Each behavior contributes to your workspace’s data ingestion volume and is billed at your existing Log Analytics/Sentinel ingestion rate. Behaviors are additive - they don’t replace your existing raw logs.

## Best practices and troubleshooting tips for querying behaviors

This section explains how to query behaviors from both the Defender portal and your Sentinel workspace. While the schemas are identical, the data scope differs:

- In the Defender portal, the behavior tables include UEBA behaviors ***and*** behaviors from connected Defender services, such as Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps and Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
- In the Sentinel workspace, the behavior tables include ***only*** UEBA behaviors generated from logs ingested into that specific workspace.

This table shows which behavior tables to use in each environment:

| **Environment** | **Tables to use** | **Use cases** |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Defender portal - Advanced Hunting** | [BehaviorInfo](/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-behaviorinfo-table)<br>[BehaviorEntities](/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-behaviorentities-table) | Detection rules, incident investigation, threat hunting in Defender portal |
| **Sentinel workspace** | [SentinelBehaviorInfo](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/sentinelbehaviorinfo)<br>[SentinelBehaviorEntities](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/sentinelbehaviorentities) | Azure Monitor workbooks, ingestion monitoring, KQL queries in Sentinel workspace |

For more practical examples of using behaviors, see [Use cases and examples](#use-cases-and-examples).

For more information about Kusto Query Language (KQL), see [Kusto query language overview](/kusto/query/?view=microsoft-sentinel).

- **Filter for UEBA behaviors in the Defender portal**

   The `BehaviorInfo` and `BehaviorEntities` tables include all UEBA behaviors and might also include behaviors from Microsoft Defender services.

    To filter for behaviors from the Microsoft Sentinel UEBA behaviors layer, use the `ServiceSource` column. For example:

    ```kusto 
    BehaviorInfo
    | where ServiceSource == "Microsoft Sentinel"
    ```

    :::image type="content" source="media/entity-behaviors-layer/query-behaviors-filter-microsoft-sentinel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of BehaviorInfo table filtered by ServiceSource column to the Microsoft Sentinel value." lightbox="media/entity-behaviors-layer/query-behaviors-filter-microsoft-sentinel.png":::


- **Drill down from behaviors to raw logs** 

  Use the `AdditionalFields` column in `BehaviorInfo`, which contains references to the original event IDs in the `SupportingEvidence` field.

  :::image type="content" source="media/entity-behaviors-layer/query-behaviors-drill-down-raw-logs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of BehaviorInfo table showing AdditionalFields column with references to event IDs and SupportingEvidence field for raw log queries." lightbox="media/entity-behaviors-layer/query-behaviors-drill-down-raw-logs.png":::

  Run a query on the `SupportingEvidence` field value to find the raw logs that contributed to a behavior. 

  :::image type="content" source="media/entity-behaviors-layer/query-behaviors-supporting-evidence.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a query on the SupportingEvidence field value and the query results that show the raw logs that contributed to a behavior." lightbox="media/entity-behaviors-layer/query-behaviors-supporting-evidence.png":::

- **Join BehaviorInfo and BehaviorEntities**

  Use the `BehaviorId` field to join `BehaviorInfo` with `BehaviorEntities`. 

  For example:

  ```kusto
  BehaviorInfo
  | join kind=inner BehaviorEntities on BehaviorId
  | where TimeGenerated >= ago(1d)
  | project TimeGenerated, Title, Description, EntityType, EntityRole, AccountUpn
  ```

  This gives you each behavior and each entity involved in it. The `AccountUpn` or identifying information for the entity is in `BehaviorEntities`, whereas `BehaviorInfo` might refer to “User” or “Host” in the text.

- **Monitor behavior data ingestion** 

  To monitor behavior data ingestion, query the `Usage` table for entries related to `SentinelBehaviorInfo` and `SentinelBehaviorEntities`.

- **Create automation, workbooks, and detection rules based on behaviors**

  - Use the `BehaviorInfo` table as a data source for detection rules or automation playbooks in the Defender portal. For example, create a scheduled query rule that triggers when a specific behavior appears.
  - For [Azure Monitor workbooks](../sentinel/monitor-your-data.md) and any artifacts built directly on your Sentinel workspace, make sure to query the `SentinelBehaviorInfo` and `SentinelBehaviorEntities` tables in your Sentinel workspace.

### Troubleshooting 

- **If behaviors aren't being generated**: Ensure supported data sources are actively sending logs to the Analytics tier, confirm the data source toggle is on, and wait 15–30 minutes after enabling.
- **I see fewer behaviors than expected**: Our coverage of supported behavior types is partial and growing. For more information, see [Supported data sources and behaviors](#supported-data-sources-and-behaviors). The UEBA behaviors layer might also not be able to detect a behavior pattern if there are very few instances of a specific behavior type.
- **Behavior counts**: A single behavior might represent tens or hundreds of raw events - this is designed to reduce noise.
     
## Limitations 

These limitations currently apply to the UEBA behaviors layer:

- You can enable behaviors on a single Sentinel workspace per tenant.
- The UEBA behaviors layer generates behaviors for a limited set of [supported data sources and vendors or services](#supported-data-sources-and-behaviors). 
- The UEBA behaviors layer doesn't currently capture every possible action or attack technique, even for supported sources. Some events might not produce corresponding behaviors. Don't assume that the absence of a behavior means no activity occurred. Always review raw logs if you suspect something might be missing. 
- Behaviors aim to reduce noise by aggregating and sequencing events, but you might still see too many behavior records. We welcome your feedback on specific behavior types to help improve coverage and relevance.
- Behaviors aren't alerts or anomalies. They're neutral observations, not classified as malicious or benign. The presence of a behavior means “this happened,” not “this is a threat.” Anomaly detection remains separate in UEBA. Use judgment or combine behaviors with UEBA anomaly data to identify noteworthy patterns.
