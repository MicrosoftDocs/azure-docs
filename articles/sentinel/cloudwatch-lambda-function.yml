#Customer intent: As a security operator, I want to create a Lambda function to send CloudWatch events to S3 bucket so I can convert the format to the format accepted by Microsoft Sentinel.

  Create a Lambda function to send CloudWatch events to an S3 bucket
introduction: |
  In some cases, your CloudWatch logs may not match the format accepted by Microsoft Sentinel - .csv file in a GZIP format without a header. In this article, you use a **lambda function** ([view the source code](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/DataConnectors/AWS-S3/CloudWatchLambdaFunction.py)) within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment to send [CloudWatch events to an S3 bucket](connect-aws.md), and convert the format to the accepted format.

      Create the lambda function 
    summary: |
      The lambda function uses Python 3.9 runtime and x86_64 architecture. 
    steps: 
      - |
        In the AWS Management Console, select the lambda service.
      - |  
        Select **Create function**. 

          :::image type="content" source="media/cloudwatch-lambda-function/lambda-basic-information.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the AWS Management Console Basic information screen." lightbox="media/cloudwatch-lambda-function/lambda-basic-information.png":::
      - |
        Type a name for the function and select **Python 3.9** as the runtime and **x86_64** as the architecture. 
      - |  
        Select **Create function**. 
      - |  
        Under **Choose a layer**, select a layer and select **Add**.

          :::image type="content" source="media/cloudwatch-lambda-function/lambda-add-layer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the AWS Management Console Add layer screen." lightbox="media/cloudwatch-lambda-function/lambda-add-layer.png":::
      - |
        Select **Permissions**, and under **Execution role**, select **Role name**.
      - |  
        Under **Permissions policies**, select **Add permissions** > **Attach policies**. 

          :::image type="content" source="media/cloudwatch-lambda-function/lambda-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the AWS Management Console Permissions tab." lightbox="media/cloudwatch-lambda-function/lambda-permissions.png":::
      - |
        Search for the *AmazonS3FullAccess* and *CloudWatchLogsReadOnlyAccess* policies and attach them.

          :::image type="content" source="media/cloudwatch-lambda-function/lambda-other-permissions-policies.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the AWS Management Console Add permissions policies screen." lightbox="media/cloudwatch-lambda-function/lambda-other-permissions-policies.png":::
      - |
        Return to the function, select **Code**, and paste the code link under **Code source**.
      - |  
        The default values for the parameters are set using environment variables. If necessary, you can manually adjust these values directly in the code. 
      - |  
        Select **Deploy**, and then select **Test**.
      - |  
        Create an event by filling in the required fields.

          :::image type="content" source="media/cloudwatch-lambda-function/lambda-configure-test-event.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the AWS Management Configure test event screen." lightbox="media/cloudwatch-lambda-function/lambda-configure-test-event.png":::
      - |
        Select **Test** to see how the event appears in the S3 bucket.
