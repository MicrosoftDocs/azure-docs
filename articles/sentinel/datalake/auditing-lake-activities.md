# Audit log for Microsoft Sentinel data lake

The audit log helps you investigate specific activities across Microsoft services. Microsoft Sentinel data lake activities are audited and can be searched in the audit log. The audit log provides a record of activities that are performed by users and administrators in Microsoft Sentinel data lake, such as:
+ Accessing data in lake via KQL queries
+ Running notebooks on data lake
+ Create/ edit/ run/ delete jobs 


Auditing is automatically turned on for Microsoft Sentinel data lake. Features that are audited are logged in the audit log automatically.

## Prerequisites
Microsoft Sentinel data lake uses the [Microsoft Purview auditing solution](/purview/audit-solutions-overview). Before you can look at the audit data, you need to turn on auditing in the Microsoft Purview portal. For more information, see [Turn auditing on or off](/purview/audit-log-enable-disable). 
 
To access the audit log, you need to have the **View-Only Audit Logs** or **Audit Logs** role in Exchange Online. By default, those roles are assigned to the Compliance Management and Organization Management role groups.

> [!NOTE]
> Global administrators in Office 365 and Microsoft 365 are automatically added as members of the Organization Management role group in Exchange Online.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to scenarios when you can't use an existing role. Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. Using accounts with lower permissions helps improve security for your organization.
