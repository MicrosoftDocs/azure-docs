# Migrate Splunk SOAR automation to Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft Sentinel provides Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) capabilities with automation rules and playbooks. Automation rules facilitate simple incident handling and response, while playbooks run more complex sequences of actions to respond and remediate threats. This article discusses how to identify SOAR use cases, and how to migrate your Splunk SOAR automation to Microsoft Sentinel automation rules and playbooks.

For more information about the differences between automation rules and playbooks, see the following articles:
- [Automate threat response with automation rules](automate-incident-handling-with-automation-rules.md)
- [Automate threat response with playbooks](automation/automate-responses-with-playbooks.md)

## Identify SOAR use cases

Here's what you need to think about when migrating SOAR use cases from Splunk.
- **Use case quality**. Choose automation use cases based on procedures that are clearly defined, with minimal variation, and a low false-positive rate.
- **Manual intervention**. Automated responses can have wide ranging effects. High impact automations should have human input to confirm high impact actions before they're taken.
- **Binary criteria**. To increase response success, decision points within an automated workflow should be as limited as possible, with binary criteria. When there are only two variables in the automated decision making, the need for human intervention is reduced and outcome predictability is enhanced.
- **Accurate alerts or data**. Response actions are dependent on the accuracy of signals such as alerts. Alerts and enrichment sources should be reliable. Microsoft Sentinel resources such as watchlists and threat intelligence with high confidence ratings enhance reliability.
- **Analyst role**. While automation is great, reserve the most complex tasks for analysts. Provide them with the opportunity for input into workflows that require validation. In short, response automation should augment and extend analyst capabilities. 

## Migrate SOAR workflow

This section shows how key Splunk SOAR concepts translate to Microsoft Sentinel components, and provides general guidelines for how to migrate each step or component in the SOAR workflow.

|Step (in diagram) |Splunk  |Microsoft Sentinel |
|---------|---------|
|1 |Ingest events into main index.     |Ingest events into the Log Analytics workspace.     |
|2 |Create containers.     |Tag incidents using the [custom details feature](surface-custom-details-in-alerts.md).   |
|3 |Create cases. |Microsoft Sentinel can automatically group incidents according to user-defined criteria, such as shared entities or severity. These alerts then generate incidents.  |
|4 |Create playbooks. |Azure Logic Apps uses several connectors to orchestrate activities across Microsoft Sentinel, Azure, third party and hybrid cloud environments. |
|4 |Create workbooks. |Microsoft Sentinel executes playbooks either in isolation or as part of an ordered automation rule. You can also execute playbooks manually against alerts or incidents, according to a predefined Security Operations Center (SOC) procedure. |

## Map SOAR components 

Review which Microsoft Sentinel or Azure Logic Apps features map to the main Splunk SOAR components.

## Operationalize playbooks and automation rules in Microsoft Sentinel

Most of the playbooks that you use with Microsoft Sentinel are available in either the [Automation > Templates tab](use-playbook-templates.md), the [Content hub catalog](sentinel-solutions-catalog.md), or [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks/Block-OnPremADUser). In some cases, however, you might need to create playbooks from scratch or from existing templates.

You typically build your custom logic app using the Azure Logic App Designer feature. The logic apps code is based on [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates](../azure-resource-manager/templates/overview.md), which facilitate development, deployment and portability of Azure Logic Apps across multiple environments. To convert your custom playbook into a portable ARM template, you can use the [ARM template generator](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/export-microsoft-sentinel-playbooks-or-azure-logic-apps-with/ba-p/3275898).

Use these resources for cases where you need to build your own playbooks either from scratch or from existing templates.

## SOAR post migration best practices

Here are best practices you should take into account after your SOAR migration:

- After you migrate your playbooks, test the playbooks extensively to ensure that the migrated actions work as expected.
- Periodically review your automations to explore ways to further simplify or enhance your SOAR. Microsoft Sentinel constantly adds new connectors and actions that can help you to further simplify or increase the effectiveness of your current response implementations.
- Monitor the performance of your playbooks using the [Playbooks health monitoring workbook](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/what-s-new-monitoring-your-logic-apps-playbooks-in-azure/ba-p/1873211).
- Use managed identities and service principals: Authenticate against various Azure services within your Logic Apps, store the secrets in Azure Key Vault, and obscure the flow execution output. We also recommend that you  [monitor the activities of these service principals](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/non-interactive-logins-minimizing-the-blind-spot/ba-p/2287932).
