# Microsoft Sentinel security alert schema reference

Microsoft Sentinel [analytics rules](detect-threats-built-in.md) create incidents as the result of **security alerts**. Security alerts can come from different sources, and accordingly use different kinds of analytics rules to create incidents:

- **Scheduled** analytics rules generate alerts as the result of their regular queries of data in logs ingested from external sources, and those same rules create incidents from those alerts. (For the purposes of this document, "scheduled" rule alerts include **NRT rule alerts**.)

- **Microsoft Security** analytics rules create incidents from alerts that are ingested as-is from other Microsoft security products, for example, Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

Regardless of the source, these alerts are all stored together in the *SecurityAlert* table in your Log Analytics workspace. This article describes the schema of this table.

Because alerts come from many sources, not all fields are used by all providers. Some fields may be left blank.

| **ExtendedLinks** | string | A bag (a collection) for all links related to the alert. This bag can include a combination of links of different types. |
| **ExtendedProperties** | string | A collection of other properties of the alert, including user-defined properties. Any [custom details](surface-custom-details-in-alerts.md) defined in the alert, and any dynamic content in the [alert details](customize-alert-details.md), are stored here. |
| **IsIncident** | boolean | DEPRECATED. Always set to *false*. |
| **ProcessingEndTime** | datetime | The time of the alert's publishing. <ul><li>**Scheduled rule alerts:** the value of the *TimeGenerated* field.<li>**Ingested alerts:** the time that the originating product completes the production of the alert. |
| **ProductComponentName** | string | The name of the component of the product that generated the alert. |
| **ProductName** | string | The name of the product that generated the alert. |
| **ProviderName** | string | The name of the alert provider (the service within the product) that generated the alert. |
| **RemediationSteps** | string | A list of action items to take to remediate the alert. |
| **ResourceId** | string | A unique identifier for the resource that is the subject of the alert. |
| **SourceComputerId** | string | DEPRECATED. Was the agent ID on the server that created the alert. |
| **SourceSystem** | string | DEPRECATED. Always populated with the string "Detection". |
| **StartTime** | datetime | The start time of the impact of the alert. <ul><li>**Scheduled rule alerts:** the value of the *TimeGenerated* field for the first *event* captured by the query.<li>**Ingested alerts:** the time of the first event or activity included in the alert. |
