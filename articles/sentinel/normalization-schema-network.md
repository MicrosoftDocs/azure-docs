# The Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) Network Session normalization schema reference (Public preview)

The Microsoft Sentinel Network Session normalization schema represents an IP network activity, such as network connections and network sessions. Such events are reported, for example, by operating systems, routers, firewalls, and intrusion prevention systems.

The network normalization schema can represent any type of an IP network session but is designed to provide support for common source types, such as Netflow, firewalls, and intrusion prevention systems.

For more information about normalization in Microsoft Sentinel, see [Normalization and the Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM)](normalization.md).

This article describes version 0.2.x of the network normalization schema. [Version 0.1](normalization-schema-v1.md) was released before ASIM was available and doesn't align with ASIM in several places. For more information, see [Differences between network normalization schema versions](normalization-schema-v1.md#changes).

## Parsers

For more information about ASIM parsers, see the [ASIM parsers overview](normalization-parsers-overview.md).

### Unifying parsers

To use parsers that unify all ASIM out-of-the-box parsers, and ensure that your analysis runs across all the configured sources, use the `_Im_NetworkSession` filtering parser or the `_ASim_NetworkSession` parameter-less parser.

You can also use workspace-deployed `ImNetworkSession` and `ASimNetworkSession` parsers by deploying them from the [Microsoft Sentinel GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/DeployASIM).

For more information, see [built-in ASIM parsers and workspace-deployed parsers](normalization-parsers-overview.md#built-in-asim-parsers-and-workspace-deployed-parsers).

### Out-of-the-box, source-specific parsers

For the list of the Network Session parsers Microsoft Sentinel provides out-of-the-box refer to the [ASIM parsers list](normalization-parsers-list.md#network-session-parsers) 

### Add your own normalized parsers

When [developing custom parsers](normalization-develop-parsers.md) for the Network Session information model, name your KQL functions using the following syntax:

- `vimNetworkSession<vendor><Product>` for parametrized parsers
- `ASimNetworkSession<vendor><Product>` for regular parsers

Refer to the article [Managing ASIM parsers](normalization-manage-parsers.md) to learn how to add your custom parsers to the network session unifying parsers.

### Filtering parser parameters

The Network Session parsers support [filtering parameters](normalization-about-parsers.md#optimizing-parsing-using-parameters). While these parameters are optional, they can improve your query performance.

The following filtering parameters are available:

| Name     | Type      | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **starttime** | datetime | Filter only network sessions that *started* at or after this time. |
| **endtime** | datetime | Filter only network sessions that *started* running at or before this time. |
| **srcipaddr_has_any_prefix** | dynamic | Filter only network sessions for which the [source IP address field](#srcipaddr) prefix is in one of the listed values. Prefixes should end with a `.`, for example: `10.0.`. The length of the list is limited to 10,000 items.|
| **dstipaddr_has_any_prefix** | dynamic | Filter only network sessions for which the [destination IP address field](#dstipaddr) prefix is in one of the listed values. Prefixes should end with a `.`, for example: `10.0.`. The length of the list is limited to 10,000 items.|
| **ipaddr_has_any_prefix** | dynamic | Filter only network sessions for which the [destination IP address field](#dstipaddr) or [source IP address field](#srcipaddr) prefix is in one of the listed values. Prefixes should end with a `.`, for example: `10.0.`. The length of the list is limited to 10,000 items.<br><br>The field [ASimMatchingIpAddr](normalization-common-fields.md#asimmatchingipaddr) is set with the one of the values `SrcIpAddr`, `DstIpAddr`, or `Both` to reflect the matching fields or fields. |
| **dstportnumber** | Int | Filter only network sessions with the specified destination port number. |
| **hostname_has_any** | dynamic/string | Filter only network sessions for which the [destination hostname field](#dsthostname) has any of the values listed. The length of the list is limited to 10,000 items.<br><br> The field [ASimMatchingHostname](normalization-common-fields.md#asimmatchinghostname) is set with the one of the values `SrcHostname`, `DstHostname`, or `Both` to reflect the matching fields or fields. |
| **dvcaction** | dynamic/string | Filter only network sessions for which the [Device Action field](#dvcaction) is any of the values listed. | 
| **eventresult** | String | Filter only network sessions with a specific **EventResult** value. |

Some parameter can accept both list of values of type `dynamic` or a single string value. To pass a literal list to parameters that expect a dynamic value, explicitly use a [dynamic literal](/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/dynamic?view=microsoft-sentinel&preserve-view=true#dynamic-literals). For example: `dynamic(['192.168.','10.'])`

For example, to filter only network sessions for a specified list of domain names, use:

```kusto
let torProxies=dynamic(["tor2web.org", "tor2web.com", "torlink.co"]);
_Im_NetworkSession (hostname_has_any = torProxies)
```

> [!TIP]
> To pass a literal list to parameters that expect a dynamic value, explicitly use a [dynamic literal](/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/dynamic?view=microsoft-sentinel&preserve-view=true#dynamic-literals). For example: `dynamic(['192.168.','10.'])`.

## Normalized content

For a full list of analytics rules that use normalized DNS events, see [Network session security content](normalization-content.md#network-session-security-content).

## Schema overview

The Network Session information model is aligned with the [OSSEM Network entity schema](https://github.com/OTRF/OSSEM/blob/master/docs/cdm/entities/network.md).

The Network Session schema serves several types of similar but distinct scenarios, which share the same fields. Those scenarios are identified by the EventType field:

- `NetworkSession` - a network session reported by an intermediate device monitoring the network, such as a Firewall, a router, or a network tap.
- `L2NetworkSession` - a network sessions for which only layer 2 information is available. Such events will include MAC addresses but not IP addresses. 
- `Flow` - an aggregated event that reports multiple similar network sessions, typically over a predefined time period, such as **Netflow** events.  
- `EndpointNetworkSession` - a network session reported by one of the end points of the session, including clients and servers. For such events, the schema supports the `remote` and `local` alias fields.
- `IDS` - a network session reported as suspicious. Such an event will have some of the inspection fields populated, and may have just one IP address field populated, either the source or the destination.

Typically, a query should either select just a subset of those event types, and may need to address separately unique aspects of the use cases. For example, IDS events do not reflect the entire network volume and should not be taken into account in column based analytics. 

Network session events use the descriptors `Src` and `Dst` to denote the roles of the devices and related users and applications involved in the session. So, for example, the source device hostname and IP address are named `SrcHostname` and `SrcIpAddr`. Other ASIM schemas typically use `Target` instead of `Dst`.

For events reported by an endpoint and for which the event type is `EndpointNetworkSession`, the descriptors `Local` and `Remote` denote the endpoint itself and the device at the other end of the network session respectively.

The descriptor `Dvc` is used for the reporting device, which is the local system for sessions reported by an endpoint, and the intermediary device or network tap for other network session events.

Supported values are `Inbound`, `Outbound`, `Local` (to the organization), `External` (to the organization) or `NA` (Not Applicable).<br><br> - For the [EventType](#eventtype) `EndpointNetworkSession`, **NetworkDirection** represents the direction relative to the endpoint. Supported values are `Inbound`, `Outbound`, `Local` (to the system), `Listen` or `NA` (Not Applicable). The `Listen` value indicates that a device has started accepting network connections but isn't actually, necessarily, connected. |
| <a name="networkduration"></a>**NetworkDuration** | Optional | Integer | The amount of time, in milliseconds, for the completion of the network session or connection.<br><br>Example: `1500` |
| **Duration** | Alias | | Alias to [NetworkDuration](#networkduration). |
|<a name="networkicmptype"></a> **NetworkIcmpType** | Optional | String | For an ICMP message, ICMP type name associated with the numerical value, as described in [RFC 2780](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2780) for IPv4 network connections, or in [RFC 4443](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4443) for IPv6 network connections.<br><br>Example: `Destination Unreachable` for NetworkIcmpCode `3` |
| **NetworkIcmpCode** | Optional | Integer | For an ICMP message, the ICMP code number as described in [RFC 2780](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2780) for IPv4 network connections, or in [RFC 4443](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4443) for IPv6 network connections. |
| **NetworkConnectionHistory** | Optional | String | TCP flags and other potential IP header information. |
| **DstBytes** | Recommended | Long | The number of bytes sent from the destination to the source for the connection or session. If the event is aggregated, **DstBytes** should be the sum over all aggregated sessions.<br><br>Example: `32455` |
| **SrcBytes** | Recommended | Long | The number of bytes sent from the source to the destination for the connection or session. If the event is aggregated, **SrcBytes** should be the sum over all aggregated sessions.<br><br>Example: `46536` |

| **SessionId** | Alias | String | Alias to [NetworkSessionId](#networksessionid). |
| **TcpFlagsAck** | Optional | Boolean | The TCP ACK Flag reported. The acknowledgment flag is used to acknowledge the successful receipt of a packet. As we can see from the diagram above, the receiver sends an ACK and a SYN in the second step of the three way handshake process to tell the sender that it received its initial packet. |
| **TcpFlagsFin** | Optional | Boolean | The TCP FIN Flag reported. The finished flag means there is no more data from the sender. Therefore, it is used in the last packet sent from the sender. |
| **TcpFlagsSyn** | Optional | Boolean | The TCP SYN Flag reported. The synchronization flag is used as a first step in establishing a three way handshake between two hosts. Only the first packet from both the sender and receiver should have this flag set. |
| **TcpFlagsUrg** | Optional | Boolean | The TCP URG Flag reported. The urgent flag is used to notify the receiver to process the urgent packets before processing all other packets. The receiver will be notified when all known urgent data has been received. See [RFC 6093](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6093) for more details. |
| **TcpFlagsPsh** | Optional | Boolean | The TCP PSH Flag reported. The push flag is similar to the URG flag and tells the receiver to process these packets as they are received instead of buffering them. |
| **TcpFlagsRst** | Optional | Boolean | The TCP RST Flag reported. The reset flag gets sent from the receiver to the sender when a packet is sent to a particular host that was not expecting it. |
| **TcpFlagsEce** | Optional | Boolean | The TCP ECE Flag reported. This flag is responsible for indicating if the TCP peer is [ECN capable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_Congestion_Notification). See [RFC 3168](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3168) for more details. |
| **TcpFlagsCwr** | Optional | Boolean | The TCP CWR Flag reported. The congestion window reduced flag is used by the sending host to indicate it received a packet with the ECE flag set. See [RFC 3168](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3168) for more details. |
| **TcpFlagsNs** | Optional | Boolean | The TCP NS Flag reported. The nonce sum flag is still an experimental flag used to help protect against accidental malicious concealment of packets from the sender. See [RFC 3540](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3540) for more details |

### Local and remote aliases

All the source and destination fields listed above, can be optionally aliased by fields with the same name and the descriptors `Local` and `Remote`. This is typically helpful for events reported by an endpoint and for which the event type is `EndpointNetworkSession`. 

For such events the descriptors `Local` and `Remote` denote the endpoint itself and the device at the other end of the network session respectively. For inbound connections, the local system is the destination, `Local` fields are aliases to the `Dst` fields, and 'Remote' fields are aliases to `Src` fields. Conversely, for outbound connections, the local system is the source, `Local` fields are aliases to the `Src` fields, and `Remote` fields are aliases to `Dst` fields.

For example, for an inbound event, the field `LocalIpAddr` is an alias to `DstIpAddr` and the field `RemoteIpAddr` is an alias to `SrcIpAddr`.

### Hostname and IP address aliases

| Field | Class | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <a name="hostname"></a>**Hostname** | Alias | | - If the event type is `NetworkSession`, `Flow` or `L2NetworkSession`, Hostname is an alias to [DstHostname](#dsthostname).<br> - If the event type is `EndpointNetworkSession`, Hostname is an alias to `RemoteHostname`, which can alias either [DstHostname](#dsthostname) or [SrcHostName](#srchostname), depending on [NetworkDirection](#networkdirection) |
| <a name="ipaddr"></a>**IpAddr** | Alias | | - If the event type is `NetworkSession`, `Flow` or `L2NetworkSession`, IpAddr is an alias to [SrcIpAddr](#srcipaddr).<br> - If the event type is `EndpointNetworkSession`, IpAddr is an alias to `LocalIpAddr`, which can alias either [SrcIpAddr](#srcipaddr) or [DstIpAddr](#dstipaddr), depending on [NetworkDirection](#networkdirection). |


### <a name="Intermediary"></a>Intermediary device and Network Address Translation (NAT) fields

The following fields are useful if the record includes information about an intermediary device, such as a firewall or a proxy, which relays the network session.

Intermediary systems often use address translation and therefore the original address and the address observed externally are not the same. In such cases, the primary address fields such as [SrcIPAddr](#srcipaddr) and [DstIpAddr](#dstipaddr) represent the addresses observed externally, while the NAT address fields, [SrcNatIpAddr](#srcnatipaddr) and [DstNatIpAddr](#dstnatipaddr) represent the internal address of the original device before translation.

| Field | Class | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <a name="dstnatipaddr"></a>**DstNatIpAddr** | Optional | IP address | The **DstNatIpAddr** represents either of:<br> - The original address of the destination device if network address translation was used.<br> - The IP address used by the intermediary device for communication with the source.<br><br>Example: `2::1` |

| <a name="srcnatipaddr"></a>**SrcNatIpAddr** | Optional | IP address | The **SrcNatIpAddr** represents either of:<br> - The original address of the source device if network address translation was used.<br> - The IP address used by the intermediary device for communication with the destination.<br><br>Example: `4.3.2.1` |
| **SrcNatPortNumber** | Optional | Integer | If reported by an intermediary NAT device, the port used by the NAT device for communication with the destination.<br><br>Example: `345` |
| <a name="dvcinboundinterface"></a>**DvcInboundInterface** | Optional | String | If reported by an intermediary device, the network interface used by the NAT device for the connection to the source device.<br><br>Example: `eth0` |
| <a name="dvcoutboundinterface"></a>**DvcOutboundInterface** | Optional | String | If reported by an intermediary device, the network interface used by the NAT device for the connection to the destination device.<br><br>Example: `Ethernet adapter Ethernet 4e` |


### <a name="inspection-fields"></a>Inspection fields

The following fields are used to represent that inspection which a security device such as a firewall, an IPS, or a web security gateway performed:

| **ThreatRiskLevel** | Optional | Integer | The risk level associated with the session. The level should be a number between **0** and **100**.<br><br>**Note**: The value might be provided in the source record by using a different scale, which should be normalized to this scale. The original value should be stored in [ThreatRiskLevelOriginal](#threatoriginalriskleveloriginal). |
| <a name="threatoriginalriskleveloriginal"></a>**ThreatOriginalRiskLevel** | Optional | String | The risk level as reported by the reporting device. |
| **ThreatIpAddr** | Optional | IP Address | An IP address for which a threat was identified. The field [ThreatField](#threatfield) contains the name of the field **ThreatIpAddr** represents. |
