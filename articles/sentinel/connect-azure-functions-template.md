# Use Azure Functions to connect Microsoft Sentinel to your data source

You can use [Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md), in conjunction with various coding languages such as [PowerShell](../azure-functions/functions-reference-powershell.md) or Python, to create a serverless connector to the REST API endpoints of your compatible data sources. Azure Function Apps then allow you to connect Microsoft Sentinel to your data source's REST API to pull in logs.

This article describes how to configure Microsoft Sentinel for using Azure Function Apps. You may also need to configure your source system, and you can find vendor- and product-specific information links in each data connector's page in the portal, or the section for your service in the [Microsoft Sentinel data connectors reference](data-connectors-reference.md) page.

> [!NOTE]
> - Once ingested in to Microsoft Sentinel, data is stored in the geographic location of the workspace in which you're running Microsoft Sentinel.
>
>     For long-term retention, you may also want to store data in log types such as *Auxiliary logs* or *Basic logs*. For more information, see [Log retention plans in Microsoft Sentinel](log-plans.md).
>
> - Using Azure Functions to ingest data into Microsoft Sentinel may result in additional data ingestion costs. For more information, see the [Azure Functions pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/) page.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have the following permissions and credentials before using Azure Functions to connect Microsoft Sentinel to your data source and pull its logs into Microsoft Sentinel:

- You must have read and write permissions on the Microsoft Sentinel workspace.

- You must have read permissions to shared keys for the workspace. [Learn more about workspace keys](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agent-windows#workspace-id-and-key).

- You must have read and write permissions on Azure Functions to create a Function App. [Learn more about Azure Functions](../azure-functions/index.yml).

- You will also need credentials for accessing the product's API - either a username and password, a token, a key, or some other combination. You may also need other API information such as an endpoint URI.

    For more information, see the documentation for the service you're connecting to and the section for your service in the [Microsoft Sentinel data connectors reference](data-connectors-reference.md) page.

- Install the solution that contains your Azure Functions-based connector from the **Content Hub** in Microsoft Sentinel. For more information, see [Discover and manage Microsoft Sentinel out-of-the-box content](sentinel-solutions-deploy.md).

## Configure and connect your data source

> [!NOTE]
> - You can securely store workspace and API authorization keys or tokens in Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault provides a secure mechanism to store and retrieve key values. [Follow these instructions](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references.md) to use Azure Key Vault with an Azure Function App.
>
> - Some data connectors depend on a parser based on a [Kusto Function](/kusto/query/functions/user-defined-functions?view=microsoft-sentinel&preserve-view=true) to work as expected. See the section for your service in the [Microsoft Sentinel data connectors reference](data-connectors-reference.md) page for links to instructions to create the Kusto function and alias.


### Step 1: Get your source system's API credentials

Follow your source system's instructions to get its **API credentials / authorization keys / tokens**. Copy and paste them into a text file for later.

You can find details on the exact credentials you'll need, and links to your product's instructions for finding or creating them, on the data connector page in the portal and in the section for your service in the [Microsoft Sentinel data connectors reference](data-connectors-reference.md) page.

You may also need to configure logging or other settings on your source system. You'll find the relevant instructions together with those in the preceding paragraph.
### Step 2: Deploy the connector and the associated Azure Function App

#### Choose a deployment option

## Find your data

After a successful connection is established, the data appears in **Logs** under *CustomLogs*, in the tables listed in the section for your service in the [Microsoft Sentinel data connectors reference](data-connectors-reference.md) page.

To query data, enter one of those table names - or the relevant Kusto function alias - in the query window.

See the **Next steps** tab in the connector page for some useful sample queries.

## Validate connectivity

It may take up to 20 minutes until your logs start to appear in Log Analytics.
