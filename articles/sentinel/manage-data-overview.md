# Manage data tiers and retention in Microsoft Sentinel (preview)

Data you collect into Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) and Microsoft Defender XDR is stored in tables. The Microsoft Defender portal lets you manage the retention period and the store costs associated with your data. You can manage retention and costs when you:

- [Configure data connectors](configure-data-connector.md) to send data to Microsoft Sentinel or Microsoft Defender XDR.
- [Manage your existing tables and data](manage-table-tiers-retention.md).

This article explains how to manage table retention and tier options in the Microsoft Defender portal to optimize security operations and reduce costs in Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR.

## Which tables can you manage in the Defender portal?

This section describes the table types you can manage in the Defender portal.

| **XDR**| Tables in the XDR default tier, which have 30 days of analytics retention by default. You can view these tables, but you can't manage them from the Defender portal.                                                                       | `IdentityInfo` | No |

> [!NOTE]
> You can view Basic logs tables in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace from the Defender portal, but you can only currently manage them from your Log Analytics workspace. To manage these tables from the Defender portal, change the table plan from basic to analytics in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
 
## How data tiers and retention work

You can retain data in Microsoft Sentinel in one of two tiers: 

* **Analytics tier**: This tier makes data available for alerting, hunting, workbooks, and all Microsoft Sentinel features. It retains data in two states:

  - **Analytics retention**: In this "hot" state, data is fully available for real-time analytics - including high-performance queries and analytics rules - and threat hunting. By default, Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR retain data in this tier for 30 days. You can extend the retention period of all tables to up to two years at a prorated monthly long-term retention charge. You can extend the retention period of Microsoft Sentinel solution tables to 90 days for free. 
  - **Total retention**: By default, all data in the analytics tier is mirrored to the data lake for the same retention period. You can extend the retention of your data in the lake beyond the analytics retention, for up to 12 years of total retention at a low cost. 

* **Data lake tier**: In this low-cost "cold" tier, Microsoft Sentinel retains your data in the lake only. Data in the data lake tier isn't available for real-time analytics features and threat hunting. However, you can access data in the lake whenever you need it through [KQL jobs](datalake/kql-jobs.md), analyze trends over time by running scheduled KQL or Spark jobs, and aggregate insights from incoming data at a regular cadence by using summary rules. 

* **XDR default tier**: By default, Microsoft Defender XDR retains threat hunting data in the XDR default tier, which includes 30 days of analytics retention, included in the XDR license. This data is not ingested into the analytics or data lake tiers. You can extend the retention period of [supported Defender XDR tables](#preview-limitations) beyond 30 days and ingest the data into the analytics tier. For more information see [Manage XDR data in Microsoft Sentinel](#manage-xdr-data-in-microsoft-sentinel)

For more information about the differences between these two retention types, see [Compare the analytics and data lake tiers](#compare-the-analytics-and-data-lake-tiers).

This diagram shows the retention components of the analytics, data lake, and XDR default tiers, and which table types apply to each tier:

## What happens when you modify table settings

You can switch a table's tier and retention settings at any time. 

When you change a table's tier from analytics to data lake, all real-time analytics and hunting queries stop working. 

When you shorten a table's total retention, Microsoft waits 30 days before removing the data, so you can revert the change and avoid data loss if you made an error in configuration. 

When you increase total retention, the new retention period applies to all data that was already ingested into the table and wasn't yet removed.   

When you change the analytics retention settings of a table with existing data, the change takes effect immediately. 

***Example***: 

- You have a table in the analytics tier with 180 days of analytics retention. By default, the Total retention is also set to 180 days. 
- You change the analytics retention to 90 days without changing the Total retention period of 180 days. 
- Microsoft Sentinel removes the last 90 days of data from in analytics retention automatically, but continues to store data that's 90-180 days in the data lake.

## Manage XDR data in Microsoft Sentinel

By default, Microsoft Defender XDR retains threat hunting data in the **XDR default tier**, for 30 days. This data isn't ingested into the analytics or data lake tiers by default. If you extend the retention period of the supported XDR tables beyond 30 days, the tables are created in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace in the analytics tier and mirrored to the data lake tier. You can't ingest XDR tables directly to the data lake tier without ingesting into the analytics tier first.

If the Microsoft Sentinel XDR connector was already enabled in the Azure portal, the tables you selected when setting up the connector are automatically ingested into the analytics tier and mirrored to the data lake tier. The default retention is 30 days, and it can be extended up to 12 years. For a list of tables see [Microsoft Defender XDR integration with Microsoft Sentinel](connect-microsoft-365-defender.md?tabs=MDE#connect-events). Supported XDR tables that weren't selected during the connector deployment can be ingested into the analytics tier and mirrored to the data lake tier by setting the retention to more than 30 days.
    
If the Microsoft Sentinel XDR connector isn't enabled, XDR tables aren't automatically ingested but can still be ingested by setting analytics retention for more than 30 days in the Defender portal. The data is automatically mirrored to the data lake tier for the same period.

Stop ingesting data into the analytics tier by resetting the analytics tier retention and total retention to the default 30 days. This disables the connector in the Azure portal.

For more information about managing your tables and data, see [Manage your existing tables and data](manage-table-tiers-retention.md).

### XDR data retention and costs

The following tables summarize the free retention periods and cost implications for the different tiers in Microsoft Sentinel:

|Tier|	Retention| Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Advanced Hunting (Default)|	30 days	| Default,  included in XDR license|
|Analytics tier | 90 days | Free storage for Sentinel-enabled workspaces. Ingestion charges apply.|
|Data lake	| Configurable. By default, the same as the analytics tier. | Free storage when total retention is the same as analytics tier retention. Retaining data in the data lake beyond the analytics tier retention period incurs additional storage costs.|

For more information on billing and costs, see [Understand the full billing model for Microsoft Sentinel](billing.md#understand-the-full-billing-model-for-microsoft-sentinel)

In the following examples, XDR data is available through advanced hunting for at least 30 days, regardless of the retention settings in the analytics or data lake tiers.

 Analytics tier retention | Total retention |  Analytics tier ingestion costs| Analytics tier storage costs | Data lake tier costs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 30 days default | 30 days default| No additional costs | N/A  | N/A |
| 90 days | 90 days | Costs apply for analytics tier ingestion. | No additional costs. 90 days included free. | No additional costs. Total retention matches analytics tier retention.|
| 90 days | 180 days | Costs apply for analytics tier ingestion. | No additional costs; 90 days included free. | Costs apply for 90 days of additional data lake retention (180 - 90 days). |
| 30 days with connector enabled | 180 days | Costs apply for analytics tier ingestion. | No additional costs; 90 days included free. | Costs apply for 150 days of additional data lake retention (180 - 30 days). |
| 180 days | 1 year | Costs apply for analytics tier ingestion. | Costs apply for 90 days of additional analytics tier retention. | Costs apply for 185 days of additional data lake retention (365 - 180 days). |

  
## Preview limitations

As part of the public preview:

- Microsoft Sentinel tables with the Basic plan can only be managed from the Log Analytics workspace. For more information, see [Manage tables in a Log Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-logs-tables). 

  To manage retention and tiering from the Microsoft Defender portal, change the table plan to analytics from the Log Analytics workspace.
 
- Some Microsoft Defender XDR tables can only be viewed in the Microsoft Defender portal. Currently, the Microsoft Defender portal supports managing these Microsoft Defender XDR tables:

  - AlertEvidence
  - AlertInfo
  - CampaignInfo
  - CloudAppEvents
  - DeviceEvents
  - DeviceFileCertificateInfo
  - DeviceFileEvents
  - DeviceImageLoadEvents
  - DeviceInfo
  - DeviceLogonEvents
  - DeviceNetworkEvents
  - DeviceNetworkInfo
  - DeviceProcessEvents
  - DeviceRegistryEvents
  - EmailAttachmentInfo
  - EmailEvents
  - EmailPostDeliveryEvents
  - EmailUrlInfo
  - FileMaliciousContentInfo
