# Reference the legacy upload indicators API

The Microsoft Sentinel upload indicators API allowed threat intelligence platforms or custom applications to import indicators of compromise in the STIX format into a Microsoft Sentinel workspace. This document serves as a reference to the legacy API.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is in PREVIEW but no longer recommended. Use the new STIX objects API in preview to upload threat intelligence. For more information, see [STIX objects API](stix-objects-api.md).
> The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
>

An upload indicators API call has five components:

1. The request URI
1. HTTP request message header
1. HTTP request message body
1. Optionally process the HTTP response message header
1. Optionally process the HTTP response message body

<a name='register-your-client-application-with-azure-ad'></a>

## Register your client application with Microsoft Entra ID

In order to authenticate to Microsoft Sentinel, the request to the upload indicators API requires a valid Microsoft Entra access token. For more information on application registration, see [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) or see the basic steps as part of the [upload indicators API data connector](connect-threat-intelligence-upload-api.md#register-an-azure-ad-application) setup.

## Permissions

This API requires the calling Microsoft Entra application to be granted the Microsoft Sentinel contributor role at the workspace level.

## Create the request

This section covers the first three of the five components discussed earlier. You first need to acquire the access token from Microsoft Entra ID, which you use to assemble your request message header.

### Acquire an access token

Acquire a Microsoft Entra access token with [OAuth 2.0 authentication](../active-directory/fundamentals/auth-oauth2.md). [V1.0 and V2.0](/entra/identity-platform/access-tokens#token-formats) are valid tokens accepted by the API.

The version of the token (v1.0 or v2.0) that your application receives is determined by the `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property in the [app manifest](/entra/identity-platform/reference-app-manifest#manifest-reference) of the API that your application is calling. If `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` is set to 1, then your application will receive a v1.0 token.

Use Microsoft Authentication Library [MSAL](/entra/identity-platform/msal-overview) to acquire either a v1.0 or v2.0 access token.  Or, send requests to the REST API in the following format:
- POST `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{{tenantId}}/oauth2/v2.0/token`
- Headers for using Microsoft Entra App:
- grant_type: "client_credentials"
- client_id: {Client ID of Microsoft Entra App}
- client_secret: {secret of Microsoft Entra App}
- scope: `"https://management.azure.com/.default"`

If `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` in the app manifest is set to 1, your application will receive a v1.0 access token even though it's calling the v2 token endpoint.

The resource/scope value is the audience of the token. This API only accepts the following audiences:
- `https://management.core.windows.net/`
- `https://management.core.windows.net`
- `https://management.azure.com/`
- `https://management.azure.com`


### Assemble the request message

There were two versions of the legacy API. Depending on the endpoint, a different array name was required in the request body. This was also represented by two versions of the logic app connector action.

#### Request URI 
API versioning: `api-version=2022-07-01`<br>
Endpoint: `https://sentinelus.azure-api.net/workspaces/{workspaceId}/threatintelligenceindicators:upload?api-version=2022-07-01`<br>
Method: `POST`<br>

#### Request header
`Authorization`: Contains the OAuth2 bearer token<br>
`Content-Type`: `application/json`

#### Request body
The JSON object for the body contains the following fields:

|`pattern_type` (required) | string | The pattern language used in this indicator.<br><br>The value for this property *should* come from [pattern types](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#_9lfdvxnyofxw).<br><br>The value of this property *must* match the type of pattern data included in the pattern property.|
|`pattern_version` (optional) | string | The version of the pattern language used for the data in the pattern property, which *must* match the type of pattern data included in the pattern property.<br><br>For patterns that don't have a formal specification, the build or code version that the pattern is known to work with *should* be used.<br><br>For the STIX pattern language, the specification version of the object determines the default value.<br><br>For other languages, the default value *should* be the latest version of the patterning language at the time of this object's creation.|
|`valid_from` (required) | timestamp | The time from which this indicator is considered a valid indicator of the behaviors it's related to or represents.|
|`valid_until` (optional) | timestamp | The time at which this indicator should no longer be considered a valid indicator of the behaviors it's related to or represents.<br><br>If the valid_until property is omitted, then there is no constraint on the latest time for which the indicator is valid.<br><br>This timestamp *must* be greater than the valid_from timestamp.|
|`kill_chain_phases` (optional) | list of string | The kill chain phase(s) to which this indicator corresponds.<br><br>The value for this property *should* come from the [Kill Chain Phase](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#_i4tjv75ce50h).|
|`created_by_ref` (optional) | string | The created_by_ref property specifies the ID property of the entity that created this object.<br><br>If this attribute is omitted, the source of this information is undefined. For object creators who wish to remain anonymous, keep this value undefined.|
|`revoked` (optional) | boolean | Revoked objects are no longer considered valid by the object creator. Revoking an object is permanent; future versions of the object with this `id` *must not* be created.<br><br>The default value of this property is false.|
|`labels` (optional) | list of strings | The `labels` property specifies a set of terms used to describe this object. The terms are user-defined or trust-group defined. These labels will display as **Tags** in Microsoft Sentinel.|

The confidence value *must* be a number in the range of 0-100.<br><br>[Appendix A](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#_1v6elyto0uqg) contains a table of normative mappings to other confidence scales that *must* be used when presenting the confidence value in one of those scales.<br><br>If the confidence property is not present, then the confidence of the content is unspecified.|
|`lang` (optional) | string | The `lang` property identifies the language of the text content in this object. When present, it *must* be a language code conformant to [RFC5646](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#kix.yoz409d7eis1). If the property isn't present, then the language of the content is `en` (English).<br><br>This property *should* be present if the object type contains translatable text properties (for example, name, description).<br><br>The language of individual fields in this object *might* override the `lang` property in granular markings (see section [7.2.3](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#_robezi5egfdr)).|
|`object_marking_refs` (optional, including TLP) | list of strings | The `object_marking_refs` property specifies a list of ID properties of marking-definition objects that apply to this object. For example, use the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) marking definition ID to designate the sensitivity of the indicator source.

For example, the indicator language is English, `en` but the description is German, `de`.<br><br>In some cases, though uncommon, marking definitions themselves might be marked with sharing or handling guidance. In this case, this property *must not* contain any references to the same Marking Definition object (i.e., it can't contain any circular references).<br><br>See section [7.2.3](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#_robezi5egfdr) for further definition of data markings.|


### Process the response message

The response header contains an HTTP status code. Reference this table for more information about how to interpret the API call result.

|Status code  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**200**     |   Success. The API returns 200 when one or more indicators are successfully validated and published. |
|**400**     |   Bad format. Something in the request isn't correctly formatted.    |
|**401**     |   Unauthorized. |
|**404**     |   File not found. Usually this error occurs when the workspace ID isn't found.   |
|**429**     |   The number of requests in a minute has exceeded.   |
|**500**     |   Server error. Usually an error in the API or Microsoft Sentinel services. |

The response body is an array of error messages in JSON format:

|Field name | Data Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
|errors	| Array of error objects | List of validation errors |

**Error object**

|Field name | Data Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
|recordIndex | int | Index of the indicators in the request |
|errorMessages | Array of strings | Error messages |


## Throttling limits for the API

All limits are applied per user:
- 100 indicators per request. 
- 100 requests per minute.

If there are more requests than the limit, a `429` http status code in the response header is returned with the following response body:
```json
{
    "statusCode": 429,
    "message": "Rate limit is exceeded. Try again in <number of seconds> seconds."
}
```
Approximately 10,000 indicators per minute is the maximum throughput before a throttling error is received.

        }
    ]
}
```

### Sample response body with validation error
If all indicators are validated successfully, an HTTP 200 status is returned with an empty response body. 

If validation fails for one or more indicators, the response body is returned with more information. For example, if you send an array with four indicators, and the first three are good but the fourth doesn't have an `id` (a required field), then an HTTP status code 200 response is generated along with the following body:

```json
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "recordIndex":3, 
            "errorMessages": [
                "Error for Property=id: Required property is missing. Actual value: NULL."
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
The indicators are sent as an array, so the `recordIndex` begins at `0`.

## Next step

This API is legacy. Please migrate to use the STIX objects API to upload threat intelligence. For more information, see [STIX objects API](stix-objects-api.md).
