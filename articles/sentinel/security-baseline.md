# Azure security baseline for Azure Sentinel

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview) to Azure Sentinel. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Sentinel. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Sentinel have been excluded. To see how Azure Sentinel completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Sentinel security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

### 4.6: Use Role-based access control to control access to resources

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/18734).

**Guidance**: You can use the Identity and Access control (IAM) pane in the Azure portal to configure role-based access control (RBAC). The roles are applied to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities in Active Directory. You can use built-in roles or custom roles for individuals and groups. 

Azure Sentinel uses RBAC to provide built-in roles that can be assigned to users, groups, and services in Azure. Using RBAC, you can use and create roles within your security operations team to grant appropriate access to Azure Sentinel. Based on the roles, you have fine-grained control over what users with access to Azure Sentinel can see. You can assign RBAC roles in the Azure Sentinel workspace directly, or to a subscription or resource group that the workspace belongs to. There are three specific built-in Azure Sentinel roles:

- Azure Sentinel reader
- Azure Sentinel responder
- Azure Sentinel contributor

In addition to Azure Sentinel dedicated RBAC roles, there are Azure and Log Analytics RBAC roles that can grant a wider set of permissions that include access to your Azure Sentinel workspace and other resources:

Azure roles include Owner, Contributor, and Reader. Azure roles grant access across all your Azure resources, including Log Analytics workspaces and Azure Sentinel resources.

Log Analytics roles include Log Analytics contributor and Log Analytics reader. Log Analytics roles grant access across all your Log Analytics workspaces.

Additionally, each workbook is an Azure resource like any other, and you can assign it roles (RBAC) to define and limit who can access.

**Guidance**: Configure a customer-managed key (CMK) for Azure Sentinel. CMK enables all data saved or sent to Azure Sentinel to be encrypted in all relevant storage resources with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. The Azure Sentinel solution uses several storage resources for log collection and features, including Log Analytics and others. As part of the Azure Sentinel CMK configuration, you will have to configure the CMK settings on the related storage resources as well. Data saved in storage resources other than Log Analytics will also be encrypted.

### 7.11: Manage Azure secrets securely

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/18766).

**Guidance**: Configure a customer-managed key (CMK) for Azure Sentinel. CMK enables all data saved or sent to Azure Sentinel to be encrypted in all relevant storage resources with an Azure Key Vault key created or owned by you. The Azure Sentinel solution uses a several storage resources for log collection and features, these include Log Analytics and other storage resources. As part of the Azure Sentinel CMK configuration, you will have to configure the CMK settings on the related storage resources as well. Data saved in storage resources other than Log Analytics will also be encrypted.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/18775).

**Guidance**: Enable Soft-Delete in Key Vault to protect keys against accidental or malicious deletion. In the event that a user revokes the key encryption key, either by deleting it or removing access for Azure Sentinel, within one hour, Azure Sentinel will honor the change and behave as if the data is no longer available. At this point, any operation performed that uses persistent storage resources such as data ingestion, persistent configuration changes, and incident creation, will be prevented. Previously stored data will not be deleted but will remain inaccessible. Inaccessible data is governed by the data-retention policy and will be purged in accordance with that policy.

The only operation possible after the encryption key is revoked or deleted is account deletion.

If access is restored after revocation, Azure Sentinel will restore access to the data within an hour.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/18777).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources.
