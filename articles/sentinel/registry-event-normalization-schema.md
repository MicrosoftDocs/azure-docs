# Azure Sentinel Registry Event normalization schema reference (Public preview)

The Registry Event schema is used to describe the Windows activity of creating, modifying, or deleting Windows Registry entities. 

Registry events are specific to Windows systems, but are reported by different systems that monitor Windows, such as EDR (End Point Detection and Response) systems, Sysmon, or Windows itself.

For more information about normalization in Azure Sentinel, see [Normalization and the Azure Sentinel Information Model (ASIM)](normalization.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Registry Event normalization schema is currently in public preview.
> This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Parsers

Azure Sentinel provides the following built-in, product-specific registry event parsers:

- **Security Events registry update (Event 4657**), collected using the Log Analytics Agent or Azure Monitor Agent
- **Sysmon registry monitoring events (Events 12, 13, and 14)**, collected using the Log Analytics Agent or Azure Monitor Agent
- **Microsoft 365 Defender for Endpoints registry events**

To use the source-agnostic parser that unifies all of the built-in parsers, and ensure that your analysis runs across all the configured sources, use **imRegistry** as the table name in your query.

Deploy the [source-agnostic and source-specific parsers](normalization-about-parsers.md) from the [Azure Sentinel GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/AzSentinelRegistry).

### Add your own normalized parsers

When implementing custom parsers for the Registry Event information model, name your KQL functions using the following syntax: `imRegistry<vendor><Product>`.

Add your KQL functions to the `imRegistry` source-agnostic parsers to ensure that any content using the Registry Event model also uses your new parser.

## Normalized content

Azure Sentinel provides the [Persisting Via IFEO Registry Key](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Hunting%20Queries/MultipleDataSources/PersistViaIFEORegistryKey.yaml) hunting query. This query works on any registry activity data normalized using the Azure Sentinel Information Model.

For more information, see [Hunt for threats with Azure Sentinel](hunting.md).

## Schema details

The Registry Event information model is aligned with the [OSSEM Registry entity schema](https://github.com/OTRF/OSSEM/blob/master/docs/cdm/entities/registry.md).

### Log Analytics fields


The following fields are generated by Log Analytics for each record, and can be overridden when creating a custom connector.

| Field         | Type     | Discussion      |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <a name="timegenerated"></a>**TimeGenerated** | datetime | The time the event was generated by the reporting device.|
| **_ResourceId**   | guid     | The Azure Resource ID of the reporting device or service, or the log forwarder resource ID for events forwarded using Syslog, CEF, or WEF. |


> [!NOTE]
> Log Analytics also adds other fields that are less relevant to security use cases. For more information, see [Standard columns in Azure Monitor Logs](../azure-monitor/logs/log-standard-columns.md).
>

### Event fields


Event fields are common to all schemas and describe the activity itself and the reporting device.

| Field               | Class       | Type       |  Description        |
|---------------------|-------------|------------|--------------------|
| **EventMessage**        | Optional    | String     |     A general message or description, either included in or generated from the record.   |
| **EventCount**          | Mandatory   | Integer    |     The number of events described by the record. <br><br>This value is used when the source supports aggregation, and a single record may represent multiple events. <br><br>For other sources, set to `1`.   |
| **EventStartTime**      | Mandatory   | Date/time  |      If the source supports aggregation and the record represents multiple events, this field specifies the time that the first event was generated. <br><br>Otherwise, this field aliases the [TimeGenerated](#timegenerated) field. |
| **EventEndTime**        | Mandatory   | Alias      |      Alias to the [TimeGenerated](#timegenerated) field.    |
| **EventType**           | Mandatory   | Enumerated |    Describes the operation reported by the record. <br><br>For Registry records, supported values include: <br>- `RegistryKeyCreated` <br>- `RegistryKeyDeleted`<br>- `RegistryKeyRenamed` <br>- `RegistryValueDeleted` <br>- `RegistryValueSet`|

| <a name ="eventproduct"></a>**EventProduct**        | Mandatory   | String     |             The product generating the event. <br><br>Example: `Sysmon`<br><br>**Note**: This field may not be available in the source record. In such cases, this field must be set by the parser.           |
| **EventProductVersion** | Optional    | String     | The version of the product generating the event. <br><br>Example: `12.1`      |
| **EventVendor**         | Mandatory   | String     |           The vendor of the product generating the event. <br><br>Example: `Microsoft`  <br><br>**Note**: This field may not be available in the source record. In such cases, this field must be set by the parser.  |
| **EventSchemaVersion**  | Mandatory   | String     |    The version of the schema. The version of the schema documented here is `0.1`         |
| **EventReportUrl**      | Optional    | String     | A URL provided in the event for a resource that provides additional information about the event.|
| **Dvc** | Mandatory       | String     |               A unique identifier of the device on which the event occurred. <br><br>This field may alias the [DvcId](#dvcid), [DvcHostname](#dvchostname), or [DvcIpAddr](#dvcipaddr) fields. For cloud sources, for which there is no apparent device, use the same value as the [EventProduct](#eventproduct) field.         |
| <a name ="dvcipaddr"></a>**DvcIpAddr**           | Recommended | IP Address |         The IP Address of the device on which the registry event occurred.  <br><br>Example: `45.21.42.12`    |
| <a name ="dvchostname"></a>**DvcHostname**         | Recommended | Hostname   |               The hostname of the device on which the registry event occurred. <br><br>Example: `ContosoDc.Contoso.Azure`               |
| <a name ="dvcid"></a>**DvcId**               | Optional    | String     |  The unique ID of the device on which the registry event occurred. <br><br>Example: `41502da5-21b7-48ec-81c9-baeea8d7d669`   |

| **DvcOsVersion**        | Optional    | String     |   The version of the operating system on the device on which the registry event occurred. <br><br>Example: `10` |
| **AdditionalFields**    | Optional    | Dynamic    | If your source provides additional information worth preserving, either keep it with the original field names or create the dynamic **AdditionalFields** field, and add to it the extra information as key/value pairs.    |


### Registry Event specific fields

The fields listed in the table below are specific to Registry events, but are similar to fields in other schemas and follow similar naming conventions.

For more information, see [Structure of the Registry](/windows/win32/sysinfo/structure-of-the-registry) in Windows documentation.
