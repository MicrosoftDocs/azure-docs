# Service limits for Microsoft Sentinel

This article lists the most common service limits you might encounter as you use Microsoft Sentinel. For other limits that might impact services or features you use, like Azure Monitor, see [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md).

## Analytics rule limits

The following limit applies to analytics rules in Microsoft Sentinel.

| Description | Limit  | Dependency |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Number of *enabled* rules     | 512 rules       | None |
| Number of near-real-time (NRT) rules | 50 NRT rules | None |
| [Entity mappings](map-data-fields-to-entities.md) | 10 mappings per rule | None |
| [Entities](map-data-fields-to-entities.md) identified per alert<br>(Divided equally among the mapped entities) | 500 entities per alert | None |
| [Entities](map-data-fields-to-entities.md) cumulative size limit | 64 KB | None |
| [Custom details](surface-custom-details-in-alerts.md) | 20 details per rule<br>50 values per detail<br>2 KB cumulative size | None |
| [Alert details](customize-alert-details.md) | 50 values per overridden field<br>5 KB per field for `Description` and collections<br>256 bytes per field for `AlertName` and non-collections | None |
| Alerts per rule<br>Applicable when *Event grouping* is set to *Trigger an alert for each event* | 150 alerts | None |
| Alerts per rule for NRT rules | 30 alerts | None |

## Hunts limits

The following limits apply to Hunts in Microsoft Sentinel.

| Description | Limit | Dependency |
| --------- | --------- | ------- |
|Number of Hunts | 100 | None |

## Incident limits

The following limits apply to incidents in Microsoft Sentinel.

| Description | Limit | Dependency |
| --------- | --------- | ------- |
| Investigation experience availability | 90 days from the incident last update time | None |
| Retention period for incident entities | 180 days | Entities database retention |
| Number of alerts | 150 alerts  | None |
| Number of automation rules     | 512 rules | None |
| Number of automation rule actions  | 20 actions  | None |
| Number of automation rule conditions  | 50 conditions | None |
| Number of bookmarks  | 20 bookmarks  | None |
| Number of characters for automation rule name  | 500 characters  | None |
| Number of characters for description  | 5,000 characters | None |
| Number of characters per comment   | 30,000 characters  | None |
| Number of comments per incident   | 100 comments  | None |
| Number of tasks  | 40 tasks | None |
| Number of incidents returned by API to *list* request | 1,000 incidents maximum | None |
| Number of incidents per day (per workspace) | See explanation after table | Database capacity |

**Number of incidents per day:** There isn't a formal, hard limit on the number of incidents that can be created per day. A workspace's actual capacity for incidents depends on the storage capacity of the incident database, so the size of the incidents is as much a factor as their number.

However, a SOC that experiences the creation of more than *around* 3,000 new incidents per day will most likely find itself unable to keep up, and the database capacity will quickly be reached. In this situation, the SOC needs to find and fix any rules that create large numbers of incidents, to get the count of daily new incidents to manageable levels.

## Machine learning-based limits

The following limits apply to machine learning-based features in Microsoft Sentinel like customizable anomalies and Fusion.

| Description                                                         | Limit                                           |Dependency|
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Number of anomalies published per anomaly type                | Top 3000 ranked by anomaly score                |None|
| Number of alerts and/or anomalies in a single Fusion incident | 100 alerts and/or anomalies |None|


## Multi workspace limits

The following limit applies to multiple workspaces in Microsoft Sentinel. Limits here are applied when working with Sentinel features across more than workspace at a time.

|Description                   | Limit        |Dependency|
-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Incident view | 100 concurrently displayed workspaces | |
| Log query | 100 Sentinel workspaces | [Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/cross-workspace-query#limitations) |
| Analytics rules | 20 Sentinel workspaces per query | |

## Notebook limits

The following limits apply to notebooks in Microsoft Sentinel. The limits are related to the dependencies on other services used by notebooks.

|Description|Limit |Dependency|
|-------|-------|-------|
| Total count of these assets per machine learning workspace: datasets, runs, models, and artifacts |10 million assets |Azure Machine Learning|
| Default limit for total compute clusters per region. Limit is shared between a training cluster and a compute instance. A compute instance is considered a single-node cluster for quota purposes. | 200 compute clusters per region|Azure Machine Learning|
|Storage accounts per region per subscription|250 storage accounts|Azure Storage|
|Maximum size of a file share by default|5 TB|Azure Storage|
|Maximum size of a file share with large file share feature enabled|100 TB|Azure Storage|
