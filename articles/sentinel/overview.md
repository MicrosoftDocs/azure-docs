# What is Microsoft Sentinel?

Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) that delivers scalable, cost-efficient security across multicloud and multi-platform environments with built-in AI, automation, threat intelligence, and a modern data lake architecture. Microsoft Sentinel provides cyberthreat detection, investigation, response, and proactive hunting, with a bird's-eye view across your enterprise.

Microsoft Sentinel also natively incorporates proven Azure services, like Log Analytics and Logic Apps, and enriches your investigation and detection with AI. It uses both Microsoft's threat intelligence stream and also enables you to bring your own threat intelligence.

Microsoft Sentinel empowers analysts to anticipate and stop attacks across clouds and platforms, faster and with greater precision. Use Microsoft Sentinel to alleviate the stress of increasingly sophisticated attacks, increasing volumes of alerts, and long resolution time frames. This article highlights the key capabilities in Microsoft Sentinel.

Microsoft Sentinel inherits the Azure Monitor [tamper-proofing and immutability](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-security#tamper-proofing-and-immutability) practices. While Azure Monitor is an append-only data platform, it includes provisions to delete data for compliance purposes.

The following table highlights the key capabilities in Microsoft Sentinel for data collection.

|Capability|Description|Get started|
|---------|---------|---------|
|Out of the box data connectors  | Many connectors are packaged with SIEM solutions for Microsoft Sentinel and provide real-time integration. These connectors include Microsoft sources and Azure sources like Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Activity, Azure Storage, and more. <br><br>Out of the box connectors are also available for the broader security and applications ecosystems for non-Microsoft solutions. You can also use common event format, Syslog, or REST-API to connect your data sources with Microsoft Sentinel.  | [Microsoft Sentinel data connectors](connect-data-sources.md)   |
|Custom connectors    |  Microsoft Sentinel supports ingesting data from some sources without a dedicated connector. If you're unable to connect your data source to Microsoft Sentinel using an existing solution, create your own data source connector.        |  [Resources for creating Microsoft Sentinel custom connectors](create-custom-connector.md).       |
|Data normalization     | Microsoft Sentinel uses both query time and ingestion time normalization to translate various sources into a uniform, normalized view.        |   [Normalization and the Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM)](normalization.md)      |

## Microsoft Sentinel data lake

Microsoft Sentinel provides a modern data lake, designed to help security operations teams simplify data management, optimize costs, and accelerate the adoption of AI. Microsoft Sentinel data lake provides affordable, long-term storage so that organizations no longer are required to compromise between cost and better security. Security operations teams now have enhanced visibility to resolve incidents faster within the Microsoft Sentinel experience and enriched through integration with data analytics tools.

| Capability | Description | Get started  |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Optimize costs and coverage | Manage costs and coverage with seamless data tiering and a centralized management experience.  | [Log retention plans in Microsoft Sentinel](log-plans.md)                                |
| Interactive KQL Exploration | KQL queries allow you to interactively explore and analyze data in the Microsoft Sentinel data lake. You can run ad-hoc queries, create scheduled jobs, and promote data to the analytics tier for further analysis. The KQL query editor provides a familiar interface for security analysts to work with long-term data.                        | [KQL and Microsoft Sentinel data lake (overview)](datalake/kql-overview.md)                        |
| Notebooks for Exploration   | Jupyter notebooks are an integral part of the Microsoft Sentinel data lake ecosystem, offering powerful tools for data analysis and visualization. The notebooks are provided by a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to interact with the data lake using Python and Apache Spark. Notebooks enable you to perform complex data transformations, run machine learning models, and create visualizations directly within the notebook environment. | [Notebooks (overview)](datalake/notebooks-overview.md)                                                               |

The following table highlights the key capabilities in Microsoft Sentinel for threat detection.

|Capacity  |Description |Get started|
|---------|---------|---------|
|Analytics | Helps you reduce noise and minimize the number of alerts you have to review and investigate. Microsoft Sentinel uses analytics to group alerts into incidents. Use the out of the box analytic rules as-is, or as a starting point to build your own rules. Microsoft Sentinel also provides rules to map your network behavior and then look for anomalies across your resources. These analytics connect the dots, by combining low fidelity alerts about different entities into potential high-fidelity security incidents.|[Detect threats out-of-the-box](detect-threats-built-in.md)   |
|MITRE ATT&CK coverage   | Microsoft Sentinel analyzes ingested data, not only to detect threats and help you investigate, but also to visualize the nature and coverage of your organization's security status based on the tactics and techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK® framework.|[Understand security coverage by the MITRE ATT&CK® framework](mitre-coverage.md)     |
|Threat intelligence    | Integrate numerous sources of threat intelligence into Microsoft Sentinel to detect malicious activity in your environment and provide context to security investigators for informed response decisions. | [Threat intelligence in Microsoft Sentinel](understand-threat-intelligence.md)      |
|Watchlists   |  Correlate data from a data source you provide, a watchlist, with the events in your Microsoft Sentinel environment. For example, you might create a watchlist with a list of high-value assets, terminated employees, or service accounts in your environment. Use watchlists in your search, detection rules, threat hunting, and response playbooks. | [Watchlists in Microsoft Sentinel](watchlists.md)   |
|Workbooks     |   Create interactive visual reports by using workbooks. Microsoft Sentinel comes with built-in workbook templates that allow you to quickly gain insights across your data as soon as you connect a data source. Or, create your own custom workbooks.|  [Visualize collected data](get-visibility.md).   |

## Investigate threats

Investigate threats with artificial intelligence, and hunt for suspicious activities at scale, tapping into years of cyber security work at Microsoft.

The following table highlights the key capabilities in Microsoft Sentinel for threat investigation.

|Feature  |Description  |Get started|
|---------|---------|---------|
|Incidents   |  Microsoft Sentinel deep investigation tools help you to understand the scope and find the root cause of a potential security threat. You can choose an entity on the interactive graph to ask interesting questions for a specific entity, and drill down into that entity and its connections to get to the root cause of the threat.| [Navigate and investigate incidents in Microsoft Sentinel](investigate-incidents.md)     |
|Hunts    |  Microsoft Sentinel's powerful hunting search-and-query tools, based on the MITRE framework, enable you to proactively hunt for security threats across your organization’s data sources, before an alert is triggered. Create custom detection rules based on your hunting query. Then, surface those insights as alerts to your security incident responders. | [Threat hunting in Microsoft Sentinel](hunting.md)     |
|Notebooks    | Microsoft Sentinel supports Jupyter notebooks in Azure Machine Learning workspaces, including full libraries for machine learning, visualization, and data analysis.<br><br>Use notebooks in Microsoft Sentinel to extend the scope of what you can do with Microsoft Sentinel data. For example:<br><br>- Perform analytics that aren't built in to Microsoft Sentinel, such as some Python machine learning features.<br>- Create data visualizations that aren't built in to Microsoft Sentinel, such as custom timelines and process trees.<br>- Integrate data sources outside of Microsoft Sentinel, such as an on-premises data set. | [Jupyter notebooks with Microsoft Sentinel hunting capabilities](notebooks.md)     |


## Respond to incidents rapidly

Automate your common tasks and simplify security orchestration with playbooks that integrate with Azure services and your existing tools. Microsoft Sentinel's automation and orchestration provides a highly extensible architecture that enables scalable automation as new technologies and threats emerge.

Playbooks in Microsoft Sentinel are based on workflows built in Azure Logic Apps. For example, if you use the ServiceNow ticketing system, use Azure Logic Apps to automate your workflows and open a ticket in ServiceNow each time a particular alert or incident is generated.

:::image type="content" source="media/overview/logic-app.png" lightbox="media/overview/logic-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of example automated workflow in Azure Logic Apps where an incident can trigger different actions.":::

The following table highlights the key capabilities in Microsoft Sentinel for threat response.

|Feature  |Description  |Get started|
|---------|---------|---------|
|Automation rules|Centrally manage the automation of incident handling in Microsoft Sentinel by defining and coordinating a small set of rules that cover different scenarios. |[Automate threat response in Microsoft Sentinel with automation rules](automate-incident-handling-with-automation-rules.md)|
|Playbooks|Automate and orchestrate your threat response by using playbooks, which are a collection of remediation actions. Run a playbook on-demand or automatically in response to specific alerts or incidents, when triggered by an automation rule. <br><br>  To build playbooks with Azure Logic Apps, choose from a constantly expanding gallery of connectors for various services and systems like ServiceNow, Jira, and more. These connectors allow you to apply any custom logic in your workflow. |[Automate threat response with playbooks in Microsoft Sentinel](automate-responses-with-playbooks.md)<br><br>[List of all Logic App connectors](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-logicapps-connectors)|

## Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal retirement timeline

[!INCLUDE [sentinel-azure-deprecation](includes/sentinel-azure-deprecation.md)]

### Changes for new customers starting July 2025

For the sake of the changes described in this section, new Microsoft Sentinel customers are customers who are [onboarding the first workspace in their tenant to Microsoft Sentinel](quickstart-onboard.md).

Starting **July, 2025**, such new customers who also have the permissions of a subscription [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) or a [User access administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator), and are not Azure Lighthouse-delegated users, have their workspaces automatically onboarded to the Defender portal together with onboarding to Microsoft Sentinel. 

Users of such workspaces, who also aren't Azure Lighthouse-delegated users, see links in Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal that redirect them to the Defender portal.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/overview/redirect-no-defender.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a redirect link from the Azure portal to the Defender portal.":::

Such users use Microsoft Sentinel in the Defender portal only.

New customers who don't have relevant permissions aren't automatically onboarded to the Defender portal, but they do still see redirection links in the Azure portal, together with prompts to have a user with relevant permissions manually onboard the workspace to the Defender portal.

The following table summarizes these experiences:

|Customer type| Experience|
|---------|---------|
|**Existing customers** creating new workspaces in a tenant where there is already a workspace enabled for Microsoft Sentinel | Workspaces are not automatically onboarded, and users don't see redirection links |
|**Azure Lighthouse-delegated users** creating new workspaces in any tenant | Workspaces are not automatically onboarded, and users don't see redirection links |
|**New customers** onboarding the first workspace in their tenant to Microsoft Sentinel | - **Users who have the required permissions** have their workspace automatically onboarded. Other users of such workspaces see redirection links in the Azure portal. <br><br>- **Users who don't have the required permissions** don't have their workspace automatically onboarded. All users of such workspaces see redirection links in the Azure portal, and a user with the required permissions must onboard the workspace to the Defender portal. |
