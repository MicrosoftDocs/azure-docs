# Scenario: Unable to read Apache Yarn log in Azure HDInsight

This article describes troubleshooting steps and possible resolutions for issues when interacting with Azure HDInsight clusters.

## Issue

The Apache Yarn logs found from storage account isn't human-readable. The file parser doesn't work and produces the following error message:

```
java.io.IOException: Not a valid BCFile.
```

## Cause

The Apache Yarn log is aggregated into `IndexFile` format, which is not supported by the file parser.

## Resolution

1. From a web browser, navigate to `https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net`, where `CLUSTERNAME` is the name of your cluster.

1. From Ambari UI, navigate to **YARN** > **Configs** > **Advanced** > **Advanced yarn-site**.

1. For WASB storage: The default value for `yarn.log-aggregation.file-formats` is `IndexedFormat,TFile`. Change the value to `TFile`.

1. For ADLS storage: The default value for `yarn.nodemanager.log-aggregation.compression-type` is `gz`. Change the value to `none`.

1. Save the change and restart all affected services.
