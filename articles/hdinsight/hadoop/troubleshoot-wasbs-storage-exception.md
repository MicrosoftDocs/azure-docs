# The account being accessed does not support http error in Azure HDInsight

This article describes troubleshooting steps and possible resolutions for issues when interacting with Azure HDInsight clusters.

## Issue

The following error message is received:

```
com.microsoft.azure.storage.StorageException: The account being accessed does not support http.
```

## Cause

There are multiple reasons why the error message is received:

* The storage account has [secure transfer](../../storage/common/storage-require-secure-transfer.md) enabled and the incorrect [URI scheme](../hdinsight-hadoop-linux-information.md#URI-and-scheme) is being used.

* A cluster was created with a storage account that had secure transfer *disabled*. Thereafter, secure transfer was enabled on the storage account.

## Resolution

If secure transfer is enabled for Azure Storage or Data Lake Storage Gen2, the URI would be `wasbs://` or `abfss://`, respectively.  See also, [secure transfer](../../storage/common/storage-require-secure-transfer.md).

For new clusters, use a storage account that already has the desired secure transfer setting. Do not change the secure transfer setting for a storage account that is in use by an existing cluster.
