# Cluster creation fails with InvalidNetworkConfigurationErrorCode in Azure HDInsight

This article describes troubleshooting steps and possible resolutions for issues when interacting with Azure HDInsight clusters.

If you see error code `InvalidNetworkConfigurationErrorCode` with the description "Virtual Network configuration isn't compatible with HDInsight Requirement," it usually indicates a problem with the [virtual network configuration](../hdinsight-plan-virtual-network-deployment.md) for your cluster. Based on the rest of the error description, follow the below sections to resolve your problem.

## "HostName Resolution failed"

### Issue

Error description contains "HostName Resolution failed."

### Cause

This error points to a problem with custom DNS configuration. DNS servers within a virtual network can forward DNS queries to Azure's recursive resolvers to resolve hostnames within that virtual network (see [Name Resolution in Virtual Networks](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md) for details). Access to Azure's recursive resolvers is provided via the virtual IP 168.63.129.16. This IP is only accessible from the Azure VMs. It's nonfunctional if you're using an on-premises DNS server, or your DNS server is an Azure VM, which isn't part of the cluster's virtual network.

### Resolution

1. Ssh into the VM that is part of the cluster, and run the command `hostname -f`. This command returns the host's fully qualified domain name (referred to as `<host_fqdn>` in the below instructions).

1. Then, run the command `nslookup <host_fqdn>` (for example, `nslookup hn*.5h6lujo4xvoe1kprq3azvzmwsd.hx.internal.cloudapp.net`). If this command resolves the name to an IP address, it means your DNS server is working correctly. In this case, raise a support case with HDInsight, and we investigate your issue. In your support case, include the troubleshooting steps you executed. It helps to resolve the issue faster.

1. If the above command doesn't return an IP address, then run `nslookup <host_fqdn> 168.63.129.16` (for example, `nslookup hn*.5h6lujo4xvoe1kprq3azvzmwsd.hx.internal.cloudapp.net 168.63.129.16`). If this command is able to resolve the IP, it means that either your DNS server isn't forwarding the query to Azure's DNS, or it isn't a VM that is part of the same virtual network as the cluster.

1. If you don't have an Azure VM that can act as a custom DNS server in the cluster's virtual network, then you need to add this first. Create a VM in the virtual network, which is configured as DNS forwarder.

1. Once you have a VM deployed in your virtual network, configure the DNS forwarding rules on this VM. Forward all iDNS name resolution requests to 168.63.129.16, and the rest to your DNS server. [Here](../hdinsight-plan-virtual-network-deployment.md) is an example of this setup for a custom DNS server.

1. Add the IP Address of this VM as first DNS entry for the Virtual Network DNS configuration.

## "Failed to connect to Azure Storage Account"

### Issue

Error description contains "Failed to connect to Azure Storage Account" or "Failed to connect to Azure SQL."

### Cause

Azure Storage and SQL don't have fixed IP Addresses, so we need to allow outbound connections to all IPs to allow accessing these services. The exact resolution steps depend on whether you have set up a Network Security Group (NSG) or User-Defined Rules (UDR). Refer to the section on [controlling network traffic with HDInsight with network security groups and user-defined routes](../control-network-traffic.md) for details on these configurations.

### Resolution

* If your cluster uses a [Network Security Group (NSG)](../../virtual-network/virtual-network-vnet-plan-design-arm.md)

    Go to the Azure portal and identify the NSG that is associated with the subnet where the cluster is being deployed. In the **Outbound security rules** section, allow outbound access to internet without limitation (note that a smaller **priority** number here means higher priority). Also, in the **subnets** section, confirm if this NSG is applied to the cluster subnet.

* If your cluster uses a [User-defined Routes (UDR)](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview.md)

    Go to the Azure portal and identify the route table that is associated with the subnet where the cluster is being deployed. Once you find the route table for the subnet, inspect the **routes** section in it.

    If there are routes defined, make sure that there are routes for IP addresses for the region where the cluster was deployed, and the **NextHopType** for each route is **Internet**. There should be a route defined for each required IP Address documented in the aforementioned article.

## "Failed to establish an outbound connection from the cluster for the communication with the HDInsight resource provider. Ensure that outbound connectivity is allowed."

### Issue

Error description contains "Failed to establish an outbound connection from the cluster for the communication with the HDInsight resource provider. Ensure that outbound connectivity is allowed."

### Cause

When you use Private Linked HDInsight clusters, outbound access from the cluster must be configured to allow connections to be made to the HDInsight resource provider.

### Resolution

* To resolve this issue, refer to the HDInsight Private Link setup steps at [private link setup](../hdinsight-private-link.md)

## "Virtual network configuration isn't compatible with HDInsight requirement"

### Issue

Error descriptions contain messages similar as follows:

```
ErrorCode: InvalidNetworkConfigurationErrorCode
ErrorDescription: Virtual Network configuration is not compatible with HDInsight Requirement. Error: 'Failed to connect to Azure Storage Account; Failed to connect to Azure SQL; HostName Resolution failed', Please follow https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=853974 to fix it.
```

### Cause

Likely an issue with the custom DNS setup.

### Resolution

Validate that 168.63.129.16 is in the custom DNS chain. DNS servers within a virtual network can forward DNS queries to Azure's recursive resolvers to resolve hostnames within that virtual network. For more information, see [Name Resolution in Virtual Networks](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md#name-resolution-that-uses-your-own-dns-server). Access to Azure's recursive resolvers is provided via the virtual IP 168.63.129.16.

1. Use [ssh command](../hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md) to connect to your cluster. Edit the following command by replacing CLUSTERNAME with the name of your cluster, and then enter the command:

    ```cmd
    ssh sshuser@CLUSTERNAME-ssh.azurehdinsight.net
    ```

1. Execute the following command:

    ```bash
    cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver*
    ```

    You should see something like this:

    ```output
    nameserver 168.63.129.16
    nameserver 10.21.34.43
    nameserver 10.21.34.44
    ```

    Based on the result - choose one of the following steps to follow:

#### 168.63.129.16 isn't in this list

**Option 1**  
Add 168.63.129.16 as the first custom DNS for the virtual network using the steps described in [Plan a virtual network for Azure HDInsight](../hdinsight-plan-virtual-network-deployment.md). These steps are applicable only if your custom DNS server runs on Linux.

**Option 2**  
Deploy a DNS server VM for the virtual network. It involves the following steps:

* Create a VM in the virtual network, which is configured as DNS forwarder (it can be a Linux or windows VM).
* Configure DNS forwarding rules on this VM (forward all iDNS name resolution requests to 168.63.129.16, and the rest to your DNS server).
* Add the IP Address of this VM as first DNS entry for Virtual Network DNS configuration.

#### 168.63.129.16 is in the list

In this case, create a support case with HDInsight, and we investigate your issue. Include the result of the below commands in your support case. It helps to investigate and resolve the issue quickly.

From an ssh session on the head node, edit and then run the following command:

```bash
hostname -f
nslookup <headnode_fqdn> (e.g.nslookup hn*.5h6lujo4xvoe1kprq3azvzmwsd.hx.internal.cloudapp.net)
dig @168.63.129.16 <headnode_fqdn> (e.g. dig @168.63.129.16 hn*.5h6lujo4xvoe1kprq3azvzmwsd.hx.internal.cloudapp.net)
```
### Cause

Another cause for this `InvalidNetworkConfigurationErrorCode` error code could be the use of the deprecated parameter `EnableVmProtection` in PowerShell or an Azure Runbook.

### Resolution

Use the valid parameters for `Get-AzVirtualNetwork` as documented in the [Az PowerShell SDK](/powershell/module/az.network/get-azvirtualnetwork)
