# Manage disk space in Azure HDInsight

This article describes troubleshooting steps and possible resolutions for issues when interacting with Azure HDInsight clusters.

## Hive log configurations

1. From a web browser, navigate to `https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net`, where `CLUSTERNAME` is the name of your cluster.

1. Navigate to **Hive** > **Configs** > **Advanced** > **Advanced hive-log4j**. Review the following settings:

    * `hive.root.logger=DEBUG,RFA`. This is the default value, modify the log level to `INFO` to print fewer logs entries.

    * `log4jhive.log.maxfilesize=1024MB`. This is the default value, modify as desired.

    * `log4jhive.log.maxbackupindex=10`. This is the default value, modify as desired. If the parameter has been omitted, the generated log files will be endless.

## Yarn log configurations

Review the following configurations:

* Apache Ambari

    1. From a web browser, navigate to `https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net`, where `CLUSTERNAME` is the name of your cluster.

    1. Navigate to **Hive** > **Configs** > **Advanced** > **Resource Manager**. Ensure **Enable Log Aggregation** is checked. If disabled, name nodes will keep the logs locally and not aggregate them in remote store on application completion or termination.

* Ensure that the cluster size is appropriate for the workload. The workload might have changed recently or the cluster might have been resized. [Scale up](../hdinsight-scaling-best-practices.md) the cluster to match a higher workload.

* `/mnt/resource` might be filled with orphaned files (as if Resource Manager restart). If necessary, manually clean `/mnt/resource/hadoop/yarn/log` and `/mnt/resource/hadoop/yarn/local`.
