# Unable to access Data Lake storage files in Azure HDInsight

This article describes troubleshooting steps and possible resolutions for issues when interacting with Azure HDInsight clusters.

## Issue: ACL verification failed

You receive an error message similar to:

```
LISTSTATUS failed with error 0x83090aa2 (Forbidden. ACL verification failed. Either the resource does not exist or the user is not authorized to perform the requested operation.).
```

### Cause

The user might have revoked permissions of service principal(SP) on files/folders.

### Resolution

1. Check that the SP has 'x' permissions to traverse along the path. For more information, see [Permissions](https://hdinsight.github.io/ClusterCRUD/ADLS/adls-create-permission-setup.html). Sample dfs command to check access to files/folders in Data Lake storage account:

    ```
    hdfs dfs -ls /<path to check access>
    ```

1. Set up required permissions to access the path based on the read/write operation being performed. See here for permissions required for various file system operations.

## Issue: Service principal certificate expiry

You receive an error message similar to:

```
Token Refresh failed - Received invalid http response: 500
```

### Cause

The certificate provided for Service principal access might have expired.

1. SSH into headnode. Check access to storage account using following dfs command:

    ```
    hdfs dfs -ls /
    ```

1. Confirm that the error message is similar to the following:

    ```
    {"stderr": "-ls: Token Refresh failed - Received invalid http response: 500, text = Response{protocol=http/1.1, code=500, message=Internal Server Error, url=http://gw0-abccluster.24ajrd4341lebfgq5unsrzq0ue.fx.internal.cloudapp.net:909/api/oauthtoken}}...
    ```

1. Get one of the urls from `core-site.xml property` - `fs.azure.datalake.token.provider.service.urls`.

1. Run the following curl command to retrieve OAuth token.

    ```
    curl gw0-abccluster.24ajrd4341lebfgq5unsrzq0ue.fx.internal.cloudapp.net:909/api/oauthtoken
    ```

1. The output for a valid service principal should be something like:

    ```
    {"AccessToken":"MIIGHQYJKoZIhvcNAQcDoIIGDjCCBgoCAQA…….","ExpiresOn":1500447750098}
    ```

1. If the service principal certificate has expired, the output will look something like this:

    ```
    Exception in OAuthTokenController.GetOAuthToken: 'System.InvalidOperationException: Error while getting the OAuth token from AAD for AppPrincipalId 23abe517-2ffd-4124-aa2d-7c224672cae2, ResourceUri https://management.core.windows.net/, AADTenantId https://login.windows.net/80abc8bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47, ClientCertificateThumbprint C49C25705D60569884EDC91986CEF8A01A495783 ---> Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory.AdalServiceException: AADSTS70002: Error validating credentials.

    Correlation ID: a44d870e-6f23-405a-8b23-9b44aebfa4bb

    at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory.HttpWebRequestWrapper.<GetResponseSyncOrAsync>d__2.MoveNext()
    ```

1. Any other Azure Active Directory related errors/certificate related errors can be recognized by pinging the gateway url to get the OAuth token.

1. If you are getting following error when attempting to access ADLS from the HDI Cluster. Check if the Certificate has Expired by following the steps mentioned above.

    ```
    Error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Token Refresh failed - Received invalid http response: 500, text = Response{protocol=http/1.1, code=500, message=Internal Server Error, url=http://clustername.hmssomerandomstringc.cx.internal.cloudapp.net:909/api/oauthtoken}
    ```

### Resolution

Create a new Certificate or assign existing Certificate using the following PowerShell script:

```powershell
$clusterName = 'CLUSTERNAME'
$resourceGroupName = 'RGNAME'
$subscriptionId = 'SUBSCRIPTIONID'
$appId = 'APPLICATIONID'
$generateSelfSignedCert = $false
$addNewCertKeyCredential = $true
$certFilePath = 'NEW_CERT_PFX_LOCAL_PATH'
$certPassword = Read-Host "Enter Certificate Password"

if($generateSelfSignedCert)
{
    Write-Host "Generating new SelfSigned certificate"
    
    $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -CertStoreLocation "cert:\CurrentUser\My" -Subject "CN=hdinsightAdlsCert" -KeySpec KeyExchange
    $certBytes = $cert.Export([System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509ContentType]::Pkcs12, $certPassword);
    $certString = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($certBytes)
}
else
{

    Write-Host "Reading the cert file from path $certFilePath"

    $cert = new-object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2($certFilePath, $certPassword)
    $certString = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($certFilePath))
}


Login-AzureRmAccount

if($addNewCertKeyCredential)
{
    Write-Host "Creating new KeyCredential for the app"

    $keyValue = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($cert.GetRawCertData())
    
    New-AzureRmADAppCredential -ApplicationId $appId -CertValue $keyValue -EndDate $cert.NotAfter -StartDate $cert.NotBefore

    Write-Host "Waiting for 30 seconds for the permissions to get propagated"

    Start-Sleep -s 30
}

Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId $subscriptionId

Write-Host "Updating the certificate on HDInsight cluster."

Invoke-AzureRmResourceAction `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -ResourceType 'Microsoft.HDInsight/clusters' `
    -ResourceName $clusterName `
    -ApiVersion '2015-03-01-preview' `
    -Action 'updateclusteridentitycertificate' `
    -Parameters @{ ApplicationId = $appId.ToString(); Certificate = $certString; CertificatePassword = $certPassword.ToString() } `
    -Force

```

For assigning existing certificate, create a certificate, have the .pfx file and password ready. Associate the certificate with the service principal that the cluster was created with and have the AppId ready.

Execute the PowerShell command after you substitute the parameters with the actual values.
