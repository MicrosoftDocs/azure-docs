# Run MapReduce jobs with Apache Hadoop on HDInsight using PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [mapreduce-selector](../includes/hdinsight-selector-use-mapreduce.md)]

This document provides an example of using Azure PowerShell to run a MapReduce job in a Hadoop on HDInsight cluster.

## Prerequisites

* An Apache Hadoop cluster on HDInsight. See [Create Apache Hadoop clusters using the Azure portal](../hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-portal.md).

* The PowerShell [Az Module](/powershell/azure/) installed.

## Run a MapReduce job

Azure PowerShell provides *cmdlets* that allow you to remotely run MapReduce jobs on HDInsight. Internally, PowerShell makes REST calls to [WebHCat](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat) (formerly called Templeton) running on the HDInsight cluster.

The following cmdlets used when running MapReduce jobs in a remote HDInsight cluster.

|Cmdlet | Description |
|---|---|
|Connect-AzAccount|Authenticates Azure PowerShell to your Azure subscription.|
|New-AzHDInsightMapReduceJobDefinition|Creates a new *job definition* by using the specified MapReduce information.|
|Start-AzHDInsightJob|Sends the job definition to HDInsight and starts the job. A *job* object is returned.|
|Wait-AzHDInsightJob|Uses the job object to check the status of the job. It waits until the job completes or the wait time is exceeded.|
|Get-AzHDInsightJobOutput|Used to retrieve the output of the job.|

The following steps demonstrate how to use these cmdlets to run a job in your HDInsight cluster.

1. Using an editor, save the following code as **mapreducejob.ps1**.

    [!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/hdinsight/use-mapreduce/use-mapreduce.ps1?range=5-69)]

2. Open a new **Azure PowerShell** command prompt. Change directories to the location of the **mapreducejob.ps1** file, then use the following command to run the script:

    ```azurepowershell
    .\mapreducejob.ps1
    ```

    When you run the script, you're prompted for the name of the HDInsight cluster and the cluster login. You may also be prompted to authenticate to your Azure subscription.

3. When the job completes, you receive output similar to the following text:

    ```output
    Cluster         : CLUSTERNAME
    ExitCode        : 0
    Name            : wordcount
    PercentComplete : map 100% reduce 100%
    Query           :
    State           : Completed
    StatusDirectory : f1ed2028-afe8-402f-a24b-13cc17858097
    SubmissionTime  : 12/5/2014 8:34:09 PM
    JobId           : job_1415949758166_0071
    ```

    This output indicates that the job completed successfully.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the **ExitCode** is a value other than 0, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

    This example also stores the downloaded files to an **output.txt** file in the directory that you run the script from.

### View output

To see the words and counts produced by the job, open the **output.txt** file in a text editor.

> [!NOTE]  
> The output files of a MapReduce job are immutable. So if you rerun this sample, you need to change the name of the output file.

## Troubleshooting

If no information is returned when the job completes, view errors for the job. To view error information for this job, add the following command to the end of the **mapreducejob.ps1** file. Then save the file and rerun the script.

```powershell
# Print the output of the WordCount job.
Write-Host "Display the standard output ..." -ForegroundColor Green
Get-AzHDInsightJobOutput `
        -Clustername $clusterName `
        -JobId $wordCountJob.JobId `
        -HttpCredential $creds `
        -DisplayOutputType StandardError
```

This cmdlet returns the information that was written to STDERR as the job runs.

## Next steps

As you can see, Azure PowerShell provides an easy way to run MapReduce jobs on an HDInsight cluster, monitor the job status, and retrieve the output. For information about other ways you can work with Hadoop on HDInsight:
