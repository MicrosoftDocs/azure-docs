# Quickstart: Create Apache Hadoop cluster in Azure HDInsight using Azure portal

In this article, you learn how to create Apache Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using Azure portal, and then run Apache Hive jobs in HDInsight. Most of Hadoop jobs are batch jobs. You create a cluster, run some jobs, and then delete the cluster. In this article, you perform all the three tasks. For in-depth explanations of available configurations, see [Set up clusters in HDInsight](../hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters.md). For more information regarding the use of the portal to create clusters, see [Create clusters in the portal](../hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-portal.md).

In this quickstart, you use the Azure portal to create an HDInsight Hadoop cluster. You can also create a cluster using the [Azure Resource Manager template](apache-hadoop-linux-tutorial-get-started.md).

Currently, HDInsight comes with [seven different cluster types](../hdinsight-overview.md#cluster-types-in-hdinsight). Each cluster type supports a different set of components. All cluster types support Hive. For a list of supported components in HDInsight, see [What's new in the Apache Hadoop cluster versions provided by HDInsight?](../hdinsight-component-versioning.md)  

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Create an Apache Hadoop cluster

In this section, you create a Hadoop cluster in HDInsight using the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. From the top menu, select **+ Create a resource**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-hadoop-linux-create-cluster-get-started-portal/azure-portal-create-resource.png" alt-text="Create a resource HDInsight cluster." border="true":::

1. Select **Analytics** > **Azure HDInsight** to go to the **Create HDInsight cluster** page.

1. From the **Basics** tab, provide the following information:

   |Property  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Subscription    |  From the drop-down list, select the Azure subscription that's used for the cluster. |
   |Resource group     | From the drop-down list, select your existing resource group, or select **Create new**.|
   |Cluster name   | Enter a globally unique name. The name can consist of up to 59 characters including letters, numbers, and hyphens. The first and last characters of the name can't be hyphens. |
   |Region    | From the drop-down list, select a region where the cluster is created.  Choose a location closer to you for better performance. |
   |Cluster type| Select **Select cluster type**. Then select **Hadoop** as the cluster type.|
   |Version|From the drop-down list, select a **version**. Use the default version if you don't know what to choose.|
   |Cluster sign in username and password    | The default sign in name is **admin**. The password must be at least 10 characters in length and must contain at least one digit, one uppercase, and one lower case letter, one nonalphanumeric character (except characters ```' ` "```). Make sure you **do not provide** common passwords such as "Pass@word1".|
   |Secure Shell (SSH) username | The default username is `sshuser`.  You can provide another name for the SSH username. |
   |Use cluster sign in password for SSH| Select this check box to use the same password for SSH user as the one you provided for the cluster sign in user.|

   :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-hadoop-linux-create-cluster-get-started-portal/azure-portal-cluster-basics.png" alt-text="HDInsight Linux get started provide cluster basic values." border="true":::

   Select the **Next: Storage >>** to advance to the storage settings.

1. From the **Storage** tab, provide the following values:

   |Property  |Description  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Primary storage type|Use the default value **Azure Storage**.|
   |Selection method|Use the default value **Select from list**.|
   |Primary storage account|Use the drop-down list to select an existing storage account, or select **Create new**. If you create a new account, the name must be between 3 and 24 characters in length, and can include numbers and lowercase letters only|
   |Container|Use the autopopulated value.|

   :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-hadoop-linux-create-cluster-get-started-portal/azure-portal-cluster-storage.png" alt-text="HDInsight Linux get started provide cluster storage values." border="true":::

   Each cluster has an [Azure Storage account](../hdinsight-hadoop-use-blob-storage.md), or an [`Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2`](../hdinsight-hadoop-use-data-lake-storage-gen2.md) dependency. It's referred as the default storage account. HDInsight cluster and its default storage account must be colocated in the same Azure region. Deleting clusters doesn't delete the storage account.

   Select the **Review + create** tab.

1. From the **Review + create** tab, verify the values you selected in the earlier steps.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-hadoop-linux-create-cluster-get-started-portal/azure-portal-cluster-review-create-hadoop.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing HDInsight Linux get started cluster summary." border="true":::

1. Select **Create**. It takes about 20 minutes to create a cluster.

   Once the cluster is created, you see the cluster overview page in the Azure portal.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-hadoop-linux-create-cluster-get-started-portal/cluster-settings-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing HDInsight Linux get started cluster settings." border="true.":::

## Run Apache Hive queries

[Apache Hive](hdinsight-use-hive.md) is the most popular component used in HDInsight. There are many ways to run Hive jobs in HDInsight. In this quickstart, you use the Ambari Hive view from the portal. For other methods for submitting Hive jobs, see [Use Hive in HDInsight](hdinsight-use-hive.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Apache Hive View is not available in HDInsight 4.0.

1. To open Ambari, from the previous screenshot, select **Cluster Dashboard**.  You can also browse to  `https://ClusterName.azurehdinsight.net` where `ClusterName` is the cluster you created in the previous section.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-hadoop-linux-create-cluster-get-started-portal/hdinsight-linux-get-started-open-cluster-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing HDInsight Linux get started cluster dashboard." border="true":::

2. Enter the Hadoop username and password that you specified while creating the cluster. The default username is `admin`.

3. Open **Hive View** as shown in the following screenshot:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-hadoop-linux-create-cluster-get-started-portal/hdi-select-hive-view.png" alt-text="Selecting Hive View from Ambari." border="true":::

4. In the **QUERY** tab, paste the following HiveQL statements into the worksheet:

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```

    :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-hadoop-linux-create-cluster-get-started-portal/hdi-apache-hive-view1.png" alt-text="HDInsight Hive View Query Editor." border="true":::

5. Select **Execute**. A **RESULTS** tab appears beneath the **QUERY** tab and displays information about the job.

   Once the query has finished, the **QUERY** tab displays the results of the operation. You shall see one table called **hivesampletable**. This sample Hive table comes with all the HDInsight clusters.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-hadoop-linux-create-cluster-get-started-portal/hdinsight-hive-views.png" alt-text="HDInsight Apache Hive view results." border="true":::

6. Repeat step 4 and step 5 to run the following query:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM hivesampletable;
   ```

7. You can also save the results of the query. Select the menu button on the right, and specify whether you want to download the results as a CSV file or store it to the storage account associated with the cluster.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-hadoop-linux-create-cluster-get-started-portal/hdinsight-linux-hive-view-save-results.png" alt-text="Save result of Apache Hive query." border="true":::

After you've completed a Hive job, you can [export the results to Azure SQL Database or SQL Server database](apache-hadoop-use-sqoop-mac-linux.md), you can also [visualize the results using Excel](apache-hadoop-connect-excel-power-query.md). For more information about using Hive in HDInsight, see [Use Apache Hive and HiveQL with Apache Hadoop in HDInsight to analyze a sample Apache Log4j file](hdinsight-use-hive.md).

## Clean up resources

After you complete the quickstart, you may want to delete the cluster. With HDInsight, your data is stored in Azure Storage, so you can safely delete a cluster when it isn't in use. You're also charged for an HDInsight cluster, even when it isn't in use. Since the charges for the cluster are many times more than the charges for storage, it makes economic sense to delete clusters when they aren't in use.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are *immediately* proceeding to the next article to learn how to run ETL operations using Hadoop on HDInsight, you may want to keep the cluster running. This is because in the tutorial you have to create a Hadoop cluster again. However, if you are not going through the next article right away, you must delete the cluster now.

### To delete the cluster and/or the default storage account

1. Go back to the browser tab where you have the Azure portal. You shall be on the cluster overview page. If you only want to delete the cluster but retain the default storage account, select **Delete**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-hadoop-linux-create-cluster-get-started-portal/hdinsight-delete-cluster.png" alt-text="Azure HDInsight delete cluster." border="true":::

2. If you want to delete the cluster and the default storage account, select the resource group name (highlighted in the previous screenshot) to open the resource group page.

3. Select **Delete resource group** to delete the resource group, which contains the cluster and the default storage account. Note deleting the resource group deletes the storage account. If you want to keep the storage account, choose to delete the cluster only.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you learned how to create a Linux-based HDInsight cluster using a Resource Manager template, and how to perform basic Hive queries. In the next article, you learn how to perform an extract, transform, and load (ETL) operation using Hadoop on HDInsight.
