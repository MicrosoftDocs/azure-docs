# Tutorial: Configure Apache Ambari email notifications in Azure HDInsight

In this tutorial, you configure Apache Ambari email notifications by using SendGrid as an example. [Apache Ambari](./hdinsight-hadoop-manage-ambari.md) simplifies the management and monitoring of an Azure HDInsight cluster by providing an easy-to-use web UI and REST API. Ambari is included on HDInsight clusters and is used to monitor the cluster and make configuration changes. [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/solutions/) is a free cloud-based email service that provides reliable transactional email delivery, scalability, and real-time analytics along with flexible APIs that make custom integration easy. Azure customers can unlock 25,000 free emails each month.

> [!NOTE]
> SendGrid isn't mandatory to configure Ambari email notifications. You can also use other third-party email apps, like Outlook and Gmail.
