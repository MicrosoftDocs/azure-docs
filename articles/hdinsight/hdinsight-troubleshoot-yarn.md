# Troubleshoot Apache Hadoop YARN by using Azure HDInsight

Learn about the top issues and their resolutions when working with Apache Hadoop YARN payloads in Apache Ambari.

## How do I create a new YARN queue on a cluster?

### Resolution steps

Use the following steps in Ambari to create a new YARN queue, and then balance the capacity allocation among all the queues.

In this example, two existing queues (**default** and **thriftsvr**) both are changed from 50% capacity to 25% capacity, which gives the new queue (spark) 50% capacity.

| Queue | Capacity | Maximum capacity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| default | 25% | 50% |
| thrftsvr | 25% | 50% |
| spark | 50% | 50% |

1. Select the **Ambari Views** icon, and then select the grid pattern. Next, select **YARN Queue Manager**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/hdinsight-troubleshoot-yarn/apache-yarn-create-queue-1.png" alt-text="Apache Ambari dashboard YARN Queue Manager." border="false":::
2. Select the **default** queue.

    :::image type="content" source="media/hdinsight-troubleshoot-yarn/apache-yarn-create-queue-2.png" alt-text="Apache Ambari YARN select default queue." border="false":::
3. For the **default** queue, change the **capacity** from 50% to 25%. For the **thriftsvr** queue, change the **capacity** to 25%.

    :::image type="content" source="media/hdinsight-troubleshoot-yarn/apache-yarn-create-queue-3.png" alt-text="Change the capacity to 25% for the default and thriftsvr queues." border="false":::
4. To create a new queue, select **Add Queue**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/hdinsight-troubleshoot-yarn/apache-yarn-create-queue-4.png" alt-text="Apache Ambari YARN dashboard Add Queue." border="false":::

5. Name the new queue.

    :::image type="content" source="media/hdinsight-troubleshoot-yarn/apache-yarn-create-queue-5.png" alt-text="Apache Ambari YARN dashboard name Queue." border="false":::  

6. Leave the **capacity** values at 50%, and then select the **Actions** button.

    :::image type="content" source="media/hdinsight-troubleshoot-yarn/apache-yarn-create-queue-6.png" alt-text="Apache Ambari YARN select action." border="false":::  
7. Select **Save and Refresh Queues**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/hdinsight-troubleshoot-yarn/apache-yarn-create-queue-7.png" alt-text="Select Save and Refresh Queues." border="false":::  

These changes are visible immediately on the YARN Scheduler UI.

## How do I download YARN logs from a cluster?

### Resolution steps

1. Connect to the HDInsight cluster by using a Secure Shell (SSH) client. For more information, see [Further reading](#additional-reading-2).

1. To list all the application IDs of the YARN applications that are currently running, run the following command:

    ```apache
    yarn top
    ```

    The IDs are listed in the **APPLICATIONID** column. You can download logs from the **APPLICATIONID** column.

    ```apache
    YARN top - 18:00:07, up 19d, 0:14, 0 active users, queue(s): root
    NodeManager(s): 4 total, 4 active, 0 unhealthy, 0 decommissioned, 0 lost, 0 rebooted
    Queue(s) Applications: 2 running, 10 submitted, 0 pending, 8 completed, 0 killed, 0 failed
    Queue(s) Mem(GB): 97 available, 3 allocated, 0 pending, 0 reserved
    Queue(s) VCores: 58 available, 2 allocated, 0 pending, 0 reserved
    Queue(s) Containers: 2 allocated, 0 pending, 0 reserved

                      APPLICATIONID USER             TYPE      QUEUE   #CONT  #RCONT  VCORES RVCORES     MEM    RMEM  VCORESECS    MEMSECS %PROGR       TIME NAME
     application_1490377567345_0007 hive            spark  thriftsvr       1       0       1       0      1G      0G    1628407    2442611  10.00   18:20:20 Thrift JDBC/ODBC Server
     application_1490377567345_0006 hive            spark  thriftsvr       1       0       1       0      1G      0G    1628430    2442645  10.00   18:20:20 Thrift JDBC/ODBC Server
    ```

1. To download YARN container logs for all application masters, use the following command:

    ```apache
    yarn logs -applicationIdn logs -applicationId <application_id> -am ALL > amlogs.txt
    ```

    This command creates a log file named amlogs.txt.

1. To download YARN container logs for only the latest application master, use the following command:

    ```apache
    yarn logs -applicationIdn logs -applicationId <application_id> -am -1 > latestamlogs.txt
    ```

    This command creates a log file named latestamlogs.txt.

1. To download YARN container logs for the first two application masters, use the following command:

    ```apache
    yarn logs -applicationIdn logs -applicationId <application_id> -am 1,2 > first2amlogs.txt
    ```

    This command creates a log file named first2amlogs.txt.

1. To download all YARN container logs, use the following command:

    ```apache
    yarn logs -applicationIdn logs -applicationId <application_id> > logs.txt
    ```

    This command creates a log file named logs.txt.

1. To download the YARN container log for a specific container, use the following command:

    ```apache
    yarn logs -applicationIdn logs -applicationId <application_id> -containerId <container_id> > containerlogs.txt
    ```

    This command creates a log file named containerlogs.txt.

## How do I check Yarn Application Diagnostics Information?

Diagnostics in Yarn UI is a feature that allows you to view the status and logs of your applications running on Yarn. Diagnostics can help you troubleshoot and debug your applications, as well as monitor their performance and resource usage.

To view the diagnostics of a specific application, you can click on the application ID in the applications list. On the application details page, you can also see a list of all the attempts that have been made to run the application. You can click on any attempt to see more details, such as the attempt ID, container ID, node ID, start time, finish time, and diagnostics

## How do I troubleshoot YARN common issues?

### Yarn UI isn't loading

If your YARN UI isn't loading or is unreachable, and it returns "HTTP Error 502.3 - Bad Gateway," it highly indicates your Resource Manager service is unhealthy. To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Ambari UI** > **YARN** > **SUMMARY** and check to see if only the active Resource Manager is in the **Started** state. If not, try to mitigate by restarting the unhealthy or stopped Resource Manager.
2. If step 1 doesn't resolve the issue, SSH the active Resource Manager head node and check the garbage collection status using `jstat -gcutil <Resource Manager pid> 1000 100`. If you see the **FGCT** increase significantly in just a few seconds, it indicates Resource Manager is busy in *Full GC*, and is unable to process the other requests.
3. Go to **Ambari UI** > **YARN** > **CONFIGS** > **Advanced** and increase `Resource Manager java heap size`.
4. Restart required services in Ambari UI.

### Both resource managers are in standby

1. Check Resource Manager log to see if similar error exists. 
```
Service RMActiveServices failed in state STARTED; cause: org.apache.hadoop.service.ServiceStateException: com.google.protobuf.InvalidProtocolBufferException: Could not obtain block: BP-452067264-10.0.0.16-1608006815288:blk_1074235266_494491 file=/yarn/node-labels/nodelabel.mirror
```
2. If the error exists, check to see if some files are under replication or if there are missing blocks in the HDFS. You can run `hdfs fsck hdfs://mycluster/`

3. Run `hdfs fsck hdfs://mycluster/ -delete` too forcefully cleanup the HDFS and to get rid of the standby RM issue. Alternatively, run [PatchYarnNodeLabel](https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/hadoopcorepatchingscripts/PatchYarnNodeLabel.sh) on one of headnodes to patch the cluster.
