# Scenario: Apache Tez application hangs in Azure HDInsight

This article describes troubleshooting steps and possible resolutions for issues when interacting with Azure HDInsight clusters.

## Issue

After you submit Apache Hive job, from Tez view the job status is **Running**, but doesn't appear to make any progress.

## Cause

Too many jobs submitted; long Yarn queue.

## Resolution

Scale up the cluster, or just wait till the Yarn queue is drained.

By default `yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-applications` controls the maximum number of applications that are running or pending, and it defaults to `10000`.
