# Scenario: Apache Hive fails to establish a connection to Apache Zookeeper in Azure HDInsight

This article describes troubleshooting steps and possible resolutions for issues when using Interactive Query components in Azure HDInsight clusters.

## Issue

The Hive View is inaccessible, and the logs in `/var/log/hive` show an error similar to the following:

```
ERROR [Curator-Framework-0]: curator.ConnectionState (ConnectionState.java:checkTimeouts(200)) - Connection timed out for connection string (<zookeepername1>.contoso.com:2181,<zookeepername2>.contoso.com:2181,<zookeepername3>.contoso.com:2181) and timeout (15000) / elapsed (21852)
```

## Cause

It is possible that Hive may fail to establish a connection to Zookeeper, which prevents the Hive View from launching.

## Resolution

1. Check that the Zookeeper service is healthy.

1. Check if the Zookeeper service has a ZNode entry for Hive Server2. The value will be missing or incorrect.

    ```
    /usr/hdp/2.6.2.25-1/zookeeper/bin/zkCli.sh -server <zookeepername1>
    [zk: <zookeepername1>(CONNECTED) 0] ls /hiveserver2-hive2
    ```

1. To re-establish connectivity, reboot the Zookeeper nodes, and reboot HiveServer2.
