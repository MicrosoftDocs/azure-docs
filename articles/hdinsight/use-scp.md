# Use SCP with Apache Hadoop in Azure HDInsight

This article provides information on securely transferring files with your HDInsight cluster.

## Copy files

The `scp` utility can be used to copy files to and from individual nodes in the cluster. For example, the following command copies the `test.txt` directory from the local system to the primary head node:

```bash
scp test.txt sshuser@clustername-ssh.azurehdinsight.net:
```

Since no path is specified after the `:`, the file is placed in the `sshuser` home directory.

The following example copies the `test.txt` file from the `sshuser` home directory on the primary head node to the local system:

```bash
scp sshuser@clustername-ssh.azurehdinsight.net:test.txt .
```

`scp` can only access the file system of individual nodes within the cluster. It can't be used to access data in the HDFS-compatible storage for the cluster.

Use `scp` when you need to upload a resource for use from an SSH session. For example, upload a Python script and then run the script from an SSH session.

For information on directly loading data into the HDFS-compatible storage, see the following documents:

* [HDInsight using Azure Storage](hdinsight-hadoop-use-blob-storage.md).
