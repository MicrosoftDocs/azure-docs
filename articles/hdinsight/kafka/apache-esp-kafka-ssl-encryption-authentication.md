# Set up TLS encryption and authentication for ESP Apache Kafka cluster in Azure HDInsight

This article shows you how to set up Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, previously known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, between Apache Kafka clients and Apache Kafka brokers. It also shows you how to set up authentication of clients (sometimes referred to as two-way TLS).

> [!Important]
> There are two clients which you can use for Kafka applications: a Java client and a console client. Only the Java client `ProducerConsumer.java` can use TLS for both producing and consuming. The console producer client `console-producer.sh` does not work with TLS.

## Apache Kafka broker setup

The Kafka TLS broker setup uses four HDInsight cluster VMs in the following way:

* headnode 0 - Certificate Authority (CA)
* worker node 0, 1, and 2 - brokers

> [!Note] 
> This guide uses self-signed certificates, but the most secure solution is to use certificates issued by trusted CAs.

The summary of the broker setup process is as follows:

1. The following steps are repeated on each of the three worker nodes:
    1. Generate a certificate.
    1. Create a cert signing request.
    1. Send the cert signing request to the Certificate Authority (CA).
    1. Sign in to the CA and sign the request.
    1. SCP the signed certificate back to the worker node.
    1. SCP the public certificate of the CA to the worker node.

1. Once you have all of the certificates, put the certs into the cert store.
1. Go to Ambari and change the configurations.

    Use the following detailed instructions to complete the broker setup:

    > [!Important]
    > In the following code snippets wnX is an abbreviation for one of the three worker nodes and should be substituted with `wn0`, `wn1` or `wn2` as appropriate. `WorkerNode0_Name` and `HeadNode0_Name` should be substituted with the names of the respective machines.

1. Perform initial setup on head node 0, which for HDInsight fills the role of the Certificate Authority (CA).

    ```bash
    # Create a new directory 'ssl' and change into it
    mkdir ssl
    cd ssl
    ```

1. Perform the same initial setup on each of the brokers (worker nodes 0, 1 and 2).

    ```bash
    # Create a new directory 'ssl' and change into it
    mkdir ssl
    cd ssl
    ```

1. On each of the worker nodes, execute the following steps using the code snippet.
    1. Create a keystore and populate it with a new private certificate.
    1. Create a certificate signing request.
    1. SCP the certificate signing request to the CA (headnode0)

    ```bash
    keytool -genkey -keystore kafka.server.keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -validity 365 -storepass "MyServerPassword123" -keypass "MyServerPassword123" -dname "CN=FQDN_WORKER_NODE" -ext SAN=DNS:FQDN_WORKER_NODE -storetype pkcs12
    keytool -keystore kafka.server.keystore.jks -certreq -file cert-file -storepass "MyServerPassword123" -keypass "MyServerPassword123"
    scp cert-file sshuser@HeadNode0_Name:~/ssl/wnX-cert-sign-request
    ```
    > [!Note]
    > FQDN_WORKER_NODE is Fully Qualified Domain Name of worker node machine.You can get that details from /etc/hosts file in head node
 
    For example, 
    ```
    wn0-espkaf.securehadooprc.onmicrosoft.com
    wn0-kafka2.zbxwnwsmpcsuvbjqbmespcm1zg.bx.internal.cloudapp.net
    ```
    :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-esp-kafka-ssl-encryption-authentication/etc-hosts.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing host file  output." border="true":::
 
1. On the CA machine, run the following command to create ca-cert and ca-key files:

    ```bash
    openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -x509 -subj "/CN=Kafka-Security-CA" -keyout ca-key -out ca-cert -nodes
    ```

1. Change to the CA machine and sign all of the received cert signing requests:

    ```bash
    openssl x509 -req -CA ca-cert -CAkey ca-key -in wn0-cert-sign-request -out wn0-cert-signed -days 365 -CAcreateserial -passin pass:"MyServerPassword123"
    openssl x509 -req -CA ca-cert -CAkey ca-key -in wn1-cert-sign-request -out wn1-cert-signed -days 365 -CAcreateserial -passin pass:"MyServerPassword123"
    openssl x509 -req -CA ca-cert -CAkey ca-key -in wn2-cert-sign-request -out wn2-cert-signed -days 365 -CAcreateserial -passin pass:"MyServerPassword123"
    ```

1. Send the signed certificates back to the worker nodes from the CA (headnode0).

    ```bash
    scp wn0-cert-signed sshuser@WorkerNode0_Name:~/ssl/cert-signed
    scp wn1-cert-signed sshuser@WorkerNode1_Name:~/ssl/cert-signed
    scp wn2-cert-signed sshuser@WorkerNode2_Name:~/ssl/cert-signed
    ```

1. Send the public certificate of the CA to each worker node.

    ```bash
    scp ca-cert sshuser@WorkerNode0_Name:~/ssl/ca-cert
    scp ca-cert sshuser@WorkerNode1_Name:~/ssl/ca-cert
    scp ca-cert sshuser@WorkerNode2_Name:~/ssl/ca-cert
    ```

1. On each worker node, add the CAs public certificate to the truststore and keystore. Then add the worker node's own signed certificate to the keystore

    ```bash
    keytool -keystore kafka.server.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert -storepass "MyServerPassword123" -keypass "MyServerPassword123" -noprompt
    keytool -keystore kafka.server.keystore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert -storepass "MyServerPassword123" -keypass "MyServerPassword123" -noprompt
    keytool -keystore kafka.server.keystore.jks -import -file cert-signed -storepass "MyServerPassword123" -keypass "MyServerPassword123" -noprompt

    ```

## Update Kafka configuration to use TLS and restart brokers

You have now set up each Kafka broker with a keystore and truststore, and imported the correct certificates. Next, modify related Kafka configuration properties using Ambari and then restart the Kafka brokers.

To complete the configuration modification, do the following steps:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal and select your Azure HDInsight Apache Kafka cluster.
1. Go to the Ambari UI by clicking **Ambari home** under **Cluster dashboards**.
1. Under **Kafka Broker** set the **listeners** property to `PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092,SASL_SSL://localhost:9093`
1. Under **Advanced kafka-broker** set the **security.inter.broker.protocol** property to `SASL_SSL`

    :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-esp-kafka-ssl-encryption-authentication/properties-file-with-sasl.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to edit  Kafka configuration properties in Ambari." border="true":::

1. Under **Custom kafka-broker** set the **ssl.client.auth** property to `required`. 

   
   > [!Note] 
   > This step is only required if you're setting up authentication and encryption.
   
    :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-esp-kafka-ssl-encryption-authentication/editing-configuration-ambari2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to edit Kafka ssl configuration properties in Ambari." border="true":::

1. Here's the screenshot that shows Ambari configuration UI with these changes.
     
   > [!Note] 
   > 1. ssl.keystore.location and ssl.truststore.location is the complete path of your keystore, truststore location in Certificate Authority (hn0)
   > 1. ssl.keystore.password and ssl.truststore.password is the password set for the keystore and truststore. In this case as an example,`  MyServerPassword123`
   > 1. ssl.key.password is the key set for the keystore and trust store. In this case as an example, `MyServerPassword123`

1. To Use TLS 1.3 in Kafka, add following configs to the Kafka configs in Ambari. 
   1. `ssl.enabled.protocols=TLSv1.3` 
   1. `ssl.protocol=TLSv1.3`

   > [!Important]
   > 1. TLS 1.3 works with HDI 5.1 kafka version only.
   > 1. If you use TLS 1.3 at server side, you should use TLS 1.3 configs at client too.
    
1. For HDI version 4.0 or 5.0
   1. If you're setting up authentication and encryption, then the screenshot looks like

       :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-esp-kafka-ssl-encryption-authentication/properties-file-authentication-as-required.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to edit Kafka-env template property in Ambari authentication as required." border="true":::

   1. If you are setting up encryption only, then the screenshot looks like  
   
       :::image type="content" source="./media/apache-esp-kafka-ssl-encryption-authentication/properties-file-authentication-as-none.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to edit Kafka-env template property in Ambari authentication as none." border="true":::

1. Restart all Kafka brokers.

## Client setup (without authentication)

If you don't need authentication, the summary of the steps to set up only TLS encryption are:

1. Sign in to the CA (active head node).
1. Copy the CA cert to client machine from the CA machine (wn0).
1. Sign in to the client machine (hn1) and navigate to the `~/ssl` folder.
1. Import the CA cert to the truststore.
1. Import the CA cert to the keystore.

These steps are detailed in the following code snippets.

1. Sign in to the CA node.

    ```bash
    ssh sshuser@HeadNode0_Name
    cd ssl
    ```

1. Copy the ca-cert to the client machine

    ```bash
    scp ca-cert sshuser@HeadNode1_Name:~/ssl/ca-cert
    ```

1. Sign in to the client machine (standby head node).

    ```bash
    ssh sshuser@HeadNode1_Name
    cd ssl
    ```

1. Import the CA certificate to the truststore.

    ```bash
    keytool -keystore kafka.client.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert -storepass "MyClientPassword123" -keypass "MyClientPassword123" -noprompt
    ```

1. Import the CA cert to keystore.
    
    ```bash
    keytool -keystore kafka.client.keystore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert -storepass "MyClientPassword123" -keypass "MyClientPassword123" -noprompt
    ```

1. Create the file `client-ssl-auth.properties` on client machine (hn1). It should have the following lines:

    ```config
    security.protocol=SASL_SSL
    sasl.mechanism=GSSAPI
    sasl.kerberos.service.name=kafka
    ssl.truststore.location=/home/sshuser/ssl/kafka.client.truststore.jks
    ssl.truststore.password=MyClientPassword123
    ```
     1.  To Use TLS 1.3 add following configs to file `client-ssl-auth.properties`
   ```config
   ssl.enabled.protocols=TLSv1.3
   ssl.protocol=TLSv1.3
   ``` 

1. Start the admin client with producer and consumer options to verify that both producers and consumers are working on port 9093. Refer to [Verification](apache-kafka-ssl-encryption-authentication.md#verification) section for steps needed to verify the setup using console producer/consumer.

## Client setup (with authentication)

> [!Note]
> The following steps are required only if you are setting up both TLS encryption **and** authentication. If you are only setting up encryption, then see [Client setup without authentication](apache-kafka-ssl-encryption-authentication.md#client-setup-without-authentication).

The following four steps summarize the tasks needed to complete the client setup:

1. Sign in to the client machine (standby head node).
1. Create a Java keystore and get a signed certificate for the broker. Then copy the certificate to the VM where the CA is running.
1. Switch to the CA machine (active head node) to sign the client certificate.
1. Go to the client machine (standby head node) and navigate to the `~/ssl` folder. Copy the signed cert to client machine.

The details of each step are given.

1. Sign in to the client machine (standby head node).

    ```bash
    ssh sshuser@HeadNode1_Name
    ```

1. Remove any existing ssl directory.

    ```bash
    rm -R ~/ssl
    mkdir ssl
    cd ssl
    ```

1. Create a Java keystore and create a certificate signing request. 

    ```bash
    keytool -genkey -keystore kafka.client.keystore.jks -validity 365 -storepass "MyClientPassword123" -keypass "MyClientPassword123" -dname "CN=HEADNODE1_FQDN" -storetype pkcs12
    
    keytool -keystore kafka.client.keystore.jks -certreq -file client-cert-sign-request -storepass "MyClientPassword123" -keypass "MyClientPassword123"
    ```

1. Copy the certificate signing request to the CA

    ```bash
    scp client-cert-sign-request sshuser@HeadNode0_Name:~/ssl/client-cert-sign-request
    ```

1. Switch to the CA machine (active head node) and sign the client certificate.

    ```bash
    ssh sshuser@HeadNode0_Name
    cd ssl
    openssl x509 -req -CA ca-cert -CAkey ca-key -in ~/ssl/client-cert-sign-request -out ~/ssl/client-cert-signed -days 365 -CAcreateserial -passin pass:MyClientPassword123
    ```

1. Copy signed client cert from the CA (active head node) to client machine.

    ```bash
    scp client-cert-signed sshuser@HeadNode1_Name:~/ssl/client-signed-cert
    ```

1. Copy the ca-cert to the client machine

    ```bash
    scp ca-cert sshuser@HeadNode1_Name:~/ssl/ca-cert
    ```

    1. Sign in to the client machine (standby head node) and navigate to ssl directory.

    ```bash
    ssh sshuser@HeadNode1_Name
    cd ssl
    ```

1. Create client store with signed certificate, and import CA  certificate into the keystore, and truststore on client machine (hn1):

    ```bash
    keytool -keystore kafka.client.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert -storepass "MyClientPassword123" -keypass "MyClientPassword123" -noprompt
    
    keytool -keystore kafka.client.keystore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert -storepass "MyClientPassword123" -keypass "MyClientPassword123" -noprompt
    
    keytool -keystore kafka.client.keystore.jks -import -file client-signed-cert -storepass "MyClientPassword123" -keypass "MyClientPassword123" -noprompt
    ```

1. Create a file `client-ssl-auth.properties` on client machine (hn1). It should have the following lines:

    ```bash
    security.protocol=SASL_SSL
    sasl.mechanism=GSSAPI
    sasl.kerberos.service.name=kafka

    ssl.truststore.location=/home/sshuser/ssl/kafka.client.truststore.jks
    ssl.truststore.password=MyClientPassword123
    ssl.keystore.location=/home/sshuser/ssl/kafka.client.keystore.jks
    ssl.keystore.password=MyClientPassword123
    ssl.key.password=MyClientPassword123

    ```
      1.  To Use TLS 1.3 add following configs to file `client-ssl-auth.properties`
   ```config
   ssl.enabled.protocols=TLSv1.3
   ssl.protocol=TLSv1.3
   ``` 

## Verification

Run these steps on the client machine.

> [!Note]
> If HDInsight 4.0 and Kafka 2.1 is installed, you can use the console producer/consumers to verify your setup. If not, run the Kafka producer on port 9092 and send messages to the topic, and then use the Kafka consumer on port 9093 which uses TLS.

### Kafka 2.1 or above

> [!Note]
> Below commands will work if you're either using `kafka` user or a custom user which have access to do CRUD operation.

:::image type="content" source="./media/apache-esp-kafka-ssl-encryption-authentication/access-to-crud-operation.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to provide access CRUD operations." border="true":::

Using Command Line Tool

1. Make sure you check the local kerberos ticket for custom user you want to use to submit commands. 

1. `klist` 

   If ticket is present, then you're good to proceed. Otherwise generate a Kerberos principle and keytab using below command. 

1. `ktutil`
  
   ```
   ktutil: addent -password -p espkafkauser@TEST.COM -k 1 -e RC4-HMAC 
   Password for espkafkauser@TEST.COM: 
   ktutil: wkt user1.keytab 
   ktutil: q 
   kinit –kt espkafkauser.keytab espkafkauser@TEST.COM 
   ```

1. `klist` again to check kerberos cached ticket.

1. Create a topic if it doesn't exist already.
   ```bash
   sudo su kafka –c "/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper <ZOOKEEPER_NODE>:2181 --create --topic topic1 --partitions 2 --replication-factor 2"
   ```
   To use a keytab, create a Keytab file with the following content. Be sure to point the Keytab property to your Keytab file and reference the principal used inside the Keytab. Following is a sample JAAS file created and placed in the location in VM: **/home/sshuser/kafka_client_jaas_keytab.conf**
   
   ```
   KafkaClient { 
      com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
      useKeyTab=true
      storeKey=true
      keyTab="/home/sshuser/espkafkauser.keytab"
      principal="espkafkauser@TEST.COM";
   };
   ```
      
1. Start console producer and provide the path to `client-ssl-auth.properties` as a configuration file for the producer.

   ```bash
    export KAFKA_OPTS="-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/home/hdiuser/kafka_client_jaas_keytab.conf"
    
   /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list <FQDN_WORKER_NODE>:9093 --topic topic1 --producer.config ~/ssl/client-ssl-auth.properties
   ```
   
1. Open another ssh connection to client machine and  start console consumer and provide the path to `client-ssl-auth.properties` as a configuration file for the consumer.

   ```bash
   export KAFKA_OPTS="-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/home/sshuser/kafka_client_jaas_keytab.conf"
    
   /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server <FQDN_WORKER_NODE>:9093 --topic topic1 --consumer.config ~/ssl/client-ssl-auth.properties --from-beginning
   ```
