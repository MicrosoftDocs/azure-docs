# Configure storage and scalability for Apache Kafka on HDInsight

Learn how to configure the number of managed disks used by [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) on HDInsight.

Kafka on HDInsight uses the local disk of the virtual machines in the HDInsight cluster. Since Kafka is very I/O heavy, [Azure Managed Disks](/azure/virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview) is used to provide high throughput and provide more storage per node. If traditional virtual hard drives (VHD) were used for Kafka, each node is limited to 1 TB. With managed disks, you can use multiple disks to achieve 16 TB for each node in the cluster.

The following diagram provides a comparison between Kafka on HDInsight before managed disks, and Kafka on HDInsight with managed disks:

## Configure managed disks: Azure portal

1. Follow the steps in the [Create an HDInsight cluster](../hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-portal.md) to understand the common steps to create a cluster using the portal. Don't complete the portal creation process.

2. From the **Configuration & Pricing** section, use the __Number of Nodes__ field to configure the number of disks.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The type of managed disk can be either __Standard__ (HDD) or __Premium__ (SSD). Premium disks are used with DS and GS series VMs. All other VM types use standard.

## Configure managed disks: Resource Manager template

To control the number of disks used by the worker nodes in a Kafka cluster, use the following section of the template:

```json
"dataDisksGroups": [
    {
        "disksPerNode": "[variables('disksPerWorkerNode')]"
    }
    ],
```
