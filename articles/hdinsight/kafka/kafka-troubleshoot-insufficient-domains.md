# Scenario: Cluster creation failed due to `not sufficient fault domains in region` in Azure HDInsight

This article describes troubleshooting steps and possible resolutions for issues when interacting with Azure HDInsight clusters.

## Issue

Receive error message similar to `not sufficient fault domains in region` when attempting to create Apache Kafka cluster.

## Cause

A fault domain is a logical grouping of underlying hardware in an Azure data center. Each fault domain shares a common power source and network switch. The virtual machines and managed disks that implement the nodes within an HDInsight cluster are distributed across these fault domains. This architecture limits the potential impact of physical hardware failures.

Each Azure region has a specific number of fault domains. For a list of domains and the number of fault domains they contain, refer to documentation on [Availability Sets](/azure/virtual-machines/availability).

In HDInsight, Kafka clusters are required to be provisioned in a region with at least three Fault domains.

## Resolution

If the region you wish to create the cluster doesn't have sufficient fault domains, reach out to product team to allow provisioning of the cluster even if there aren't three fault domains.
