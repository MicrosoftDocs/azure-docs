# How to connect Kafka cluster with VM in different VNet

This Document lists steps that must be followed to set up connectivity between VM and HDI Kafka residing in two different VNet. 

1. Create two different VNets where HDInsight Kafka cluster and VM will be hosted respectively. For more information, see [Create a virtual network using the Azure portal](../../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md)

   > [!Note]
   > These two  VNets must be peered, so that IP addresses of their subnets must not overlap with each other. For more information, see [Connect virtual networks with virtual network peering using the Azure portal](../../virtual-network/tutorial-connect-virtual-networks-portal.md)

1. Make sure that the peering status shows as connected.

1. After the above steps are completed, we can create HDInsight Kafka cluster in one VNet. For more information, see [Create an Apache Kafka cluster](./apache-kafka-get-started.md#create-an-apache-kafka-cluster)

1. Create a Virtual Machine in the second VNet. While creating the VM, specify the second VNet name where this virtual machine must be deployed. For more information, see [Create a Linux virtual machine in the Azure portal](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal)

1. After this step, we can copy the entries of the file /etc/host from Kafka headnode to VM.
   
   :::image type="content" source="./media/connect-kafka-cluster-with-different-vnet/etc-host-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing host file output." border="true":::
   
1. Remove the `headnodehost` string entries from the file. For example, the above image has `headnodehost` entry for the ip 10.0.0.16. 
1. After these entries are made, try to reach the Kafka Ambari dashboard using the curl command using the hn0 or hn1 FQDN as
   
   From Linux VM
   
   ```
   curl hn0-vnetka.glarbkztnoqubmzjylls33qnse.bx.internal.cloudapp.net:8080 
   ```
   
   Output: 

   ```

   From Windows VM

   > [!Note] 
   > 1. In Windows VM , static hostnames are added in the file hosts present in the path `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\`
   > 1. This document assumes that the Ambari server is active on hn0. If the Ambari server is active on hn1 use the FQDN of hn1 to access the Ambari UI. 
   
1. You can also send messages to kafka topic and read the topics from the VM. For that you can try to use this sample java application, https://github.com/Azure-Samples/hdinsight-kafka-java-get-started
   
   Make sure to create the topic inside the Kafka cluster using the command
     
   ```
   java -jar kafka-producer-consumer.jar create <topic_name> $KAFKABROKERS
   ```

1. After creating the topic, we can use the below commands to produce and consume. The $KAFKABROKERS must be replaced appropriately with the broker worker node FQDN and port as mentioned in the documentation. 
    
   ```
   java -jar kafka-producer-consumer.jar producer test $KAFKABROKERS `
   java -jar kafka-producer-consumer.jar consumer test $KAFKABROKERS 
   ```
   
1. After this step you get an output as 
    
   **Producer output:**
   
   :::image type="content" source="./media/connect-kafka-cluster-with-different-vnet/kafka-producer-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Kafka producer output VM." border="true":::
     
   **Consumer output:**
