# Set up the PySpark interactive environment for Visual Studio Code

The following steps show how to set up the PySpark interactive environment in VS Code. This step is only for non-Windows users.

We use **python/pip** command to build virtual environment in your Home path. If you want to use another version, you need to change default version of **python/pip** command manually. More details see [update-alternatives](https://linux.die.net/man/8/update-alternatives).

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

   * Install Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
   * Install pip from [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (if it's not installed from the Python installation).
   * Optionally validate that Python and pip are installed successfully by using the commands `python --version`, and `pip --version`, respectively. 

     > [!NOTE]
     > It is recommended to manually install Python instead of using the macOS default version.

2. Install **virtualenv** by running command below.

   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   ```

## Other packages

On Linux, if you come across the error message below, then install the required packages by running the following two commands.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/set-up-pyspark-interactive-environment/install-libkrb5-package.png" alt-text="Install libkrb5 package for python." border="true":::

```bash
sudo apt-get install libkrb5-dev
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-dev
```

Restart VS Code, and then go back to the VS Code editor and run **Spark: PySPark Interactive** command.
