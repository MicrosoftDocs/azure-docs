# Ports used by Apache Hadoop services on HDInsight

This document provides a list of the ports used by Apache Hadoop services running on HDInsight clusters. It also provides information on ports used to connect to the cluster using SSH.

## Public ports vs. non-public ports

Linux-based HDInsight clusters only expose three ports publicly on the internet: 22, 23, and 443. These ports secure cluster access using SSH and services exposed over the secure HTTPS protocol.

HDInsight is implemented by several Azure Virtual Machines (cluster nodes) running on an Azure Virtual Network. From within the virtual network, you can access ports not exposed over the internet. If you connect via SSH to the head node, you can directly access services running on the cluster nodes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you do not specify an Azure Virtual Network as a configuration option for HDInsight, one is created automatically. However, you can't join other machines (such as other Azure Virtual Machines or your client development machine) to this virtual network.

To join additional machines to the virtual network, you must create the virtual network first, and then specify it when creating your HDInsight cluster. For more information, see [Plan a virtual network for HDInsight](hdinsight-plan-virtual-network-deployment.md).

## Public ports

All the nodes in an HDInsight cluster are located in an Azure Virtual Network. The nodes can't be directly accessed from the internet. A public gateway provides internet access to the following ports, which are common across all HDInsight cluster types.

| Service | Port | Protocol | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sshd |22 |SSH |Connects clients to sshd on the primary headnode. For more information, see [Use SSH with HDInsight](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md). |
| sshd |22 |SSH |Connects clients to sshd on the edge node. For more information, see [Use SSH with HDInsight](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md). |
| sshd |23 |SSH |Connects clients to sshd on the secondary headnode. For more information, see [Use SSH with HDInsight](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md). |
| Ambari |443 |HTTPS |Ambari web UI. See [Manage HDInsight using the Apache Ambari Web UI](hdinsight-hadoop-manage-ambari.md) |
| Ambari |443 |HTTPS |Ambari REST API. See [Manage HDInsight using the Apache Ambari REST API](hdinsight-hadoop-manage-ambari-rest-api.md) |
| WebHCat |443 |HTTPS |`HCatalog` REST API. See  [Use MapReduce with Curl](hadoop/apache-hadoop-use-mapreduce-curl.md) |
| HiveServer2 |443 |ODBC |Connects to Hive using ODBC. See [Connect Excel to HDInsight with the Microsoft ODBC driver](hadoop/apache-hadoop-connect-excel-hive-odbc-driver.md). |
| HiveServer2 |443 |JDBC |Connects to ApacheHive using JDBC. See [Connect to Apache Hive on HDInsight using the Hive JDBC driver](hadoop/apache-hadoop-connect-hive-jdbc-driver.md) |

The following are available for specific cluster types:

| Service | Port | Protocol | Cluster type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Stargate` |443 |HTTPS |HBase |HBase REST API. See [Get started using Apache HBase](hbase/apache-hbase-tutorial-get-started-linux.md) |
| Livy |443 |HTTPS |Spark |Spark REST API. See [Submit Apache Spark jobs remotely using Apache Livy](spark/apache-spark-livy-rest-interface.md) |
| Spark Thrift server |443 |HTTPS |Spark |Spark Thrift server used to submit Hive queries. See [Use Beeline with Apache Hive on HDInsight](hadoop/apache-hadoop-use-hive-beeline.md) |
| Kafka REST proxy |443 |HTTPS |Kafka |Kafka REST API. See [Interact with Apache Kafka clusters in Azure HDInsight using a REST proxy](kafka/rest-proxy.md) |

### Authentication

All services publicly exposed on the internet must be authenticated:

| Port | Credentials |
| --- | --- |
| 22 or 23 |The SSH user credentials specified during cluster creation |
| 443 |The login name (default: admin) and password that were set during cluster creation |

## Non-public ports

> [!NOTE]
> Some services are only available on specific cluster types. For example, HBase is only available on HBase cluster types.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some services only run on one headnode at a time. If you attempt to connect to the service on the primary headnode and receive an error, retry using the secondary headnode.
