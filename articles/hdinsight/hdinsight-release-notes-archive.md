## Updated

* MSI based authentication support available for Azure blob storage.

  * Azure HDInsight now supports OAuth-based authentication for accessing Azure Blob storage by leveraging Azure Active Directory (AAD) and managed identities (MSI). With this enhancement, HDInsight uses user-assigned managed identities to access Azure blob storage. For more information, see [Managed identities for Azure resources](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).


* HDInsight service transitioned to use standard load balancers for all its cluster configurations due to [deprecation announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-basic-load-balancer-will-be-retired-on-30-september-2025-upgrade-to-standard-load-balancer#main) of Azure basic load balancer.

  > [!NOTE]
  > This change is available in all regions. Recreate your cluster to consume this change. For any assistance, contact [support](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/~/overview).

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > When using your own Virtual Network (custom VNet) during cluster creation, be advised that the cluster creation won't succeed once this change is enabled. We recommend referring to the [migration guide to recreate the cluster](./load-balancer-migration-guidelines.md).

For workload specific versions, see [HDInsight 5.x component versions](./hdinsight-5x-component-versioning.md).

## Fixed issues
* Security enhancements
    * Improvements on using Tags for clusters in line with the [SFI](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-cloud/resources/secure-future-initiative) requirements.
    * Improvements in probes scripts as per the [SFI](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-cloud/resources/secure-future-initiative) requirements.
* Improvements in the HDInsight Log Analytics with System Managed Identity support for HDInsight Resource Provider.
* Addition of new activity to upgrade the `mdsd` agent version for old image (created before 2024).
* Enabling MISE in gateway as part of the continued improvements for [MSAL Migration](/entra/identity-platform/msal-overview).
* Incorporate Spark Thrift Server `Httpheader hiveConf` to the Jetty HTTP ConnectionFactory.
* Revert RANGER-3753 and RANGER-3593.
    
    The `setOwnerUser` implementation given in Ranger 2.3.0 release has a critical regression issue when being used by Hive. In Ranger 2.3.0, when HiveServer2 tries to evaluate the policies, Ranger Client tries to get the owner of the hive table by calling the Metastore in the setOwnerUser function which essentially makes call to storage to check access for that table. This issue causes the queries to run slow when Hive runs on 2.3.0 Ranger.

**New regions added**

## What's new

* HDInsight announces the General availability of HDInsight 5.1 starting November 1, 2023. This release brings in a full stack refresh to the [open source components](./hdinsight-5x-component-versioning.md#open-source-components-available-with-hdinsight-5x) and the integrations from Microsoft. 
    * Latest Open Source Versions – [HDInsight 5.1](./hdinsight-5x-component-versioning.md) comes with the latest stable [open-source version](./hdinsight-5x-component-versioning.md#open-source-components-available-with-hdinsight-5x) available. Customers can benefit from all latest open source features, Microsoft performance improvements, and Bug fixes. 
    * Secure – The latest versions come with the most recent security fixes, both open-source security fixes and security improvements by Microsoft. 
    * Lower TCO – With performance enhancements customers can lower the operating cost, along with [enhanced autoscale](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/analytics-on-azure-blog/enhanced-autoscale-capabilities-in-hdinsight-clusters/ba-p/3811271).
   
* Cluster permissions for secure storage  
  * Customers can specify (during cluster creation) whether a secure channel should be used for HDInsight cluster nodes to connect the storage account.
    
* HDInsight Cluster Creation with Custom VNets.
  * To improve the overall security posture of the HDInsight clusters, HDInsight clusters using custom VNETs need to ensure that the user needs to have permission for `Microsoft Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action` to perform create operations. Customer might face creation failures if this check is not enabled.
    
 * Non-ESP ABFS clusters [Cluster Permissions for Word Readable] 
     * Non-ESP ABFS clusters restrict non-Hadoop group users from executing Hadoop commands for storage operations. This change improves cluster security posture.
       
* In-line quota update.
   * Now you can request quota increase directly from the My Quota page, with the direct API call it is much faster. In case the API call fails, you can create a new support request for quota increase.

### :::image type="icon" border="false" source="./media/hdinsight-release-notes/clock.svg"::: Coming soon

* The max length of cluster name will be changed to 45 from 59 characters, to improve the security posture of clusters. This change will be rolled out to all regions starting upcoming release.

* Basic and Standard A-series VMs Retirement.
   * On August 31, 2024, we will retire Basic and Standard A-series VMs. Before that date, you need to migrate your workloads to Av2-series VMs, which provide more memory per vCPU and faster storage on solid-state drives (SSDs).
   * To avoid service disruptions, [migrate your workloads](https://aka.ms/Av1retirement) from Basic and Standard A-series VMs to Av2-series VMs before August 31, 2024.

1. **Quota Management for HDInsight**

    HDInsight currently allocates quota to customer subscriptions at a regional level. The cores allocated to customers are generic and not classified at a VM family level (For example, `Dv2`, `Ev3`, `Eav4`, etc.).
    
    HDInsight introduced an improved view, which provides a detail and classification of quotas for family-level VMs, this feature allows customers to view current and remaining quotas for a region at the VM family level. With the enhanced view, customers have richer visibility, for planning quotas, and a better user experience. This feature is currently available on HDInsight 4.x and 5.x for East US EUAP region. Other regions to follow later.

## Release date: 08/10/2022

This release applies to HDInsight 4.0.  HDInsight release is made available to all regions over several days.

HDInsight uses safe deployment practices, which involve gradual region deployment. It might take up to 10 business days for a new release or a new version to be available in all regions.


:::image type="content" border="true" source="media/hdinsight-release-notes/icon-for-new-feature.png" alt-text="Icon_showing_new_features."::: 
### New Feature

**1. Attach external disks in HDI Hadoop/Spark clusters**

HDInsight cluster comes with predefined disk space based on SKU. This space might not be sufficient in large job scenarios. 

This new feature allows you to add more disks in cluster, which used as node manager local directory. Add number of disks to worker nodes during HIVE and Spark cluster creation, while the  selected disks are part of node manager’s local directories.

> [!NOTE]
> The added disks are only configured for node manager local directories.
> 

For more information, [see here](./hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters.md#configuration--pricing)

**2. Selective logging analysis**

Selective logging analysis is now available on all regions for public preview. You can connect your cluster to a log analytics workspace. Once enabled, you can see the logs and metrics like HDInsight Security Logs, Yarn Resource Manager, System Metrics etc. You can monitor workloads and see how they're affecting cluster stability. Selective logging allows you to enable/disable all the tables or enable selective tables in log analytics workspace. You can adjust the source type for each table, since in new version of Geneva monitoring one table has multiple sources.

1. The Geneva monitoring system uses mdsd(MDS daemon) which is a monitoring agent and fluentd for collecting logs using unified logging layer.
1. Selective Logging uses script action to disable/enable tables and their log types. Since it doesn't open any new ports or change any existing security setting hence, there are no security changes.
1. Script Action runs in parallel on all specified nodes and changes the configuration files for disabling/enabling tables and their log types.

For more information, [see here](./selective-logging-analysis.md)

### Deprecation notices
#### Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets on HDInsight  

HDInsight will no longer use Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets to provision the clusters, no breaking change is expected. Existing HDInsight clusters on virtual machine scale sets have no impact, any new clusters on latest images will no longer use Virtual Machine Scale Sets.  

#### Scaling of Azure HDInsight HBase workloads will now be supported only using manual scale

Starting from March 01, 2022, HDInsight will only support manual scale for HBase, there's no impact on running clusters. New HBase clusters won't be able to enable schedule based Autoscaling.  For more information on how to  manually scale your HBase cluster, refer our documentation on [Manually scaling Azure HDInsight clusters](./hdinsight-scaling-best-practices.md)


## Release date: 12/27/2021

This release applies for HDInsight 4.0. HDInsight release is made available to all regions over several days. The release date here indicates the first region release date. If you don't see following changes, wait for the release being live in your region over several days.

The OS versions for this release are:

### New features
#### Azure HDInsight support for Restricted Public Connectivity is generally available on Oct 15, 2021
Azure HDInsight now supports restricted public connectivity in all regions. Below are some of the key highlights of this capability: 

- Ability to reverse resource provider to cluster communication such that it's outbound from the cluster to the resource provider 
- Support for bringing your own Private Link enabled resources (For example, storage, SQL, key vault) for HDInsight cluster to access the resources over private network only 
- No public IP addresses are resource provisioned 

By using this new capability, you can also skip the inbound network security group (NSG) service tag rules for HDInsight management IPs. Learn more about [restricting public connectivity](./hdinsight-restrict-public-connectivity.md)

#### Azure HDInsight support for Azure Private Link is generally available on Oct 15 2021
You can now use private endpoints to connect to your HDInsight clusters over private link. Private link can be used in cross VNET scenarios where VNET peering isn't available or enabled. 

Azure Private Link enables you to access Azure PaaS Services (for example, Azure Storage and SQL Database) and Azure hosted customer-owned/partner services over a [private endpoint](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md) in your virtual network. 

Traffic between your virtual network and the service travels the Microsoft backbone network. Exposing your service to the public internet is no longer necessary. 

Let more at [enable private link](./hdinsight-private-link.md).  

#### New Azure Monitor integration experience (Preview)
The new Azure monitor integration experience will be Preview in East US and West Europe with this release. Learn more details about the new Azure monitor experience [here](./log-analytics-migration.md#migrate-to-the-new-azure-monitor-integration).

### Deprecation
HDInsight 3.6 version is deprecated effective Oct 01, 2022. 
### Behavior changes
#### HDInsight Interactive Query only supports schedule-based Autoscale
As customer scenarios grow more mature and diverse, we've identified some limitations with Interactive Query (LLAP) load-based Autoscale. These limitations are caused by the nature of LLAP query dynamics, future load prediction accuracy issues, and issues in the LLAP scheduler's task redistribution. Due to these limitations, users might see their queries run slower on LLAP clusters when Autoscale is enabled. The effect on performance can outweigh the cost benefits of Autoscale.

Starting from July 2021, the Interactive Query workload in HDInsight only supports schedule-based Autoscale. You can no longer enable load-based autoscale on new Interactive Query clusters. Existing running clusters can continue to run with the known limitations described above. 

Microsoft recommends that you move to a schedule-based Autoscale for LLAP.  You can analyze your cluster's current usage pattern through the Grafana Hive dashboard. For more information, see [Automatically scale Azure HDInsight clusters](hdinsight-autoscale-clusters.md). 

### Upcoming changes
The following changes happen in upcoming releases.

#### Built-in LLAP component in ESP Spark cluster will be removed
HDInsight 4.0 ESP Spark cluster has built-in LLAP components running on both head nodes. The LLAP components in ESP Spark cluster were originally added for HDInsight 3.6 ESP Spark, but has no real user case for HDInsight 4.0 ESP Spark. In the next release scheduled in Sep 2021, HDInsight will remove the built-in LLAP component from HDInsight 4.0 ESP Spark cluster. This change helps to offload head node workload and avoid confusion between ESP Spark and ESP Interactive Hive cluster type.

### New region
- West US 3
- `Jio` India West
- Australia Central

### Component version change
The following component version has been changed with this release:
- ORC version from 1.5.1 to 1.5.9

You can find the current component versions for HDInsight 4.0 and HDInsight 3.6 in [this doc](./hdinsight-component-versioning.md).

### Price Correction for HDInsight `Dv2` Virtual Machines

A pricing error was corrected on April 25, 2021, for the `Dv2` VM series on HDInsight. The pricing error resulted in a reduced charge on some customer's bills prior to April 25, and with the correction, prices now match what had been advertised on the HDInsight pricing page and the HDInsight pricing calculator. The pricing error impacted customers in the following regions who used `Dv2` VMs:

- Canada Central
- Canada East
- East Asia
- South Africa North
- Southeast Asia
- UAE Central

Starting on April 25, 2021, the corrected amount for the `Dv2` VMs will be on your account. Customer notifications were sent to subscription owners prior to the change. You can use the Pricing calculator, HDInsight pricing page, or the Create HDInsight cluster blade in the Azure portal to see the corrected costs for `Dv2` VMs in your region.

No other action is needed from you. The price correction will only apply for usage on or after April 25, 2021 in the specified regions, and not to any usage prior to this date. To ensure you have the most performant and cost-effective solution, we recommended that you review the pricing, VCPU, and RAM for your `Dv2` clusters and compare the `Dv2` specifications to the `Ev3` VMs to see if your solution would benefit from utilizing one of the newer VM series.

## Release date: 06/02/2021

This release applies for both HDInsight 3.6 and HDInsight 4.0. HDInsight release is made available to all regions over several days. The release date here indicates the first region release date. If you don't see following changes, wait for the release being live in your region in several days.

The OS versions for this release are:
- HDInsight 3.6: Ubuntu 16.04.7 LTS
- HDInsight 4.0: Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS

### New features
#### OS version upgrade
As referenced in [Ubuntu's release cycle](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle), the Ubuntu 16.04 kernel reaches End of Life (EOL) in April 2021. We started rolling out the new HDInsight 4.0 cluster image running on Ubuntu 18.04 with this release. Newly created HDInsight 4.0 clusters run on Ubuntu 18.04 by default once available. Existing clusters on Ubuntu 16.04 runs as is with full support.

HDInsight 3.6 will continue to run on Ubuntu 16.04. It will change to Basic support (from Standard support) beginning 1 July 2021. For more information about dates and support options, see [Azure HDInsight versions](./hdinsight-component-versioning.md#supported-hdinsight-versions). Ubuntu 18.04 won't be supported for HDInsight 3.6. If you'd like to use Ubuntu 18.04, you'll need to migrate your clusters to HDInsight 4.0. 

You need to drop and recreate your clusters if you'd like to move existing HDInsight 4.0 clusters to Ubuntu 18.04. Plan to create or recreate your clusters after Ubuntu 18.04 support becomes available.

After creating the new cluster, you can SSH to your cluster and run `sudo lsb_release -a` to verify that it runs on Ubuntu 18.04. We recommend that you test your applications in your test subscriptions first before moving to production.

#### Scaling optimizations on HBase accelerated writes clusters
HDInsight made some improvements and optimizations on scaling for HBase accelerated write enabled clusters. [Learn more about HBase accelerated write](./hbase/apache-hbase-accelerated-writes.md).

### Deprecation
No deprecation in this release.

### Behavior changes
#### Disable Standard_A5 VM size as Head Node for HDInsight 4.0
HDInsight cluster Head Node is responsible for initializing and managing the cluster. Standard_A5 VM size has reliability issues as Head Node for HDInsight 4.0. Starting from this release, customers won't be able to create new clusters with Standard_A5 VM size as Head Node. You can use other two-core VMs like E2_v3 or E2s_v3. Existing clusters will run as is. A four-core VM is highly recommended for Head Node to ensure the high availability and reliability of your production HDInsight clusters.

#### Network interface resource not visible for clusters running on Azure virtual machine scale sets
HDInsight is gradually migrating to Azure virtual machine scale sets. Network interfaces for virtual machines are no longer visible to customers for clusters that use Azure virtual machine scale sets.

### Upcoming changes
The following changes will happen in upcoming releases.

#### HDInsight Interactive Query only supports schedule-based Autoscale

As customer scenarios grow more mature and diverse, we've identified some limitations with Interactive Query (LLAP) load-based Autoscale. These limitations are caused by the nature of LLAP query dynamics, future load prediction accuracy issues, and issues in the LLAP scheduler's task redistribution. Due to these limitations, users might see their queries run slower on LLAP clusters when Autoscale is enabled. The effect on performance can outweigh the cost benefits of Autoscale.

Starting from July  2021, the Interactive Query workload in HDInsight only supports schedule-based Autoscale. You can no longer enable Autoscale on new Interactive Query clusters. Existing running clusters can continue to run with the known limitations described above. 

Microsoft recommends that you move to a schedule-based Autoscale for LLAP.  You can analyze your cluster's current usage pattern through the Grafana Hive dashboard. For more information, see [Automatically scale Azure HDInsight clusters](hdinsight-autoscale-clusters.md). 

#### VM host naming will be changed on July 1, 2021
HDInsight now uses Azure virtual machines to provision the cluster. The service is gradually migrating to [Azure virtual machine scale sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview). This migration will change the cluster host name FQDN name format, and the numbers in the host name won't be guarantee in sequence. If you want to get the FQDN names for each node, refer to [Find the Host names of Cluster Nodes](./find-host-name.md).

#### Move to Azure virtual machine scale sets
HDInsight now uses Azure virtual machines to provision the cluster. The service will gradually migrate to [Azure virtual machine scale sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview). The entire process might take months. After your regions and subscriptions are migrated, newly created HDInsight clusters will run on virtual machine scale sets without customer actions. No breaking change is expected.

## Release date: 03/24/2021

### New features
#### Spark 3.0 preview
HDInsight added [Spark 3.0.0](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0/) support to HDInsight 4.0 as a Preview feature.

#### OS version upgrade
HDInsight clusters are currently running on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. As referenced in [Ubuntu’s release cycle](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle), the Ubuntu 16.04 kernel will reach End of Life (EOL) in April 2021. We’ll start rolling out the new HDInsight 4.0 cluster image running on Ubuntu 18.04 in May 2021. Newly created HDInsight 4.0 clusters will run on Ubuntu 18.04 by default once available. Existing clusters on Ubuntu 16.04 will run as is with full support.

HDInsight 3.6 will continue to run on Ubuntu 16.04. It will reach the end of standard support by 30 June 2021, and will change to Basic support starting on 1 July 2021. For more information about dates and support options, see [Azure HDInsight versions](./hdinsight-component-versioning.md#supported-hdinsight-versions). Ubuntu 18.04 won't be supported for HDInsight 3.6. If you’d like to use Ubuntu 18.04, you’ll need to migrate your clusters to HDInsight 4.0. 

You need to drop and recreate your clusters if you’d like to move existing clusters to Ubuntu 18.04. Plan to create or recreate your cluster after Ubuntu 18.04 support becomes available. We’ll send another notification after the new image becomes available in all regions.

It’s highly recommended that you test your script actions and custom applications deployed on edge nodes on an Ubuntu 18.04 virtual machine (VM) in advance. You can [create Ubuntu Linux VM on 18.04-LTS](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/vm-simple-linux/), then create and use a [secure shell (SSH) key pair](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/mac-create-ssh-keys#ssh-into-your-vm) on your VM to run and test your script actions and custom applications deployed on edge nodes.

#### Disable Standard_A5 VM size as Head Node for HDInsight 4.0
HDInsight cluster Head Node is responsible for initializing and managing the cluster. Standard_A5 VM size has reliability issues as Head Node for HDInsight 4.0. Starting from the next release in May 2021, customers won't be able to create new clusters with Standard_A5 VM size as Head Node. You can use other 2-core VMs like E2_v3 or E2s_v3. Existing clusters will run as is. A 4-core VM is highly recommended for Head Node to ensure the high availability and reliability of your production HDInsight clusters.

### Bug fixes
HDInsight continues to make cluster reliability and performance improvements. 

### Component version change
Added support for Spark 3.0.0 and Kafka 2.4.1 as Preview.

#### Moving to Azure virtual machine scale sets
HDInsight now uses Azure virtual machines to provision the cluster. The service is gradually migrating to [Azure virtual machine scale sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview). The entire process might take months. After your regions and subscriptions are migrated, newly created HDInsight clusters will run on virtual machine scale sets without customer actions. No breaking change is expected.

### Deprecation
#### Disabled VM sizes
Starting from January 9 2021, HDInsight will block all customers creating clusters using standard_A8, standard_A9, standard_A10 and standard_A11 VM sizes. Existing clusters will run as is. Consider moving to HDInsight 4.0 to avoid potential system/support interruption.

### Behavior changes
#### Default cluster VM size changes to `Ev3`-series 
Default cluster VM sizes will be changed from D-series to `Ev3`-series. This change applies to head nodes and worker nodes. To avoid this change impacting your tested workflows, specify the VM sizes that you want to use in the ARM template.

#### Ability to select different Zookeeper virtual machine sizes for Spark, Hadoop, and ML Services
HDInsight previously didn't support customizing Zookeeper node size for Spark, Hadoop, and ML Services cluster types. It defaults to A2_v2/A2 virtual machine sizes, which are provided free of charge. From this release, you can select a Zookeeper virtual machine size that is most appropriate for your scenario. Zookeeper nodes with virtual machine size other than A2_v2/A2 will be charged. A2_v2 and A2 virtual machines are still provided free of charge.

#### Moving to Azure virtual machine scale sets
HDInsight now uses Azure virtual machines to provision the cluster. Starting from this release, the service will gradually migrate to [Azure virtual machine scale sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview). The entire process might take months. After your regions and subscriptions are migrated, newly created HDInsight clusters will run on virtual machine scale sets without customer actions. No breaking change is expected.

### Deprecation

### Behavior changes
#### ESP Spark cluster head node size change 
The minimum allowed head node size for ESP Spark cluster is changed to Standard_D13_V2. 
VMs with low cores and memory as head node could cause ESP cluster issues because of relatively low CPU and memory capacity. Starting from release, use SKUs higher than Standard_D13_V2 and Standard_E16_V3 as head node for ESP Spark clusters.
 
#### A minimum 4-core VM is required for Head Node 
A minimum 4-core VM is required for Head Node to ensure the high availability and reliability of HDInsight clusters. Starting from April 6 2020, customers can only choose 4-core or above VM as Head Node for the new HDInsight clusters. Existing clusters will continue to run as expected. 
 
#### Cluster worker node provisioning change
When 80% of the worker nodes are ready, the cluster enters **operational** stage. At this stage, customers can do all the data plane operations like running scripts and jobs. But customers can't do any control plane operation like scaling up/down. Only deletion is supported.
 
After the **operational** stage, the cluster waits another 60 minutes for the remaining 20% worker nodes. At the end of this 60 minute period, the cluster moves to the **running** stage, even if all of worker nodes are still not available. Once a cluster enters the **running** stage, you can use it as normal. Both control plan operations like scaling up/down, and data plan operations like running scripts and jobs are accepted. If some of the requested worker nodes aren't available, the cluster will be marked as partial success. You are charged for the nodes that were deployed successfully. 
 
#### Create new service principal through HDInsight
Previously, with cluster creation, customers can create a new service principal to access the connected ADLS Gen 1 account in Azure portal. Starting June 15, 2020, new service principal creation is not possible in the HDInsight creation workflow, only existing service principal is supported. See [Create Service Principal and Certificates using Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md).

#### Time out for script actions with cluster creation
HDInsight supports running script actions with cluster creation. From this release, all script actions with cluster creation must finish within **60 minutes**, or they time out. Script actions submitted to running clusters aren't impacted. Learn more details [here](./hdinsight-hadoop-customize-cluster-linux.md#script-action-in-the-cluster-creation-process).
 
### Upcoming changes
No upcoming breaking changes that you need to pay attention to.

## Release date: 01/09/2020

This release applies both for HDInsight 3.6 and 4.0. HDInsight release is made available to all regions over several days. The release date here indicates the first region release date. If you don't see following changes, wait for the release being live in your region in several days.

### New features
#### TLS 1.2 enforcement
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) are cryptographic protocols that provide communications security over a computer network. Learn more about [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#SSL_1.0.2C_2.0_and_3.0). HDInsight uses TLS 1.2 on public HTTP's endpoints but TLS 1.1 is still supported for backward compatibility. 

With this release, customers can opt into TLS 1.2 only for all connections through the public cluster endpoint. To support this, the new property **minSupportedTlsVersion** is introduced and can be specified during cluster creation. If the property isn't set, the cluster still supports TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2, which is the same as today's behavior. Customers can set the value for this property to "1.2", which means that the cluster only supports TLS 1.2 and above. For more information, see [Transport Layer Security](./transport-layer-security.md).

#### Bring your own key for disk encryption
All managed disks in HDInsight are protected with Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE). Data on those disks is encrypted by Microsoft-managed keys by default. Starting from this release, you can Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) for disk encryption and manage it using Azure Key Vault. BYOK encryption is a one-step configuration during cluster creation with no other cost. Just register HDInsight as a managed identity with Azure Key Vault and add the encryption key when you create your cluster. For more information, see [Customer-managed key disk encryption](./disk-encryption.md).

A-series VMs could cause ESP cluster issues because of relatively low CPU and memory capacity. A-series VMs will be deprecated for creating new ESP clusters.

#### Moving to Azure virtual machine scale sets
HDInsight now uses Azure virtual machines to provision the cluster. In the upcoming release, HDInsight will use Azure virtual machine scale sets instead. See more about Azure virtual machine scale sets.

### Bug fixes
HDInsight continues to make cluster reliability and performance improvements. 

### Component version change
No component version change for this release. You could find the current component versions for HDInsight 4.0 ad HDInsight 3.6 here.

## Release date: 12/17/2019

This release applies both for HDInsight 3.6 and 4.0.

### New features

#### Service tags
Service tags simplify security for Azure virtual machines and Azure virtual networks by enabling you to easily restrict network access to the Azure services. You can use service tags in your network security group (NSG) rules to allow or deny traffic to a specific Azure service globally or per Azure region. Azure provides the maintenance of IP addresses underlying each tag. HDInsight service tags for network security groups (NSGs) are groups of IP addresses for health and management services. These groups help minimize complexity for security rule creation. HDInsight customers can enable service tag through Azure portal, PowerShell, and REST API. For more information, see [Network security group (NSG) service tags for Azure HDInsight](./hdinsight-service-tags.md).

#### Custom Ambari DB
HDInsight now allows you to use your own SQL DB for Apache Ambari. You can configure this custom Ambari DB from the Azure portal or through Resource Manager template.  This feature allows you to choose the right SQL DB for your processing and capacity needs. You can also upgrade easily to match business growth requirements. For more information, see [Set up HDInsight clusters with a custom Ambari DB](hdinsight-custom-ambari-db.md).

### Deprecation
No deprecations for this release. To get ready for upcoming deprecations, see [Upcoming changes](#upcoming-changes).

### Behavior changes
No behavior changes for this release. To get ready for upcoming behavior changes, see [Upcoming changes](#upcoming-changes).

### Upcoming changes
The following changes will happen in upcoming releases. 

#### Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 enforcement
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) are cryptographic protocols that provide communications security over a computer network. For more information, see [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#SSL_1.0.2C_2.0_and_3.0). While Azure HDInsight clusters accept TLS 1.2 connections on public HTTPS endpoints, TLS 1.1 is still supported for backward compatibility with older clients.

Starting from the next release, you will be able to opt in and configure your new HDInsight clusters to only accept TLS 1.2 connections. 

Later in the year, starting on 6/30/2020, Azure HDInsight will enforce TLS 1.2 or later versions for all HTTPS connections. We recommend that you ensure that all your clients are ready to handle TLS 1.2 or later versions.

#### Moving to Azure virtual machine scale sets
HDInsight now uses Azure virtual machines to provision the cluster. Starting from February 2020 (exact date will be communicated later), HDInsight will use Azure virtual machine scale sets instead. See more about [Azure virtual machine scale sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview).

#### ESP Spark cluster node size change 
In the upcoming release:
- The minimum allowed node size for ESP Spark cluster will be changed to Standard_D13_V2. 
- A-series VMs will be deprecated for creating new ESP clusters, as A-series VMs could cause ESP cluster issues because of relatively low CPU and memory capacity.

#### HBase 2.0 to 2.1
In the upcoming HDInsight 4.0 release, HBase version will be upgraded from version 2.0 to 2.1.

### Bug fixes
HDInsight continues to make cluster reliability and performance improvements. 

### Component version change
We've extended HDInsight 3.6 support to December 31, 2020. You can find more details in [Supported HDInsight versions](hdinsight-component-versioning.md#supported-hdinsight-versions).

No component version change for HDInsight 4.0.

Apache Zeppelin on HDInsight 3.6: 0.7.0-->0.7.3.

## Release date: 11/07/2019

This release applies both for HDInsight 3.6 and 4.0.

### New features

#### HDInsight Identity Broker (HIB) (Preview)

HDInsight Identity Broker (HIB) enables users to sign in to Apache Ambari using multifactor authentication (MFA) and get the required Kerberos tickets without needing password hashes in Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AAD-DS). Currently HIB is only available for clusters deployed through Azure Resource Management (ARM) template.

#### Kafka REST API Proxy (Preview)

Kafka REST API Proxy provides one-click deployment of highly available REST proxy with Kafka cluster via secured Azure AD authorization and OAuth protocol. 

#### Auto scale

Autoscale for Azure HDInsight is now generally available across all regions for Apache Spark and Hadoop cluster types. This feature makes it possible to manage big data analytics workloads in a more cost-efficient and productive way. Now you can optimize use of your HDInsight clusters and only pay for what you need.

Depending on your requirements, you can choose between load-based and schedule-based autoscaling. Load-based Autoscale can scale the cluster size up and down based on the current resource needs while schedule-based Autoscale can change the cluster size based on a predefined schedule. 

Autoscale support for HBase and LLAP workload is also public preview. For more information, see [Automatically scale Azure HDInsight clusters](./hdinsight-autoscale-clusters.md).

#### HDInsight Accelerated Writes for Apache HBase 

Accelerated Writes uses Azure premium SSD managed disks to improve performance of the Apache HBase Write Ahead Log (WAL). For more information, see [Azure HDInsight Accelerated Writes for Apache HBase](./hbase/apache-hbase-accelerated-writes.md).

#### Custom Ambari DB

HDInsight now offers a new capacity to enable customers to use their own SQL DB for Ambari. Now customers can choose the right SQL DB for Ambari and  easily upgrade it based on their own business growth requirement. The deployment is done with an Azure Resource Manager template. For more information, see [Set up HDInsight clusters with a custom Ambari DB](./hdinsight-custom-ambari-db.md).

#### F-series virtual machines are now available with HDInsight

F-series virtual machines(VMs) is a good choice to get started with HDInsight with light processing requirements. At a lower per-hour list price, the F-series are  the best value in price-performance in the Azure portfolio based on the Azure Compute Unit (ACU) per vCPU. For more information, see [Selecting the right VM size for your Azure HDInsight cluster](./hdinsight-selecting-vm-size.md).

### Deprecation

#### G-series virtual machine deprecation
From this release, G-series VMs are no longer offered in HDInsight.

#### `Dv1` virtual machine deprecation
From this release, the use of `Dv1` VMs with HDInsight is deprecated. Any customer request for `Dv1` will be served with `Dv2` automatically. There's  no price difference between `Dv1` and `Dv2` VMs.

### Behavior changes

#### Cluster managed disk size change
HDInsight provides managed disk space with the cluster. From this release, the managed disk size of each node in the new created cluster is changed to 128 GB.

### Upcoming changes
The following changes will happen in the upcoming releases. 

#### Moving to Azure virtual machine scale sets
HDInsight now uses Azure virtual machines to provision the cluster. Starting from December, HDInsight will use Azure virtual machine scale sets instead. See more about [Azure virtual machine scale sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview).

### Known issues

#### Replication is broken for Secure HBase with default installation

For HDInsight 4.0, do the following steps:

1. Enable inter-cluster communication.
1. Sign in to the active headnode.
1. Download a script to enable replication with the following command:

    ```
    sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/hbase-utils/master/replication/hdi_enable_replication.sh
    ```
1. Type the command `sudo kinit <domainuser>`.
1. Type the following command to run the script:

    ```
    sudo bash hdi_enable_replication.sh -m <hn*> -s <srclusterdns> -d <dstclusterdns> -sp <srcclusterpasswd> -dp <dstclusterpasswd> -copydata
    ```
For HDInsight 3.6

1. Sign in to active HMaster ZK.
1. Download a script to enable replication with the following command:
    ```
    sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/hbase-utils/master/replication/hdi_enable_replication.sh
    ```
1. Type the command `sudo kinit -k -t /etc/security/keytabs/hbase.service.keytab hbase/<FQDN>@<DOMAIN>`.
1. Type the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo bash hdi_enable_replication.sh -s <srclusterdns> -d <dstclusterdns> -sp <srcclusterpasswd> -dp <dstclusterpasswd> -copydata
    ```

#### Phoenix Sqlline stops working after migrating HBase cluster to HDInsight 4.0

Do the following steps:

1. Drop the following Phoenix tables:
    1. `SYSTEM.FUNCTION`
    1. `SYSTEM.SEQUENCE`
    1. `SYSTEM.STATS`
    1. `SYSTEM.MUTEX`
    1. `SYSTEM.CATALOG`
1. If you can't delete any of the tables, restart HBase to clear any connections to the tables.
1. Run `sqlline.py` again. Phoenix will re-create all of the tables that were deleted in step 1.
1. Regenerate Phoenix tables and views for your HBase data.

#### Phoenix Sqlline stops working after replicating HBase Phoenix metadata from HDInsight 3.6 to 4.0

Do the following steps:

1. Before doing the replication, go to the destination 4.0 cluster and execute `sqlline.py`. This command will generate Phoenix tables like `SYSTEM.MUTEX` and `SYSTEM.LOG` that only exist in 4.0.
1. Drop the following tables:
    1. `SYSTEM.FUNCTION`
    1. `SYSTEM.SEQUENCE`
    1. `SYSTEM.STATS`
    1. `SYSTEM.CATALOG`
1. Start the HBase replication

#### Mahout

In HDP-2.3.x and 2.4.x, instead of shipping a specific Apache release of Mahout, we synchronized to a particular revision point on Apache Mahout trunk. This revision point is after the 0.9.0 release, but before the 0.10.0 release. This provides a large number of bug fixes and functional enhancements over the 0.9.0 release, but provides a stable release of the Mahout functionality before the complete conversion to new Spark-based Mahout in 0.10.0.

The revision point chosen for Mahout in HDP 2.3.x and 2.4.x is from the "mahout-0.10.x" branch of Apache Mahout, as of 19 December 2014, revision 0f037cb03e77c096 in GitHub.

In HDP-2.5.x and 2.6.x, we removed the "commons-httpclient" library from Mahout because we view it as an obsolete library with possible security issues, and upgraded the Hadoop-Client in Mahout to version 2.7.3, the same version used in HDP-2.5. As a result:

-   Previously compiled Mahout jobs will need to be recompiled in the HDP-2.5 or 2.6 environment.

-   There's  a small possibility that some Mahout jobs might encounter "ClassNotFoundException" or "could not load class" errors related to "org.apache.commons.httpclient", "net.java.dev.jets3t", or related class name prefixes. If these errors happen, you might consider whether to manually install the needed jars in your classpath for the job, if the risk of security issues in the obsolete library is acceptable in your environment.

-   There's  an even smaller possibility that some Mahout jobs might encounter crashes in Mahout's hbase-client code calls to the hadoop-common libraries, due to binary compatibility problems. Regrettably, there's  no way to resolve this issue except revert to the HDP-2.4.2 version of Mahout, which might have security issues. Again, this should be unusual, and is unlikely to occur in any given Mahout job suite.

### Fixed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

This section covers all Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) that are addressed in this release.

#### **​CVE-2017-7676**

| **Summary:** Apache Ranger policy evaluation ignores characters after ‘\*’ wildcard character |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Severity:** Critical                                                                           |
| **Vendor:** Hortonworks                                                                          |
| **Versions Affected:** HDInsight 3.6 versions including Apache Ranger versions 0.5.x/0.6.x/0.7.0     |
| **Users affected:** Environments that use Ranger policies with characters after ‘\*’ wildcard character – like my\*test, test\*.txt |
| **Impact:** Policy resource matcher ignores characters after ‘\*’ wildcard character, which can result in unintended behavior.      |
| **Fix detail:** Ranger policy resource matcher was updated to correctly handle wildcard matches.           |
| **Recommended Action:** Upgrade to HDI 3.6 (with Apache Ranger 0.7.1+).                                |

### **​CVE-2017-7677**

| **Summary:** Apache Ranger Hive Authorizer should check for RWX permission when external location is specified |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Severity:** Critical                                                                           |
| **Vendor:** Hortonworks                                                                          |
| **Versions Affected:** HDInsight 3.6 versions including Apache Ranger versions 0.5.x/0.6.x/0.7.0 |
| **Users affected:** Environments that use external location for hive tables |
| **Impact:** In environments that use external location for hive tables, Apache Ranger Hive Authorizer should check for RWX permission for the external location specified for create table. |
| **Fix detail:** Ranger Hive Authorizer was updated to correctly handle permission check with external location. |
| **Recommended Action:** Users should upgrade to HDI 3.6 (with Apache Ranger 0.7.1+). |

#### **​CVE-2017-9799**

| **Summary:** Potential execution of code as the wrong user in Apache Storm |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Severity:** Important |
| **Vendor:** Hortonworks |
| **Versions Affected:** HDP 2.4.0, HDP-2.5.0, HDP-2.6.0 |
| **Users affected:** Users who use Storm in secure mode and are using blobstore to distribute topology based artifacts or using the blobstore to distribute any topology resources. |
| **Impact:** Under some situations and configurations of storm it's theoretically possible for the owner of a topology to trick the supervisor to launch a worker as a different, non-root, user. In the worst case, this could lead to secure credentials of the other user being compromised. This vulnerability only applies to Apache Storm installations with security enabled. |
| **Mitigation:** Upgrade to HDP-2.6.2.1 as there are currently no workarounds.  |

#### **​CVE-2016-4970**

| **Summary:** handler/ssl/OpenSslEngine.java in Netty 4.0.x before 4.0.37. Final and 4.1.x before 4.1.1. Final allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Severity:** Moderate  |
| **Vendor:** Hortonworks  |
| **Versions Affected:** HDP 2.x.x since 2.3.x  |
| **Users Affected:** All users that use HDFS. |
| **Impact:** Impact is low as Hortonworks does not use OpenSslEngine.java directly in Hadoop codebase.     |
| **Recommended Action:** Upgrade to HDP 2.6.3.   |

#### **​CVE-2016-8746**

| **Summary:** Apache Ranger path matching issue in policy evaluation                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Severity:** Normal                                                                                                                   |
| **Vendor:** Hortonworks                                                                                                                |
| **Versions Affected:** All HDP 2.5 versions including Apache Ranger versions 0.6.0/0.6.1/0.6.2                                         |
| **Users affected:** All users of the ranger policy admin tool.                                                                         |
| **Impact:** Ranger policy engine incorrectly matches paths in certain conditions when a policy contains wildcards and recursive flags. |
| **Fix detail:** Fixed policy evaluation logic                                                                                          |
| **Recommended Action:** Users should upgrade to HDP 2.5.4+ (with Apache Ranger 0.6.3+) or HDP 2.6+ (with Apache Ranger 0.7.0+)         |

#### **​CVE-2016-8751**

| **Summary:** Apache Ranger stored cross site scripting issue  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Severity:** Normal |

| **Impact:** Apache Ranger is vulnerable to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting when entering custom policy conditions. Admin users can store some arbitrary JavaScript code execute when normal users sign in and access policies. |
| **Fix detail:** Added logic to sanitize the user input.  |
| **Recommended Action:** Users should upgrade to HDP 2.5.4+ (with Apache Ranger 0.6.3+) or HDP 2.6+ (with Apache Ranger 0.7.0+)  |

### Behavioral changes

|**Apache Component**|**Apache JIRA**|**Summary**|**Details**|
|--|--|--|--|
|**Spark 2.3** |**N/A** |**Changes as documented in the Apache Spark release notes** |- There's a "Deprecation" document and a "Change of behavior" guide, https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-2-3-0.html#deprecations<br /><br />- For SQL part, there's another detailed "Migration" guide (from 2.2 to 2.3), https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#upgrading-from-spark-sql-22-to-23|
|Spark |[**HIVE-12505**](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12505) |Spark job completes successfully but there's an HDFS disk quota full error |**Scenario:** Running **insert overwrite** when a quota is set on the Trash folder of the user who runs the command.<br /><br />**Previous Behavior:** The job succeeds even though it fails to move the data to the Trash. The result can wrongly contain some of the data previously present in the table.<br /><br />**New Behavior:** When the move to the Trash folder fails, the files are permanently deleted.|
|**Kafka 1.0**|**N/A**|**Changes as documented in the Apache Spark release notes** |https://kafka.apache.org/10/documentation.html#upgrade_100_notable|
|**Hive/ Ranger** | |Another ranger hive policies required for INSERT OVERWRITE |**Scenario:** Another ranger hive policies required for **INSERT OVERWRITE**<br /><br />**Previous behavior:** Hive **INSERT OVERWRITE** queries succeed as usual.<br /><br />**New behavior:** Hive **INSERT OVERWRITE** queries are unexpectedly failing after upgrading to HDP-2.6.x with the error:<br /><br />Error while compiling statement: FAILED: HiveAccessControlException Permission denied: user jdoe does not have WRITE privilege on /tmp/\*(state=42000,code=40000)<br /><br />As of HDP-2.6.0, Hive **INSERT OVERWRITE** queries require a Ranger URI policy to allow write operations, even if the user has write privilege granted through HDFS policy.<br /><br />**Workaround/Expected Customer Action:**<br /><br />1. Create a new policy under the Hive repository.<br />2. In the dropdown where you see Database, select URI.<br />3. Update the path (Example: /tmp/*)<br />4. Add the users and group and save.<br />5. Retry the insert query.|
|**HDFS**|**N/A** |HDFS should support for multiple `KMS Uris` |**Previous Behavior:** dfs.encryption.key.provider.uri property was used to configure the KMS provider path.<br /><br />**New Behavior:** dfs.encryption.key.provider.uri is now deprecated in favor of hadoop.security.key.provider.path to configure the KMS provider path.|
|**Zeppelin**|[**ZEPPELIN-3271**](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3271)|Option for disabling scheduler |**Component Affected:** Zeppelin-Server<br /><br />**Previous Behavior:** In previous releases of Zeppelin, there was no option for disabling scheduler.<br /><br />**New Behavior:** By default, users will no longer see scheduler, as it's disabled by default.<br /><br />**Workaround/Expected Customer Action:** If you want to enable scheduler, you will need to add azeppelin.notebook.cron.enable with value of true under custom zeppelin site in Zeppelin settings from Ambari.|

### Known issues

- **HDInsight integration with ADLS Gen 2** 
  There are two issues on HDInsight ESP clusters using Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 with user directories and permissions:
   
  1. Home directories for users aren't getting created on Head Node 1. As a workaround, create the directories manually and changes ownership to the respective user’s UPN.
   
  2. Permissions on /hdp directory are currently not set to 751. This needs to be set to
     
     ```bash
     chmod 751 /hdp 
     chmod –R 755 /hdp/apps
     ```

- **Spark 2.3**

  -   \[[*SPARK-23523*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23523)\]\[SQL\] Incorrect result caused by the rule OptimizeMetadataOnlyQuery

  -   \[[*SPARK-23406*](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23406)\] Bugs in stream-stream self-joins

  -   Spark sample notebooks aren't available when Azure Data Lake Storage (Gen2) is default storage of the cluster.

- **Enterprise Security Package**

  - Spark Thrift Server doesn't accept connections from ODBC clients.
    Workaround steps:
    1. Wait for about 15 minutes after cluster creation.
    2. Check ranger UI for existence of hivesampletable_policy.
    3. Restart Spark service.
       STS connection should work now.

- **Workaround for Ranger service check failure**

  -   [RANGER-1607](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RANGER-1607): Workaround for Ranger service check failure while upgrading to HDP 2.6.2 from previous HDP versions.

      > [!NOTE]  
      > Only when Ranger is SSL enabled. 
     
  This issue arises when attempting to upgrade to HDP-2.6.1 from previous HDP versions through Ambari. Ambari uses a curl call to do a service check to Ranger service in Ambari. If the JDK version used by Ambari is JDK-1.7, the curl call will fail with the below error:
    
  `curl: (35) error:14077410:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:sslv3 alert handshake failure`
    
  The reason for this error is the tomcat version used in Ranger is Tomcat-7.0.7\*. Using JDK-1.7 conflicts with default ciphers provided in Tomcat-7.0.7\*.
    
  You can resolve this issue in two ways:
    
  -   Update the JDK used in Ambari from JDK-1.7 to JDK-1.8 (see the section [Change the JDK Version](https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/Ambari-2.2.0.0/bk_ambari_reference_guide/content/ch_changing_the_jdk_version_on_an_existing_cluster.html) in the Ambari Reference Guide).
    
  -   If you want to continue supporting a JDK-1.7 environment:
    
      1.  Add the property ranger.tomcat.ciphers in the ranger-admin-site section in your Ambari Ranger configuration with the below value:
            
          SSL\_RSA\_WITH\_RC4\_128\_MD5, SSL\_RSA\_WITH\_RC4\_128\_SHA, TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA, SSL\_RSA\_WITH\_3DES\_EDE\_CBC\_SHA
        
      2.  If your environment is configured for Ranger-KMS, add the property ranger.tomcat.ciphers in theranger-kms-site section in your Ambari Ranger configuration with the below value:
            
          SSL\_RSA\_WITH\_RC4\_128\_MD5, SSL\_RSA\_WITH\_RC4\_128\_SHA, TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA, SSL\_RSA\_WITH\_3DES\_EDE\_CBC\_SHA
    
  >[!NOTE]  
  >The noted values are working examples and might not be indicative of your environment. Ensure that the way you set these properties matches how your environment is configured.   

- **RangerUI: Escape of policy condition text entered in the policy form**
    
  **Component Affected:** Ranger
    
  **Description of Problem**
    
  If a user wants to create policy with custom policy conditions and the expression or text contains special characters, then policy enforcement won't work. Special characters are converted into ASCII before saving the policy into the database.
    
  **Special Characters:** & &lt; &gt; " \` '
    
  For example, the condition tags.attributes\['type'\]='abc' would get converted to the following once the policy is saved.
    
  tags.attds\[&\#x27;dsds&\#x27;\]=&\#x27;cssdfs&\#x27;
    
  You can see the policy condition with these characters by opening the policy in edit mode.
    
  **Workaround**
    
  - **Option \#1: Create/Update policy via Ranger REST API**
        
      REST URL: http://&lt;host&gt;:6080/service/plugins/policies
        
      **Creating policy with policy condition:**
        
      The following example will create policy with tags as \`tags-test\` and assign it to \`public\` group with policy condition astags.attr\['type'\]=='abc' by selecting all hive component permissions like select, update, create, drop, alter, index, lock, all.
        
      **Example:**
        
      ```bash
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:6080/service/plugins/policies -u admin:admin -d '{"policyType":"0","name":"P100","isEnabled":true,"isAuditEnabled":true,"description":"","resources":{"tag":{"values":["tags-test"],"isRecursive":"","isExcludes":false}},"policyItems":[{"groups":["public"],"conditions":[{"type":"accessed-after-expiry","values":[]},{"type":"tag-expression","values":["tags.attr['type']=='abc'"]}],"accesses":[{"type":"hive:select","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:update","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:create","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:drop","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:alter","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:index","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:lock","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:all","isAllowed":true}]}],"denyPolicyItems":[],"allowExceptions":[],"denyExceptions":[],"service":"tagdev"}'
      ```
        
      **Update existing policy with policy condition:**
        
      The following example will update policy with tags as \`tags-test\` and assign it to \`public\` group with policy condition astags.attr\['type'\]=='abc' by selecting all hive component permissions like select, update, create, drop, alter, index, lock, all.
        
      REST URL: http://&lt;host-name&gt;:6080/service/plugins/policies/&lt;policy-id&gt;
        
      **Example:**
        
      ```bash
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT http://localhost:6080/service/plugins/policies/18 -u admin:admin -d '{"id":18,"guid":"ea78a5ed-07a5-447a-978d-e636b0490a54","isEnabled":true,"createdBy":"Admin","updatedBy":"Admin","createTime":1490802077000,"updateTime":1490802077000,"version":1,"service":"tagdev","name":"P0101","policyType":0,"description":"","resourceSignature":"e5fdb911a25aa7f77af5a9546938d9ed","isAuditEnabled":true,"resources":{"tag":{"values":["tags"],"isExcludes":false,"isRecursive":false}},"policyItems":[{"accesses":[{"type":"hive:select","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:update","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:create","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:drop","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:alter","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:index","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:lock","isAllowed":true},{"type":"hive:all","isAllowed":true}],"users":[],"groups":["public"],"conditions":[{"type":"ip-range","values":["tags.attributes['type']=abc"]}],"delegateAdmin":false}],"denyPolicyItems":[],"allowExceptions":[],"denyExceptions":[],"dataMaskPolicyItems":[],"rowFilterPolicyItems":[]}'
      ```
        
  - **Option \#2: Apply JavaScript changes**
        
      Steps to update JS file:
        
      1.  Find out PermissionList.js file under /usr/hdp/current/ranger-admin
        
      2.  Find out definition of renderPolicyCondtion function (line no: 404).
        
      3.  Remove following line from that function i.e under display function(line no: 434)
            
          val = \_.escape(val);//Line No:460
            
          After removing the above line, the Ranger UI will allow you to create policies with policy condition that can contain special characters and policy evaluation will be successful for the same policy.

**HDInsight Integration with ADLS Gen 2: User directories and permissions issue with ESP clusters**
    1.	Home directories for users aren't getting created on Head Node 1. Workaround is to create these manually and changes ownership  to the respective user’s UPN.
    2.	Permissions on /hdp are currently not set to 751. This needs to be set to 
    a.	chmod 751 /hdp 
    b.	chmod –R 755 /hdp/apps

### Deprecation

-   **OMS Portal:** We've removed the link from HDInsight resource page that was pointing to OMS portal. Azure Monitor logs initially used its own portal called the OMS portal to manage its configuration and analyze collected data. All functionality from this portal has been moved to the Azure portal where it will continue to be developed. HDInsight has deprecated the support for OMS portal. Customers will use HDInsight Azure Monitor logs integration in Azure portal.

-   **Spark 2.3:** [Spark Release 2.3.0 deprecations](https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-2-3-0.html#deprecations)

### ​Upgrading

All of these features are available in HDInsight 3.6. To get the latest version of Spark, Kafka and R Server (Machine Learning Services), choose the Spark, Kafka, ML Services version when you [create a HDInsight 3.6 cluster](./hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters.md). To get support for ADLS, you can choose the ADLS storage type as an option. Existing clusters won't be upgraded to these versions automatically.

All new clusters created after June 2018 will automatically get across the 1000+ bug fixes across all the open-source projects. Follow [this](./hdinsight-upgrade-cluster.md) guide for best practices around upgrading to a newer HDInsight version.
