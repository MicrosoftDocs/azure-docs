# Create a cluster with Data Lake Storage Gen2 using the Azure portal

The Azure portal is a web-based management tool for services and resources hosted in the Microsoft Azure cloud. In this article, you learn how to create Linux-based Azure HDInsight clusters by using the portal. More details are available from [Create HDInsight clusters](./hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters.md).

[!INCLUDE [delete-cluster-warning](includes/hdinsight-delete-cluster-warning.md)]

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

To create an HDInsight cluster that uses Data Lake Storage Gen2 for storage, follow these steps to configure a storage account that has a hierarchical namespace.

## Create a user-assigned managed identity

Create a user-assigned managed identity, if you donâ€™t already have one.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In the upper-left click **Create a resource**.
1. In the search box, type **user assigned** and click **User Assigned Managed Identity**.
1. Click **Create**.
1. Enter a name for your managed identity, select the correct subscription, resource group, and location.
1. Click **Create**.

For more information on how managed identities work in Azure HDInsight, see [Managed identities in Azure HDInsight](hdinsight-managed-identities.md).

## Create a storage account to use with Data Lake Storage Gen2

Create a storage account to use with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In the upper-left click **Create a resource**.
1. In the search box, type **storage** and click **storage account**.
1. Click **Create**.
1. On the **`Create storage account`** screen:
    1. Select the correct subscription and resource group.
    1. Enter a name for your storage account with Data Lake Storage Gen2.
    1. Click on the **Advanced** tab.
    1. Click **Enabled** next to **Hierarchical namespace** under **Data Lake Storage Gen2**.
    1. Click **Review + create**.
    1. Click **Create**

For more information on other options during storage account creation, see [Quickstart: Create a storage account for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](../storage/blobs/create-data-lake-storage-account.md).

## Set up permissions for the managed identity on the Data Lake Storage Gen2

Assign the managed identity to the **Storage Blob Data Owner** role on the storage account.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your storage account.

1. Select **Access control (IAM)**.

1. Select **Add > Add role assignment**.

1. On the **Role** tab, select **Storage Blob Data Owner**.

   :::image type="content" source="~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/media/role-based-access-control/add-role-assignment-role-generic.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Add role assignment page with Role tab selected.":::

1. On the **Members** tab, select **Managed identity**, and then select **Select members**.

1. Select your subscription, select **User-assigned managed identity**, and then select your user-assigned managed identity.

1. On the **Review + assign** tab, select **Review + assign** to assign the role.

   The user-assigned identity that you selected is now listed under the selected role.

   For more information about role assignments, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.yml)

1. After this initial setup is complete, you can create a cluster through the portal. The cluster must be in the same Azure region as the storage account. In the **Storage** tab of the cluster creation menu, select the following options:

    * For **Primary storage type**, select **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**.
    * Under **Primary Storage account**, search for and select the newly created storage account with Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage.

    * Under **Identity**, select the newly created user-assigned managed identity.

    > [!NOTE]
    > * To add a secondary storage account with Data Lake Storage Gen2, at the storage account level, simply assign the managed identity created earlier to the new Data Lake Storage Gen2 that you want to add. Please be advised that adding a secondary storage account with Data Lake Storage Gen2 via the "Additional storage accounts" blade on HDInsight isn't supported.
    > * You can enable RA-GRS or RA-ZRS on the Azure Blob storage account that HDInsight uses. However, creating a cluster against the RA-GRS or RA-ZRS secondary endpoint isn't supported.
    > * HDInsight does not support setting Data Lake Storage Gen2 as read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS) or geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS).

## Delete the cluster

See [Delete an HDInsight cluster using your browser, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI](./hdinsight-delete-cluster.md).

## Troubleshoot

If you run into issues with creating HDInsight clusters, see [access control requirements](./hdinsight-hadoop-customize-cluster-linux.md#access-control).
