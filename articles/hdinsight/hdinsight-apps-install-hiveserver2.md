# Scale HiveServer2 on Azure HDInsight Clusters for High Availability

Learn how to deploy an additional HiveServer2 into your cluster to increase availability and load distribution. When increasing the headnode size isn't desired, you can also use edge nodes to deploy HiveServer2. 

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on your usage, increasing the number of HiveServer2 may increase the number of connections to the Hive metastore. Also ensure your Azure SQL database is properly sized.

## Prerequisites

To use this guide, you need to understand the following article:
- [Use empty edge nodes on Apache Hadoop clusters in HDInsight](hdinsight-apps-use-edge-node.md)

## Install HiveServer2

In this section, you install an additional HiveServer2 onto your target hosts.

1. Open Ambari in your browser and click on your target host.

3. Confirm and the process runs. Repeat 1-3 for all desired hosts.

4. When you have finished installing, restart all services with stale configs and start HiveServer2.
