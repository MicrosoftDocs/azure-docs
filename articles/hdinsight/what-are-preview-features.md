# What are preview features? 

This article describes what preview features are, what limitations apply to them, and how to identify them. 

Preview features are features that aren't complete but are made available on a **preview** basis so that customers can get early access and provide feedback. 

Preview features come with some disclaimers. Preview features:

* Are subject to separate [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://www.microsoft.com/business-applications/legal/supp-powerplatform-preview/).

* Aren't meant for production use.

* Aren't supported by Microsoft Support for production use. Microsoft Support is, however, eager to get your feedback on the preview functionality, and might provide best-effort support in certain cases. 

* May have limited or restricted functionality.

* May not be available in all geographic areas.

## How to identify a preview feature

These features have a **Preview** label in the documentation.
