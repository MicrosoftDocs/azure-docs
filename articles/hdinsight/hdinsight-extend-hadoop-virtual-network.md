# Extend HDInsight capabilities by using Azure Virtual Network
Azure Virtual Network allows you to extend your Hadoop solutions to incorporate on-premises resources such as SQL Server. It also allows you to combine multiple HDInsight cluster types, or to create secure private networks between resources in the cloud.

## Prerequisites

* Azure CLI 2.0: For more information, see [Install and Configure Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-az-cli2).

* Azure PowerShell: For more information, see [Install and Configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs).

> [!NOTE]
> The steps in this document require the latest version of the Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell. If you are using an older version, the commands may be different. For best results, use the previous links to install the latest versions.

## <a id="whatis"></a>What is Azure Virtual Network?

[Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/virtual-network/) allows you to create a secure, persistent network containing the resources you need for your solution. A virtual network allows you to:

* Connect cloud resources together in a private network (cloud-only).
  
    ![diagram of cloud-only configuration](media/hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network/cloud-only.png)
  
    Using Virtual Network to link Azure services with Azure HDInsight enables the following scenarios:
  
    * **Invoking HDInsight services or jobs** from Azure websites or services running in Azure virtual machines.
    * **Directly transferring data** between HDInsight and Azure SQL Database, SQL Server, or another data storage solution running on a virtual machine.
    * **Combining multiple HDInsight servers** into a single solution. There are several types of HDInsight clusters, which correspond to the workload or technology that the cluster is tuned for. There is no supported method to create a cluster that combines multiple types, such as Storm and HBase on one cluster. Using a virtual network allows multiple clusters to directly communicate with each other.

* Connect your cloud resources to your local datacenter network (site-to-site or point-to-site) by using a virtual private network (VPN).
  
    Site-to-site configuration allows you to connect multiple resources in your datacenter to the Azure virtual network. The connectaion can be made using a hardware VPN device or the Routing and Remote Access service.
  
    ![diagram of site-to-site configuration](media/hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network/site-to-site.png)
  
    Point-to-site configuration allows you to connect a specific resource to the Azure virtual network by using software VPN.
  
    ![diagram of point-to-site configuration](media/hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network/point-to-site.png)
  
    Using Virtual Network to link the cloud and your datacenter enables similar scenarios to the cloud-only configuration. But instead of being limited to working with resources in the cloud, you can also work with resources in your datacenter.
  
    * **Directly transferring data** between HDInsight and your datacenter. An example is using Sqoop to transfer data to or from SQL Server or reading data generated by a line-of-business (LOB) application.
    * **Invoking HDInsight services or jobs** from an LOB application. An example is using HBase Java APIs to store and retrieve data from an HDInsight HBase cluster.

For more information on Virtual Network features, benefits, and capabilities, see the [Azure Virtual Network overview](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Create the Azure Virtual Network before provisioning an HDInsight cluster, then specify the network when creating the cluster. For more information, see [Virtual Network configuration tasks](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/virtual-network/).

## Virtual Network requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Creating an HDInsight cluster on a Virtual Network requires specific Virtual Network configurations, which are described in this section.

### Location-based Virtual networks

Azure HDInsight supports only location-based virtual networks, and does not currently work with virtual networks based on affinity group.

### Classic or v2 Virtual Network

Linux-based clusters require an Azure Resource Manager Virtual Network (Windows-based clusters require a Classic Virtual Network). If you do not have the correct type of network, it can not be selected when you create the cluster.

You can join the different network types, which allows you to access resources on an incompatible virtual network. Create the cluster in the network version that it requires, and it will be able to access resources in the other network since the two are joined. For more information on connecting classic and Resource Manager Virtual Networks, see [Connecting classic VNets to new VNets](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-connect-different-deployment-models-portal.md).

### Custom DNS

When creating a virtual network, Azure provides default name resolution for Azure services such as HDInsight that are installed in the network. However you may need to use your own Domain Name System (DNS) for situations such as cross network domain name resolution. For example, when communicating between services located in two joined virtual networks. HDInsight supports both the default Azure name resolution and custom DNS when used with Azure Virtual Network.

For more information on using a custom DNS server, see the [Name Resolution for VMs and Role Instances](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md#name-resolution-using-your-own-dns-server) document.

### Secured Virtual Networks

The HDInsight service is a managed service, and requires Internet access during provisioning and while running. The Internet connectivity is used by Azure to:

* Monitor the health of the cluster
* Initiate failover of cluster resources
* Change the number of nodes in the cluster through scaling operations
* Other management tasks

These operations do not require full access to the Iternet. When restricting Internet access, allow inbound access on port 443 for the following IP addresses. This allows Azure to manage HDInsight:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The IP addresses that should be allowed are specific to the region that the HDInsight cluster and Virtual Network reside in. Use the following to find the IP addresses for the region you are using.

__Brazil South__ region:

* 191.235.84.104
* 191.235.87.113

__Canada East__ region:

* 52.229.127.96
* 52.229.123.172

__Canada Central__ region:

* 52.228.37.66
* 52.228.45.222

__Central India__ region:

* 52.172.153.209
* 52.172.152.49

__West Central US__ region:

* 52.161.23.15
* 52.161.10.167

__West US 2__ region:

* 52.175.211.210
* 52.175.222.222

__All other regions__:

* 168.61.49.99
* 23.99.5.239
* 168.61.48.131
* 138.91.141.162

Allowing inbound access from port 443 for these addresses will allow you to successfully install HDInsight into a secured virtual network.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> HDInsight doesn't support restricting outbound traffic, only inbound traffic. When defining Network Security Group rules for the subnet that contains HDInsight, only use inbound rules.

The following examples demonstrate how to create a Network Security Group that allows required addresses, and applies the security group to a subnet within your Virtual Network. Modify the IP addresses used in this example to match the Azure region you are using.

These steps assume that you have already created a Virtual Network and subnet that you want to install HDInsight into. See [Create a virtual network using the Azure portal](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-create-vnet-arm-pportal.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note the `priority` value used in these examples. Rules are tested against network traffic in order by priority. Once a rule matches the test criteria and is applied, no more rules are tested.
> 
> If you have custom rules that broadly block inbound traffic (such as a **deny all** rule), you may need to adjust the priority values in these examples. The rules in the examples need to occur before rules that block access. Otherwise, the **deny all** rule are tested first and the rules in this example are never applied. You must not block the default rules for an Azure Virtual Network. For example, you should not create a **deny all** rule that is applied before the default **ALLOW VNET INBOUND** rule (which has a priority of 65000.)
> 
> For more information on Network Security Group rules, see [What is a Network Security Group?](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg.md).

**Using Azure Resource Management template**

Using the following Resource Management template from the [Azure QuickStart Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/) to create an HDInsight cluster in a VNet with the secure network configurations:

[Deploy a secured Azure VNet and an HDInsight Hadoop cluster within the VNet](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-hdinsight-secure-vnet/)

**Using Azure PowerShell**

    $vnetName = "Replace with your virtual network name"
    $resourceGroupName = "Replace with the resource group the virtual network is in"
    $subnetName = "Replace with the name of the subnet that HDInsight will be installed into"
    # Get the Virtual Network object
    $vnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetwork `

    # Get the subnet object
    $subnet = $vnet.Subnets | Where-Object Name -eq $subnetName
    # Create a new Network Security Group.
    # And add exemptions for the HDInsight health and management services.

        -VirtualNetwork $vnet `
        -Name $subnetName `
        -AddressPrefix $subnet.AddressPrefix `
        -NetworkSecurityGroup $nsg

**Using the Azure CLI**

1. Use the following command to create a new network security group named `hdisecure`. Replace **RESOURCEGROUPNAME** with the resource group that contains the Azure Virtual Network. Replace **LOCATION** with the location (region,) that the group was created in.
   
        az network nsg create -g RESOURCEGROUPNAME -n hdisecure -l LOCATION

    Once the group has been created, you receive information on the new group.

2. Use the following to add rules to the new network security group that allow inbound communication on port 443 from the Azure HDInsight health and management service. Replace **RESOURCEGROUPNAME** with the name of the resource group that contains the Azure Virtual Network.
    
        az network nsg rule create -g RESOURCEGROUPNAME --nsg-name hdisecure -n hdirule1 --protocol "*" --source-port-range "*" --destination-port-range "443" --source-address-prefix "168.61.49.99/24" --destination-address-prefix "VirtualNetwork" --access "Allow" --priority 300 --direction "Inbound"
        az network nsg rule create -g RESOURCEGROUPNAME --nsg-name hdisecure -n hdirule2 --protocol "*" --source-port-range "*" --destination-port-range "443" --source-address-prefix "23.99.5.239/24" --destination-address-prefix "VirtualNetwork" --access "Allow" --priority 301 --direction "Inbound"
        az network nsg rule create -g RESOURCEGROUPNAME --nsg-name hdisecure -n hdirule3 --protocol "*" --source-port-range "*" --destination-port-range "443" --source-address-prefix "168.61.48.131/24" --destination-address-prefix "VirtualNetwork" --access "Allow" --priority 302 --direction "Inbound"
        az network nsg rule create -g RESOURCEGROUPNAME --nsg-name hdisecure -n hdirule4 --protocol "*" --source-port-range "*" --destination-port-range "443" --source-address-prefix "138.91.141.162/24" --destination-address-prefix "VirtualNetwork" --access "Allow" --priority 303 --direction "Inbound"

3. Once the rules have been created, use the following to retrieve the unique identifier for this network security group:

        az network nsg show -g RESOURCEGROUPNAME -n hdisecure --query 'id'

    This command returns a value similar to the following text:

        "/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTIONID/resourceGroups/RESOURCEGROUPNAME/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/hdisecure"

    Use double-quotes around id in the command if you don't get the expected results.

4. Using the following command to apply the network security group to a subnet. Replace the __GUID__ and __RESOURCEGROUPNAME__ values with the ones returned from the previous step. Replace __VNETNAME__ and __SUBNETNAME__ with the virtual network name and subnet name that you want to use when creating an HDInsight cluster.
   
        az network vnet subnet update -g RESOURCEGROUPNAME --vnet-name VNETNAME --name SUBNETNAME --set networkSecurityGroup.id="/subscriptions/GUID/resourceGroups/RESOURCEGROUPNAME/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/hdisecure"
   
    Once this command completes, you can successfully install HDInsight into the secured Virtual Network on the subnet used in these steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using the preceding steps only open access to the HDInsight health and management service on the Azure cloud. Any other access to the HDInsight cluster from outside the Virtual Network is blocked. You need to add additional Network Security Group rules if you wish to enable access from outside the Virtual Network.
> 
> The following example demonstrates how to enable SSH access from the Internet: 
> 
> * Azure PowerShell - ```Add-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name "SSSH" -Description "SSH" -Protocol "*" -SourcePortRange "*" -DestinationPortRange "22" -SourceAddressPrefix "*" -DestinationAddressPrefix "VirtualNetwork" -Access Allow -Priority 304 -Direction Inbound```
> * Azure CLI - ```az network nsg rule create -g RESOURCEGROUPNAME --nsg-name hdisecure -n hdirule5 --protocol "*" --source-port-range "*" --destination-port-range "22" --source-address-prefix "*" --destination-address-prefix "VirtualNetwork" --access "Allow" --priority 304 --direction "Inbound"```

For more information on Network Security Groups, see [Network Security Groups overview](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg.md). For information on controlling routing in an Azure Virtual Network, see [User-defined Routes and IP forwarding](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview.md).

## <a id="tasks"></a>Tasks and information

This section contains information on common tasks and information you may need when using HDInsight with a virtual network.

### Determine the FQDN

The HDInsight cluster is assigned a specific fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the Virtual Network interface. The FQDN is the address that you should use when connecting to the cluster from other Azure resources in the virtual network. To determine the FQDN, use the following to URL to query the Ambari management service:

    https://<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/ambari/api/v1/clusters/<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/services/<servicename>/components/<componentname>

You use the cluster name and a service and component running on the cluster, such as the YARN resource manager.

> [!NOTE]
> The data returned is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document. To extract just the FQDN, you should use a JSON parser to retrieve the `host_components[0].HostRoles.host_name` value.

For example, to return the FQDN from an HDInsight Hadoop cluster, you can use one of the following methods to retrieve the data for the YARN resource manager:

* [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs)
  
        $ClusterDnsName = <clustername>
        $Username = <cluster admin username>
        $Password = <cluster admin password>
        $DnsSuffix = ".azurehdinsight.net"
        $ClusterFQDN = $ClusterDnsName + $DnsSuffix
  
        $webclient = new-object System.Net.WebClient
        $webclient.Credentials = new-object System.Net.NetworkCredential($Username, $Password)
  
        $Url = "https://" + $ClusterFQDN + "/ambari/api/v1/clusters/" + $ClusterFQDN + "/services/yarn/        components/resourcemanager"
        $Response = $webclient.DownloadString($Url)
        $JsonObject = $Response | ConvertFrom-Json
        $FQDN = $JsonObject.host_components[0].HostRoles.host_name
        Write-host $FQDN

* [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) and [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
  
        curl -G -u <username>:<password> https://<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/ambari/api/v1/clusters/<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/services/yarn/components/resourcemanager | jq .host_components[0].HostRoles.host_name

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have restricted internet access to the cluster, you cannot use Ambari over the Internet. Instead, you must use one of the following methods to retrieve the FQDN:
>
> * Azure PowerShell: `Get-AzureRmNetworkInterface -ResourceGroupName GROUPNAME | Foreach-object { Write-Output $_.DnsSettings.InternalFqdn }`
> * Azure CLI 2.0: ` az network nic list --resource-group GROUPNAME --query '[].dnsSettings.internalFqdn'`
>
> In both examples, replace __GROUPNAME__ with the resource group name that contains the Virtual Network.

### Connecting to HBase

To connect to HBase remotely by using the Java API, you must determine the ZooKeeper quorum addresses for the HBase cluster and specify the quorum information in your application.

To get the ZooKeeper quorum address, use one of the following methods to query the Ambari management service:

* [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs)
  
        $ClusterDnsName = <clustername>
        $Username = <cluster admin username>
        $Password = <cluster admin password>
        $DnsSuffix = ".azurehdinsight.net"
        $ClusterFQDN = $ClusterDnsName + $DnsSuffix
  
        $webclient = new-object System.Net.WebClient
        $webclient.Credentials = new-object System.Net.NetworkCredential($Username, $Password)
  
        $Url = "https://" + $ClusterFQDN + "/ambari/api/v1/clusters/" + $ClusterFQDN + "/configurations?type=hbase-site&tag=default&fields=items/properties/hbase.zookeeper.quorum"
        $Response = $webclient.DownloadString($Url)
        $JsonObject = $Response | ConvertFrom-Json
        Write-host $JsonObject.items[0].properties.'hbase.zookeeper.quorum'

* [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) and [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
  
        curl -G -u <username>:<password> "https://<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/ambari/api/v1/clusters/<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/configurations?type=hbase-site&tag=default&fields=items/properties/hbase.zookeeper.quorum" | jq .items[0].properties[]

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on using Ambari with HDInsight, see [Monitor Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using the Ambari API](hdinsight-monitor-use-ambari-api.md).

Once you have the quorum information, use it in your client application.

For example, for a Java application that uses the HBase API, you would add an **hbase-site.xml** file to the project and specify the quorum information in the file as follows:

```xml
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>zookeeper0.address,zookeeper1.address,zookeeper2.address</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort</name>
    <value>2181</value>
  </property>
</configuration>
```

### Verify network connectivity

Some services, such as SQL Server, can limit incoming network connections. If you encounter problems accessing a service from HDInsight, consult the documentation for the service to ensure that you have enabled network access. You can also verify network access by creating an Azure virtual machine on the same virtual network. Then use client utilities on the virtual machine to verify that the virtual machine can connect to the service over the virtual network.
