# Unable to download large data sets using JDBC/ODBC and Apache Thrift software framework in HDInsight

This article describes troubleshooting steps and possible resolutions for issues when using Apache Spark components in Azure HDInsight clusters.

## Issue

When trying to download large data sets using JDBC/ODBC and the Apache Thrift software framework in Azure HDInsight, you receive an error message similar as follows:

```
org.apache.spark.SparkException: Kryo serialization failed:
Buffer overflow. Available: 0, required: 36518. To avoid this, increase spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max value.
```

## Cause

This exception is caused by the serialization process trying to use more buffer space than is allowed. In Spark 2.0.0, the class `org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer` is used for serializing objects when data is accessed through the Apache Thrift software framework. A different class is used for data that will be sent over the network or cached in serialized form.

## Resolution

Increase the `Kryoserializer` buffer value. Add a key named `spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max` and set it to `2047` in spark2 config under `Custom spark2-thrift-sparkconf`. Restart all affected components.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The value for `spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max` must be less than 2048. Fractional values are not supported.
