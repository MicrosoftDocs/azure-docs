# Debug WASB file operations in Azure HDInsight

There are times when you may want to understand what operations the WASB driver started with Azure Storage. For the client side, the WASB driver produces logs for each file system operation at **DEBUG** level. WASB driver uses log4j to control logging level and the default is **INFO** level. For Azure Storage server-side analytics logs, see [Azure Storage analytics logging](../../storage/common/storage-analytics-logging.md).

A produced log looks similar to:

```log
18/05/13 04:15:55 DEBUG NativeAzureFileSystem: Moving wasb://xxx@yyy.blob.core.windows.net/user/livy/ulysses.txt/_temporary/0/_temporary/attempt_20180513041552_0000_m_000000_0/part-00000 to wasb://xxx@yyy.blob.core.windows.net/user/livy/ulysses.txt/part-00000
```

## Turn on WASB debug log for file operations

1. From a web browser, navigate to `https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/#/main/services/SPARK2/configs`, where `CLUSTERNAME` is the name of your Spark cluster.

1. Navigate to **advanced spark2-log4j-properties**.

    1. Modify `log4j.appender.console.Threshold=INFO` to `log4j.appender.console.Threshold=DEBUG`.

    1. Add `log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop.fs.azure.NativeAzureFileSystem=DEBUG`.

1. Navigate to **Advanced livy2-log4j-properties**.

    Add `log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop.fs.azure.NativeAzureFileSystem=DEBUG`.

1. Save changes.

## Additional logging

The above logs should provide high-level understanding of the file system operations. If the above logs are still not providing useful information, or if you want to investigate blob storage api calls, add `fs.azure.storage.client.logging=true` to the `core-site`. This setting enables the Java SDK logs for wasb storage driver and print each call to blob storage server. Remove the setting after investigations because it could fill up the disk quickly and could slow down the process.

If the backend is Azure Data Lake based, then use the following log4j setting for the component(for example, spark/tez/hdfs):

```
log4j.logger.com.microsoft.azure.datalake.store=ALL,adlsFile
log4j.additivity.com.microsoft.azure.datalake.store=true
log4j.appender.adlsFile=org.apache.log4j.FileAppender
log4j.appender.adlsFile.File=/var/log/adl/adl.log
log4j.appender.adlsFile.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.adlsFile.layout.ConversionPattern=%p\t%d{ISO8601}\t%r\t%c\t[%t]\t%m%n
```

Look for the logs in `/var/log/adl/adl.log` for the logs.
