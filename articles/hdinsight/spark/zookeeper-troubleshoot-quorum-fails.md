# Apache ZooKeeper server fails to form a quorum in Azure HDInsight

This article describes troubleshooting steps and possible resolutions for issues related to Zookeepers in Azure HDInsight clusters.

## Symptoms

* Both the resource managers go to standby mode
* Name nodes are both in standby mode
* Spark, Hive, and Yarn jobs or Hive queries fail because of Zookeeper connection failures
* LLAP daemons fail to start on secure Spark or secure interactive Hive clusters

## Sample log

You may see an error message similar to the yarn logs (/var/log/hadoop-yarn/yarn/yarn-yarn*.log on the headnodes):

```output
2020-05-05 03:17:18.3916720|Lost contact with Zookeeper. Transitioning to standby in 10000 ms if connection is not reestablished.
Message
2020-05-05 03:17:07.7924490|Received RMFatalEvent of type STATE_STORE_FENCED, caused by org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException$NoAuthException: KeeperErrorCode = NoAuth
...
2020-05-05 03:17:08.3890350|State store operation failed 
2020-05-05 03:17:08.3890350|Transitioning to standby state
```

## Related issues

* High availability services like Yarn, Name Node, and Livy can go down for many reasons.
* Confirm from the logs that it's related to Zookeeper connections
* Make sure that the issue happens repeatedly (don't use these solutions for one off cases)
* Jobs can fail temporarily due to Zookeeper connection issues

## Common causes for Zookeeper failure

* High CPU usage on the zookeeper servers
  * In the Ambari UI, if you see near 100% sustained CPU usage on the zookeeper servers, then the zookeeper sessions open during that time can expire and time out
* Zookeeper clients are reporting frequent timeouts
  * In the logs for Resource Manager, Name node and others, you see frequent client connection timeouts
  * This could result in quorum loss, frequent failovers, and other issues

## Check for zookeeper status

* Find the zookeeper servers from the /etc/hosts file or from Ambari UI
* Run the following command
  * `echo stat | nc <ZOOKEEPER_HOST_IP> 2181` (or 2182)  
  * Port 2181 is the apache zookeeper instance
  * Port 2182 is used by the HDInsight zookeeper (to provide HA for services that aren't natively HA)
  * If the command shows no output, then it means that the zookeeper servers aren't running
  * If the servers are running, the result includes statics of client connections and other statistics

## CPU load peaks up every hour

* Log in to the zookeeper server and check the /etc/crontab
* If there are any hourly jobs running at this time, randomize the start time across different zookeeper servers.
  
## Purging old snapshots

* Zookeepers are configured to auto purge old snapshots
* By default, the last 30 snapshots are retained
* The number of snapshots that are retained, controlled by the configuration key `autopurge.snapRetainCount`. This property can be found in the following files:
  * `/etc/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg` for Hadoop zookeeper
  * `/etc/hdinsight-zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg` for HDInsight zookeeper
* Set `autopurge.snapRetainCount` to a value of 3 and restart the zookeeper servers
  * Hadoop zookeeper config can be updated and the service can be restarted through Ambari
  * Stop and restart HDInsight zookeeper manually
    * `sudo lsof -i :2182` gives you the process ID to kill
    * `sudo python /opt/startup_scripts/startup_hdinsight_zookeeper.py`
* Don't purge snapshots manually - deleting snapshots manually could result in data loss

## CancelledKeyException in the zookeeper server log doesn't require snapshot cleanup

* This exception is seen on the zookeeper servers (/var/log/zookeeper/zookeeper-zookeeper-* or /var/log/hdinsight-zookeeper/zookeeper* files)
* This exception usually means that the client is no longer active and the server is unable to send a message
* This exception also indicates that the zookeeper client is ending sessions prematurely
* Look for the other symptoms outlined in this document
