# Scenario: `hbase hbck` command returns inconsistencies in Azure HDInsight

This article describes troubleshooting steps and possible resolutions for issues when interacting with Azure HDInsight clusters. If you're using hbase-2.x, see [How to use Apache HBase HBCK2 tool](./how-to-use-hbck2-tool.md)

## Issue: Region isn't in `hbase:meta`

Region xxx on HDFS, but not listed in `hbase:meta` or deployed on any region server.

### Cause

Varies.

### Resolution

1. Fix the meta table by running:

    ```
    hbase hbck -ignorePreCheckPermission –fixMeta
    ```

1. Assign regions to RegionServers by running:

    ```
    hbase hbck -ignorePreCheckPermission –fixAssignment
    ```

## Issue: Region is offline

Region xxx not deployed on any RegionServer. It means the region is in `hbase:meta`, but offline.

### Cause

Varies.

### Resolution

Bring regions online by running:

```
hbase hbck -ignorePreCheckPermission –fixAssignment
```

Alternatively, run `assign <region-hash>` on hbase-shell to force assign this region

## Issue: Regions have the same start/end keys

### Cause

Varies.

### Resolution

Manually merge those overlapped regions. Go to HBase HMaster Web UI table section, select the table link, which has the issue. You see start key/end key of each region belonging to that table. Then merge those overlapped regions. In HBase shell, do `merge_region 'xxxxxxxx','yyyyyyy', true`. For example:

```
RegionA, startkey:001, endkey:010,

RegionB, startkey:001, endkey:080,

RegionC, startkey:010, endkey:080.
```

In this scenario, you need to merge RegionA and RegionC and get RegionD with the same key range as RegionB, then merge RegionB and RegionD. `xxxxxxx` and `yyyyyy` are the hash string at the end of each region name. Be careful here not to merge two discontinuous regions. After each merge, like merge A and C, HBase will start a compaction on RegionD. Wait for the compaction to finish before doing another merge with RegionD. You can find the compaction status on that region server page in HBase HMaster UI.

## Issue: Can't load `.regioninfo`

Can't load `.regioninfo` for region `/hbase/data/default/tablex/regiony`.

### Cause

It's most likely due to region partial deletion when RegionServer crashes or VM reboots. Currently, the Azure Storage is a flat blob file system and some file operations aren't atomic.

### Resolution

Manually clean up these remaining files and folders:

1. Execute `hdfs dfs -ls /hbase/data/default/tablex/regiony` to check what folders/files are still under it.

1. Execute `hdfs dfs -rmr /hbase/data/default/tablex/regiony/filez` to delete all child files/folders

1. Execute `hdfs dfs -rmr /hbase/data/default/tablex/regiony` to delete the region folder.
