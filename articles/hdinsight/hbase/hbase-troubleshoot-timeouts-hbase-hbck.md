# Scenario: Timeouts with 'hbase hbck' command in Azure HDInsight

This article describes troubleshooting steps and possible resolutions for issues when interacting with Azure HDInsight clusters.

## Issue

Encounter timeouts with `hbase hbck` command when fixing region assignments.

## Cause

A potential cause for timeout issues when you use the `hbck` command might be that several regions are in the "in transition" state for a long time. You can see those regions as offline in the HBase Master UI. Because a high number of regions are attempting to transition, HBase Master might time out and be unable to bring those regions back online.

## Resolution

1. Sign in to the HDInsight HBase cluster using SSH.

1. Run `hbase zkcli` command to connect with Apache ZooKeeper shell.

1. Run `rmr /hbase/regions-in-transition` or `rmr /hbase-unsecure/regions-in-transition` command.

1. Exit from `hbase zkcli` shell by using `exit` command.

1. From the Apache Ambari UI, restart the Active HBase Master service.

1. Run the `hbase hbck -fixAssignments` command.

1. Monitor the HBase Master UI "region in transition" that section to make sure no region gets stuck.
