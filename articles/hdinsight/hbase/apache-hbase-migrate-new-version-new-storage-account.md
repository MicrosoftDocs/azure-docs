# Migrate Apache HBase to a new version and storage account

This article discusses how to update your Apache HBase cluster on Azure HDInsight to a newer version with a different Azure Storage account.

This article applies only if you need to use different Storage accounts for your source and destination clusters. To upgrade versions with the same Storage account for your source and destination clusters, see [Migrate Apache HBase to a new version](apache-hbase-migrate-new-version.md).

The downtime while upgrading should be only a few minutes. This downtime is caused by the steps to flush all in-memory data, and the time to configure and restart the services on the new cluster. Your results will vary, depending on the number of nodes, amount of data, and other variables.

## Review Apache HBase compatibility

Before upgrading Apache HBase, ensure the HBase versions on the source and destination clusters are compatible. Review the HBase version compatibility matrix and release notes in the [HBase Reference Guide](https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#upgrading) to make sure your application is compatible with the new version.

Here is an example compatibility matrix. Y indicates compatibility and N indicates a potential incompatibility:

| Compatibility type | Major version| Minor version | Patch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Client-Server wire compatibility | N | Y | Y |
| Server-Server compatibility | N | Y | Y |
| File format compatibility | N | Y | Y |
| Client API compatibility | N | Y | Y |
| Client binary compatibility | N | N | Y |
| **Server-side limited API compatibility** |  |  |  |
| Stable | N | Y | Y |
| Evolving | N | N | Y |
| Unstable | N | N | N |
| Dependency compatibility | N | Y | Y |
| Operational compatibility | N | N | Y |

The HBase version release notes should describe any breaking incompatibilities. Test your application in a cluster running the target version of HDInsight and HBase.

For more information about HDInsight versions and compatibility, see [Azure HDInsight versions](../hdinsight-component-versioning.md).

## Apache HBase cluster migration overview

To upgrade and migrate your Apache HBase cluster on Azure HDInsight to a new storage account, you complete the following basic steps. For detailed instructions, see the detailed steps and commands.

Prepare the source cluster:
1. Stop data ingestion.
1. Flush `memstore` data.
1. Stop HBase from Ambari.
1. For clusters with accelerated writes, back up the Write Ahead Log (WAL) directory.

Prepare the destination cluster:
1. Create the destination cluster.
1. Stop HBase from Ambari.
1. Clean Zookeeper data.
1. Switch user to HBase.

Complete the migration:
1. Clean the destination file system, migrate the data, and remove `/hbase/hbase.id`.
1. Clean and migrate the WAL.
1. Start all services from the Ambari destination cluster.
1. Verify HBase.
1. Delete the source cluster.

## Detailed migration steps and commands

Use these detailed steps and commands to migrate your Apache HBase cluster with a new storage account.

### Prepare the source cluster

1. Stop ingestion to the source HBase cluster.
   
1. Flush the source HBase cluster you're upgrading.
   
   HBase writes incoming data to an in-memory store called a `memstore`. After the `memstore` reaches a certain size, HBase flushes it to disk for long-term storage in the cluster's storage account. Deleting the source cluster after an upgrade also deletes any data in the `memstores`. To retain the data, manually flush each table's `memstore` to disk before upgrading.
   
   You can flush the `memstore` data by running the [flush_all_tables.sh](https://github.com/Azure/hbase-utils/blob/master/scripts/flush_all_tables.sh) script from the [hbase-utils GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/hbase-utils/).
   
   You can also flush the `memstore` data by running the following HBase shell command from inside the HDInsight cluster:
   
   ```bash
   hbase shell
   flush "<table-name>"
   ```
   
1. Sign in to [Apache Ambari](https://ambari.apache.org/) on the source cluster with `https://<OLDCLUSTERNAME>.azurehdinsight.net`, and stop the HBase services.
   
1. At the confirmation prompt, select the box to turn on maintenance mode for HBase.
   
   For more information on connecting to and using Ambari, see [Manage HDInsight clusters by using the Ambari Web UI](../hdinsight-hadoop-manage-ambari.md).
   
1. If your source HBase cluster doesn't have the [Accelerated Writes](apache-hbase-accelerated-writes.md) feature, skip this step. For source HBase clusters with Accelerated Writes, back up the WAL directory under HDFS by running the following commands from an SSH session on any source cluster Zookeeper node or worker node.
   
   ```bash
   hdfs dfs -mkdir /hbase-wal-backup
   hdfs dfs -cp hdfs://mycluster/hbasewal /hbase-wal-backup
   ```

### Prepare the destination cluster

1. In the Azure portal, [set up a new destination HDInsight cluster](../hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters.md) that uses a different storage account than your source cluster.
   
1. Sign in to [Apache Ambari](https://ambari.apache.org/) on the new cluster at `https://<NEWCLUSTERNAME>.azurehdinsight.net`, and stop the HBase services.
   
1. Clean the Zookeeper data on the destination cluster by running the following commands in any Zookeeper node or worker node:
   
   ```bash
   hbase zkcli
   rmr /hbase-unsecure
   quit
   ```
   
1. Switch the user to HBase by running `sudo su hbase`.

### Clean and migrate the file system and WAL

Run the following commands, depending on your source HDI version and whether the source and destination clusters have Accelerated Writes. The destination cluster is always HDI version 4.0, since HDI 3.6 is in Basic support and isn't recommended for new clusters.

- [The source cluster is HDI 3.6 with Accelerated Writes, and the destination cluster has Accelerated Writes](#the-source-cluster-is-hdi-36-or-hdi-40-with-accelerated-writes-and-the-destination-cluster-has-accelerated-writes).
- [The source cluster is HDI 3.6 without Accelerated Writes, and the destination cluster has Accelerated Writes](#the-source-cluster-is-hdi-36-without-accelerated-writes-and-the-destination-cluster-has-accelerated-writes).
- [The source cluster is HDI 3.6 without Accelerated Writes, and the destination cluster doesn't have Accelerated Writes](#the-source-cluster-is-hdi-36-without-accelerated-writes-and-the-destination-cluster-doesnt-have-accelerated-writes).
- [The source cluster is HDI 4.0 with Accelerated Writes, and the destination cluster has Accelerated Writes](#the-source-cluster-is-hdi-36-or-hdi-40-with-accelerated-writes-and-the-destination-cluster-has-accelerated-writes).
- [The source cluster is HDI 4.0 without Accelerated Writes, and the destination cluster has Accelerated Writes](#the-source-cluster-is-hdi-40-without-accelerated-writes-and-the-destination-cluster-has-accelerated-writes).
- [The source cluster is HDI 4.0 without Accelerated Writes, and the destination cluster doesn't have Accelerated Writes](#the-source-cluster-is-hdi-40-without-accelerated-writes-and-the-destination-cluster-doesnt-have-accelerated-writes).

The `<container-endpoint-url>` for the storage account is `https://<storageaccount>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>`. Pass the SAS token for the storage account at the very end of the URL.

- The `<container-fullpath>` for storage type WASB is `wasbs://<container-name>@<storageaccount>.blob.core.windows.net`
- The `<container-fullpath>` for storage type Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is `abfs://<container-name>@<storageaccount>.dfs.core.windows.net`.

#### Copy commands

The HDFS copy command is `hdfs dfs <copy properties starting with -D> -cp`
 
Use `hadoop distcp` for better performance when copying files not in a page blob: `hadoop distcp <copy properties starting with -D>`
 
To pass the key of the storage account, use:
- `-Dfs.azure.account.key.<storageaccount>.blob.core.windows.net='<storage account key>'`
- `-Dfs.azure.account.keyprovider.<storageaccount>.blob.core.windows.net=org.apache.hadoop.fs.azure.SimpleKeyProvider`

You can also use [AzCopy](../../storage/common/storage-ref-azcopy.md) for better performance when copying HBase data files.
   
1. Run the AzCopy command:
   
   ```bash
   azcopy cp "<source-container-endpoint-url>/hbase" "<target-container-endpoint-url>" --recursive
   ```

1. If the destination storage account is Azure Blob storage, do this step after the copy. If the destination storage account is Data Lake Storage Gen2, skip this step.
   
   The Hadoop WASB driver uses special 0-sized blobs corresponding to every directory. AzCopy skips these files when doing the copy. Some WASB operations use these blobs, so you must create them in the destination cluster. To create the blobs, run the following Hadoop command from any node in the destination cluster:
   
   ```bash
   sudo -u hbase hadoop fs -chmod -R 0755 /hbase
   ```

You can download AzCopy from [Get started with AzCopy](../../storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10.md). For more information about using AzCopy, see [azcopy copy](../../storage/common/storage-ref-azcopy-copy.md).

### Complete the migration

1. On the destination cluster, save your changes and restart all required services as indicated by Ambari.
   
1. Point your application to the destination cluster.
   
   > [!NOTE]  
   > The static DNS name for your application changes when you upgrade. Rather than hard-coding this DNS name, you can configure a CNAME in your domain name's DNS settings that points to the cluster's name. Another option is to use a configuration file for your application that you can update without redeploying.
   
1. Start the ingestion.
   
1. Verify HBase consistency and simple Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations.
   
1. If the destination cluster is satisfactory, delete the source cluster.
