# Use Azure Monitor logs to monitor HDInsight clusters

Learn how to enable Azure Monitor logs to monitor Hadoop cluster operations in HDInsight, and how to add an HDInisght monitoring solution.

[Azure Monitor logs](../log-analytics/log-analytics-overview.md) is a service in Azure Monitor that monitors your cloud and on-premises environments to maintain their availability and performance. It collects data generated by resources in your cloud and on-premises environments and from other monitoring tools to provide analysis across multiple sources.

[!INCLUDE [azure-monitor-log-analytics-rebrand](../../includes/azure-monitor-log-analytics-rebrand.md)]

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

* **A Log Analytics workspace**. You can think of this workspace as a unique Azure Monitor logs environment with its own data repository, data sources, and solutions. For the instructions, see [Create a Log Analytics workspace](../azure-monitor/learn/quick-collect-azurevm.md#create-a-workspace).

* **An Azure HDInsight cluster**. Currently, you can use Azure Monitor logs with the following HDInsight cluster types:

  * Hadoop
  * HBase
  * Interactive Query
  * Kafka
  * Spark
  * Storm

  For the instructions on how to create an HDInsight cluster, see [Get started with Azure HDInsight](hadoop/apache-hadoop-linux-tutorial-get-started.md).  

* **Azure PowerShell Az module**.  See [Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az).

> [!NOTE]  
> It is recommended to place both the HDInsight cluster and the Log Analytics workspace in the same region for better performance. Azure Monitor logs is not available in all Azure regions.

## Enable Azure Monitor logs by using the portal

In this section, you configure an existing HDInsight Hadoop cluster to use an Azure Log Analytics workspace to monitor jobs, debug logs, etc.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. From the left menu, select **All services**.

3. Under **ANALYTICS**, select **HDInsight clusters**.

4. Select your cluster from the list.

5. From the left, under **Monitoring**, select **Operations Management Suite**.

6. From the main view, under **OMS Monitoring**, select **Enable**.

7. From the **Select a workspace** drop-down list, select an existing Log Analytics workspace.

8. Select **Save**.  It takes a few moments to save the setting.

## Enable Azure Monitor logs by using Azure PowerShell

You can enable Azure Monitor logs using the Azure PowerShell Az module [Enable-AzHDInsightOperationsManagementSuite](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.hdinsight/enable-azhdinsightoperationsmanagementsuite) cmdlet.

```powershell
# Enter user information
$resourceGroup = "<your-resource-group>"
$cluster = "<your-cluster>"
$LAW = "<your-Log-Analytics-workspace>"
# End of user input

# obtain workspace id for defined Log Analytics workspace
$WorkspaceId = (Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name $LAW).CustomerId

# obtain primary key for defined Log Analytics workspace
$PrimaryKey = (Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name $LAW | Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspaceSharedKeys).PrimarySharedKey

# Enables Operations Management Suite
Enable-AzHDInsightOperationsManagementSuite -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name $cluster -WorkspaceId $WorkspaceId -PrimaryKey $PrimaryKey
```

To disable, the use the [Disable-AzHDInsightOperationsManagementSuite](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.hdinsight/disable-azhdinsightoperationsmanagementsuite) cmdlet:

```powershell
Disable-AzHDInsightOperationsManagementSuite -Name "<your-cluster>"
```

## Install HDInsight cluster management solutions

HDInsight provides cluster-specific management solutions that you can add for Azure Monitor logs. [Management solutions](../log-analytics/log-analytics-add-solutions.md) add functionality to Azure Monitor logs, providing additional data and analysis tools. These solutions collect important performance metrics from your HDInsight clusters and provide the tools to search the metrics. These solutions also provide visualizations and dashboards for most cluster types supported in HDInsight. By using the metrics that you collect with the solution, you can create custom monitoring rules and alerts.

These are the available HDInsight solutions:

* HDInsight Hadoop Monitoring
* HDInsight HBase Monitoring
* HDInsight Interactive Query Monitoring
* HDInsight Kafka Monitoring
* HDInsight Spark Monitoring
* HDInsight Storm Monitoring

For the instructions to install a management solution, see [Management solutions in Azure](../azure-monitor/insights/solutions.md#install-a-monitoring-solution). To experiment, install a HDInsight Hadoop Monitoring solution. When it is done, you see an **HDInsightHadoop** tile listed under **Summary**. Select the **HDInsightHadoop** tile. The HDInsightHadoop solution looks like:

Because the cluster is a brand new cluster, the report doesn't show any activities.
