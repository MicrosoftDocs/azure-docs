# Configure Azure Blob Storage as primary storage account in Azure HDInsight

Learn how to use managed identities to authenticate Blob storage while configuring primary storage during HDInsight cluster creation.  

## Enable Managed Identity using Azure portal

1. Select **Primary storage** type from the dropdown list.

1. Choose the Selection method as **Select from list**.

1. Click **Enable Managed Identity** to authenticate for HDInsight cluster creation. 

1. Select the **Managed Identity** from the dropdown list.

1. Click on **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/configure-azure-blob-storage/basic-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the basic tab." border="true" lightbox="./media/configure-azure-blob-storage/basic-tab.png":::

1. On the Security & Networking tab, select **User assigned managed identity** as the same Managed Identity which during cluster creation in the Basic tab.

## Use ARM template  

You can use managed identities to authenticate Azure blob storage by using ARM template while you create HDInsight cluster. 

Same thing can be achieved via ARM request if that is how you want to create HDInsight cluster. 

1. Earlier for Azure Storage based clusters, you would provide storage key for the Azure Storage Account in  

    ```
    properties -> storageProfile -> storageaccounts -> key
    ```

1. Field of the arm request and following field would remain null 

    ```
    properties -> storageProfile -> storageaccounts -> msiResourceId 
    ```
1. To set the key as null, and `msiResourceId` as full path of the MSI you want to use. 

    ```
    /subscriptions/test-subscription/resourcegroups/test-rg/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/test-msi 
    ```
1. Add one more field in the ARM request which would otherwise be null, which is  

    `identity`

1. The content should have following fields.

    ```
    { 

    "type": "UserAssigned", 

    "userAssignedIdentities": { 

    "<full path of the MSI>": {} 

    } 
    ```
1. For Example, 

    ```
    { 

    "type": "UserAssigned", 

    "userAssignedIdentities": { 

      "/subscriptions/test-subscription/resourcegroups/test-rg/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/test-msi": {} 

     } 

    } 
    ```  

## MSI based Script Action using primary Azure Blob Storage storage 

Previously while adding the primary storage as Azure Blob Storage storage in the Azure HDInsight cluster, you can't provide MSI for authentication. 
Also to access a script action that isn't accessible anonymously, you need to mention the SAS Key in the script action parameters, so the Azure HDInsight Cluster can access the script for execution.

Now, you can add Azure Blob Storage storage in Azure HDInsight cluster as a primary storage using MSI. 

Hence there's no need to provide the SAS key in the script action parameters, while adding the script action, if the script uploaded to the  primary Azure Blob Storage storage account. 

The script is downloaded and implemented. This will work even if the script isn't publicly accessible. 

The new feature specifically supports scripts that aren't publicly accessible but don't require a SAS key or token. This provides an additional layer of security for scripts that need to be kept private. 

The traditional script action, whether accessed anonymously or with a SAS key included in the script URI, continues to function without any modifications. For more information, see [Customize Azure HDInsight clusters by using script actions](./hdinsight-hadoop-customize-cluster-linux.md). 

## Configure Azure Blob storage as secondary storage

**Access Key as authentication**
 
Use access keys to authenticate Azure blob storage while configuring it as secondary storage during HDInsight cluster creation.

Learn how to use access keys to authenticate Blob storage while configuring secondary storage during HDInsight cluster creation.  

> [!NOTE]
> If the primary storage is already chosen as Blob storage, then same authentication mechanism may need to be chosen for secondary storage. (i.e. access key in this scenario).


1. Select `Additional Azure Storage` in the storage section in portal during HDInsight cluster creation. 
1. Choose the `Storage Account` from the drop-down. 
1. Select authentication mechanism as `Use access key`. 
1. Enter **Access key** details.
1. Click **Next**.

 **Managed Identity as authentication**

Use manage identities to authenticate Azure blob storage while configuring it as secondary storage during HDInsight cluster creation. 

> [!NOTE]
> If the primary storage is chosen as Blob storage, then same authentication mechanism may need to be chosen for secondary storage (i.e. managed identity in this scenario). Only one Managed identity can be used to authenticate both primary and secondary storages and the managed identity need to have sufficient access to secondary storage being selected. 

1. Configure Blob as secondary storage using Azure portal. 
1. Select **Additional Azure Storage** in the storage section in portal during HDInsight cluster creation. 
1. Choose the **Storage Account** from the drop-down. 
1. Select authentication mechanism as `Use managed identity`. 
1. Select the **managed identity** from the list. 
1. Click **Next**.
