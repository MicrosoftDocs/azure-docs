HDInsight uses safe deployment practices, which involve gradual region deployment. It might take up to 10 business days for a new release or a new version to be available in all regions.

**OS versions**

* HDInsight 5.1: Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS Linux Kernel 5.4
* HDInsight 5.0: Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS Linux Kernel 5.4
* HDInsight 4.0: Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS Linux Kernel 5.4

> [!NOTE]
> Ubuntu 18.04 is supported under [Extended Security Maintenance(ESM)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/linux-and-open-source-blog/canonical-ubuntu-18-04-lts-reaching-end-of-standard-support/ba-p/3822623) by the Azure Linux team for [Azure HDInsight July 2023](/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-release-notes-archive#release-date-july-25-2023), release onwards. 

For workload specific versions, see [HDInsight 5.x component versions](./hdinsight-5x-component-versioning.md).

## Issues fixed

* Managed identity-based authentication for WASB encounters issues when network ACL is enabled on storage.
* Managed identity-based authentication for SQL databases encounters issues when availability zones are used.
* Multiple security fixes.

## Updates

* Active PIN requests for creating HDInsight clusters with predetermined image versions will be revoked/cancelled on 26 May 2025. Beyond this date, customers will only be able to create clusters using the updated (compliant) images of each HDInsight version. This measure is intended to improve cluster security and prevent potential issues with clusters and gateway nodes. 

## Reminder

* HDInsight service transitioned to use standard load balancers for all its cluster configurations due to [deprecation announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-basic-load-balancer-will-be-retired-on-30-september-2025-upgrade-to-standard-load-balancer#main) of Azure basic load balancer.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > By default, creation of any new HDInsight cluster happens with Standard Load Balancers. We recommend referring to the [migration guide to recreate the cluster](./load-balancer-migration-guidelines.md).
  > For any assistance, contact [support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview).

* [Basic and Standard A-series VMs Retirement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/basic-and-standard-aseries-vms-on-hdinsight-will-retire-on-31-august-2024/).
   * On August 31, 2024, we'll retire Basic and Standard A-series VMs. Before that date, you need to migrate your workloads to Av2-series VMs, which provide more memory per vCPU and faster storage on solid-state drives (SSDs).
   * To avoid service disruptions, [migrate your workloads](https://aka.ms/Av1retirement) from Basic and Standard A-series VMs to Av2-series VMs before August 31, 2024.
