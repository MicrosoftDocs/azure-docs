## Issues fixed

* Patched multiple OS-level vulnerabilities across dependencies (qs, braces,   connect, debug, etc.).

## Reminder

* HDInsight service has transitioned to use standard load balancers for all its cluster configurations due to [deprecation announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-basic-load-balancer-will-be-retired-on-30-september-2025-upgrade-to-standard-load-balancer#main) of Azure basic load balancer.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > By default, creation of any new HDInsight cluster happens with Standard Load Balancers. We recommend referring to the [migration guide to recreate the cluster](./load-balancer-migration-guidelines.md).
