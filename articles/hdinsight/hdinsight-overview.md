|Extensibility     |  You can extend the HDInsight clusters with installed components (Hue, Presto, and so on) by using script actions, by adding edge nodes, or by integrating with other [big data](#what-is-big-data) certified applications. HDInsight enables seamless integration with the most popular [big data](#what-is-big-data) solutions with a one-click deployment.|

### What is big data?

Big data is collected in escalating volumes, at higher velocities, and in a greater variety of formats than ever before. It can be historical (meaning stored) or real time (meaning streamed from the source). See [Scenarios for using HDInsight](#scenarios-for-using-hdinsight) to learn about the most common use cases for big data.

## Cluster types in HDInsight

HDInsight includes specific cluster types and cluster customization capabilities, such as the capability to add components, utilities, and languages. HDInsight offers the following cluster types:

|Cluster Type | Description | Get Started |
|---|---|---|
|[Apache Hadoop](./hadoop/apache-hadoop-introduction.md)|A framework that uses HDFS, YARN resource management, and a simple MapReduce programming model to process and analyze batch data in parallel.| [Create an Apache Hadoop cluster](hadoop/apache-hadoop-linux-create-cluster-get-started-portal.md)
|[Apache Spark](./spark/apache-spark-overview.md)|An open-source, parallel-processing framework that supports in-memory processing to boost the performance of big-data analysis applications. See [What is Apache Spark in HDInsight?](./spark/apache-spark-overview.md).|[Create an Apache Spark cluster](spark/apache-spark-jupyter-spark-sql-use-portal.md)
|[Apache HBase](./hbase/apache-hbase-overview.md)|A NoSQL database built on Hadoop that provides random access and strong consistency for large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data--potentially billions of rows times millions of columns. See [What is HBase on HDInsight?](./hbase/apache-hbase-overview.md)|[Create an Apache HBase cluster](hbase/quickstart-resource-manager-template.md)
|[Apache Interactive Query](./interactive-query/apache-interactive-query-get-started.md)|In-memory caching for interactive and faster Hive queries. See [Use Interactive Query in HDInsight](./interactive-query/apache-interactive-query-get-started.md).|[Create an Interactive Query cluster](interactive-query/quickstart-resource-manager-template.md)
|[Apache Kafka](./kafka/apache-kafka-introduction.md)|An open-source platform is used for building streaming data pipelines and applications. Kafka also provides message-queue functionality that allows you to publish and subscribe to data streams. See [Introduction to Apache Kafka on HDInsight](./kafka/apache-kafka-introduction.md).|[Create an Apache Kafka cluster](kafka/apache-kafka-get-started.md)

## Scenarios for using HDInsight

Azure HDInsight can be used for various scenarios in [big data](#what-is-big-data) processing. It can be historical data (data that is already collected and stored) or real-time data (data that is directly streamed from the source). The scenarios for processing such data can be summarized in the following categories:

### Batch processing (ETL)

Extract, transform, and load (ETL) is a process where unstructured or structured data is extracted from heterogeneous data sources. It's then transformed into a structured format and loaded into a data store. You can use the transformed data for data science or data warehousing.

### Data warehousing

You can use HDInsight to perform interactive queries at petabyte scales over structured or unstructured data in any format. You can also build models connecting them to BI tools.

### Internet of Things (IoT)

You can use HDInsight to process streaming data that is received in real time from different kinds of devices. For more information, [read this blog post from Azure that announces the public preview of Apache Kafka on HDInsight with Azure Managed disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-public-preview-of-apache-kafka-on-hdinsight-with-azure-managed-disks/).

## Open-source components in HDInsight

Azure HDInsight enables you to create clusters with open-source frameworks such as Spark, Hive, LLAP, Kafka, Hadoop and HBase. By default, these clusters include various open-source components such as Apache Ambari, Avro, Apache Hive 3, HCatalog, Apache Hadoop MapReduce, Apache Hadoop YARN, Apache Phoenix, Apache Pig, Apache Sqoop, Apache Tez, Apache Oozie, and Apache ZooKeeper.

## Programming languages in HDInsight

HDInsight clusters, including Spark, HBase, Kafka, Hadoop, and others, support many programming languages. Some programming languages aren't installed by default. For libraries, modules, or packages that aren't installed by default, use a script action to install the component.

|Programming language  |Information  |
|---------|---------|
|Default programming language support     | By default, HDInsight clusters support:<ul><li>Java</li><li>Python</li><li>.NET</li><li>Go</li></ul>  |
|Java virtual machine (JVM) languages     | Many languages other than Java can run on a Java virtual machine (JVM). However, if you run some of these languages, you might have to install more components on the cluster. The following JVM-based languages are supported on HDInsight clusters: <ul><li>Clojure</li><li>Jython (Python for Java)</li><li>Scala</li></ul>     |
|Hadoop-specific languages     | HDInsight clusters support the following languages that are specific to the Hadoop technology stack: <ul><li>Pig Latin for Pig jobs</li><li>HiveQL for Hive jobs and SparkSQL</li></ul>        |

## Business intelligence on HDInsight

Familiar business intelligence (BI) tools retrieve, analyze, and report data that is integrated with HDInsight by using either the Power Query add-in or the Microsoft Hive ODBC Driver:

* [Apache Spark BI using data visualization tools with Azure HDInsight](./spark/apache-spark-use-bi-tools.md)

* [Visualize Apache Hive data with Microsoft Power BI in Azure HDInsight](./hadoop/apache-hadoop-connect-hive-power-bi.md)

* [Visualize Interactive Query Hive data with Power BI in Azure HDInsight](./interactive-query/apache-hadoop-connect-hive-power-bi-directquery.md)

* [Connect Excel to Apache Hadoop with Power Query](./hadoop/apache-hadoop-connect-excel-power-query.md) (requires Windows)

* [Connect Excel to Apache Hadoop with the Microsoft Hive ODBC Driver](./hadoop/apache-hadoop-connect-excel-hive-odbc-driver.md) (requires Windows)

## In-region data residency 

Spark, Hadoop, and LLAP don't store customer data, so these services automatically satisfy in-region data residency requirements specified in the [Azure global infrastructure site](https://datacenters.microsoft.com/globe/explore/). 

Kafka and HBase do store customer data. This data is automatically stored by Kafka and HBase in a single region, so this service satisfies in-region data residency requirements specified in the [Azure global infrastructure site](https://datacenters.microsoft.com/globe/explore/).
