# Define dynamic network group membership in Azure Virtual Network Manager with Azure Policy

In this article, you learn how to use Azure Policy conditional statements to create network groups with dynamic membership. You create these conditional statements using the basic editor by selecting parameters and operators from a drop-down menu. Also, you learn how to use the advanced editor to update conditional statements of an existing network group.

[Azure Policy](../governance/policy/overview.md) is a service to enable you to enforce per-resource governance at scale. It can be used to specify conditional expressions that define group membership, as opposed to explicit lists of virtual networks. This condition continues to power your network groups dynamically, allowing virtual networks to join and leave the group automatically as their fulfillment of the condition changes, with no Network Manager operation required.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- To modify dynamic network groups, you must be [granted access with role-based access control](concept-network-groups.md#network-groups-and-azure-policy). Classic Admin/legacy authorization isn't supported.
## <a name="parameters"></a> Parameters and operators

Virtual networks with dynamic memberships are selected using conditional statements. You can define more than one conditional statement by using *logical operators* such as **AND** and **OR** for scenarios where you need to further narrow the selected virtual networks. 

List of supported parameters:

| **Parameters** | **Advanced editor field** |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| **Name** | `Name` |
| **ID** | `Id` |
| **Tags**| `tag['tagName']` |
| **Subscription Name** | `[subscription().Name]` |
| **Subscription ID** | `[subscription().Id]` |
| **Subscription Tags** | `[subscription().tags['tagName']]` |
| **Resource Group Name** | `[resourceGroup().Name]` |
| **Resource Group ID** | `[resourceGroup().Id]` |
| **Resource Group Tags** | `[resourceGroup().tags['tagName']]` |

List of supported operators:

| **Operators** | **Advanced editor** |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| **Contains** | `"contains": <>` |
| **Doesn't contain** | `"notcontains": <>` |
| **In** | `"in": <>` |
| **Not In** | `"notin": <>` |
| **Equals** | `"equals": <>` |
| **Doesn't equal** | `"notequals": <>` |
| **Contains any of** | `"contains": <>` |
| **Contains all of** | `"contains": <>` |
| **Doesn't contain any of** | `"notcontains": <>` |
| **Exists** | `"exists": true` |
| **Doesn't exist** | `"exists": false` |

> [!NOTE]
> The *Exists* and *Does not exist* operators are only used with the **Tags** parameter.

## Basic editor

Assume you have the following virtual networks in your subscription. Each virtual network has an associated tag named **environment** with the respective value of *production* or *test*. 

| **Virtual Network** | **Tag Name** | **Tag Value** |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| myVNet01-EastUS | environment | production |
| myVNet01-WestUS | environment | production |
| myVNet02-WestUS | environment | test |
| myVNet03-WestUS | environment | test |

You only want to select virtual networks that whose tag has a key value pair of **environment** equal to **production**. To begin using the basic editor to create your conditional statement, you need to create a new network group.

1. Go to your Azure Virtual Network Manager instance and select **Network Groups** under **Settings**. Then select **+ Create** to create a new network group.
1. Enter a **Name** and an optional **Description** for the network group, and select **Add**.
1. Select the network group from the list and select **Create Azure Policy**.
1. Enter a **Policy name** and leave the **Scope** selections unless changes are needed.
1. Under **Criteria**, select **Tags** from the drop-down under **Parameter** and then select **Key value pair** from the drop-down under **Operator**.
1. Enter **environment** and **production** under **Condition** and select **Preview Resources**. You should see myVNet01-EastUS and myVNet01-WestUS show up in the list.

1. Select **Close** and **Save**. 
1. After a few minutes, select your network group and select **Group Members** under **Settings**. You should only see myVNet01-WestUS and myVNet01-WestUS.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The **basic editor** is only available during the creation of an Azure Policy. Once a policy is created, all edits will be done using JSON in the **Policies** section of virtual network manager or via Azure Policy.

## Advanced editor

The advanced editor can be used to select virtual networks during the creation of a network group or when updating an existing network group. Based in [JSON](../governance/policy/concepts/assignment-structure.md), the advanced editor is useful for creating and updating complex Azure Policy conditional statements by experienced users.

### Create a new policy with advanced editor

1. Go to your Azure Virtual Network Manager instance and select **Network Groups** under **Settings**. Then select **+ Create** to create a new network group.
1. Enter a **Name** and an optional **Description** for the network group, and select **Add**.
1. Select the network group from the list and select **Create Azure Policy**.
1. Enter a **Policy name** and leave the **Scope** selections unless changes are needed.
1. Under **Criteria**, select **Advanced (JSON) editor** to open the editor.
1. Enter the following JSON code into the text box and select **Save**:

   ```json
      {
      "field": "Name",
      "contains": "myVNet01"
      }
   ```
1. After a few minutes, select your network group and select **Group Members** under **Settings**. You should only see myVNet01-WestUS and myVNet01-EastUS.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any Azure Policies you create through with virtual network manager will live in the Azure Policy services area. They will not be remove from your Azure Policy assignments and definitions when a virtual network manager instance is delete. This requires removal of the policies manually. [Learn to remove Azure Policies](../governance/policy/tutorials/create-and-manage.md#clean-up-resources)

### Edit an existing policy

1. Select the network group created in the previous section. Then select the **Policies** tab.
1. Select the policy created in the previous section.
1. You see the conditional statements for the network group in the advance editor view as follows:

    ```json
    [
      {
         "field": "Name",
         "contains": "myVNet01"
      }
    ]
    ```

1. To add another conditional statement for a **Name** field *not containing* **WestUS**, enter the following into the advanced editor:

    ```json
    {
       "allOf": [

          {
             "field": "Name",
             "contains": "VNet01"
          },
          {
             "field": "Name",
             "notcontains": "WestUS"
          }
       ]
    }
    ```

    The `"allOf"` parameter contains both the conditional statements that are separated by the **AND** logical operator.
1. Select Save. 
1. After a few minutes, select your network group and select **Group Members** under **Settings**. You should only see myVNet01-EastUS.

See [Parameter and operators](#parameters) for the complete list of parameters and operators you can use with the advanced editor. 
## More examples

Here are more examples of conditional statements in the advanced editor.

### Example 1: OR operator only

This example uses the **OR** logical operator to separate two conditional statements.

* Basic editor:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-define-network-group-membership-azure-policy/or-operator.png" alt-text="Screenshot of network group conditional statement using the OR logical operator.":::

* Advanced operator:

    ```json
    {
       "anyOf": [
          {
             "field": "Name",
             "contains": "myVNet01"
          },
          {
             "field": "Name",
             "contains": "myVNet02"
          }
       ]
    }
    ```

The `"anyOf"` parameter contains both the conditional statements that are separated by the **OR** logical operator.

### Example 2: AND and OR operator at the same time

* Basic editor:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-define-network-group-membership-azure-policy/both-operator.png" alt-text="Screenshot of network group conditional statement using both OR and AND logical operator.":::

* Advanced editor:

```json
{
   "allOf": [
      {
         "anyOf": [
            {
               "field": "Name",
               "contains": "myVNet01"
            },
            {
               "field": "Name",
               "contains": "myVNet02"
            }
         ]
      },
      {
         "field": "Name",
         "notcontains": "West"
      }
   ]
}
```
Both `"allOf"` and `"anyOf"` are used in the code. Since the **AND** operator is last in the list, it is on the outer part of the code containing the two conditional statements with the **OR** operator.

### Example 3: Using custom tag values with advanced editor

In this example, a conditional statement is created that finds virtual networks where the name includes **myVNet** AND the **environment** tag equals **production**.

* Advanced editor:

   ```json

     {
          "allOf": [
            {
               "field": "Name",
               "contains": "myVNet"
            },      
            {
               "field": "tags['environment']",
               "equals": "production"
            }
          ]    
     }

   ```
