# Cross-tenant support in Azure Virtual Network Manager

In this article, you learn about cross-tenant support in Azure Virtual Network Manager. Cross-tenant supports allows organizations to use a central Network Manager instance for managing virtual networks across different tenants and subscriptions.

 ## Overview of Cross-tenant 

Cross-tenant support in Azure Virtual Network Manager allows you to add subscriptions or management groups from other tenants to your network manager. This is done by establishing a two-way connection between the network manager and target tenants. Once connected, the central manager can deploy connectivity and/or security admin rules to virtual networks across those connected subscriptions or management groups. This support assists organizations that fit the following scenarios: 

- Acquisitions – In instances where organizations merge through acquisition and have multiple tenants, cross tenant support allows a central network manager to manage virtual networks across the tenants. 

- Managed service provider – In managed service provider scenarios, an organization can manage the resources of other organizations. Cross-tenant support allows central management of virtual networks by a central service provider for multiple clients. 

## Cross-tenant connection 

Establishing cross-tenant support begins with creating a cross tenant connection between two tenants. Cross-tenant support requires two-way consent--one from the network manager, the other from the target tenant's virtual network manager hub. The connections are as follows:

- Network manager connection - You create a cross-tenant connection from your network manager. The connection includes the exact scope of the tenant’s subscriptions or management groups to manage in your network manager.
- Virtual network manager hub connection - the tenant creates a cross-tenant connection from their virtual network manager hub. This connection includes the scope of subscriptions or management groups to be managed by the central network manager.

Once both cross-tenant connections exist and the scopes are exactly the same, a true connection is established. Administrators can use their network manager to add cross-tenant resources to their [network groups](concept-network-groups.md) and to manage virtual networks included in the connection scope. Existing connectivity and/or security admin rules are applied to the resources based on existing configurations.

A cross-tenant connection can only be established and maintained when both objects from each party exist. When one of the connections is removed, the cross-tenant connection is broken. If you need to delete a cross-tenant connection, you perform the following:

- Remove cross-tenant connection from the network manager side via Cross-tenant connections settings in the Azure portal.
- Remove cross-tenant connection from the tenant side via Virtual network manager hub's Cross-tenant connections settings in the Azure portal.

> [!NOTE] 
> Once a connection is removed from either side, the network manager will no longer be able to view or manage the tenant's resources under that former connection's scope.

## Connection states
The resources required to create the cross-tenant connection contain a state, which represents whether the associated scope has been added to the Network Manager scope. Possible state values include:

* Connected: Both the Scope Connection and Network Manager Connection resources exist. The scope has been added to the Network Manager's scope.
* Pending: One of the two approval resources hasn't been created. The scope hasn't yet been added to the Network Manager's scope.
* Conflict: There's already a network manager with this subscription or management group defined within its scope. Two network managers with the same scope access can't directly manage the same scope, therefore this subscription/management group can't be added to the Network Manager scope. To resolve the conflict, remove the scope from the conflicting network manager's scope and recreate the connection resource.
* Revoked: The scope was at one time added to the Network Manager scope, but the removal of an approval resource has caused it to be revoked.

The only state that represents the scope has been added to the Network Manager scope is 'Connected'.

## Required permissions 

To use cross-tenant connection in Azure Virtual Network Manager, users need the following permissions: 

- Administrator of central management tenant has guest account in target managed tenant. 

- Administrator guest account has *Network Contributor* permissions applied at appropriate scope level(Management group, subscription, or virtual network). 

Need help with setting up permissions? Check out how to [add guest users in the Azure portal](../active-directory/external-identities/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal.md), and how to [assign user roles to resources in Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.yml) 

## Known limitations 

Currently, cross-tenant virtual networks can only be [added to network groups manually](concept-network-groups.md#group-membership). Adding cross-tenant virtual networks to network groups dynamically through Azure Policy is a future capability.
