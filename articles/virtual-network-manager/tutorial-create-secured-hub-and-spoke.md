# Tutorial: Create a secured hub and spoke network

In this tutorial, you create a hub and spoke network topology using Azure Virtual Network Manager. You then deploy a virtual network gateway in the hub virtual network to allow resources in the spoke virtual networks to communicate with remote networks using VPN. Also, you configure a security configuration to block outbound network traffic to the internet on ports 80 and 443. Last, you verify that configurations were applied correctly by looking at the virtual network and virtual machine settings.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Prerequisite

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* Before you can complete steps in this tutorial, you must first [create an Azure Virtual Network Manager](create-virtual-network-manager-portal.md) instance. The instance needs to included the **Connectivity** and **Security admin** features. This tutorial used a Virtual Network Manager instance named **vnm-learn-eastus-001**.

## Create virtual networks

This procedure walks you through creating three virtual networks that will be connected using the hub and spoke network topology.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Select **+ Create a resource** and search for **Virtual network**. Then select **Create** to begin configuring the virtual network.

1. On the *Basics* tab, enter or select the following information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Subscription | Select the subscription you want to deploy this virtual network into. |
    | Resource group | Select or create a new resource group to store the virtual network. This quickstart uses a resource group named **rg-learn-eastus-001**. |
    | Name | Enter **vnet-learn-prod-eastus-001** for the virtual network name. |
    | Region | Select the **East US** region. |

 1. Select **Next: IP Addresses** and configure the following network address space:

    | Setting | Value |
    | -------- | ----- |
    | IPv4 address space | Enter **10.0.0.0/16** as the address space. |
    | Subnet name | Enter the name **default** for the subnet. |
    | Subnet address space | Enter the subnet address space of **10.0.0.0/24**. |

1. Select **Review + create** and then select **Create** to deploy the virtual network.


1. Repeat steps 2-5 to create two more virtual networks into the same resource group with the following information:


    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Subscription | Select the same subscription you selected in step 3. |
    | Resource group | Select the **rg-learn-eastus-001**. |
    | Name | Enter **vnet-learn-prod-eastus-002** and **vnet-learn-hub-eastus-001** for the two virtual networks. |
    | Region | Select **(US) East US** |
    | vnet-learn-prod-eastus-002 IP addresses | IPv4 address space: 10.1.0.0/16 </br> Subnet name: default </br> Subnet address space: 10.1.0.0/24|
    | vnet-learn-hub-eastus-001 IP addresses | IPv4 address space: 10.2.0.0/16 </br> Subnet name: default </br> Subnet address space: 10.2.0.0/24|

## Deploy a virtual network gateway

Deploy a virtual network gateway into the hub virtual network. This virtual network gateway is necessary for the spokes to *Use hub as a gateway* setting.

1. Select **+ Create a resource** and search for **Virtual network gateway**. Then select **Create** to begin configuring the virtual network gateway.

1. On the *Basics* tab, enter or select the following settings:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secured-hub-and-spoke/gateway-basics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of create the virtual network gateway basics tab.":::

    | Setting | Value |
    | -------- | ----- |
    | Subscription | Select the subscription you want to deploy this virtual network into. |
    | Name | Enter **gw-learn-hub-eastus-001** for the virtual network gateway name. |
    | SKU | Select **VpnGW1** for the SKU. |
    | Generation | Select **Generation1** for the generation. |
    | Virtual network | Select the **vnet-learn-hub-eastus-001** for the VNet. |
    | **Public IP Address** |  |
    | Public IP address name | Enter the name **gwpip-learn-hub-eastus-001** for the public IP. |
    | **SECOND PUBLIC IP ADDRESS** | |
    | Public IP address name | Enter the name **gwpip-learn-hub-eastus-002** for the public IP. |

    
1. Select **Review + create** and then select **Create** after validation has passed. The deployment of a virtual network gateway can take about 30 minutes. You can move on to the next section while waiting for this deployment to complete. However, you may find **gw-learn-hub-eastus-001** doesn't display that it has a gateway due to timing and sync across the Azure portal.

## Create a network group

> [!NOTE]
> This how-to guide assumes you created a network manager instance using the [quickstart](create-virtual-network-manager-portal.md) guide. The network group in this tutorial is called **ng-learn-prod-eastus-001**.

[!INCLUDE [virtual-network-manager-create-network-group](../../includes/virtual-network-manager-create-network-group.md)]

## Define dynamic group membership with Azure policy

1. From the list of network groups, select **ng-learn-prod-eastus-001**. Under **Create policy to dynamically add members**, select **Create Azure policy**.

1. On the **Create Azure Policy** page, select or enter the following information:

## Verify deployment of configurations

### Verify from a virtual network

1. Go to **vnet-learn-prod-eastus-001** virtual network and select **Network Manager** under **Settings**. The **Connectivity configurations** tab lists **cc-learn-prod-eastus-001** connectivity configuration applied in the virtual network

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secured-hub-and-spoke/vnet-connectivity-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of connectivity configuration applied to the virtual network.":::

1. Select the **Security admin configurations** tab and expand **Outbound** to list the security admin rules applied to this virtual network.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secured-hub-and-spoke/verify-security-admin-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of security admin configuration applied to the virtual network."::: 

1. Select **Peerings** under **Settings** to list the virtual network peerings created by Virtual Network Manager. Its name starts with **ANM_**. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secured-hub-and-spoke/vnet-peerings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of virtual network peerings created by Virtual Network Manager." lightbox="media/tutorial-create-secured-hub-and-spoke/vnet-peerings-large.png":::

### Verify from a VM

1. [Deploy a test virtual machine](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal) into **vnet-learn-prod-eastus-001**.

1. Go to the test VM created in *vnet-learn-prod-eastus-001* and select **Networking** under *Settings*. Select **Outbound port rules** and verify the **DENY_INTERNET** rule is applied.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-secured-hub-and-spoke/vm-security-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot of test VM's network security rules.":::

1. Select the network interface name and select **Effective routes** under **Help** to verify the routes for the virtual network peerings. The `10.2.0.0/16` route with the **Next Hop Type** of `VNet peering` is the route to the hub virtual network.

## Clean up resources

If you no longer need the Azure Virtual Network Manager, you need to make sure all of following is true before you can delete the resource:

* There are no deployments of configurations to any region.
* All configurations have been deleted.
* All network groups have been deleted.

Use the [remove components checklist](concept-remove-components-checklist.md) to make sure no child resources are still available before deleting the resource group.
