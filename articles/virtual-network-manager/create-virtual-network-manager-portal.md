# Quickstart: Create a mesh network topology with Azure Virtual Network Manager - Azure portal

Get started with Azure Virtual Network Manager by using the Azure portal to manage connectivity for all your virtual networks.

In this quickstart, you deploy three virtual networks and use Azure Virtual Network Manager to create a mesh network topology. Then you verify that the connectivity configuration was applied.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- To modify dynamic network groups, you must be [granted access via Azure RBAC role](concept-network-groups.md#network-groups-and-azure-policy) assignment only. Classic Admin/legacy authorization isn't supported.

[!INCLUDE [virtual-network-manager-create-instance](../../includes/virtual-network-manager-create-instance.md)]

## Create virtual networks

Create three virtual networks by using the portal. Each virtual network has a `networkType` tag that's used for dynamic membership. If you have existing virtual networks for your mesh configuration, add the tags listed in the table to your virtual networks and skip to the next section.

1. From the **Home** screen, select **+ Create a resource** and search for **Virtual networks**. Then select **Create** to begin configuring a virtual network.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter or select the following information.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Subscription** | Select the subscription where you want to deploy this virtual network. |
    | **Resource group** | Select **resource-group**. |
    | **Virtual network name** | Enter **vnet-000**. |
    | **Region** | Select **(US) West 2**. |

1. Select the **IP addresses** tab.
1. On the **IP addresses** tab, configure the following network address spaces.

    | Setting | Value |
    | -------- | ----- |
    | **IPv4 address space** | 10.0.0.0/16 |
    | **Subnet name** | default |
    | **Subnet address space** | 10.0.0.0/24 |

1. Select the **Tags** tab. Enter the following tag information and select **Review + Create**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Name | NetworkType |
    | Value | Production |
    | Resource | Select **Virtual network**. |

1. After your configuration passes validation, select **Create** to deploy the virtual network.

1. Repeat the preceding steps to create more virtual networks with the following information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Subscription** | Select the same subscription that you selected in step 2. |
    | **Resource group** | Select **resource-group**. |
    | **Name** | Enter **vnet-01** and **vnet-02** for the other virtual networks. |
    | **Region** | Select **(US) West 2**. |
    | **vnet-01 IP addresses** | IPv4 address space: **10.1.0.0/16** </br> Subnet name: **default** </br> Subnet address space: **10.1.0.0/24**|
    | **vnet-01 Tags** | Name: **NetworkType** </br> Value: **Production** </br> Resource: **Virtual network**. |
    | **vnet-02 IP addresses** | IPv4 address space: **10.2.0.0/16** </br> Subnet name: **default** </br> Subnet address space: **10.2.0.0/24**|
    | **vnet-02 Tags** | Name: **NetworkType** </br> Value: **Production** </br> Resource: **Virtual network**. |

## Create a network group

Virtual Network Manager applies configurations to groups of virtual networks by placing them in network groups. To create a network group:

[!INCLUDE [virtual-network-manager-create-network-group](../../includes/virtual-network-manager-create-network-group.md)]

## Define membership for a connectivity configuration

After you create your network group, you add virtual networks as members. Choose one of the following options for your mesh membership configuration.

# [Manual membership](#tab/manualmembership)

### Add a membership manually

In this task, you manually add two virtual networks for your mesh configuration to your network group:

1. From the list of network groups, select **network-group**. On the **network-group** pane, under **Manually add members**, select **Add virtual networks**.

1. On the **Manually add members** pane, select **vnet-00** and **vnet-01**, and then select **Add**.

1. On the **Network Group** pane, select **View group members**. Confirm **vnet-00** and **vnet-01** are listed with a **Source** of *Manually added*. If no virtual networks are listed, select **Refresh**.

# [Azure Policy](#tab/azurepolicy)

### Create a policy definition for dynamic membership

By using [Azure Policy](concept-azure-policy-integration.md), you define a condition to dynamically add two virtual networks to your network group when the virtual network has a tag with the name `NetworkType` and the value `Production`.

1. From the list of network groups, select **network-group**. Under **Create policy to dynamically add members**, select **Create Azure policy**.

1. On the **Create Azure policy** pane, select or enter the following information, and then select **Preview resources**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Policy name** | Enter **azure-policy**. |
    | **Scope** | Choose **Select scopes** and then select your current subscription. |
    | **Parameter** | Select **Name** from the dropdown list.|
    | **Operator** | Select **Key value pair** from the dropdown list.|
    | **Condition** | Enter name of **NetworkType**.</br> Enter value of **Production**. |

2. The **Preview resources** pane shows the virtual networks for addition to the network group based on the defined conditions in Azure Policy. When you're ready, select **Close**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/create-virtual-network-manager-portal/preview-virtual-networks.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the pane for previewing the virtual networks.":::

3. Select **Save** to deploy the Azure Policy. It can take up to one minute for the policy to take effect and be added to your network group.

4. On the **Network Group** pane, under **Settings**, select **Group members** to view the membership of the group based on the conditions that you defined in Azure Policy. Confirm that **Source** is listed as **azure-policy - subscriptions/subscription_id**.

## Create a configuration

Now that you created the network group and updated its membership with virtual networks, you create a mesh network topology configuration. Replace `<subscription_id>` with your subscription.

1. Under **Settings**, select **Configurations**. Then select **Create**.

1. Select **Connectivity configuration** from the dropdown menu to begin creating a connectivity configuration.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following information, and then select **Next: Topology**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Name** | Enter **connectivity-configuration**. |
    | **Description** | *(Optional)* Provide a description about this connectivity configuration. |

1. On the **Topology** tab, select the **Mesh** topology, and leave the **Enable mesh connectivity across regions** checkbox unselected. Cross-region connectivity isn't required for this setup, because all the virtual networks are in the same region. 

1. Under **Network groups**, select **Add** > **Add network group**.
1. On the **Add network groups** window, select **network-group**, and then choose **Select** to add the network group to the configuration.

1. Select the **Visualization** tab to view the topology of the configuration. This tab shows a visual representation of the network group that you added to the configuration.

1. Select **Next: Review + Create** > **Create** to create the configuration.

1. After the deployment finishes, select **Refresh**. The new connectivity configuration appears on the **Configurations** pane.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/create-virtual-network-manager-portal/connectivity-configuration-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a connectivity configuration list.":::

## Deploy the connectivity configuration

To apply your configurations to your environment, you need to commit the configuration by deployment. Deploy the configuration to the (US) West 2 region where the virtual networks are deployed:

1. Under **Settings**, select **Deployments**. Then select **Deploy configurations** and **Connectivity configuration** from the dropdown.

1. On the **Deploy a configuration** window, select the following settings, and then select **Next**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Connectivity configurations** | Select **connectivity-configuration** under **Connectivity - Mesh** in the dropdown menu. |
    | **Target regions** | Select **(US) West 2** as the deployment region. |

1. Select **Next** and **Deploy** to complete the deployment.

1. Confirm that the deployment appears in the list for the selected region. The deployment of the configuration can take a few minutes to finish.
