# Using network groups with security admin rules

In this article, you learn how to use network groups with security admin rules in Azure Virtual Network Manager (AVNM). Network groups allow you to create logical groups of virtual networks and subnets that have common attributes, such as environment, region, service type, and more. You can then specify your network groups as the source and/or destination of your security admin rules so that you can enforce the traffic among your grouped network resources. This feature streamlines the process of securing your traffic across workloads and environments, as it removes the manual step of specifying individual Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) ranges or resource IDs.

## Why use network groups with security admin rules?

Using network groups with security admin rules allows you to define the source and destination of the traffic for the security admin rule. This feature streamlines the process of securing your traffic across workloads and environments by aggregating the CIDR ranges of the network groups to your virtual network manager instance. Aggregation to a virtual network manager removes the manual step of specifying individual CIDR ranges or resource IDs. 

For example, you need to ensure traffic is denied between your production and nonproduction environments represented by two separate network groups. Create a security admin rule with an action type of
**Deny**.
Specify one network group as the target for your rule collection, these virtual networks will receive the configured rules. Then select the direction of the traffic you want to deny and use the other network group as the corresponding source / destination. You can enforce the traffic between your grouped network resources without the need to specify individual CIDR ranges or resource IDs.

## How do I deploy a security admin rule using network groups?

From the Azure portal, you can [deploy a security admin rule using network groups](./how-to-create-security-admin-rule-network-groups.md) in the Azure portal. To create a security admin rule, create a security admin configuration and add a security admin rule that utilizes network groups as source and destination. This is done by electing to use *Manual* for the **Network group address space aggregation option** setting in the configuration. Once elected, the virtual network manager instance will aggregate the CIDR ranges of the network groups referenced as the source and destination of the security admin rules in the configuration.

Finally, deploy the security admin configuration and the rules apply to the network group resources. With the *Manual* aggregation option, the CIDR ranges in the network group are aggregated only when you deploy the security admin configuration. This allows you to commit the CIDR ranges on your schedule.

If you change the resources in your network group or a network group's CIDR range changes, you need to redeploy the security configuration after the changes are made. After deployment, the new CIDR ranges will be applied across your network to all new and existing network group resources.

## Supported regions

During the public preview, network groups with security admin rules are supported in all regions where Azure Virtual Network Manager is available.

## Limitations of network groups with security admin rules

The following limitations apply when using network groups with security admin rules:

- Only supports manual aggregation of CIDRs in a network group. The CIDR range in a rule only changes upon the customer commit. This means The CIDR range within a rule remains unchanged until the customer commits.

- Supports 100 networking resources (virtual networks or subnets) in any one network group referenced in the security admin rule.

- CIDR ranges for network groups members can be either Ipv4 or Ipv6 CIDRs, but not both in the same group. If Ipv4 and Ipv6 ranges are present in the same group, your virtual network manager only uses the IPv4 ranges.

- Role-based access control ownership is inferred from the `Microsoft.Network/networkManagers/securityAdminConfigurations/rulecollections/rules/write` permission only.

- Network groups must have the same member-types. Virtual networks and subnets are supported but must be in separate network groups.

- Force-delete of any network group used as the source and/or destination in a security admin rule isn't currently supported. Usage causes an error.
