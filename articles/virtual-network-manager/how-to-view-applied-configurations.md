# View configurations applied by Azure Virtual Network Manager

Azure Virtual Network Manager provides a few different ways for you to verify if configurations are being applied correctly. In this article, we look at how you can verify configurations applied both at virtual network and virtual machine level. We'll also go over operations you'll see in the activity log.


## Virtual network visibility
Effective network group membership and applied configurations can be viewed on the per virtual network level.

### Network group membership
All network group memberships are recorded and available for query inside [Azure Resource Graph](../governance/resource-graph/overview.md). You are using the `networkResources` table for the extension resource type of `Microsoft.Network/networkGroupMemberships` in your query.

Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to find and use the Resource Graph Explorer with the following steps:

1. Select **All services** in the left pane. Search for and select **Resource Graph Explorer**, or connect directly to the [Resource Graph Explorer](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/ArgQueryBlade) 

1. In the **Query 1** portion of the window, enter the following query to find all network groups containing your virtual network:
    ```kusto
    networkresources
    | where type == "microsoft.network/networkgroupmemberships"
    | where id == "{virtualNetworkId}/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkGroupMemberships/default"
    | mv-expand properties.GroupMemberships
    | project properties_GroupMemberships.NetworkGroupId
    ```
1. Select **Run query**.
1. Review the query response in the **Results** tab. Select the **Messages** tab to see details about the query, including the count of results and duration of the query. Errors, if any, are displayed under this tab.
1. To find all resources inside your network group, repeat steps above with the following query:
    ```kusto
    networkresources
    | where type == "microsoft.network/networkgroupmemberships"
    | mv-expand properties.GroupMemberships
    | where properties_GroupMemberships.NetworkGroupId == {networkGroupId}
    | parse id with virtualNetworkId "/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkGroupMemberships/default"
    |    project virtualNetworkId
    ```
Learn more about [Azure Resource Graph queries using Resource Graph Explorer](../governance/resource-graph/first-query-portal.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Resource Graph will only return networking resources you have read access to at the time of running the query. 

### Applied configurations

Once your configuration has been deployed by Virtual Network Manager, you can view the applied configuration from the virtual network resource. 

1. Go to your virtual network resource and select **Network Manager** under *Settings*. On the Connectivity tab, view all the connectivity configurations the virtual network is associated with.

2. Select the **Security admin configurations** tab to view all the security rules currently applied to your virtual network.

## Virtual machine visibility

At the virtual machine level, you can view security rules applied by Virtual Network Manager and the effective routes for the connectivity configurations.

### Applied security rules

1. Go to a virtual machine in a virtual network that has a configuration applied by Virtual Network Manager. Then select **Networking** under *Settings* on the left menu pane.

2. You see a list of inbound network security groups and also a section for inbound security rules applied by Virtual Network Manager.

3. Select the **Outbound port rules** tab to view the outbound security rules for the virtual machine.

### Effective routes

1. To view the effective routes for the applied connectivity configuration, select the network interface name under the *Networking* settings of the virtual machine.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-view-applied-configurations/vm-network-interface.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting virtual machine network interface card.":::

1. Then select **Effective routes** under *Support + troubleshooting*.

2. Routes with the next hop type of *ConnectedGroup* are either part of mesh configuration or when [*Direct connectivity*](concept-connectivity-configuration.md#direct-connectivity) is enabled for a network group. Routes between the hub and spoke virtual networks will appear as next hop type *VNetPeering* or *GlobalVNetPeering*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The hub virtual network address space is also **included** in the *ConnectedGroup*. Therefore, if virtual network peering fails between the hub and spoke virtual networks, they can still communicate with each other because they're in a connected group.
    > 

### Effective security rules

1. To see effective security rules for an applied security rule configuration, select the network interface name under the *Networking* settings of the virtual machine.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-view-applied-configurations/vm-network-interface.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting virtual machine network interface card for security rules.":::

1. Then select **Effective security rules** under *Support + troubleshooting*.

1. Select the name of the Azure Virtual Network Manager to see the security admin rules associated to the virtual machine.

## Activity Log

You can view the activity log for your Azure Virtual Network Manager resource to see the changes that you or your network administrator have made. To view the activity log, go to your Network Manager resource in the Azure portal. Select **Activity log** in the left pane menu. If necessary, adjust the *Timespan* and add more filters to narrow the list of operations. You can also view the *Activity Log* by searching for the service at the top of the Azure portal.
