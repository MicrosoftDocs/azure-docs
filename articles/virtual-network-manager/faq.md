# Azure Virtual Network Manager FAQ

This article answers frequently asked questions about Azure Virtual Network Manager.

## General

### Which Azure regions support Azure Virtual Network Manager?

For current information about region support, refer to [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=virtual-network-manager).

> [!NOTE]
> All regions have [availability zones](../reliability/availability-zones-region-support.md), except France Central.

### What are common use cases for Azure Virtual Network Manager?

* You can create network groups to meet the security requirements of your environment and its functions. For example, you can create network groups for your production and test environments to manage their connectivity and security rules at scale.
  
  For security rules, you can create a security admin configuration with two collections. Each collection is targeted on your production and test network groups, respectively. After deployment, this configuration enforces one set of security rules for network resources for your production environment and one set for your test environment.

* You can apply connectivity configurations to create a mesh or a hub-and-spoke network topology for a large number of virtual networks across your organization's subscriptions.

* You can deny high-risk traffic. As an administrator of an enterprise, you can block specific protocols or sources that override any network security group (NSG) rules that would normally allow the traffic.

* You can always allow traffic. For example, you might permit a specific security scanner to always have inbound connectivity to all your resources, even if NSG rules are configured to deny the traffic.

### What's the cost of using Azure Virtual Network Manager?

Azure Virtual Network Manager charges are based on the number of subscriptions that contain a virtual network with an active Virtual Network Manager configuration deployed onto it. Also, a charge for peering applies to the traffic volume of virtual networks that are managed by a deployed connectivity configuration (either mesh or hub-and-spoke).

You can find current pricing for your region on the [Azure Virtual Network Manager pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-network-manager/) page.

### How do I deploy Azure Virtual Network Manager?

You can deploy and manage an Azure Virtual Network Manager instance and configurations through various tools, including:

* [Azure portal](./create-virtual-network-manager-portal.md)
* [Azure CLI](./create-virtual-network-manager-cli.md)
* [Azure PowerShell](./create-virtual-network-manager-powershell.md)
* [ARM Template](./create-virtual-network-manager-template.md)
* [Terraform](./create-virtual-network-manager-terraform.md)

## Technical

### Can a virtual network belong to multiple Azure Virtual Network Manager instances?

Yes, a virtual network can belong to more than one Azure Virtual Network Manager instance.

### Can spoke VNets be connected to a VWAN hub while in a mesh topology so that those spoke VNets can communicate directly?

Yes, spoke VNets can connect to VWAN hubs while in the mesh group. Those VNets in the mesh group have direct connectivity.

### Will operations to the IP prefixes in VNETs that are a part of the Azure Virtual Network Manager mesh propagate automatically? 

VNets in mesh are automatically in sync. IP prefixes will be updated automatically. This means that traffic within the mesh will work even after there are changes in IP prefixes in VNets in the mesh.

### How do I verify a mesh topology is configured and applied?"? 

Please refer to the documentation [How to view applied configurations](/azure/virtual-network-manager/how-to-view-applied-configurations?branch=main). A mesh topology is not a VNet peering, so you cannot see mesh connectivity in peering.

### What happens if the region where the Azure Virtual Network Manager is created is down? Does it affect deployed configurations or only prevent configuration changes?

Only the ability to change configurations will be impacted. Once Azure Virtual Network Manager has programmed the configuration after you commit the configuration, it will continue to operate. For example, if the Azure Virtual Network Manager instance is created in region 1 and the mesh topology is established in region 2, the mesh in region 2 will continue to function even if region 1 becomes unavailable. 

### What is a global mesh network topology?

A global mesh allows for virtual networks across regions to communicate with one another. The effects are similar to how global virtual network peering works.

### Is there a limit to how many network groups I can create?

There's no limit to how many network groups you can create.

### How do I remove the deployment of all applied configurations?

You need to deploy a **None** configuration to all regions where you have a configuration applied.

### Can I add virtual networks from another subscription that I don't manage?

Yes, if you have the appropriate permissions to access those virtual networks.

### What is dynamic group membership?

See [Dynamic membership](concept-network-groups.md#dynamic-membership).

### How does the deployment of configuration differ for dynamic membership and static membership?

See [Configuration deployments in Azure Virtual Network Manager](concept-deployments.md#deployment).

### How do I delete an Azure Virtual Network Manager component?

See [Remove and update Azure Virtual Network Manager components checklist](concept-remove-components-checklist.md).

### Does Azure Virtual Network Manager store customer data?

No. Azure Virtual Network Manager doesn't store any customer data.

### Can an Azure Virtual Network Manager instance be moved?

No. Azure Virtual Network Manager doesn't currently support that capability. If you need to move an instance, you can consider deleting it and using the Azure Resource Manager template to create another one in another location.

### Can I move a subscription with an Azure Virtual Network Manager to another tenant?
Yes, but there are some considerations to keep in mind:
- The target tenant cannot have an Azure Virtual Network Manager created.
- The spokes virtual networks in the network group may lose their reference when changing tenants, thus losing connectivity to the hub vnet. To resolve this, after moving the subscription to another tenant, you must manually add the spokes vnets to the network group of Azure Virtual Network Manager.

### How can I see what configurations are applied to help me troubleshoot?

You can view Azure Virtual Network Manager settings under **Network Manager** for a virtual network. The settings show both connectivity and security admin configurations that are applied. For more information, see [View configurations applied by Azure Virtual Network Manager](how-to-view-applied-configurations.md).

### What happens when all zones are down in a region with a Virtual Network Manager instance?

If a regional outage occurs, all configurations applied to current managed virtual network resources remain intact during the outage. You can't create new configurations or modify existing configurations during the outage. After the outage is resolved, you can continue to manage your virtual network resources as before.

### Can a virtual network managed by Azure Virtual Network Manager be peered to an unmanaged virtual network?

Yes. Azure Virtual Network Manager is fully compatible with pre-existing hub-and-spoke topology deployments that use peering. You don't need to delete any existing peered connections between the spokes and the hub. The migration occurs without any downtime to your network.

### Can I migrate an existing hub-and-spoke topology to Azure Virtual Network Manager?

Yes. Migrating existing virtual networks to the hub-and-spoke topology in Azure Virtual Network Manager is straightforward. You can [create a hub-and-spoke topology connectivity configuration](how-to-create-hub-and-spoke.md). When you deploy this configuration, Virtual Network Manager automatically creates the necessary peerings. Any pre-existing peerings remain intact, so there's no downtime.

### How do connected groups differ from virtual network peering in establishing connectivity between virtual networks?

In Azure, virtual network peering and connected groups are two methods of establishing connectivity between virtual networks. Peering works by creating a one-to-one mapping between virtual networks, whereas connected groups use a new construct that establishes connectivity without such a mapping.

In a connected group, all virtual networks are connected without individual peering relationships. For example, if three virtual networks are part of the same connected group, connectivity is enabled between each virtual network without the need for individual peering relationships.

### When managing virtual networks that currently use VNet peering, does this result in paying VNet peering charges twice with Azure Virtual Network Manager?

There is no second or double charge for peering. Your virtual network manager respects all previously created VNet peerings, and migrates those connections. All peering resources, whether created inside a virtual network manager or outside, with incur a single peering charge.


### Can I create exceptions to security admin rules?

Normally, security admin rules are defined to block traffic across virtual networks. However, there are times when certain virtual networks and their resources need to allow traffic for management or other processes. For these scenarios, you can [create exceptions](./concept-enforcement.md#network-traffic-enforcement-and-exceptions-with-security-admin-rules) where necessary. [Learn how to block high-risk ports with exceptions](how-to-block-high-risk-ports.md) for these scenarios.

### How can I deploy multiple security admin configurations to a region?

You can deploy only one security admin configuration to a region. However, multiple connectivity configurations can exist in a region if you [create multiple rule collections](how-to-block-network-traffic-portal.md#add-a-rule-collection-and-security-rule) in a security configuration.

### Do security admin rules apply to Azure private endpoints?

Currently, security admin rules don't apply to Azure private endpoints that fall under the scope of a virtual network managed by Azure Virtual Network Manager.

#### Outbound rules

| Port | Protocol | Source | Destination | Action |
| ---- | -------- | ------ | ----------- | ------ |
| 443, 12000 | TCP  | `VirtualNetwork` | `AzureCloud` | Allow |
| Any | Any | `VirtualNetwork` | `VirtualNetwork` | Allow |

### Can an Azure Virtual WAN hub be part of a network group?

No, an Azure Virtual WAN hub can't be in a network group at this time.

### Can I use an Azure Virtual WAN instance as the hub in a Virtual Network Manager hub-and-spoke topology configuration?

No, an Azure Virtual WAN hub isn't supported as the hub in a hub-and-spoke topology at this time.

### My virtual network isn't getting the configurations I'm expecting. How do I troubleshoot?

Use the following questions for possible solutions.

#### Have you deployed your configuration to the virtual network's region?

Configurations in Azure Virtual Network Manager don't take effect until they're deployed. Make a deployment to the virtual network's region with the appropriate configurations.

#### Is your virtual network in scope?

A network manager is delegated only enough access to apply configurations to virtual networks within your scope. If a resource is in your network group but out of scope, it doesn't receive any configurations.

#### Are you applying security rules to a virtual network that contains managed instances?

Azure SQL Managed Instance has some network requirements. These requirements are enforced through high-priority network intent policies whose purpose conflicts with security admin rules. By default, admin rule application is skipped on virtual networks that contain any of these intent policies. Because **Allow** rules pose no risk of conflict, you can opt to apply **Allow Only** rules by setting `AllowRulesOnly` on `securityConfiguration.properties.applyOnNetworkIntentPolicyBasedServices`.

#### Are you applying security rules to a virtual network or subnet that contains services that block security configuration rules?

Certain services require specific network requirements to function properly. These services include Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure Databricks, and Azure Application Gateway. By default, application of security admin rules is skipped on [virtual networks and subnets that contain any of these services](./concept-security-admins.md#nonapplication-of-security-admin-rules). Because **Allow** rules pose no risk of conflict, you can opt to apply **Allow Only** rules by setting the security configurations' `AllowRulesOnly` field on the `securityConfiguration.properties.applyOnNetworkIntentPolicyBasedServices` .NET class.
