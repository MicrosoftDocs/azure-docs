# Verify resource reachability with Virtual Network Verifier - Azure portal

In this article, you learn how to use Virtual Network Verifier in the Azure portal to verify the reachability of a storage account from a VM based on your applied network policies. As part of the process, you create a verifier workspace, create a reachability analysis intent, run a reachability analysis, and view the reachability analysis results. This article also demonstrates how you can delegate verifier workspaces to other users in your organization so they gain the ability to use a permitted verifier workspace.

[!INCLUDE [virtual-network-verifier-preview](../../includes/virtual-network-verifier-preview.md)]

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- An existing network manager instance. If you don't have a network manager instance, create one by following the instructions in [Create a virtual network manager](create-virtual-network-manager-portal.md).
  - A verifier workspace is a child resource of a network manager, so it must be created from a network manager instance. Once a verifier workspace exists, it can be accessed directly from the Azure portal by searching **Verifier workspaces**.
- Resources to verify reachability between. In this example, two virtual machines are used.

## Create a Virtual Network Verifier

In this step, you create a verifier workspace in your network manager to set up the reachability analysis intent needed to verify whether your virtual machine can reach your other virtual machine.

1. In the Azure portal, type **Network managers** into the search box on the task bar and select the desired network manager instance.
2. Within the network manager instance, navigate to the **Verifier workspace** pane to create a new verifier workspace.
3. Select **Create** to create a new verifier workspace.
4. On the **Create a virtual network manager verifier workspace** page, provide a name and optional description for your verifier workspace.


## Create a reachability analysis intent

In this step, you create a reachability analysis intent in your verifier workspace. This analysis intent describes the traffic path being checked for reachability.

1. Within the verifier workspace you created, select **Define an analysis intent** directly, or navigate to **Reachability analysis intents** under *Settings* and select **+ Create**.
2. Enter or select the following information, then select **Create** to create the reachability analysis intent.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Name** | Enter a name for the reachability analysis intent. |
    | **Protocol** | Select the protocol of the traffic you want to verify. |
    | **Source type** | Select the source type of either **Public internet**, **Virtual machines**, or **Subnet**. Select **Virtual machines** for this example. |
    | **Source** | If a virtual machine is selected as the source type, use the selection picker to select an instance from the parent network manager's scope. |
    | **Source IP address** | Enter an IPv4 or IPv6 address or a range using CIDR notation of the source you want to verify. |
    | **Source port** | Enter a port or a range of the source you want to verify. To specify any port, enter *. |
    | **Destination type** | Select the destination type of either **Public internet**, **Cosmos DB**, **Storage Account**, **SQL Server**, **Virtual machines**, or **Subnet**. Select **Virtual machines** for this example. |
    | **Destination** | If a Cosmos DB, storage account, SQL server, or virtual machine is selected as the destination type, use the selection picker to select an instance from the parent network manager's scope. |
    | **Destination IP address** | Enter an IPv4 or IPv6 address or a range using CIDR notation of the destination you want to verify. |
    | **Destination port** | Enter a port or a range of the destination you want to verify. To specify any port, enter *. |

3. Repeat the process to create more reachability analysis intents in the verifier workspace.

## Start an analysis

After setting up a reachability analysis intent, you can initiate an analysis. This analysis checks if a path exists between the source and destination specified in the intent, considering the network policies and resources that are currently in place. This analysis evaluates policies and resources within the scope of the verifier workspace's parent network manager.

1. Under **Reachability analysis intents**, select the checkbox next to the reachability analysis intent you want to analyze and select **Start analysis**.
2. In the **Start analysis** pane, enter a name and optional description for the analysis, and then select the **Start analysis** button.

> [!NOTE]
> The analysis run may take a few minutes to complete. You can monitor the progress of the analysis in the Azure Portal.
  
## View reachability analysis results
In this step, you view the results of the analysis you started in the previous step.

1. In the verifier workspace, select **Reachability analysis intents** under *Settings* and select the corresponding **View results** for your reachability analysis intent. Alternatively, navigate to **Reachability analysis results** and select the name of the result you want to view.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-verify-reachability-with-virtual-network-verifier/select-analysis-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Reachability analysis intent windows showing analysis intent run to view.":::

2. In the **View analysis results** pane, you can view the results of the analysis, including the status of the analysis, the path taken by the traffic, the resources traversed, and the result outcome.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-verify-reachability-with-virtual-network-verifier/view-analysis-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Reachability analysis results window with analysis results.":::

3. On the **Reachability analysis results** tab in the **View analysis results** pane, you see the results in a visual format. The visualization shows the path taken by the traffic and the resources traversed.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-verify-reachability-with-virtual-network-verifier/view-analysis-results-visualization.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Reachability analysis results window with visualization of analysis results.":::

4. Select one of the resources in the visualization to view the resource details. You can also select any of the lengths in the visualization to view details of that step.

5. Select the **JSON output** tab to view the full JSON output of the analysis result. The beginning of the JSON object details the outcome of the result, which indicates whether all packets reached, some packets reached, or no packets reached. Explanations are provided for each outcome and each reachability step.

6. Select **Close** to close the analysis results.


## Delegate a verifier workspace to other users

Optionally, you can delegate a verifier workspace to other users. This allows other users to use a network verifier's capability by granting them access to the verifier workspace, reachability analysis intents, analysis ability, and reachability analysis results. Each verifier workspace in a network manager has its own permissions, so granting a user access to one verifier workspace doesn't result in access to all verifier workspaces under the same network manager. Granting a user permission to a verifier workspace also doesn't result in any access to the rest of the parent network manager.

1. In the verifier workspace, select **Access control (IAM)**.
2. Select **+ Add** and **Add role assignment**.
3. Within *Add role assignment* and the *Role* tab, select the **Privileged administrator roles** tab and select the **Contributor** role.
4. Select the **Members** tab and add the users you want to have access to the verifier workspace to by clicking **+ Select members**.
5. Select **Review + assign**.
