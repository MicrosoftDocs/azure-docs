# Data trustee principle

To help meet the needs of customers and prospective customers in the European Union (EU), the European Free Trade
Association (EFTA), and the UK, along with their concerns about security and privacy of their online data, Microsoft 
has developed Microsoft Azure Germany, which comprises industry-leading cloud services
**hosted and operated entirely under special security measures in Germany**. 

Thereby, a local company controls access to
customer data, so long as access is not granted by the customer or end user. This ensures that the data owners keep
sovereignty and the decision-making powers over their data – especially against third parties such as domestic or foreign
supervisory and law enforcement authorities, which may only access customer data in regulatory and compliant cases
under the requirements of the German law.

Azure Germany offers a separate instance of Microsoft Azure services from within German datacenters. The datacenters are 
located in two German locations, Frankfurt/Main and Magdeburg, which
ensure that customer data remains in Germany and are connected to one another through a
private network. All customer data is exclusively stored in those datacenters in Germany.
A designated German company — the German data trustee — controls access to customer data and the systems and
infrastructure that hold customer data. 

The German data trustee is an independent company that is headquartered, incorporated, owned, and controlled in
Germany and is subject to German law. For Microsoft Azure Germany, T-Systems International, a subsidiary company of
Deutsche Telekom, has been contracted as the data trustee. The main characteristic of the data trustee model is that
Microsoft is only granted access to customer data in contractually compliant cases by and under the supervision of the
German data trustee or by the customer itself. At the same time, Microsoft Azure Germany integrates and unifies state-of-the-art security measures as well as global standards for datacenters.

Microsoft administers all aspects of operation and provision of Azure Germany services that do not require access to customer data. It ensures that there is no connection with other Microsoft global cloud services. Microsoft remains responsible to its customers for SLAs (Service Level Agreements), as well as for most operational aspects that do not enable access to customer data.

In contrast, the German data trustee is responsible for all tasks and processes that require physical or logical access to infrastructure in 
Germany storing customer data, and the data trustee controls all access to customer data other than access initiated by the customer or end users. 



In total, the following features are characteristic for Azure Germany:

* All data provided by the customer through its use of Azure Germany is stored in German datacenters only.
* Datacenters are located in Germany and (physical) access is monitored and controlled through a well-known German
data trustee (T-Systems International).
* Depending on the service used, there is constant data synchronization between both datacenters in
Germany in order to ensure continuity of business processes and to enable emergency recovery.
* Access to customer data is under the control of the data trustee.
* The data trustee operates under German law.
