# Why have you received a notification that your Azure subscription has a past due balance?
If you are the Account Administrator for your Azure subscription, and have not made your payment on time, you will receive an email notification about your past due balance or you will see an alert either on [https://account.windowsazure.com](https://account.windowsazure.com) or [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

If we are unable to process your payment for some reason, you might receive an email with a message similar to:

**We have been unable to charge your credit card for your subscription. To prevent any service interruptions, please update your payment information.**

Make sure you are getting notification emails. If you are not getting notification emails, you may be using different email addresses for login and Account Admin . The email address in the Account Administrator’s profile is used by Microsoft to notify you about important billing-related updates about the subscription. We recommend that you specify a contact email address that you check regularly.

## What will happen if you forget to pay
The service will be canceled and your resources will no longer be available. Any data will be deleted 90 days after the service is terminated.

## What can you do to resolve the issue
Pay your outstanding balance in full.

**Scenario 1**: If you are on an invoice mode of payment, send your payment to the location listed at the bottom of your invoice. If you need help, contact [Azure Support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade).

**Scenario 2**: If the bill is not paid because the credit card on file was declined, or has expired, use another credit card or payment method for the subscriptions, or contact your bank to resolve the issue. If you update the payment method, all outstanding charges against that payment method will automatically be settled immediately. This includes outstanding charges for Azure as well as any other Microsoft services for which that card was used.

For instructions about how to change the payment method in Azure, see [How to change the credit card used to pay for an Azure subscription](billing-how-to-change-credit-card.md). You must log on as an Account Administrator to make this change.

**Scenario 3**:  If the bill notice was not received because the Account Administrator has left the company or changed roles, contact [Azure Support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to resolve the issue.
