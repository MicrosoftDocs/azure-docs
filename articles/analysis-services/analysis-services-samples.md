# Azure Analysis Services samples

Use the following sample resources to help you learn about and test Analysis Services for your environment.

## Code samples

The [Analysis Services](https://github.com/Microsoft/Analysis-Services) repository on GitHub includes open source code samples and community projects. 

## Tabular model project and database samples

[Adventure Works for Analysis Services](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks-analysis-services) on GitHub is the most commonly used sample tabular model project. You can download a VS project or a completed sample tabular model database.

## Sample database on Azure

Azure Synapse Analytics (SQL Data Warehouse) provides a sample AdventureWorksDW database that can be included in a provisioned resource. To learn more, see [Quickstart: Create and query an Azure Synapse Analytics SQL pool](/azure/sql-data-warehouse/create-data-warehouse-portal).

## Sample databases on GitHub

These sample databases on GitHub can be used for creating and testing your own models. 

[Adventure Works sample databases](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks)

[Wide World Importers sample databases](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/wide-world-importers-v1.0)
