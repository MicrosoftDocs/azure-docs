# Azure Container Registry webhook reference

You can [configure webhooks](container-registry-webhook.md) for your container registry that generate events when certain actions are performed against it. For example, you can enable webhooks that are triggered on container image `push` and `delete` operations. When a webhook is triggered, Azure Container Registry issues an HTTP or HTTPS request containing information about the event to an endpoint you specify. Your endpoint can then process the webhook and act accordingly.

The following sections detail the schema of webhook requests generated by supported events. The event sections contain the payload schema for the event type, an example request payload, and one or more example commands that would trigger the webhook.

For information about configuring webhooks for your Azure container registry, see [Using Azure Container Registry webhooks](container-registry-webhook.md).

## Webhook requests

### HTTP request

A triggered webhook makes an HTTP `POST` request to the URL endpoint you specified when you configured the webhook.

### HTTP headers

Webhook requests include a `Content-Type` of `application/json` if you have not specified a `Content-Type` custom header for your webhook.

No other headers are added to the request beyond those custom headers you might have specified for the webhook.

## Push event

Webhook triggered when a container image is pushed to a repository.

### Push event payload

|Element|Type|Description|
|-------------|----------|-----------|
|`id`|String|The ID of the webhook event.|
|`timestamp`|DateTime|The time at which the webhook event was triggered.|
|`action`|String|The action that triggered the webhook event.|
|[target](#target)|Complex Type|The target of the event that triggered the webhook event.|
|[request](#request)|Complex Type|The request that generated the webhook event.|

### target

|Element|Type|Description|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|`mediaType`|String|The MIME type of the referenced object.|
|`size`|Int32|The number of bytes of the content. Same as Length field.|
|`digest`|String|The digest of the content, as defined by the Registry V2 HTTP API Specification.|
|`length`|Int32|The number of bytes of the content. Same as Size field.|
|`repository`|String|The repository name.|
|`tag`|String|The image tag name.|

### request

|Element|Type|Description|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|`id`|String|The ID of the request that initiated the event.|
|`host`|String|The externally accessible hostname of the registry instance, as specified by the HTTP host header on incoming requests.|
|`method`|String|The request method that generated the event.|
|`useragent`|String|The user agent header of the request.|

### Payload example: push event

```JSON
{
  "id": "cb8c3971-9adc-488b-bdd8-43cbb4974ff5",
  "timestamp": "2017-11-17T16:52:01.343145347Z",
  "action": "push",
  "target": {
    "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
    "size": 524,
    "digest": "sha256:80f0d5c8786bb9e621a45ece0db56d11cdc624ad20da9fe62e9d25490f331d7d",
    "length": 524,
    "repository": "hello-world",
    "tag": "v1"
  },
  "request": {
    "id": "3cbb6949-7549-4fa1-86cd-a6d5451dffc7",

### <a name="delete_target"></a> target

|Element|Type|Description|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|`mediaType`|String|The MIME type of the referenced object.|

### Payload example: delete event

```JSON
{
    "id": "afc359ce-df7f-4e32-bdde-1ff8aa80927b",

    "target": {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
      "digest": "sha256:80f0d5c8786bb9e621a45ece0db56d11cdc624ad20da9fe62e9d25490f331d7d",

Example [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/acr) commands that trigger a **delete** event webhook:

```azurecli
# Delete repository
az acr repository delete -n MyRegistry --repository MyRepository

# Delete manifest
az acr repository delete -n MyRegistry --repository MyRepository --tag MyTag --manifest
```
