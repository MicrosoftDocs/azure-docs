# Tutorial: Configure caches in Azure Cache for Redis using Ansible

[!INCLUDE [ansible-28-note.md](../../includes/ansible-28-note.md)]

[Azure Cache for Redis](/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/) is an open-source compatible service that allows you to build responsive apps by providing fast access to data.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md](../../includes/open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md)]
[!INCLUDE [ansible-prereqs-cloudshell-use-or-vm-creation2.md](../../includes/ansible-prereqs-cloudshell-use-or-vm-creation2.md)]

## Create a cache

Create an Azure Cache for Redis within a new resource group.

```yml
  - name: Create resource group
    azure_rm_resourcegroup:
      name: "{{ resource_group }}"
      location: "{{ location }}"

  - name: Create Azure Cache for Redis
    azure_rm_rediscache:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ redis_name }}"
      sku:
        name: basic
        size: C1 
```

It can take several minutes to provision a cache. The following code tells Ansible wait for the operation to complete:

```yml
  - name: Wait for Redis provisioning to complete
    azure_rm_rediscache_facts:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ redis_name }}"
    register: facts
    until: "{{ facts.rediscaches[0]['provisioning_state'] == 'Succeeded' }}"
    retries: 100
    delay: 60
```

During the lengthy provisioning process, several "error" messages will be displayed. These messages can safely be ignored. The important message is the last message. In the following example, there are many error messages until the final ("ok") message.

```Output
FAILED - RETRYING: Get facts (100 retries left).
FAILED - RETRYING: Get facts (99 retries left).
FAILED - RETRYING: Get facts (98 retries left).
FAILED - RETRYING: Get facts (97 retries left).
FAILED - RETRYING: Get facts (96 retries left).
FAILED - RETRYING: Get facts (95 retries left).
FAILED - RETRYING: Get facts (94 retries left).
FAILED - RETRYING: Get facts (93 retries left).
FAILED - RETRYING: Get facts (92 retries left).
FAILED - RETRYING: Get facts (91 retries left).
ok: [localhost]
```

## Scale the cache

Azure Cache for Redis has different cache offerings depending on your app's needs. These cache options provide flexibility in the choice of cache size and features. If your app requirements change after the cache is created, you can scale the cache as needed. For more information about scaling, see [How to Scale Azure Cache for Redis](/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-how-to-scale).

The following sample code scales the cache to **Standard**:

```yml
- name: Scale up Azure Cache for Redis
    azure_rm_rediscache:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ redis_name }}"
      sku:
        name: standard
        size: C1
```

It can take several minutes to scale a cache. The following code tells Ansible wait for the operation to complete:

```yml
  - name: Wait for Redis scaling up to complete
    azure_rm_rediscache_facts:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ redis_name }}"
    register: facts
    until: "{{ facts.rediscaches[0]['provisioning_state'] == 'Succeeded' }}"
    retries: 100
    delay: 60
```

Similar to the task to provision Azure Cache for Redis, output like the following message is normal:

```Ouput
**FAILED - RETRYING: Get facts (100 retries left)** is normal.
```

## Reboot the cache

The following code reboots the cache created in previous sections.

```yml
  - name: Reboot Azure Cache for Redis
    azure_rm_rediscache:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ redis_name }}"
      reboot:
        reboot_type: all
```

### Add firewall rule

The following code adds a firewall rule to the cache:

```yml
  - name: Add Firewall rule
    azure_rm_rediscachefirewallrule:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      cache_name: "{{ redis_name }}"
      name: rule1
      start_ip_address: 168.1.1.1
      end_ip_address: 168.1.1.4
```

## Delete the cache

The following code deletes the cache:

```yml
  - name: Delete Azure Cache for Redis
    azure_rm_rediscache:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ redis_name }}"
      state: absent
```

## Get the sample playbook

There are two ways to get the complete sample playbook:
- [Download the playbook](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ansible-playbooks/blob/master/rediscache.yml) and save it to `rediscache.yml`.
- Create a new file named `rediscache.yml` and copy into it the following contents:

```yml
- name: Manage Azure Cache for Redis
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  vars:
    resource_group: "{{ resource_group_name }}"
    redis_name: "redis{{ resource_group_name }}"
    location: eastus2

  roles:
    - azure.azure_preview_modules

  tasks:
  - name: Create resource group
    azure_rm_resourcegroup:
      name: "{{ resource_group }}"
      location: "{{ location }}"

  - name: Create Azure Cache for Redis
    azure_rm_rediscache:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ redis_name }}"
      sku:
        name: basic
        size: C1

  - name: Wait for Redis provisioning to complete
    azure_rm_rediscache_facts:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ redis_name }}"
    register: facts
    until: "{{ facts.rediscaches[0]['provisioning_state'] == 'Succeeded' }}"
    retries: 100
    delay: 60

  - name: Scale up Azure Cache for Redis
    azure_rm_rediscache:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ redis_name }}"
      sku:
        name: standard
        size: C1

  - name: Wait for Redis scaling up to complete
    azure_rm_rediscache_facts:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ redis_name }}"
    register: facts
    until: "{{ facts.rediscaches[0]['provisioning_state'] == 'Succeeded' }}"
    retries: 100
    delay: 60

  - name: Reboot Azure Cache for Redis
    azure_rm_rediscache:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ redis_name }}"
      reboot:
        reboot_type: all

  - name: Add Firewall rule
    azure_rm_rediscachefirewallrule:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      cache_name: "{{ redis_name }}"
      name: rule1
      start_ip_address: 168.1.1.1
      end_ip_address: 168.1.1.4

  - name: Delete Azure Cache for Redis
    azure_rm_rediscache:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ redis_name }}"
      state: absent
```

## Run the sample playbook

In this section, run the playbook to test various features shown in this article.

In the `vars` section, replace the `{{ resource_group_name }}` placeholder with the name of your resource group.

Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook rediscache.yml
```

The output looks similar to the following results:

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resources created in this article. 

Save the following code as `cleanup.yml`:

```yml
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
    resource_group: "{{ resource_group_name }}"
  tasks:
    - name: Delete a resource group
      azure_rm_resourcegroup:
        name: "{{ resource_group }}"
        state: absent
```

In the `vars` section, replace the `{{ resource_group_name }}` placeholder with the name of your resource group.

Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook cleanup.yml
```
