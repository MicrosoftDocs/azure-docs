# Calculate the size of a Blob storage container

This script calculates the size of a container in Azure Blob storage by totaling the size of the blobs in the container.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This CLI script provides an estimated size for the container and should not be used for billing calculations.
>
> The maximum number of blobs returned with a single listing call is 5000. If you need to return more than 5000 blobs, use a continuation token to request additional sets of results.
