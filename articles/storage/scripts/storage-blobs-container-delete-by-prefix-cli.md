# Use an Azure CLI script to delete containers based on container name prefix

This script first creates a few sample containers in Azure Blob storage, then deletes some of the containers based on a prefix in the container name.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

## Sample script

[!INCLUDE [cli-launch-cloud-shell-sign-in.md](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/cli-launch-cloud-shell-sign-in.md)]

### Run the script

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azure_cli_scripts/storage/delete-containers-by-prefix/delete-containers-by-prefix.sh" id="FullScript":::

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [cli-clean-up-resources.md](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/cli-clean-up-resources.md)]

```azurecli
az group delete --name $resourceGroup
```
