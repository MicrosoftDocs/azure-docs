# Use Azure Storage Explorer to manage directories and files in Azure Data Lake Storage

This article shows you how to use [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) to create and manage directories and files in storage accounts that have hierarchical namespace (HNS) enabled.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. See [Get Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

- A storage account that has hierarchical namespace (HNS) enabled. Follow [these](../common/storage-account-create.md) instructions to create one.

- Azure Storage Explorer installed on your local computer. To install Azure Storage Explorer for Windows, Macintosh, or Linux, see [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/).

> [!NOTE]
> Storage Explorer makes use of both the Blob (blob) & Data Lake Storage (dfs) [endpoints](../common/storage-private-endpoints.md#private-endpoints-for-azure-storage) when working with Azure Data Lake Storage. If access to Azure Data Lake Storage is configured using private endpoints, ensure that two private endpoints are created for the storage account: one with the target sub-resource `blob` and the other with the target sub-resource `dfs`.

## Sign in to Storage Explorer

When you first start Storage Explorer, the **Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer - Connect to Azure Storage** window appears. While Storage Explorer provides several ways to connect to storage accounts, only one way is currently supported for managing ACLs.

In the **Select Resource** panel, select **Subscription**.

In the **Select Azure Environment** panel, select an Azure environment to sign in to. You can sign in to global Azure, a national cloud or an Azure Stack instance. Then select **Next**.

Storage Explorer opens a webpage for you to sign in.

After you successfully sign in with an Azure account, the account and the Azure subscriptions associated with that account appear under **ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT**. Select the Azure subscriptions that you want to work with, and then select **Open Explorer**.

:::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer, and highlights the Account Management pane and Open Explorer button." source="./media/data-lake-storage-explorer/storage-explorer-account-panel-sml.png"  lightbox="./media/data-lake-storage-explorer-acl/storage-explorer-account-panel-sml.png":::

When it completes connecting, Azure Storage Explorer loads with the **Explorer** tab shown. This view gives you insight to all of your Azure storage accounts as well as local storage configured through the [Azurite storage emulator](../common/storage-use-azurite.md?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json) or [Azure Stack](/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-storage-connect-se?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json) environments.

## Create a container

A container holds directories and files. To create one, expand the storage account you created in the proceeding step. Select **Blob Containers**, right-click, and select **Create Blob Container**. Alternatively, you can select **Blob Containers**, then select **Create Blob Container** in the **Actions** pane. 

:::image type="content" alt-text="Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer - Create a container" source="./media/data-lake-storage-explorer/creating-a-filesystem-sml.png" lightbox="./media/data-lake-storage-explorer/creating-a-filesystem-lrg.png" :::

Enter the name for your container. See the [Create a container](storage-quickstart-blobs-dotnet.md#create-a-container) section for a list of rules and restrictions on naming containers. When complete, press **Enter** to create the container. After the container has been successfully created, it's displayed under the **Blob Containers** folder for the selected storage account.

## Create a directory

To create a directory, select the container that you created in the proceeding step. In the container ribbon, choose the **New Folder** button. Enter the name for your directory. When complete, press **Enter** to create the directory. After the directory has been successfully created, it appears in the editor window.

## Upload blobs to the directory

On the directory ribbon, choose the **Upload** button. This operation gives you the option to upload a folder or a file.

Choose the files or folder to upload.

:::image type="content" alt-text="Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer - upload a blob" source="media/data-lake-storage-explorer/storage-explorer-upload-file-sml.png" lightbox="media/data-lake-storage-explorer/storage-explorer-upload-file-lrg.png" :::

When you select **Upload**, the files selected are queued, and each file is uploaded. When the upload is complete, the results are shown in the **Activities** window.

## View blobs in a directory

In the **Azure Storage Explorer** application, select a directory under a storage account. The main pane shows a list of the blobs in the selected directory.

## Download blobs

To download files by using **Azure Storage Explorer**, with a file selected, select **Download** from the ribbon. A file dialog opens and provides you with the ability to enter a file name. Select **Select Folder** to start the download of a file to the local location.
