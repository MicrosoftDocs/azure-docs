# Customer intent: As a developer, I want to use the Azure CLI to upload, download, and list blobs in Azure Blob storage, so that I can effectively manage my data transfers and storage operations in the cloud.

# Quickstart: Create, download, and list blobs with Azure CLI

The Azure CLI is Azure's command-line experience for managing Azure resources. You can use it in your browser with Azure Cloud Shell. You can also install it on macOS, Linux, or Windows and run it from the command line. In this quickstart, you learn to use the Azure CLI to upload and download data to and from Azure Blob storage.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [storage-quickstart-prereq-include](../../../includes/storage-quickstart-prereq-include.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-h3.md)]

- This article requires version 2.0.46 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Authorize access to Blob storage

You can authorize access to Blob storage from the Azure CLI either with Microsoft Entra credentials or by using the storage account access key. Using Microsoft Entra credentials is recommended. This article shows how to authorize Blob storage operations using Microsoft Entra ID.

Azure CLI commands for data operations against Blob storage support the `--auth-mode` parameter, which enables you to specify how to authorize a given operation. Set the `--auth-mode` parameter to `login` to authorize with Microsoft Entra credentials. For more information, see [Authorize access to blob or queue data with Azure CLI](./authorize-data-operations-cli.md?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json).

Only Blob storage data operations support the `--auth-mode` parameter. Management operations, such as creating a resource group or storage account, automatically use Microsoft Entra credentials for authorization.

To begin, sign-in to to your Azure account with the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login).

```azurecli
az login
```

## Create a resource group

Create an Azure resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command. A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

Remember to replace placeholder values in angle brackets with your own values:

```azurecli
az group create \
    --name <resource-group> \
    --location <location>
```

## Create a storage account

Create a general-purpose storage account with the [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-create) command. The general-purpose storage account can be used for all four services: blobs, files, tables, and queues.

Remember to replace placeholder values in angle brackets with your own values:

```azurecli
az storage account create \
    --name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource-group> \
    --location <location> \
    --sku Standard_ZRS \
    --encryption-services blob
```

## Create a container

Blobs are always uploaded into a container. You can organize groups of blobs in containers similar to the way you organize your files on your computer in folders. Create a container for storing blobs with the [az storage container create](/cli/azure/storage/container#az-storage-container-create) command.

The following example uses your Microsoft Entra account to authorize the operation to create the container. Before you create the container, assign the [Storage Blob Data Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-contributor) role to yourself. Even if you are the account owner, you need explicit permissions to perform data operations against the storage account. For more information about assigning Azure roles, see [Assign an Azure role for access to blob data](assign-azure-role-data-access.md).

Remember to replace placeholder values in angle brackets with your own values:

```azurecli
az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv | az role assignment create \
    --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
    --assignee @- \
    --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account>"

az storage container create \
    --account-name <storage-account> \
    --name <container> \
    --auth-mode login
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure role assignments may take a few minutes to propagate.

You can also use the storage account key to authorize the operation to create the container. For more information about authorizing data operations with Azure CLI, see [Authorize access to blob or queue data with Azure CLI](./authorize-data-operations-cli.md?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json).

## Upload a blob

Blob storage supports block blobs, append blobs, and page blobs. The examples in this quickstart show how to work with block blobs.

First, create a file to upload to a block blob. If you're using Azure Cloud Shell, use the following command to create a file:

```bash
vi helloworld
```

When the file opens, press **insert**. Type *Hello world*, then press **Esc**. Next, type *:x*, then press **Enter**.

In this example, you upload a blob to the container you created in the last step using the [az storage blob upload](/cli/azure/storage/blob#az-storage-blob-upload) command. It's not necessary to specify a file path since the file was created at the root directory. Remember to replace placeholder values in angle brackets with your own values:

```azurecli
az storage blob upload \
    --account-name <storage-account> \
    --container-name <container> \
    --name myFile.txt \
    --file myFile.txt \
    --auth-mode login
```

This operation creates the blob if it doesn't already exist, and overwrites it if it does. Upload as many files as you like before continuing.

When you upload a blob using the Azure CLI, it issues respective [REST API calls](/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api) via http and https protocols. 

To upload multiple files at the same time, you can use the [az storage blob upload-batch](/cli/azure/storage/blob#az-storage-blob-upload-batch) command.

## List the blobs in a container

List the blobs in the container with the [az storage blob list](/cli/azure/storage/blob#az-storage-blob-list) command. Remember to replace placeholder values in angle brackets with your own values:

```azurecli
az storage blob list \
    --account-name <storage-account> \
    --container-name <container> \
    --output table \
    --auth-mode login
```

## Download a blob

Use the [az storage blob download](/cli/azure/storage/blob#az-storage-blob-download) command to download the blob you uploaded earlier. Remember to replace placeholder values in angle brackets with your own values:

```azurecli
az storage blob download \
    --account-name <storage-account> \
    --container-name <container> \
    --name myFile.txt \
    --file <~/destination/path/for/file> \
    --auth-mode login
```

## Data transfer with AzCopy

The AzCopy command-line utility offers high-performance, scriptable data transfer for Azure Storage. You can use AzCopy to transfer data to and from Blob storage and Azure Files. For more information about AzCopy v10, the latest version of AzCopy, see [Get started with AzCopy](../common/storage-use-azcopy-v10.md). To learn about using AzCopy v10 with Blob storage, see [Transfer data with AzCopy and Blob storage](../common/storage-use-azcopy-v10.md#transfer-data).

The following example uses AzCopy to upload a local file to a blob. Remember to replace the sample values with your own values:

```bash
azcopy login
azcopy copy 'C:\myDirectory\myFile.txt' 'https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myFile.txt'
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to delete the resources you created as part of this quickstart, including the storage account, delete the resource group by using the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command. Remember to replace placeholder values in angle brackets with your own values:

```azurecli
az group delete \
    --name <resource-group> \
    --no-wait
```
