# Enable soft delete for blobs

Blob soft delete protects an individual blob and its versions, snapshots, and metadata from accidental deletes or overwrites by maintaining the deleted data in the system for a specified period of time. During the retention period, you can restore the blob to its state at deletion. After the retention period has expired, the blob is permanently deleted. For more information about blob soft delete, see [Soft delete for blobs](soft-delete-blob-overview.md).

Blob soft delete is part of a comprehensive data protection strategy for blob data. To learn more about Microsoft's recommendations for data protection, see [Data protection overview](data-protection-overview.md).

## Enable blob soft delete

You can enable or disable soft delete for a storage account at any time by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI.

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Blob soft delete is enabled by default when you create a new storage account with the Azure portal. The setting to enable or disable blob soft delete when you create a new storage account is on the **Data protection** tab. For more information about creating a storage account, see [Create a storage account](../common/storage-account-create.md).

To enable blob soft delete for an existing storage account by using the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to your storage account.
1. Locate the **Data Protection** option under **Data management**.
1. In the **Recovery** section, select **Turn on soft delete for blobs**.
1. Specify a retention period between 1 and 365 days. Microsoft recommends a minimum retention period of seven days.
1. Save your changes.

### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Blob soft delete is not enabled when you create a new storage account with PowerShell. You can enable blob soft delete after the new account has been created.

To enable blob soft delete for an existing storage account with PowerShell, call the [Enable-AzStorageBlobDeleteRetentionPolicy](/powershell/module/az.storage/enable-azstorageblobdeleteretentionpolicy) command, specifying the retention period in days.

The following example enables blob soft delete and sets the retention period to seven days. Remember to replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values:

```azurepowershell
Enable-AzStorageBlobDeleteRetentionPolicy -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> `
    -StorageAccountName <storage-account> `
    -RetentionDays 7
```

To check the current settings for blob soft delete, call the [Get-AzStorageBlobServiceProperty](/powershell/module/az.storage/get-azstorageblobserviceproperty) command:

```azurepowershell
$properties = Get-AzStorageBlobServiceProperty -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> `
    -StorageAccountName <storage-account>
$properties.DeleteRetentionPolicy.Enabled
$properties.DeleteRetentionPolicy.Days
```

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-CLI)

Blob soft delete is not enabled when you create a new storage account with Azure CLI. You can enable blob soft delete after the new account has been created.

To enable blob soft delete for an existing storage account with Azure CLI, call the [az storage account blob-service-properties update](/cli/azure/storage/account/blob-service-properties#az-storage-account-blob-service-properties-update) command, specifying the retention period in days.

The following example enables blob soft delete and sets the retention period to seven days. Remember to replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values:

```azurecli-interactive
az storage account blob-service-properties update --account-name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource-group> \
    --enable-delete-retention true \
    --delete-retention-days 7
```

To check the current settings for blob soft delete, call the [az storage account blob-service-properties show](/cli/azure/storage/account/blob-service-properties#az-storage-account-blob-service-properties-show) command:

```azurecli-interactive
az storage account blob-service-properties show --account-name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource-group>
```

### [Template](#tab/template)

To enable blob soft delete with an Azure Resource Manager template, create a template that sets the **deleteRetentionPolicy** property. The following steps describe how to create a template in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, choose **Create a resource**.
1. In **Search the Marketplace**, type **Deploy a custom template**, and then press **ENTER**.
1. Choose **Build your own template in the editor**.
1. In the template editor, paste in the following JSON. Replace the `<account-name>` placeholder with the name of your storage account.

    ```json
      {
      "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
      "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
      "parameters": {},
      "variables": {},
      "resources": [
            {
               "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices",
               "apiVersion": "2023-04-01",
               "name": "<account-name>/default",
               "properties": {
                     "deleteRetentionPolicy": {
                        "enabled": true,
                        "days": 7
                  }
               }
            }
      ]
      }
    ```

1. Specify the retention period. The default value is 7.
1. Save the template.
1. Specify the resource group of the account, and then choose the **Review + create** button to deploy the template and enable container soft delete.

### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

1. Install the latest **PowershellGet** module. Then, close and reopen the PowerShell console.

    ```powershell
    Install-Module PowerShellGet -Repository PSGallery -Force
    ```

2. Install **Az.Storage** preview module.

    ```powershell
    Install-Module Az.Storage -Repository PsGallery -RequiredVersion 3.7.1-preview -AllowClobber -AllowPrerelease -Force
    ```

    For more information about how to install PowerShell modules, see [Install the Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell)

3. Obtain storage account authorization by using either a storage account key, a connection string, or Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see [Connect to the account](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-powershell.md#connect-to-the-account).

   The following example obtains authorization by using a storage account key.

   ```powershell
   $ctx = New-AzStorageContext -StorageAccountName '<storage-account-name>' -StorageAccountKey '<storage-account-key>'
   ```

4. To enable blob soft delete with PowerShell, use the [Enable-AzStorageDeleteRetentionPolicy](/powershell/module/az.storage/enable-azstoragedeleteretentionpolicy) command, and specify the retention period in days.

   The following example enables soft delete for an account, and sets the retention period to 4 days.

   ```powershell
   Enable-AzStorageDeleteRetentionPolicy -RetentionDays 4  -Context $ctx
   ```

5. To check the current settings for blob soft delete, use the `Get-AzStorageServiceProperty` command:

   ```powershell
    Get-AzStorageServiceProperty -ServiceType Blob -Context $ctx
   ```

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-CLI)

1. Open the [Azure Cloud Shell](../../cloud-shell/overview.md), or if you've [installed](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) the Azure CLI locally, open a command console application such as Windows PowerShell.

2. Install the `storage-preview` extension.

   ```azurecli
   az extension add -n storage-preview
   ```

3. Connect to your storage account. For more information, see [Connect to the account](data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-cli.md#connect-to-the-account).

   > [!NOTE]
   > The example presented in this article show Microsoft Entra authorization. To learn more about authorization methods, see [Authorize access to blob or queue data with Azure CLI](./authorize-data-operations-cli.md).

4. To enable soft delete with Azure CLI, call the `az storage fs service-properties update` command, specifying the retention period in days.

   The following example enables blob and directory soft delete and sets the retention period to 5 days.

   ```azurecli
   az storage fs service-properties update --delete-retention --delete-retention-period 5 --auth-mode login
   ```

5. To check the current settings for blob soft delete, call the `az storage fs service-properties update` command:

   ```azurecli
   az storage fs service-properties update --delete-retention false --connection-string $con
   ```

### [Template](#tab/template)

To enable blob soft delete with an Azure Resource Manager template, create a template that sets the **deleteRetentionPolicy** property. The following steps describe how to create a template in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, choose **Create a resource**.
1. In **Search the Marketplace**, type **Deploy a custom template**, and then press **ENTER**.
1. Choose **Build your own template in the editor**.
1. In the template editor, paste in the following JSON. Replace the `<account-name>` placeholder with the name of your storage account.
