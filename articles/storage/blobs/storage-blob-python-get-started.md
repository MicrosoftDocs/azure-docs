# Get started with Azure Blob Storage and Python

[!INCLUDE [storage-dev-guide-selector-getting-started](../../../includes/storage-dev-guides/storage-dev-guide-selector-getting-started.md)]

This article shows you how to connect to Azure Blob Storage by using the Azure Blob Storage client library for Python. Once connected, use the [developer guides](#build-your-app) to learn how your code can operate on containers, blobs, and features of the Blob Storage service.

If you're looking to start with a complete example, see [Quickstart: Azure Blob Storage client library for Python](storage-quickstart-blobs-python.md).

[API reference](/python/api/azure-storage-blob) | [Package (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-storage-blob/) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob) | [Samples](../common/storage-samples-python.md?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json#blob-samples) | [Give feedback](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Azure storage account - [create a storage account](../common/storage-account-create.md)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.8+

## Set up your project

This section walks you through preparing a project to work with the Azure Blob Storage client library for Python.

From your project directory, install packages for the Azure Blob Storage and Azure Identity client libraries using the `pip install` command. The **azure-identity** package is needed for passwordless connections to Azure services.

```console
pip install azure-storage-blob azure-identity
```

Then open your code file and add the necessary import statements. In this example, we add the following to our *.py* file:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient, BlobClient, ContainerClient
```

Blob client library information:

- [azure.storage.blob](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob): Contains the primary classes (_client objects_) that you can use to operate on the service, containers, and blobs.

### Asynchronous programming

The Azure Blob Storage client library for Python supports both synchronous and asynchronous APIs. The asynchronous APIs are based on Python's [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) library. 

Follow these steps to use the asynchronous APIs in your project:

- Install an async transport, such as [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/). You can install `aiohttp` along with `azure-storage-blob` by using an optional dependency install command. In this example, we use the following `pip install` command:

    ```console
    pip install azure-storage-blob[aio]
    ```

- Open your code file and add the necessary import statements. In this example, we add the following to our *.py* file:

    ```python
    import asyncio

    from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential
    from azure.storage.blob.aio import BlobServiceClient, BlobClient, ContainerClient
    ```

    The `import asyncio` statement is only required if you're using the library in your code. It's added here for clarity, as the examples in the [developer guide articles](#build-your-app) use the `asyncio` library.

- Create a client object using `async with` to begin working with data resources. Only the top level client needs to use `async with`, as other clients created from it share the same connection pool. In this example, we create a `BlobServiceClient` object using `async with`, and then create a `ContainerClient` object:

    ```python
    async with BlobServiceClient(account_url, credential=credential) as blob_service_client:
        container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client(container="sample-container")
    ```

    To learn more, see the async examples in [Authorize access and connect to Blob Storage](#authorize-access-and-connect-to-blob-storage).

Blob async client library information:

- [azure.storage.blob.aio](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.aio): Contains the primary classes that you can use to operate on the service, containers, and blobs asynchronously.

## Authorize access and connect to Blob Storage

To connect an app to Blob Storage, create an instance of the [BlobServiceClient](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclient) class. This object is your starting point to interact with data resources at the storage account level. You can use it to operate on the storage account and its containers. You can also use the service client to create container clients or blob clients, depending on the resource you need to work with.

To learn more about creating and managing client objects, including best practices, see [Create and manage client objects that interact with data resources](storage-blob-client-management.md).

You can authorize a `BlobServiceClient` object by using a Microsoft Entra authorization token, an account access key, or a shared access signature (SAS). For optimal security, Microsoft recommends using Microsoft Entra ID with managed identities to authorize requests against blob data. For more information, see [Authorize access to blobs using Microsoft Entra ID](authorize-access-azure-active-directory.md).

<a name='azure-ad'></a>

## [Microsoft Entra ID (recommended)](#tab/azure-ad)

To authorize with Microsoft Entra ID, you need to use a [security principal](../../active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals.md). Which type of security principal you need depends on where your app runs. Use the following table as a guide:

| Where the app runs | Security principal | Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local machine (developing and testing) | Service principal | To learn how to register the app, set up a Microsoft Entra group, assign roles, and configure environment variables, see [Authorize access using developer service principals](/azure/developer/python/sdk/authentication-local-development-service-principal?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json&bc=/azure/storage/blobs/breadcrumb/toc.json) | 
| Local machine (developing and testing) | User identity | To learn how to set up a Microsoft Entra group, assign roles, and sign in to Azure, see [Authorize access using developer credentials](/azure/developer/python/sdk/authentication-local-development-dev-accounts?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json&bc=/azure/storage/blobs/breadcrumb/toc.json) | 
| Hosted in Azure | Managed identity | To learn how to enable managed identity and assign roles, see [Authorize access from Azure-hosted apps using a managed identity](/azure/developer/python/sdk/authentication-azure-hosted-apps?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json&bc=/azure/storage/blobs/breadcrumb/toc.json) |
| Hosted outside of Azure (for example, on-premises apps) | Service principal | To learn how to register the app, assign roles, and configure environment variables, see [Authorize access from on-premises apps using an application service principal](/azure/developer/python/sdk/authentication-on-premises-apps?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json&bc=/azure/storage/blobs/breadcrumb/toc.json) |

#### Authorize access using DefaultAzureCredential

An easy and secure way to authorize access and connect to Blob Storage is to obtain an OAuth token by creating a [DefaultAzureCredential](/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential) instance. You can then use that credential to create a [BlobServiceClient](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclient) object.

The following example creates a `BlobServiceClient` object using `DefaultAzureCredential`:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_auth.py" id="Snippet_get_service_client_DAC":::

If your project uses asynchronous APIs, instantiate `BlobServiceClient` using `async with`:

```python
# TODO: Replace <storage-account-name> with your actual storage account name
account_url = "https://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net"
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

async with BlobServiceClient(account_url, credential=credential) as blob_service_client:
    # Work with data resources in the storage account
```

## [SAS token](#tab/sas-token)

To use a shared access signature (SAS) token, provide the token as a string and initialize a [BlobServiceClient](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclient) object. If your account URL includes the SAS token, omit the credential parameter.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_auth.py" id="Snippet_get_service_client_SAS":::

If your project uses asynchronous APIs, instantiate `BlobServiceClient` using `async with`:

```python
# TODO: Replace <storage-account-name> with your actual storage account name
account_url = "https://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net"

# Replace <sas_token_str> with your actual SAS token
sas_token: str = "<sas_token_str>"

async with BlobServiceClient(account_url, credential=sas_token) as blob_service_client:
    # Work with data resources in the storage account
```

To learn more about generating and managing SAS tokens, see the following articles:

- [Grant limited access to Azure Storage resources using shared access signatures (SAS)](../common/storage-sas-overview.md?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json)
- [Create an account SAS with Python](../common/storage-account-sas-create-python.md)
- [Create a service SAS with Python](sas-service-create-python.md)
- [Create a user delegation SAS with Python](storage-blob-user-delegation-sas-create-python.md)

> [!NOTE]
> For scenarios where shared access signatures (SAS) are used, Microsoft recommends using a user delegation SAS. A user delegation SAS is secured with Microsoft Entra credentials instead of the account key. 

## [Account key](#tab/account-key)

To use a storage account shared key, provide the key as a string and initialize a [BlobServiceClient](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclient) object.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_auth.py" id="Snippet_get_service_client_account_key":::

You can also create a `BlobServiceClient` object using a connection string.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_auth.py" id="Snippet_get_service_client_connection_string":::

If your project uses asynchronous APIs, instantiate `BlobServiceClient` using `async with`:

```python
# TODO: Replace <storage-account-name> with your actual storage account name
account_url = "https://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net"

shared_access_key = os.getenv("AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY")

async with BlobServiceClient(account_url, credential=shared_access_key) as blob_service_client:
    # Work with data resources in the storage account
```

For information about how to obtain account keys and best practice guidelines for properly managing and safeguarding your keys, see [Manage storage account access keys](../common/storage-account-keys-manage.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The account access key should be used with caution. If your account access key is lost or accidentally placed in an insecure location, your service may become vulnerable. Anyone who has the access key is able to authorize requests against the storage account, and effectively has access to all the data. `DefaultAzureCredential` provides enhanced security features and benefits and is the recommended approach for managing authorization to Azure services.
