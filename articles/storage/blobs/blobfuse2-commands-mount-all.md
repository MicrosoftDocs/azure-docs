# How to use the BlobFuse2 mount all command to mount all blob containers in a storage account as a Linux file system

Use the `blobfuse2 mount all` command to mount all blob containers in a storage account as a Linux file system. Each container will be mounted to a unique subdirectory under the path specified. The subdirectory names will correspond to the container names.

## Syntax

`blobfuse2 mount all [path] --[flag-name]=[flag-value]`

## Arguments

`[path]`

Specify a file path to the directory where all of the blob storage containers in the storage account will be mounted. Example:

```bash
blobfuse2 mount all ./mount_path ...
```

## Flags (options)

Flags that apply to `blobfuse2 mount all` are inherited from the parent commands, [`blobfuse2`](blobfuse2-commands.md) and [`blobfuse2 mount`](blobfuse2-commands-mount.md).

## Examples

> [!NOTE]
> The following examples assume you have already created a configuration file in the current directory.

Mount all blob storage containers in the storage account specified in the configuration file to the path specified in the command. (Each container will be a subdirectory under the directory specified):

```bash
sudo mkdir bf2all
sudo blobfuse2 mount all ./bf2all --config-file=./config.yaml
```
Example Output
```output
Mounting container : blobfuse2a to path : bf2all/blobfuse2a
Mounting container : blobfuse2b to path : bf2all/blobfuse2b
```
```bash
sudo blobfuse2 mount list
```
Example output
```output
1 : /home/<user>/bf2all/blobfuse2a
2 : /home/<user>/bf2all/blobfuse2b
```
