# Create and manage a blob snapshot with .NET

A snapshot is a read-only version of a blob that's taken at a point in time. This article shows how to create and manage blob snapshots using the [Azure Storage client library for .NET](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/storage).

For more information about blob snapshots in Azure Storage, see [Blob snapshots](snapshots-overview.md).

## Set up your environment

[!INCLUDE [storage-dev-guide-project-setup-dotnet](../../../includes/storage-dev-guides/storage-dev-guide-project-setup-dotnet.md)]

#### Authorization

The authorization mechanism must have the necessary permissions to work with blob snapshots. For authorization with Microsoft Entra ID (recommended), you need Azure RBAC built-in role **Storage Blob Data Contributor** or higher. To learn more, see the authorization guidance for [Snapshot Blob](/rest/api/storageservices/snapshot-blob#authorization).

## Create a snapshot

To create a snapshot of a block blob, use one of the following methods:

- [CreateSnapshot](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.specialized.blobbaseclient.createsnapshot)
- [CreateSnapshotAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.specialized.blobbaseclient.createsnapshotasync)

The following code example shows how to create a snapshot. Include a reference to the [Azure.Identity](https://www.nuget.org/packages/azure.identity) library to use your Microsoft Entra credentials to authorize requests to the service. For more information about using the [DefaultAzureCredential](/dotnet/api/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential) class to authorize a managed identity to access Azure Storage, see [Azure Identity client library for .NET](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme).

```csharp
private static async Task CreateBlockBlobSnapshot(
    string accountName,
    string containerName, 
    string blobName,
    Stream data)
{
    const string blobServiceEndpointSuffix = ".blob.core.windows.net";
    Uri containerUri = 
        new Uri("https://" + accountName + blobServiceEndpointSuffix + "/" + containerName);

    // Get a container client object and create the container.
    BlobContainerClient containerClient = new BlobContainerClient(containerUri,
        new DefaultAzureCredential());
    await containerClient.CreateIfNotExistsAsync();

    // Get a blob client object.
    BlobClient blobClient = containerClient.GetBlobClient(blobName);

    try
    {
        // Upload text to create a block blob.
        await blobClient.UploadAsync(data);

        // Add blob metadata.
        IDictionary<string, string> metadata = new Dictionary<string, string>
        {
            { "ApproxBlobCreatedDate", DateTime.UtcNow.ToString() },
            { "FileType", "text" }
        };
        await blobClient.SetMetadataAsync(metadata);

        // Sleep 5 seconds.
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(5000);

        // Create a snapshot of the base blob.
        // You can specify metadata at the time that the snapshot is created.
        // If no metadata is specified, then the blob's metadata is copied to the snapshot.
        await blobClient.CreateSnapshotAsync();
    }
    catch (RequestFailedException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
        Console.ReadLine();
        throw;
    }
}
```

## Delete snapshots

To delete a blob, you must first delete any snapshots of that blob. You can delete a snapshot individually, or specify that all snapshots be deleted when the source blob is deleted. If you attempt to delete a blob that still has snapshots, an error results.

To delete a blob and its snapshots, use one of the following methods, and include the [DeleteSnapshotsOption](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.models.deletesnapshotsoption) enum:

- [Delete](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.specialized.blobbaseclient.delete)
- [DeleteAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.specialized.blobbaseclient.deleteasync)
- [DeleteIfExists](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.specialized.blobbaseclient.deleteifexists)
- [DeleteIfExistsAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.specialized.blobbaseclient.deleteifexistsasync)

The following code example shows how to delete a blob and its snapshots in .NET, where `blobClient` is an object of type [BlobClient](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.blobclient):

```csharp
await blobClient.DeleteIfExistsAsync(DeleteSnapshotsOption.IncludeSnapshots, null, default);
```

## Copy a blob snapshot over the base blob

You can perform a copy operation to promote a snapshot over its base blob, as long as the base blob is in an online tier (hot or cool). The snapshot remains, but its destination is overwritten with a copy that can be read and written to.

The following code example shows how to copy a blob snapshot over the base blob:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/dotnet/BlobDevGuideBlobs/CopySnapshot.cs" id="Snippet_CopySnapshot":::
