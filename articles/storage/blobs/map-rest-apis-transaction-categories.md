# Map each REST operation to a price

This article helps you find the price of each REST operation that clients can execute against the Azure Blob Storage service.

Each request made by tools such as AzCopy or Azure Storage Explorer arrives to the service in the form of a REST operation. This is also true for a custom application that leverages an Azure Storage Client library. REST operations are not billed for requests with unsuccessful authentication. After an identity is authenticated, all operations and requests made by that identity are billed, including those that donâ€™t succeed.

To determine the price of each operation, you must first determine how that operation is classified in terms of its _type_. That's because the pricing pages list prices only by operation type and not by each individual operation. Use the tables in this article as a guide.

## Operation type of each Blob Storage REST operation

The following table maps each Blob Storage REST operation to an operation type.

The price of each type appears in the [Azure Blob Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/) page.

<sup>1</sup>    In addition to a read charge, charges are incurred for the **Query Acceleration - Data Scanned**, and **Query Acceleration - Data Returned** transaction categories that appear on the [Azure Data Lake Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/data-lake/) page.

<sup>2</sup> When the source object is in a different account, the source account incurs one transaction for each read request to the source object.

## Operation type of each Data Lake Storage REST operation

The following table maps each Data Lake Storage REST operation to an operation type. 

The price of each type appears in the [Azure Data Lake Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/data-lake/) page.
