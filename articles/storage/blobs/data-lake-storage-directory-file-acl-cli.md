# Manage directories and files in Azure Data Lake Storage via the Azure CLI

This article shows you how to use the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/) to create and manage directories and files in storage accounts that have a hierarchical namespace.

To learn about how to get, set, and update the access control lists (ACL) of directories and files, see [Use Azure CLI to manage ACLs in Azure Data Lake Storage](data-lake-storage-acl-cli.md).

[Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/src/azure-cli/azure/cli/command_modules/storage/docs/ADLS%20Gen2.md) | [Give feedback](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions/issues)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. For more information, see [Get Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

- A storage account that has hierarchical namespace enabled. Follow [these](create-data-lake-storage-account.md) instructions to create one.

- Azure CLI version `2.6.0` or higher.

## Ensure that you have the correct version of Azure CLI installed

1. Open the [Azure Cloud Shell](../../cloud-shell/overview.md), or if you've [installed](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) the Azure CLI locally, open a command console application such as Windows PowerShell.

2. Verify that the version of Azure CLI that you have installed is `2.6.0` or higher by using the following command.

   ```azurecli
    az --version
   ```

   If your version of Azure CLI is lower than `2.6.0`, then install a later version. For more information, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Connect to the account

1. If you're using Azure CLI locally, run the login command.

   ```azurecli
   az login
   ```

   If the CLI can open your default browser, it will do so and load an Azure sign-in page.

   Otherwise, open a browser page at [https://aka.ms/devicelogin](https://aka.ms/devicelogin) and enter the authorization code displayed in your terminal. Then, sign in with your account credentials in the browser.

   To learn more about different authentication methods, see [Authorize access to blob or queue data with Azure CLI](./authorize-data-operations-cli.md).

2. If your identity is associated with more than one subscription, and you are not prompted to select the subscription, then set your active subscription to the subscription of the storage account that you want to operate upon. In this example, replace the `<subscription-id>` placeholder value with the ID of your subscription.

   ```azurecli
   az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
   ```

   Replace the `<subscription-id>` placeholder value with the ID of your subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> The example presented in this article show Microsoft Entra authorization. To learn more about authorization methods, see [Authorize access to blob or queue data with Azure CLI](./authorize-data-operations-cli.md).

## Create a container

A container acts as a file system for your files. You can create one by using the [az storage fs create](/cli/azure/storage/fs#az-storage-fs-create) command.

This example creates a container named `my-file-system`.

```azurecli
az storage fs create -n my-file-system --account-name mystorageaccount --auth-mode login
```

## Show container properties

You can print the properties of a container to the console by using the [az storage fs show](/cli/azure/storage/fs#az-storage-fs-show) command.

```azurecli
az storage fs show -n my-file-system --account-name mystorageaccount --auth-mode login
```

## List container contents

List the contents of a directory by using the [az storage fs file list](/cli/azure/storage/fs/file#az-storage-fs-file-list) command.

This example lists the contents of a container named `my-file-system`.

```azurecli
az storage fs file list -f my-file-system --account-name mystorageaccount --auth-mode login
```

## Delete a container

Delete a container by using the [az storage fs delete](/cli/azure/storage/fs#az-storage-fs-delete) command.

This example deletes a container named `my-file-system`.

```azurecli
az storage fs delete -n my-file-system --account-name mystorageaccount --auth-mode login
```

## Create a directory

Create a directory reference by using the [az storage fs directory create](/cli/azure/storage/fs/directory#az-storage-fs-directory-create) command.

This example adds a directory named `my-directory` to a container named `my-file-system` that is located in an account named `mystorageaccount`.

```azurecli
az storage fs directory create -n my-directory -f my-file-system --account-name mystorageaccount --auth-mode login
```

## Show directory properties

You can print the properties of a directory to the console by using the [az storage fs directory show](/cli/azure/storage/fs/directory#az-storage-fs-directory-show) command.

```azurecli
az storage fs directory show -n my-directory -f my-file-system --account-name mystorageaccount --auth-mode login
```

## Rename or move a directory

Rename or move a directory by using the [az storage fs directory move](/cli/azure/storage/fs/directory#az-storage-fs-directory-move) command.

This example renames a directory from the name `my-directory` to the name `my-new-directory` in the same container.

```azurecli
az storage fs directory move -n my-directory -f my-file-system --new-directory "my-file-system/my-new-directory" --account-name mystorageaccount --auth-mode login
```

This example moves a directory to a container named `my-second-file-system`.

```azurecli
az storage fs directory move -n my-directory -f my-file-system --new-directory "my-second-file-system/my-new-directory" --account-name mystorageaccount --auth-mode login
```

## Delete a directory

Delete a directory by using the [az storage fs directory delete](/cli/azure/storage/fs/directory#az-storage-fs-directory-delete) command.

This example deletes a directory named `my-directory`.

```azurecli
az storage fs directory delete -n my-directory -f my-file-system  --account-name mystorageaccount --auth-mode login
```

## Check if a directory exists

Determine if a specific directory exists in the container by using the [az storage fs directory exists](/cli/azure/storage/fs/directory#az-storage-fs-directory-exists) command.

This example reveals whether a directory named `my-directory` exists in the `my-file-system` container.

```azurecli
az storage fs directory exists -n my-directory -f my-file-system --account-name mystorageaccount --auth-mode login
```

## Download from a directory

Download a file from a directory by using the [az storage fs file download](/cli/azure/storage/fs/file#az-storage-fs-file-download) command.

This example downloads a file named `upload.txt` from a directory named `my-directory`.

```azurecli
az storage fs file download -p my-directory/upload.txt -f my-file-system -d "C:\myFolder\download.txt" --account-name mystorageaccount --auth-mode login
```

## List directory contents

List the contents of a directory by using the [az storage fs file list](/cli/azure/storage/fs/file#az-storage-fs-file-list) command.

This example lists the contents of a directory named `my-directory` that is located in the `my-file-system` container of a storage account named `mystorageaccount`.

```azurecli
az storage fs file list -f my-file-system --path my-directory --account-name mystorageaccount --auth-mode login
```

## Upload a file to a directory

Upload a file to a directory by using the [az storage fs file upload](/cli/azure/storage/fs/file#az-storage-fs-file-upload) command.

This example uploads a file named `upload.txt` to a directory named `my-directory`.

```azurecli
az storage fs file upload -s "C:\myFolder\upload.txt" -p my-directory/upload.txt  -f my-file-system --account-name mystorageaccount --auth-mode login
```

## Show file properties

You can print the properties of a file to the console by using the [az storage fs file show](/cli/azure/storage/fs/file#az-storage-fs-file-show) command.

```azurecli
az storage fs file show -p my-file.txt -f my-file-system --account-name mystorageaccount --auth-mode login
```

## Rename or move a file

Rename or move a file by using the [az storage fs file move](/cli/azure/storage/fs/file#az-storage-fs-file-move) command.

This example renames a file from the name `my-file.txt` to the name `my-file-renamed.txt`.

```azurecli
az storage fs file move -p my-file.txt -f my-file-system --new-path my-file-system/my-file-renamed.txt --account-name mystorageaccount --auth-mode login
```

## Delete a file

Delete a file by using the [az storage fs file delete](/cli/azure/storage/fs/file#az-storage-fs-file-delete) command.

This example deletes a file named `my-file.txt`

```azurecli
az storage fs file delete -p my-directory/my-file.txt -f my-file-system  --account-name mystorageaccount --auth-mode login
```
