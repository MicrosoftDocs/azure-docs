# Create a blob container with Python

[!INCLUDE [storage-dev-guide-selector-create-container](../../../includes/storage-dev-guides/storage-dev-guide-selector-create-container.md)]

Blobs in Azure Storage are organized into containers. Before you can upload a blob, you must first create a container. This article shows how to create containers with the [Azure Storage client library for Python](/python/api/overview/azure/storage).

To learn about creating blob containers using asynchronous APIs, see [Create a container asynchronously](#create-a-container-asynchronously).

[!INCLUDE [storage-dev-guide-prereqs-python](../../../includes/storage-dev-guides/storage-dev-guide-prereqs-python.md)]

## Set up your environment

[!INCLUDE [storage-dev-guide-project-setup-python](../../../includes/storage-dev-guides/storage-dev-guide-project-setup-python.md)]

#### Add import statements

Add the following `import` statements:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_create_container.py" id="Snippet_imports":::

#### Authorization

The authorization mechanism must have the necessary permissions to create a container. For authorization with Microsoft Entra ID (recommended), you need Azure RBAC built-in role **Storage Blob Data Contributor** or higher. To learn more, see the authorization guidance for [Create Container (REST API)](/rest/api/storageservices/create-container#authorization).

## Create a container

To create a container, call the following method from the [BlobServiceClient](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclient) class:

- [BlobServiceClient.create_container](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclient#azure-storage-blob-blobserviceclient-create-container)

You can also create a container using the following method from the [ContainerClient](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.containerclient) class:

- [ContainerClient.create_container](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.containerclient#azure-storage-blob-containerclient-create-container)

Containers are created immediately beneath the storage account. It's not possible to nest one container beneath another. An exception is thrown if a container with the same name already exists. 

The following example creates a container from a `BlobServiceClient` object:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_create_container.py" id="Snippet_create_container":::

## Create the root container

A root container serves as a default container for your storage account. Each storage account may have one root container, which must be named *$root*. The root container must be explicitly created or deleted.

You can reference a blob stored in the root container without including the root container name. The root container enables you to reference a blob at the top level of the storage account hierarchy. For example, you can reference a blob in the root container as follows:

`https://accountname.blob.core.windows.net/default.html`

The following example creates a new `ContainerClient` object with the container name $root, then creates the container if it doesn't already exist in the storage account:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_create_container.py" id="Snippet_create_root_container":::

## Create a container asynchronously

The Azure Blob Storage client library for Python supports creating a blob container asynchronously. To learn more about project setup requirements, see [Asynchronous programming](storage-blob-python-get-started.md#asynchronous-programming).

Follow these steps to create a container using asynchronous APIs:

1. Add the following import statements:

    ```python
    import asyncio

    from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential
    from azure.storage.blob.aio import BlobServiceClient
    from azure.core.exceptions import ResourceExistsError
    ```

1. Add code to run the program using `asyncio.run`. This function runs the passed coroutine, `main()` in our example, and manages the `asyncio` event loop. Coroutines are declared with the async/await syntax. In this example, the `main()` coroutine first creates the top level `BlobServiceClient` using `async with`, then calls the method that creates the container. Note that only the top level client needs to use `async with`, as other clients created from it share the same connection pool.

    :::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_create_container_async.py" id="Snippet_create_client_async":::

1. Add code to create a container. The code is the same as the synchronous example, except that the method is declared with the `async` keyword and the `await` keyword is used when calling the `create_container` method.

    :::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_create_container_async.py" id="Snippet_create_container":::

With this basic setup in place, you can implement other examples in this article as coroutines using async/await syntax.

### Code samples

- View [synchronous](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureStorageSnippets/blob/master/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_create_container.py) or [asynchronous](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureStorageSnippets/blob/master/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_create_container_async.py) code samples from this article (GitHub)

### REST API operations

The Azure SDK for Python contains libraries that build on top of the Azure REST API, allowing you to interact with REST API operations through familiar Python paradigms. The client library methods for creating a container use the following REST API operation:

- [Create Container](/rest/api/storageservices/create-container) (REST API)
