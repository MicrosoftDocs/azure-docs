# Create and list blob versions in .NET

Blob versioning automatically creates a previous version of a blob anytime it is modified or deleted. When blob versioning is enabled, then you can restore an earlier version of a blob to recover your data if it is erroneously modified or deleted.

For optimal data protection, Microsoft recommends enabling both blob versioning and blob soft delete for your storage account. For more information, see [Blob versioning](versioning-overview.md) and [Soft delete for blobs](soft-delete-blob-overview.md).

## Modify a blob to trigger a new version

The following code example shows how to trigger the creation of a new version with the Azure Storage client library for .NET, version [12.5.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Storage.Blobs/12.5.1) or later. Before running this example, make sure you have enabled versioning for your storage account.

The example creates a block blob, and then updates the blob's metadata. Updating the blob's metadata triggers the creation of a new version. The example retrieves the initial version and the current version, and shows that only the current version includes the metadata.

## List blob versions

To list blob versions, specify the [BlobStates](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.models.blobstates) parameter with the **Version** field. Versions are listed from oldest to newest.

The following code example shows how to list blob versions.

## Copy a previous blob version over the base blob

You can perform a copy operation to promote a version over its base blob, as long as the base blob is in an online tier (hot or cool). The version remains, but its destination is overwritten with a copy that can be read and written to.

The following code example shows how to copy a blob version over the base blob:
