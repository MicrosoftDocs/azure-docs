# Map a custom domain to an Azure Blob Storage endpoint

You can map a custom domain to a blob service endpoint or a [static website](storage-blob-static-website.md) endpoint.

> [!NOTE]
> This mapping works only for subdomains (for example: `www.contoso.com`). If you want your web endpoint to be available on the root domain (for example: `contoso.com`), then you'll have to use Azure CDN. For guidance, see the [Map a custom domain with HTTPS enabled](#enable-https) section of this article. Because you're going to that section of this article to enable the root domain of your custom domain, the step within that section for enabling HTTPS is optional.

<a id="enable-http"></a>

## Map a custom domain with only HTTP enabled

This approach is easier, but enables only HTTP access. If the storage account is configured to [require secure transfer](../common/storage-require-secure-transfer.md) over HTTPS, then you must enable HTTPS access for your custom domain.

To enable HTTPS access, see the [Map a custom domain with HTTPS enabled](#enable-https) section of this article.

<a id="map-a-domain"></a>

### Map a custom domain

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your custom domain will be briefly unavailable to users while you complete the configuration. If your domain currently supports an application with a service-level agreement (SLA) that requires zero downtime, then follow the steps in the [Map a custom domain with zero downtime](#zero-down-time) section of this article to ensure that users can access your domain while the DNS mapping takes place.

If you are unconcerned that the domain is briefly unavailable to your users, follow these steps.

:heavy_check_mark: Step 1: Get the host name of your storage endpoint.

:heavy_check_mark: Step 2: Create a canonical name (CNAME) record with your domain provider.

:heavy_check_mark: Step 3: Register the custom domain with Azure.

:heavy_check_mark: Step 4: Test your custom domain.

<a id="endpoint"></a>

#### Step 1: Get the host name of your storage endpoint

The host name is the storage endpoint URL without the protocol identifier and the trailing slash.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your storage account.

2. In the menu pane, under **Settings**, select **Endpoints**.

3. Copy the value of the **Blob service** endpoint or the **Static website** endpoint to a text file.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Data Lake storage endpoint is not supported (For example: `https://mystorageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/`).

4. Remove the protocol identifier (For example: `HTTPS`) and the trailing slash from that string. The following table contains examples.

   | Type of endpoint |  endpoint | host name |
   |------------|-----------------|-------------------|
   |blob service  | `https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/` | `mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net` |
   |static website  | `https://mystorageaccount.z5.web.core.windows.net/` | `mystorageaccount.z5.web.core.windows.net` |

   Set this value aside for later.

<a id="create-cname-record"></a>

#### Step 2: Create a canonical name (CNAME) record with your domain provider

Create a CNAME record to point to your host name. A CNAME record is a type of Domain Name System (DNS) record that maps a source domain name to a destination domain name.

> [!NOTE]
> CNAME records must be accessible to public networks. If CNAME records are private, registration with Azure will not succeed. 

1. Sign in to your domain registrar's website, and then go to the page for managing DNS setting.

   You might find the page in a section named **Domain Name**, **DNS**, or **Name Server Management**.

2. Find the section for managing CNAME records.

   You might have to go to an advanced settings page and look for **CNAME**, **Alias**, or **Subdomains**.

3. Create a CNAME record. As part of that record, provide the following items:

   - The subdomain alias such as `www` or `photos`. The subdomain is required, root domains are not supported.

   - The host name that you obtained in the [Get the host name of your storage endpoint](#endpoint) section earlier in this article.

<a id="register"></a>

#### Step 3: Register your custom domain with Azure

##### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your storage account.

2. In the menu pane, under **Security + networking**, select **Networking**.

3. In the **Networking** page, choose the **Custom domain** tab.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This option does not appear in accounts that have the hierarchical namespace feature enabled. For those accounts, use either PowerShell or the Azure CLI to complete this step.

3. In the **Domain name** text box, enter the name of your custom domain, including the subdomain.

   For example, if your domain is *contoso.com* and your subdomain alias is *www*, enter `www.contoso.com`. If your subdomain is *photos*, enter `photos.contoso.com`.

4. To register the custom domain, choose the **Save** button.

   After the CNAME record has propagated through the Domain Name Servers (DNS), and if your users have the appropriate permissions, they can view blob data by using the custom domain.

##### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Run the following PowerShell command

```powershell
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name> -Name <storage-account-name> -CustomDomainName <custom-domain-name> -UseSubDomain $false
```

- Replace the `<resource-group-name>` placeholder with the name of the resource group.

- Replace the `<storage-account-name>` placeholder with the name of the storage account.

- Replace the `<custom-domain-name>` placeholder with the name of your custom domain, including the subdomain.

  For example, if your domain is *contoso.com* and your subdomain alias is *www*, enter `www.contoso.com`. If your subdomain is *photos*, enter `photos.contoso.com`.

After the CNAME record has propagated through the Domain Name Servers (DNS), and if your users have the appropriate permissions, they can view blob data by using the custom domain.

##### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Run the following PowerShell command

```azurecli
az storage account update \
   --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ 
   --name <storage-account-name> \
   --custom-domain <custom-domain-name> \
   --use-subdomain false
  ```

- Replace the `<resource-group-name>` placeholder with the name of the resource group.

- Replace the `<storage-account-name>` placeholder with the name of the storage account.

- Replace the `<custom-domain-name>` placeholder with the name of your custom domain, including the subdomain.

  For example, if your domain is *contoso.com* and your subdomain alias is *www*, enter `www.contoso.com`. If your subdomain is *photos*, enter `photos.contoso.com`.

After the CNAME record has propagated through the Domain Name Servers (DNS), and if your users have the appropriate permissions, they can view blob data by using the custom domain.

---

#### Step 4: Test your custom domain

To confirm that your custom domain is mapped to your blob service endpoint, create a blob in a public container within your storage account. Then, in a web browser, access the blob by using a URI in the following format: `http://<subdomain.customdomain>/<mycontainer>/<myblob>`

For example, to access a web form in the `myforms` container in the *photos.contoso.com* custom subdomain, you might use the following URI: `http://photos.contoso.com/myforms/applicationform.htm`

<a id="zero-down-time"></a>

### Map a custom domain with zero downtime

> [!NOTE]
> If you are unconcerned that the domain is briefly unavailable to your users, then consider using the steps in the [Map a custom domain](#map-a-domain) section of this article. It's a simpler approach with fewer steps.

If your domain currently supports an application with a service-level agreement (SLA) that requires zero downtime, then follow these steps to ensure that users can access your domain while the DNS mapping takes place.

:heavy_check_mark: Step 1: Get the host name of your storage endpoint.

:heavy_check_mark: Step 2: Create an intermediary canonical name (CNAME) record with your domain provider.

:heavy_check_mark: Step 3: Pre-register the custom domain with Azure.

:heavy_check_mark: Step 4: Create a CNAME record with your domain provider.

:heavy_check_mark: Step 5: Test your custom domain.

<a id="endpoint-2"></a>

#### Step 1: Get the host name of your storage endpoint

The host name is the storage endpoint URL without the protocol identifier and the trailing slash.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your storage account.

2. In the menu pane, under **Settings**, select **Endpoints**.

3. Copy the value of the **Blob service** endpoint or the **Static website** endpoint to a text file.

4. Remove the protocol identifier (For example: `HTTPS`) and the trailing slash from that string. The following table contains examples.

   | Type of endpoint |  endpoint | host name |
   |------------|-----------------|-------------------|
   |blob service  | `https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/` | `mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net` |
   |static website  | `https://mystorageaccount.z5.web.core.windows.net/` | `mystorageaccount.z5.web.core.windows.net` |

   Set this value aside for later.

#### Step 2: Create an intermediary canonical name (CNAME) record with your domain provider

Create a temporary CNAME record to point to your host name. A CNAME record is a type of DNS record that maps a source domain name to a destination domain name.

> [!NOTE]
> CNAME records must be accessible to public networks. If CNAME records are private, registration with Azure will not succeed.

1. Sign in to your domain registrar's website, and then go to the page for managing DNS setting.

   You might find the page in a section named **Domain Name**, **DNS**, or **Name Server Management**.

2. Find the section for managing CNAME records.

   You might have to go to an advanced settings page and look for **CNAME**, **Alias**, or **Subdomains**.

3. Create a CNAME record. As part of that record, provide the following items:

   - The subdomain alias such as `www` or `photos`. The subdomain is required, root domains are not supported.

     Add the `asverify` subdomain to the alias. For example: `asverify.www` or `asverify.photos`.

   - The host name that you obtained in the [Get the host name of your storage endpoint](#endpoint) section earlier in this article.

     Add the subdomain `asverify` to the host name. For example: `asverify.mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net`.

#### Step 3: Pre-register your custom domain with Azure

When you pre-register your custom domain with Azure, you permit Azure to recognize your custom domain without having to modify the DNS record for the domain. That way, when you do modify the DNS record for the domain, it will be mapped to the blob endpoint with no downtime.

##### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your storage account.

2. In the menu pane, under **Security + networking**, select **Networking**.

3. In the **Networking** page, choose the **Custom domain** tab.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This option does not appear in accounts that have the hierarchical namespace feature enabled. For those accounts, use either PowerShell or the Azure CLI to complete this step.

3. In the **Domain name** text box, enter the name of your custom domain, including the subdomain.

   For example, if your domain is *contoso.com* and your subdomain alias is *www*, enter `www.contoso.com`. If your subdomain is *photos*, enter `photos.contoso.com`.

4. Select the **Use indirect CNAME validation** check box.

5. To register the custom domain, choose the **Save** button.

   If the registration is successful, the portal notifies you that your storage account was successfully updated. Your custom domain has been verified by Azure, but traffic to your domain is not yet being routed to your storage account until you create a CNAME record with your domain provider. You'll do that in the next section.

##### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Run the following PowerShell command

```powershell
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name> -Name <storage-account-name> -CustomDomainName <custom-domain-name> -UseSubDomain $true
```

- Replace the `<resource-group-name>` placeholder with the name of the resource group.

- Replace the `<storage-account-name>` placeholder with the name of the storage account.

- Replace the `<custom-domain-name>` placeholder with the name of your custom domain, including the subdomain.

  For example, if your domain is *contoso.com* and your subdomain alias is *www*, enter `www.contoso.com`. If your subdomain is *photos*, enter `photos.contoso.com`.

Traffic to your domain is not yet being routed to your storage account until you create a CNAME record with your domain provider. You'll do that in the next section.

##### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Run the following PowerShell command

```azurecli
az storage account update \
   --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ 
   --name <storage-account-name> \
   --custom-domain <custom-domain-name> \
   --use-subdomain true
  ```

- Replace the `<resource-group-name>` placeholder with the name of the resource group.

- Replace the `<storage-account-name>` placeholder with the name of the storage account.

- Replace the `<custom-domain-name>` placeholder with the name of your custom domain, including the subdomain.

  For example, if your domain is *contoso.com* and your subdomain alias is *www*, enter `www.contoso.com`. If your subdomain is *photos*, enter `photos.contoso.com`.

Traffic to your domain is not yet being routed to your storage account until you create a CNAME record with your domain provider. You'll do that in the next section.

#### Step 4: Create a CNAME record with your domain provider

Create a temporary CNAME record to point to your host name.

1. Sign in to your domain registrar's website, and then go to the page for managing DNS setting.

   You might find the page in a section named **Domain Name**, **DNS**, or **Name Server Management**.

2. Find the section for managing CNAME records.

   You might have to go to an advanced settings page and look for **CNAME**, **Alias**, or **Subdomains**.

3. Create a CNAME record. As part of that record, provide the following items:

   - The subdomain alias such as `www` or `photos`. The subdomain is required, root domains are not supported.

   - The host name that you obtained in the [Get the host name of your storage endpoint](#endpoint-2) section earlier in this article.

#### Step 5: Test your custom domain

To confirm that your custom domain is mapped to your blob service endpoint, create a blob in a public container within your storage account. Then, in a web browser, access the blob by using a URI in the following format: `http://<subdomain.customdomain>/<mycontainer>/<myblob>`

For example, to access a web form in the `myforms` container in the *photos.contoso.com* custom subdomain, you might use the following URI: `http://photos.contoso.com/myforms/applicationform.htm`

### Remove a custom domain mapping

To remove a custom domain mapping, deregister the custom domain. Use one of the following procedures.

#### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your storage account.

2. In the menu pane, under **Security + networking**, select **Networking**.

3. In the **Networking** page, choose the **Custom domain** tab.

4. Clear the contents of the text box that contains your custom domain name.

5. Select the **Save** button.

After the custom domain has been removed successfully, you will see a portal notification that your storage account was successfully updated.

#### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/updated-for-az.md)]

To remove a custom domain registration, use the [Set-AzStorageAccount](/powershell/module/az.storage/set-azstorageaccount) PowerShell cmdlet, and then specify an empty string (`""`) for the `-CustomDomainName` argument value.

- Command format:

  ```powershell
  Set-AzStorageAccount `
      -ResourceGroupName "<resource-group-name>" `
      -AccountName "<storage-account-name>" `
      -CustomDomainName ""
  ```

- Command example:

  ```powershell
  Set-AzStorageAccount `
      -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" `
      -AccountName "mystorageaccount" `
      -CustomDomainName ""
  ```

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To remove a custom domain registration, use the [az storage account update](/cli/azure/storage/account) CLI command, and then specify an empty string (`""`) for the `--custom-domain` argument value.

- Command format:

  ```azurecli
  az storage account update \
      --name <storage-account-name> \
      --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
      --custom-domain ""
  ```

- Command example:

  ```azurecli
  az storage account update \
      --name mystorageaccount \
      --resource-group myresourcegroup \
      --custom-domain ""
  ```

## Map a custom domain with HTTPS enabled

This approach involves more steps, but it enables HTTPS access.
If you don't need users to access your blob or web content by using HTTPS, then see the [Map a custom domain with only HTTP enabled](#enable-http) section of this article.
The approach involves using [Azure Front Door (preferred)](../../frontdoor/front-door-overview.md) or [Azure CDN](../../cdn/cdn-overview.md) which are Content Delivery Network services offered by Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> Custom domain mapping requires the use of CNAME records. CNAME records must be accessible to public networks. If CNAME records are private, registration with Azure will not succeed.

### Using Azure Front Door
1. Enable [Azure Front Door](../../frontdoor/front-door-overview.md) on your blob or website endpoint.

   For steps, see [Integrate an Azure storage account with Azure Front Door](../../frontdoor/integrate-storage-account.md).

2. [Configure a custom domain on Azure Front Door](../../frontdoor/standard-premium/how-to-add-custom-domain.md).

3. [Configure HTTPS on an Azure Front Door custom domain](../../frontdoor/standard-premium/how-to-configure-https-custom-domain.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you update your static website, be sure to clear cached content on the AFD edge POPs by purging the AFD endpoint. For more information, see [Cache purging in Azure Front Door](../../frontdoor/standard-premium/how-to-cache-purge.md).

4. (Optional) Review the following guidance:

   - Learn how to use [Azure Front Door with Azure Storage blobs](../../frontdoor/scenario-storage-blobs.md).
   - Learn how to [enable Azure Front Door Private Link with Azure Blob Storage](../../frontdoor/standard-premium/how-to-enable-private-link-storage-account.md).
   - Learn how to [enable Azure Front Door Private Link with Storage Static Website](../../frontdoor/how-to-enable-private-link-storage-static-website.md).
   - [HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection with AFD](../../frontdoor/front-door-how-to-redirect-https.md).
   - [Front Door Billing](../../frontdoor/billing.md).

### Using Azure CDN

1. Enable [Azure CDN](../../cdn/cdn-overview.md) on your blob or web endpoint. For step-by-step guidance, see [Integrate an Azure storage account with Azure CDN](../../cdn/cdn-create-a-storage-account-with-cdn.md).

2. [Map Azure CDN content to a custom domain](../../cdn/cdn-map-content-to-custom-domain.md).

3. [Enable HTTPS on an Azure CDN custom domain](../../cdn/cdn-custom-ssl.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you update your static website, be sure to clear cached content on the CDN edge servers by purging the CDN endpoint. For more information, see [Purge an Azure CDN endpoint](../../cdn/cdn-purge-endpoint.md).

4. (Optional) Review the following guidance:

   - [Shared access signature (SAS) tokens with Azure CDN](../../cdn/cdn-storage-custom-domain-https.md#shared-access-signatures).

   - [HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection with Azure CDN](../../cdn/cdn-storage-custom-domain-https.md#http-to-https-redirection).
