# Delete and restore a blob container with Python

[!INCLUDE [storage-dev-guide-selector-delete-container](../../../includes/storage-dev-guides/storage-dev-guide-selector-delete-container.md)]

This article shows how to delete containers with the [Azure Storage client library for Python](/python/api/overview/azure/storage). If you've enabled [container soft delete](soft-delete-container-overview.md), you can restore deleted containers.

To learn about deleting a blob container using asynchronous APIs, see [Delete a container asynchronously](#delete-a-container-asynchronously).

[!INCLUDE [storage-dev-guide-prereqs-python](../../../includes/storage-dev-guides/storage-dev-guide-prereqs-python.md)]

## Set up your environment

[!INCLUDE [storage-dev-guide-project-setup-python](../../../includes/storage-dev-guides/storage-dev-guide-project-setup-python.md)]

#### Add import statements

Add the following `import` statements:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_delete_container.py" id="Snippet_imports":::

#### Authorization

The authorization mechanism must have the necessary permissions to delete or restore a container. For authorization with Microsoft Entra ID (recommended), you need Azure RBAC built-in role **Storage Blob Data Contributor** or higher. To learn more, see the authorization guidance for [Delete Container (REST API)](/rest/api/storageservices/delete-container#authorization) and [Restore Container (REST API)](/rest/api/storageservices/restore-container#authorization).

## Delete a container

To delete a container in Python, use the following method from the [BlobServiceClient](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclient) class:

- [BlobServiceClient.delete_container](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclient#azure-storage-blob-blobserviceclient-delete-container)

You can also delete a container using the following method from the [ContainerClient](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.containerclient) class:

- [ContainerClient.delete_container](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.containerclient#azure-storage-blob-containerclient-delete-container)

After you delete a container, you can't create a container with the same name for *at least* 30 seconds. Attempting to create a container with the same name will fail with HTTP error code `409 (Conflict)`. Any other operations on the container or the blobs it contains will fail with HTTP error code `404 (Not Found)`.

The following example uses a `BlobServiceClient` object to delete the specified container:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_delete_container.py" id="Snippet_delete_container":::

The following example shows how to delete all containers that start with a specified prefix:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_delete_container.py" id="Snippet_delete_container_prefix":::

## Restore a deleted container

When container soft delete is enabled for a storage account, a deleted container and its contents may be recovered within a specified retention period. To learn more about container soft delete, see [Enable and manage soft delete for containers](soft-delete-container-enable.md). You can restore a soft-deleted container by calling the following method of the `BlobServiceClient` class:

- [BlobServiceClient.undelete_container](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclient#azure-storage-blob-blobserviceclient-undelete-container)

The following example finds a deleted container, gets the version of that deleted container, and then passes the version into the `undelete_container` method to restore the container.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_delete_container.py" id="Snippet_restore_container":::

## Delete a container asynchronously

The Azure Blob Storage client library for Python supports deleting a blob container asynchronously. To learn more about project setup requirements, see [Asynchronous programming](storage-blob-python-get-started.md#asynchronous-programming).

Follow these steps to delete a container using asynchronous APIs:

1. Add the following import statements:

    ```python
    import asyncio

    from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential
    from azure.storage.blob.aio import BlobServiceClient
    ```

1. Add code to run the program using `asyncio.run`. This function runs the passed coroutine, `main()` in our example, and manages the `asyncio` event loop. Coroutines are declared with the async/await syntax. In this example, the `main()` coroutine first creates the top level `BlobServiceClient` using `async with`, then calls the method that deletes the container. Note that only the top level client needs to use `async with`, as other clients created from it share the same connection pool.

    :::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_delete_container_async.py" id="Snippet_create_client_async":::

1. Add code to delete the container. The code is the same as the synchronous example, except that the method is declared with the `async` keyword and the `await` keyword is used when calling the `delete_container` method.

    :::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_delete_container_async.py" id="Snippet_delete_container":::

With this basic setup in place, you can implement other examples in this article as coroutines using async/await syntax.

### Code samples

- View [synchronous](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureStorageSnippets/blob/master/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_delete_container.py) or [asynchronous](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureStorageSnippets/blob/master/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_delete_container_async.py) code samples from this article (GitHub)

### REST API operations

The Azure SDK for Python contains libraries that build on top of the Azure REST API, allowing you to interact with REST API operations through familiar Python paradigms. The client library methods for deleting or restoring a container use the following REST API operations:

- [Delete Container](/rest/api/storageservices/delete-container) (REST API)
- [Restore Container](/rest/api/storageservices/restore-container) (REST API)
