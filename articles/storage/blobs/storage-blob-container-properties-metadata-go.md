# Manage container properties and metadata with Go

[!INCLUDE [storage-dev-guide-selector-manage-properties-container](../../../includes/storage-dev-guides/storage-dev-guide-selector-manage-properties-container.md)]

Blob containers support system properties and user-defined metadata, in addition to the data they contain. This article shows how to manage system properties and user-defined metadata with the [Azure Storage client module for Go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/storage/azblob#section-readme).

#### Authorization

The authorization mechanism must have the necessary permissions to work with container properties or metadata. For authorization with Microsoft Entra ID (recommended), you need Azure RBAC built-in role **Storage Blob Data Reader** or higher for the *get* operations, and **Storage Blob Data Contributor** or higher for the *set* operations. To learn more, see the authorization guidance for [Get Container Properties (REST API)](/rest/api/storageservices/get-container-properties#authorization), [Set Container Metadata (REST API)](/rest/api/storageservices/set-container-metadata#authorization), or [Get Container Metadata (REST API)](/rest/api/storageservices/get-container-metadata#authorization).

## About properties and metadata

- **System properties**: System properties exist on each Blob Storage resource. Some of them can be read or set, while others are read-only. Behind the scenes, some system properties correspond to certain standard HTTP headers. The Azure Storage client library for Go maintains these properties for you.

- **User-defined metadata**: User-defined metadata consists of one or more name-value pairs that you specify for a Blob storage resource. You can use metadata to store additional values with the resource. Metadata values are for your own purposes only, and don't affect how the resource behaves.

    Metadata name/value pairs are valid HTTP headers and should adhere to all restrictions governing HTTP headers. For more information about metadata naming requirements, see [Metadata names](/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-containers--blobs--and-metadata#metadata-names).

## Retrieve container properties

To retrieve container properties, call the following method from a container client object:

- [GetProperties](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/storage/azblob/container#Client.GetProperties)

The following code example fetches a container's system properties and writes some of the property values to a console window:

:::code language="go" source="~/blob-devguide-go/cmd/container-properties-metadata/container_properties_metadata.go" id="snippet_get_container_properties":::

## Set and retrieve metadata

You can specify metadata as one or more name-value pairs on a blob or container resource. To set metadata, call the following method from a container client object:

- [SetMetadata](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/storage/azblob/container#Client.SetMetadata)

Setting container metadata overwrites all existing metadata associated with the container. It's not possible to modify an individual name-value pair.

The following code example sets metadata on a container:

:::code language="go" source="~/blob-devguide-go/cmd/container-properties-metadata/container_properties_metadata.go" id="snippet_set_container_metadata":::

To retrieve metadata, call the following method from a container client object:

- [GetProperties](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/storage/azblob/container#Client.GetProperties)

Metadata is included in the response from `GetProperties`. The following example reads in metadata values and writes them to a console window: 

:::code language="go" source="~/blob-devguide-go/cmd/container-properties-metadata/container_properties_metadata.go" id="snippet_get_container_metadata":::

## Resources

To learn more about setting and retrieving container properties and metadata using the Azure Blob Storage client module for Go, see the following resources.

### Code samples

- View [code samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/blob-storage-devguide-go/blob/main/cmd/container-properties-metadata/container_properties_metadata.go) from this article (GitHub)

### REST API operations

The Azure SDK for Go contains libraries that build on top of the Azure REST API, allowing you to interact with REST API operations through familiar Go paradigms. The client library methods for setting and retrieving properties and metadata use the following REST API operations:

- [Get Container Properties](/rest/api/storageservices/get-container-properties) (REST API)
- [Set Container Metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/set-container-metadata) (REST API)
- [Get Container Metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/get-container-metadata) (REST API)

The `get_container_properties` method retrieves container properties and metadata by calling both the [Get Container Properties](/rest/api/storageservices/get-container-properties) operation and the [Get Container Metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/get-container-metadata) operation.
