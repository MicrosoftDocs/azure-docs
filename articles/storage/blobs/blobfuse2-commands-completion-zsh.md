## Usage

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  To do so, run the following command once:

`echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc`

To load completions in your current shell session:

`source <(blobfuse2 completion zsh); compdef _blobfuse2 blobfuse2`

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

- On Linux:

    `blobfuse2 completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_blobfuse2"`

- On macOS:

    `blobfuse2 completion zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_blobfuse2`

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.
