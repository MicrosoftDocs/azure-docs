# Customer intent: As a cloud administrator, I want to use Storage Explorer to manage file shares on Azure, so that I can efficiently organize, access, and control my file-based data in the cloud.

# Using Storage Explorer with Azure Files

Azure Files is a service that offers file shares in the cloud using the standard Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol. Both SMB 2.1 and SMB 3.0 are supported. With Azure Files, you can migrate legacy applications that rely on file shares to Azure quickly and without costly rewrites. You can use File storage to expose data publicly to the world, or to store application data privately. In this article, you'll learn how to use Storage Explorer to work with file shares and files.

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this article, you'll need the following:

- [Download and install Storage Explorer](https://www.storageexplorer.com/)

- [Connect to an Azure storage account or service](./vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer.md#connect-to-a-storage-account-or-service)

## Create a file share

All files must reside in a file share, which is simply a logical grouping of files. An account can contain an unlimited number of file shares, and each share can store an unlimited number of files.

The following steps illustrate how to create a file share within Storage Explorer.

1. Open Storage Explorer.

1. In the left pane, expand the storage account within which you wish to create the file share

1. Right-click **File Shares**, and - from the context menu - select **Create File Share**.

    ![Create file share](./media/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-files/image1.png)

1. A text box will appear below the **File Shares** folder. Enter the name for your file share. See the [Share naming rules](../blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-dotnet.md) section for a list of rules and restrictions on naming file shares.

    ![Naming the share](./media/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-files/image2.png)

1. Press **Enter** when done to create the file share, or **Esc** to cancel. Once the file share has been successfully created, it will be displayed under the **File Shares** folder for the selected storage account.

## View a file share's contents

File shares contain files and folders (that can also contain files).

The following steps illustrate how to view the contents of a file share within Storage Explorer:+

1. Open Storage Explorer.

1. In the left pane, expand the storage account containing the file share you wish to view.

1. Expand the storage account's **File Shares**.

1. Right-click the file share you wish to view, and - from the context menu - select **Open**. You can also double-click the file share you wish to view.

    ![Open share](./media/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-files/image4.png)

1. The main pane will display the file share's contents.

    ![Screenshot of the main pane for a file share in Storage Explorer showing the contents of the share.](./media/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-files/image5.png)

## Delete a file share

File shares can be easily created and deleted as needed. (To see how to delete individual files, refer to the section, [Managing files in a file share](./vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-blobs.md#managing-blobs-in-a-blob-container).)

The following steps illustrate how to delete a file share within Storage Explorer:

1. Open Storage Explorer.

1. In the left pane, expand the storage account containing the file share you wish to view.

1. Expand the storage account's **File Shares**.

1. Right-click the file share you wish to delete, and - from the context menu - select **Delete**. You can also press **Delete** to delete the currently selected file share.

    ![Delete](./media/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-files/image6.png)

1. Select **Yes** to the confirmation dialog.

    ![Confirmation dialog](./media/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-files/image7.png)

## Copy a file share

Storage Explorer enables you to copy a file share to the clipboard, and then paste that file share into another storage account. (To see how to copy individual files, refer to the section, [Managing files in a file share](./vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-blobs.md#managing-blobs-in-a-blob-container).)

The following steps illustrate how to copy a file share from one storage account to another.

1. Open Storage Explorer.

1. In the left pane, expand the storage account containing the file share you wish to copy.

1. Expand the storage account's **File Shares**.

1. Right-click the file share you wish to copy, and - from the context menu - select **Copy File Share**.

    ![Copy File Share](./media/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-files/image8.png)

1. Right-click the desired "target" storage account into which you want to paste the file share, and - from the context menu - select **Paste File Share**.

    ![Paste File Share](./media/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-files/image9.png)

## Get the SAS for a file share

A [shared access signature (SAS)](../common/storage-sas-overview.md) provides delegated access to resources in your storage account. This means that you can grant a client limited permissions to objects in your storage account for a specified period of time and with a specified set of permissions, without having to share your account access keys.

The following steps illustrate how to create a SAS for a file share:+

1. Open Storage Explorer.

1. In the left pane, expand the storage account containing the file share for which you wish to get a SAS.

1. Expand the storage account's **File Shares**.

1. Right-click the desired file share, and - from the context menu - select **Get Shared Access Signature**.

    ![Get Shared Access Signature](./media/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-files/image10.png)

1. In the **Shared Access Signature** dialog, specify the policy, start and expiration dates, time zone, and access levels you want for the resource.

    ![SAS dialog](./media/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-files/image11.png)

1. When you're finished specifying the SAS options, select **Create**.

1. A second **Shared Access Signature** dialog will then display that lists the file share along with the URL and QueryStrings you can use to access the storage resource. Select **Copy** next to the URL you wish to copy to the clipboard.

    ![Second SAS dialog](./media/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-files/image12.png)

1. When done, select **Close**.

## Manage Access Policies for a file share

The following steps illustrate how to manage (add and remove) access policies for a file share:+ . The Access Policies is used for creating SAS URLs through which people can use to access the Azure Files resource during a defined period of time.

1. Open Storage Explorer.

1. In the left pane, expand the storage account containing the file share whose access policies you wish to manage.

1. Expand the storage account's **File Shares**.

1. Select the desired file share, and - from the context menu - select **Manage Access Policies**.

    ![Manage access policies context menu](./media/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-files/image13.png)

1. The **Access Policies** dialog will list any access policies already created for the selected file share.

    ![Access Policies](./media/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-files/image14.png)

1. Follow these steps depending on the access policy management task:

    - **Add a new access policy** - Select **Add**. Once generated, the **Access Policies** dialog will display the newly added access policy (with default settings).

    - **Edit an access policy** - Make any desired edits, and select **Save**.

    - **Remove an access policy** - Select **Remove** next to the access policy you wish to remove.

1. Create a new SAS URL using the Access Policy you created earlier:
