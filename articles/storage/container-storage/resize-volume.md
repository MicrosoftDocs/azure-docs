# Resize persistent volumes in Azure Container Storage without downtime

You can expand persistent volumes in Azure Container Storage without downtime. Shrinking persistent volumes isn't supported.

You can't increase a volume beyond the maximum capacity available in your Elastic SAN or the local NVMe storage available on your nodes. If you need more capacity, first [increase your Elastic SAN capacity](../elastic-san/elastic-san-expand.md) or [increase your ephemeral disk (local NVMe) capacity](use-container-storage-with-local-disk.md#manage-storage) by adding more nodes to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. Then expand the volume size.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [container-storage-prerequisites](../../../includes/container-storage-prerequisites.md)]

- This article assumes you [installed Azure Container Storage version 2.x.x](./install-container-storage-aks.md) on your AKS cluster and created a persistent volume claim (PVC) using [Elastic SAN](use-container-storage-with-elastic-san.md) or [ephemeral disk (local NVMe)](use-container-storage-with-local-disk.md).

## Expand a volume

Follow these instructions to resize a persistent volume. A built-in StorageClass supports volume expansion, so reference a PVC created by an Azure Container Storage StorageClass. For example, if you created the PVC for Elastic SAN, it might be named `elasticsanpvc`.

1. Expand the PVC by increasing the `spec.resources.requests.storage` field. Replace `<pvc-name>` with the name of your PVC and `<size-in-Gi>` with the new size, for example `100Gi`.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   kubectl patch pvc <pvc-name> --type merge --patch '{"spec": {"resources": {"requests": {"storage": "<size-in-Gi>"}}}}'
   ```

1. Check the PVC to confirm the new size.

   ```azurecli
   kubectl describe pvc <pvc-name>
   ```
