# Create an Azure classic file share

Before you create an Azure classic file share, you need to answer two questions about how you want to use it:

- **What are the performance requirements for your file share?**  
   Azure classic file shares offer two different media tiers of storage, SSD (premium) and HDD (standard), which enable you to tailor your file shares to the performance and price requirements of your scenario. SSD file shares provide consistent high performance and low latency, within single-digit milliseconds for most IO operations. HDD file shares provide cost-effective storage for general purpose use.

- **What are the redundancy requirements for your Azure file share?**  
   Azure Files offers Local (LRS), Zone (ZRS), Geo (GRS), and GeoZone (GZRS) redundancy options for standard SMB file shares. SSD file shares are only available for the LRS and ZRS redundancy types. See [Azure Files redundancy](./files-redundancy.md) for more information.

For more information on these choices, see [Planning for an Azure Files deployment](storage-files-planning.md).

## Prerequisites

- This article assumes that you have an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, then create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
- If you intend to use Azure PowerShell, [install the latest version](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).
- If you intend to use Azure CLI, [install the latest version](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Create a storage account

Azure classic file shares are deployed into _storage accounts_, which are top-level objects that represent a shared pool of storage. This pool of storage can be used to deploy multiple file shares.

Storage accounts have two properties, kind and SKU, which dictate the billing model, media tier, and redundancy of the file shares deployed in the storage account. For Azure Files, there are three main combinations of kind and SKU to consider:

| Media tier  | Billing model                                                     | Storage account kind | Storage account SKUs                                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SSD and HDD | [Provisioned v2](./understanding-billing.md#provisioned-v2-model) | FileStorage          | <ul><li>PremiumV2_LRS</li><li>PremiumV2_ZRS</li><li>StandardV2_LRS</li><li>StandardV2_ZRS</li><li>StandardV2_GRS</li><li>StandardV2_GZRS</li></ul> |
| SSD         | [Provisioned v1](./understanding-billing.md#provisioned-v1-model) | FileStorage          | <ul><li>Premium_LRS</li><li>Premium_ZRS</li></ul>                                                                                                  |
| HDD         | [Pay-as-you-go](./understanding-billing.md#pay-as-you-go-model)   | StorageV2            | <ul><li>Standard_LRS</li><li>Standard_ZRS</li><li>Standard_GRS</li><li>Standard_GZRS</li></ul>                                                     |

We recommended the provisioned v2 billing model for all new file share deployments. The provisioned v1 and pay-as-you-go billing models remain fully supported for new and existing deployments. Provisioned v2 file shares are currently available in most regions. See [provisioned v2 availability](./understanding-billing.md#provisioned-v2-availability) for more information.

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To create a storage account via the Azure portal, use the search box at the top of the Azure portal to search for **storage accounts** and select the matching result.

![A screenshot of the Azure portal search box with results for "storage accounts".](./media/storage-how-to-create-file-share/create-storage-account-0.png)

This shows a list of all existing storage accounts available in your visible subscriptions. Select **+ Create** to create a new storage account.

### Basics

The first tab to complete creating a storage account is labeled **Basics**, which contains the required fields to create a storage account.

This setting is always available, even for FileStorage storage accounts which can't contain Azure Blob storage. Selecting an option has no impact on Azure Files.    |

> [!NOTE]
> Since all standard SMB file shares now support up to 100 TiB capacity when using the pay-as-you-go billing model and 256 TiB capacity when using the provisioned v2 billing model, the **large file shares** (LargeFileSharesState) property on storage accounts is no longer used and will be removed in the future.

### Networking

The networking section allows you to configure networking options. These settings are optional for the creation of the storage account and can be configured later if desired. For more information on these options, see [Azure Files networking considerations](storage-files-networking-overview.md).

### Data protection

The **Data protection** tab contains ability to enable or disable soft-delete. The soft-delete option for Azure Files is under the **Recovery** section.

## Create a classic file share

After you create a storage account, you can create a classic file share. This process is different depending on whether you created a provisioned v2, provisioned v1, or pay-as-you-go storage account.

> [!NOTE]
> The name of your file share must be all lower-case letters, numbers, and single hyphens, and must begin and end with a lower-case letter or number. The name can't contain two consecutive hyphens. For details about naming file shares and files, see [Naming and referencing shares, directories, files, and metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/Naming-and-Referencing-Shares--Directories--Files--and-Metadata).

### Create a provisioned v2 classic file share

When you create a classic file share using the provisioned v2 billing model, you specify how much storage, IOPS, and throughput your file share needs. The amount of each quantity that you provision determines your total bill. By default, when you create a new file share using the provisioned v2 model, we provide a recommendation for how many IOPS and how much throughput you need based on the amount of provisioned storage you specify. Depending on your individual file share requirements, you might find that you require more or less IOPS or throughput than our recommendations, and can optionally override these recommendations with your own values as desired. To learn more, see [Understanding the provisioned v2 billing model](./understanding-billing.md#provisioned-v2-model).

> [!NOTE]
> Before you create a provisioned v2 classic file share, make sure the storage account you intend to use is of the *FileStorage* storage account kind. Go to the Overview tab essentials section of the storage account to check its account kind.  

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Follow these instructions to create a new Azure file share using the Azure portal.

1. Go to your newly created storage account. From the service menu, under **Data storage**, select **File shares**.

   ![A screenshot of the file shares item underneath the data storage node in the table of contents for the storage account.](./media/storage-how-to-create-file-share/create-file-share-provisioned-v2-0.png)

2. In the file share listing, you should see any previously created file shares in this storage account or an empty table if no file shares exist. Select **+ File share** to create a new file share.

3. Complete the field in the **Basics** tab of the new file share blade:

   ![A screenshot of the basics tab in the new file share blade (provisioned v2).](./media/storage-how-to-create-file-share/create-file-share-provisioned-v2-1.png)

   - **Name**: The name of the file share to be created.

   - **Provisioned storage (GiB)**: The amount of storage to provision on the share. The actual provisioned storage capacity is the amount that you're billed for regardless of actual usage.

   - **Provisioned IOPS and throughput**: A radio button group that lets you select between _Recommended provisioning_ and _Manually specify IOPS and throughput_. The IOPS and throughput recommendations are based on typical customer usage for that amount of provisioned storage for that media tier, so if you don't know specifically what your IOPS and throughput requirements are, we recommend you stick with the recommendations and adjust later as needed.

     - **IOPS**: If you select _Manually specify IOPS and throughput_, this textbox enables you to enter the amount of IOPS you want to provision on this file share.

     - **Throughput (MiB/sec)**: If you select _Manually specify IOPS and throughput_, this textbox enables you to enter the amount of throughput you want to provision on this file share.

4. Select the **Backup** tab. By default, [backup is enabled](../../backup/backup-azure-files.md) when you create an Azure file share using the Azure portal. If you want to disable backup for the file share, uncheck the **Enable backup** checkbox. If you want backup enabled, you can either leave the defaults or create a new Recovery Services Vault in the same region and subscription as the storage account. To create a new backup policy, select **Create a new policy**.

5. Select **Review + create** and then **Create** to create the Azure file share.

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

You can create a provisioned v2 Azure file share with the `New-AzRmStorageShare` cmdlet. The following PowerShell commands assume you set the variables `$resourceGroupName` and `$storageAccountName` as defined in the "Create Storage Account" section.

To create a provisioned v2 file share, use the following command. Remember to replace the values for the variables `$shareName` and `$provisionedStorageGib` with the desired selections for your file share deployment.

```powershell
$shareName = "<name-of-the-file-share>"

# The provisioned storage size of the share in GiB. Valid range is 32 to 262,144.
$provisionedStorageGib = 1024

# If you do not specify on the ProvisionedBandwidthMibps and ProvisionedIops, the deployment will use the recommended provisioning.
$provisionedIops = 3000
$provisionedThroughputMibPerSec = 130

New-AzRmStorageShare -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -AccountName $storageAccountName -ShareName $shareName -QuotaGiB $provisionedStorageGib;
# -ProvisionedBandwidthMibps $provisionedThroughputMibPerSec -ProvisionedIops $provisionedIops
$f = Get-AzRmStorageShare -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -AccountName $storageAccountName -ShareName $shareName;
$f | fl
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

You can create a Provisioned v2 Azure file share with [`az storage share-rm create`](/cli/azure/storage/share-rm#az-storage-share-rm-create) command. The following PowerShell commands assume you set the variables `resourceGroupName` and `storageAccountName` as defined in the creating a storage account with Azure CLI section.

To create a provisioned v2 file share, use the following command. Remember to replace the values for the variables `shareName`, `provisionedStorageGib` with the desired selections for your file share deployment.

```bash
shareName="<file-share>"

# The provisioned storage size of the share in GiB. Valid range is 32 to
# 262,144.
provisionedStorageGib=1024

# If you do not specify on the ProvisionedBandwidthMibps and ProvisionedIops, the deployment will use the recommended provisioning.
provisionedIops=3000
provisionedThroughputMibPerSec=130

az storage share-rm create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --name $shareName --storage-account $storageAccountName --quota $provisionedStorageGib
# --provisioned-iops $provisionedIops --provisioned-bandwidth-mibps $provisionedThroughputMibPerSec
```

### Create an SSD provisioned v1 classic file share

When you create a classic file share using the provisioned v1 billing model, you specify how much storage your share needs, and IOPS and throughput capacity are computed for you based on how much storage provisioned. Depending on your individual file share requirements, you might find that you require more IOPS or throughput than our recommendations. In this case, you need to provision more storage to get the required IOPS or throughput. To learn more, see [Understanding the provisioned v1 billing model](./understanding-billing.md#provisioned-v1-model).

> [!NOTE]
> Before you start create a provisioned v1 classic file share, please make sure the storage account you intend to use is "FileStorage" storage account kind. Go to overview tab essentials section of the storage account to check its account kind.  

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Follow these instructions to create a new Azure classic file share using the Azure portal.

1. Go to your newly created storage account. From the service menu, under **Data storage**, select **File shares**.

   ![A screenshot of the basics tab in the new file share blade (provisioned v1).](./media/storage-how-to-create-file-share/create-file-share-provisioned-v1-0.png)

   - **Name**: The name of the file share to be created.

   - **Provisioned storage (GiB)**: The amount of storage to provision on the share. The provisioned storage capacity is the amount that you're billed for regardless of actual usage.

   - **Protocol**: The file sharing protocol to use on the share. By default, new shares use the SMB protocol. Select the NFS protocol to create an NFS v4.1 share.

4. Select the **Backup** tab. By default, [backup is enabled](../../backup/backup-azure-files.md) when you create an Azure file share using the Azure portal. If you want to disable backup for the file share, uncheck the **Enable backup** checkbox. If you want backup enabled, you can either leave the defaults or create a new Recovery Services Vault in the same region and subscription as the storage account. To create a new backup policy, select **Create a new policy**. NFS shares don't support Azure Backup.

5. Select **Review + create** and then **Create** to create the Azure file share.

### Create an HDD pay-as-you-go classic file share

HDD pay-as-you-go file shares have a property called access tier. All three access tiers are stored on the exact same storage hardware. The main difference for these three access tiers is their data at-rest storage prices, which are lower in cooler tiers, and the transaction prices, which are higher in the cooler tiers. To learn more about the differences between tiers, see [differences in access tiers](./understanding-billing.md#differences-in-access-tiers).

> [!NOTE]
> Before you start create a pay-as-you-go classic file share, please make sure the storage account you intend to use is "StorageV2 (general purpose v2)" storage account kind. Go to overview tab essentials section of the storage account to check its account kind.

## Set up networking

If you're using an SMB file share, networking configuration isn't required. However, we still recommend you take it into consideration. If you're using an NFS file share, networking configuration is required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The NFSv4.1 protocol runs on port 2049. If you're connecting from an on-premises network, make sure that your client allows outgoing communication through port 2049. If you grant access to specific VNets, make sure that any network security groups associated with those VNets don't contain security rules that block incoming communication through port 2049.

### Set up a private endpoint or service endpoint

NFS file shares require network-level security configurations. Currently there are two options for establishing networking-level security configurations: Private endpoint and service endpoint. Private endpoint gives your file share a private, static IP address within your virtual network, preventing connectivity interruptions from dynamic IP address changes. Traffic to your file share stays within peered virtual networks, including those in other regions and on premises. Standard [data processing rates](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/private-link/) for private endpoints apply. See [What is a private endpoint](../../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md) to learn more. 

If you don't require a static IP address, you can enable a service endpoint for Azure Files within the virtual network. A service endpoint configures file share to allow access only from specific subnets. The allowed subnets can belong to a virtual network in the same subscription or a different subscription, including those that belong to a different Microsoft Entra tenant. There's no extra charge for using service endpoints. See [Azure virtual network service endpoints](../../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview.md) to learn more.

1. Select the NFS file share you created. You should see a dialog that says _Connect to this NFS share from Linux_. Under **Network configuration**, select **Review options**
