# Enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services authentication on Azure Files

[!INCLUDE [storage-files-aad-auth-include](../../../includes/storage-files-aad-auth-include.md)]

This article focuses on enabling Microsoft Entra Domain Services (formerly Azure Active Directory Domain Services) for identity-based authentication with Azure file shares. In this authentication scenario, Microsoft Entra credentials and Microsoft Entra Domain Services credentials are the same and can be used interchangeably.

We strongly recommend that you review the [How it works section](./storage-files-active-directory-overview.md#how-it-works) to select the right AD source for your storage account. The setup is different depending on the AD source you choose.

If you're new to Azure Files, we recommend reading our [planning guide](storage-files-planning.md) before reading this article.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Files supports Kerberos authentication with Microsoft Entra Domain Services with RC4-HMAC and AES-256 encryption. We recommend using AES-256.
>
> Azure Files supports authentication for Microsoft Entra Domain Services with full or partial (scoped) synchronization with Microsoft Entra ID. For environments with scoped synchronization present, administrators should be aware that Azure Files only honors Azure RBAC role assignments granted to principals that are synchronized. Role assignments granted to identities not synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Microsoft Entra Domain Services will be ignored by the Azure Files service.

## Prerequisites

Before you enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services over SMB for Azure file shares, make sure you've completed the following prerequisites:

1.  **Select or create a Microsoft Entra tenant.**

    You can use a new or existing tenant. The tenant and the file share that you want to access must be associated with the same subscription.

    To create a new Microsoft Entra tenant, you can [Add a Microsoft Entra tenant and a Microsoft Entra subscription](/windows/client-management/mdm/add-an-azure-ad-tenant-and-azure-ad-subscription). If you have an existing Microsoft Entra tenant but want to create a new tenant for use with Azure file shares, see [Create a Microsoft Entra tenant](/rest/api/datacatalog/create-an-azure-active-directory-tenant).

1.  **Enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services on the Microsoft Entra tenant.**

    To support authentication with Microsoft Entra credentials, you must enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services for your Microsoft Entra tenant. If you aren't the administrator of the Microsoft Entra tenant, contact the administrator and follow the step-by-step guidance to [Enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services using the Azure portal](../../active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-create-instance.md).

    It typically takes about 15 minutes for a Microsoft Entra Domain Services deployment to complete. Verify that the health status of Microsoft Entra Domain Services shows **Running**, with password hash synchronization enabled, before proceeding to the next step.

1.  **Domain-join an Azure VM with Microsoft Entra Domain Services.**

    To access an Azure file share by using Microsoft Entra credentials from a VM, your VM must be domain-joined to Microsoft Entra Domain Services. For more information about how to domain-join a VM, see [Join a Windows Server virtual machine to a managed domain](../../active-directory-domain-services/join-windows-vm.md). Microsoft Entra Domain Services authentication over SMB with Azure file shares is supported only on Azure VMs running on OS versions above Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Non-domain-joined VMs can access Azure file shares using Microsoft Entra Domain Services authentication only if the VM has unimpeded network connectivity to the domain controllers for Microsoft Entra Domain Services. Usually this requires either site-to-site or point-to-site VPN.

1.  **Select or create an Azure file share.**

    Select a new or existing file share that's associated with the same subscription as your Microsoft Entra tenant. For information about creating a new file share, see [Create a file share in Azure Files](storage-how-to-create-file-share.md).
    For optimal performance, we recommend that your file share be in the same region as the VM from which you plan to access the share.

1.  **Verify Azure Files connectivity by mounting Azure file shares using your storage account key.**

    To verify that your VM and file share are properly configured, try mounting the file share using your storage account key. For more information, see [Mount an Azure file share and access the share in Windows](storage-how-to-use-files-windows.md).

## Regional availability

Azure Files authentication with Microsoft Entra Domain Services is available in [all Azure Public, Gov, and China regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/locations/).

## Enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services authentication for your account

To enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services authentication over SMB for Azure Files, you can set a property on storage accounts by using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or Azure CLI. Setting this property implicitly "domain joins" the storage account with the associated Microsoft Entra Domain Services deployment. Microsoft Entra Domain Services authentication over SMB is then enabled for all new and existing file shares in the storage account.

Keep in mind that you can enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services authentication over SMB only after you've successfully deployed Microsoft Entra Domain Services to your Microsoft Entra tenant. For more information, see the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services authentication over SMB with the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), follow these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, go to your existing storage account, or [create a storage account](../common/storage-account-create.md).
1. Select **Data storage** > **File shares**.
1. In the **File share settings** section, select **Identity-based access: Not configured**.

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

To enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services authentication over SMB with Azure PowerShell, install the latest Az module (2.4 or newer) or the Az.Storage module (1.5 or newer). For more information about installing PowerShell, see [Install Azure PowerShell on Windows with PowerShellGet](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).

To create a new storage account, call [New-AzStorageAccount](/powershell/module/az.storage/New-azStorageAccount), and then set the **EnableAzureActiveDirectoryDomainServicesForFile** parameter to **true**. In the following example, remember to replace the placeholder values with your own values. (If you were using the previous preview module, the parameter for enabling the feature is **EnableAzureFilesAadIntegrationForSMB**.)

```powershell
# Create a new storage account
New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "<resource-group-name>" `
    -Name "<storage-account-name>" `
    -Location "<azure-region>" `
    -SkuName Standard_LRS `
    -Kind StorageV2 `
    -EnableAzureActiveDirectoryDomainServicesForFile $true
```

To enable this feature on existing storage accounts, use the following command:

```powershell
# Update a storage account
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "<resource-group-name>" `
    -Name "<storage-account-name>" `
    -EnableAzureActiveDirectoryDomainServicesForFile $true
```


# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To enable Microsoft Entra authentication over SMB with Azure CLI, install the latest CLI version (Version 2.0.70 or newer). For more information about installing Azure CLI, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

To create a new storage account, call [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-create), and set the `--enable-files-aadds` argument. In the following example, remember to replace the placeholder values with your own values. (If you were using the previous preview module, the parameter for feature enablement is **file-aad**.)

```azurecli-interactive
# Create a new storage account
az storage account create -n <storage-account-name> -g <resource-group-name> --enable-files-aadds
```

To enable this feature on existing storage accounts, use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
# Update a new storage account
az storage account update -n <storage-account-name> -g <resource-group-name> --enable-files-aadds
```

## Recommended: Use AES-256 encryption

By default, Microsoft Entra Domain Services authentication uses Kerberos RC4 encryption. We recommend configuring it to use Kerberos AES-256 encryption instead by following these instructions.

The action requires running an operation on the Active Directory domain that's managed by Microsoft Entra Domain Services to reach a domain controller to request a property change to the domain object. The cmdlets below are Windows Server Active Directory PowerShell cmdlets, not Azure PowerShell cmdlets. Because of this, these PowerShell commands must be run from a client machine that's domain-joined to the Microsoft Entra Domain Services domain.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Windows Server Active Directory PowerShell cmdlets in this section must be run in Windows PowerShell 5.1 from a client machine that's domain-joined to the Microsoft Entra Domain Services domain. PowerShell 7.x and Azure Cloud Shell won't work in this scenario.

Log into the domain-joined client machine as a Microsoft Entra Domain Services user with the required permissions. You must have write access to the `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` attribute of the domain object. Typically, members of the **AAD DC Administrators** group will have the necessary permissions. Open a normal (non-elevated) PowerShell session and execute the following commands.

```powershell
# 1. Find the service account in your managed domain that represents the storage account.

$storageAccountName= “<InsertStorageAccountNameHere>”
$searchFilter = "Name -like '*{0}*'" -f $storageAccountName
$userObject = Get-ADUser -filter $searchFilter

if ($userObject -eq $null)
{
   Write-Error "Cannot find AD object for storage account:$storageAccountName" -ErrorAction Stop
}

# 2. Set the KerberosEncryptionType of the object

Set-ADUser $userObject -KerberosEncryptionType AES256

# 3. Validate that the object now has the expected (AES256) encryption type.

Get-ADUser $userObject -properties KerberosEncryptionType
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you were previously using RC4 encryption and update the storage account to use AES-256, you should run `klist purge` on the client and then remount the file share to get new Kerberos tickets with AES-256.

## Next step

- To grant users access to your file share, follow the instructions in [Assign share-level permissions](storage-files-identity-assign-share-level-permissions.md).
