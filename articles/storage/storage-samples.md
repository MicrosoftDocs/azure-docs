# Azure Storage samples

## Overview
Use the links below to view and download working Azure Storage samples.

## Azure Code Sample Library

The [Azure Code Sample Library](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/samples/?service=storage) includes samples for Azure Storage that you can download and run locally. The Code Sample Library provides sample code in .zip format. Alternatively, you can browse and clone the GitHub repository for each sample.

## Getting started samples

* [Get started with Azure Storage in five minutes](storage-getting-started-guide.md)
* [Visual Studio Quick Starts for Azure Storage](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-net/tree/master/Samples/GettingStarted/VisualStudioQuickStarts)

## .NET samples

To explore the .NET samples, download the [.NET Storage Client Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage/) from NuGet. The .NET storage client library is also available in the [Azure SDK for .NET](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/).

* [Getting Started with Azure Blob Service in .NET](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/samples/storage-blob-dotnet-getting-started/)

## Java samples

To explore the Java samples, download the [Java Storage Client Library](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-java).

* [Get started with blobs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-java/tree/master/microsoft-azure-storage-samples/src/com/microsoft/azure/storage/blob/gettingstarted)
* [Get started with tables](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-java/tree/master/microsoft-azure-storage-samples/src/com/microsoft/azure/storage/table/gettingtstarted)
* [Get started with queues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-java/tree/master/microsoft-azure-storage-samples/src/com/microsoft/azure/storage/queue/gettingstarted)

## Node.js samples

To explore the Node.js samples, download the [Node.js Storage Client Library](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node).

* [Blob uploader](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node/tree/master/examples/blobuploader)
* [Upload and download blob](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node/blob/master/examples/samples/blobuploaddownloadsample.js)
* [Continuation token](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node/blob/master/examples/samples/continuationsample.js)
