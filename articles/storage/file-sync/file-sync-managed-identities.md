# How to use managed identities with Azure File Sync (preview)

Azure File Sync support for system-assigned managed identities is now in preview.

Managed Identity support eliminates the need for shared keys as a method of authentication by utilizing a system-assigned managed identity provided by Microsoft Entra ID. 

When you enable this configuration, the system-assigned managed identities will be used for the following scenarios:
-	Storage Sync Service authentication to Azure file share
-	Registered server authentication to Azure file share
-	Registered server authentication to Storage Sync Service 

To learn more about the benefits of using managed identities, see [Managed identities for Azure resources](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

To configure your Azure File Sync deployment to utilize system-assigned managed identities, please follow the guidance in the subsequent sections.

## Prerequisites
# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal) 
- You need to have a **Storage Sync Service** [deployed](file-sync-deployment-guide.md) with at least one **registered server**.  

- **Azure File Sync agent version 19.1.0.0 or later** must be installed on the registered server. 

- On your **storage accounts** used by Azure File Sync: 

  - You must be a **member of the Owner management role** or have “Microsoft.Authorization/roleassignments/write” permissions. 

  - **Allow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage account** exception must be enabled for preview. [Learn more](file-sync-networking-endpoints.md#grant-access-to-trusted-azure-services-and-restrict-access-to-the-storage-account-public-endpoint-to-specific-virtual-networks) 

  - **Allow storage account key access** must be enabled for preview. To check this setting, navigate to your storage account and select **Configuration** under the Settings section.

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell) 
- You need to have a **Storage Sync Service** [deployed](file-sync-deployment-guide.md) with at least one **registered server**.  

- **Azure File Sync agent version 19.1.0.0 or later** must be installed on the registered server. 

- On your **storage accounts** used by Azure File Sync: 

  - You must be a **member of the Owner management role** or have “Microsoft.Authorization/roleassignments/write” permissions. 

  - **Allow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage account** exception must be enabled for preview. [Learn more](file-sync-networking-endpoints.md#grant-access-to-trusted-azure-services-and-restrict-access-to-the-storage-account-public-endpoint-to-specific-virtual-networks) 

  - **Allow storage account key access** must be enabled for preview. To check this setting, navigate to your storage account and select **Configuration** under the Settings section. 
  
  -	**Az.StorageSync [PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.StorageSync) version 2.2.0 or later** must be installed on the machine that will be used to configure Azure File Sync to use managed identities.

## Regional availability

Azure File Sync support for system-assigned managed identities (preview) is available in [all Azure Public and Gov regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/locations/) that support Azure File Sync.

## Enable a system-assigned managed identity on your registered servers
Before you can configure Azure File Sync to use managed identities, your registered servers must have a system-assigned managed identity that will be used to authenticate to the Azure File Sync service and Azure file shares. 

To enable a system-assigned managed identity on a registered server that has the Azure File Sync v19 agent installed, perform the following steps:
- If the server is hosted outside of Azure, it must be an **Azure Arc-enabled server** to have a system-assigned managed identity. For more information on Azure Arc-enabled servers and how to install the Azure Connected Machine agent, see: [Azure Arc-enabled servers Overview](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).  
- If the server is an Azure virtual machine, **enable the system-assigned managed identity setting on the VM**. For more information, see: [Configure managed identities on Azure virtual machines](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-configure-managed-identities?pivots=qs-configure-portal-windows-vm#enable-system-assigned-managed-identity-on-an-existing-vm).

> [!NOTE]
> - At least one registered server must have a system-assigned managed identity before you can configure the Storage Sync Service to use a system-assigned identity.
> - Once the Storage Sync Service is configured to use managed identities, registered servers that do not have a system-assigned managed identity will continue to use a shared key to authenticate to your Azure file shares.
 
### How to check if your registered servers have a system-assigned managed identity
# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal) 
To check if your registered servers have a system-assigned managed identity, perform the following steps using the portal:  

1. Go to your **Storage Sync Service** in the Azure portal, expand **Settings** and select **Managed identity (preview)**. 

2. In the Registered Servers section, click the **Ready to use Managed ID** tile. This tile displays a list of servers that have a system-assigned managed identity. If your server is not listed, perform the steps to [Enable a system-assigned managed identity on your registered servers]( #enable-a-system-assigned-managed-identity-on-your-registered-servers).  

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell) 
To check if your registered servers have a system-assigned managed identity, run the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Get-AzStorageSyncServer -ResourceGroupName <string> -StorageSyncServiceName <string>
```

Verify the **LatestApplicationId** property has a GUID which indicates the server has a system-assigned managed identity but is not currently configured to use the managed identity.  

If the value for the **ActiveAuthType** property is **Certificate** and the **LatestApplicationId** does not have a GUID, the server does not have a system-assigned managed identity and will use shared keys to authenticate to the Azure file share.

> [!NOTE]
> Once a server is configured to use the system-assigned managed identity by following the steps in the following section, the **LatestApplicationId** property is no longer used (will be empty), the **ActiveAuthType** property value will be changed to **ManagedIdentity**, and the **ApplicationId** property will have a GUID which is the system-assigned managed identity.

## Configure your Azure File Sync deployment to use system-assigned managed identities
# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal) 

To configure the Storage Sync Service and registered servers to use system-assigned managed identities, perform the following steps in the portal: 

1. Go to your **Storage Sync Service** in the Azure portal, expand **Settings** and select **Managed identity (preview)**. 

2. Click **Turn on Managed identity** to begin setup. 

The following steps are performed and will take several minutes (or longer for large topologies) to complete: 

- Enables a system-assigned managed identity for Storage Sync Service resource. 

- Grants the Storage Sync Service system-assigned managed identity access to your Storage Accounts (Storage Account Contributor role). 

- Grants the Storage Sync Service system-assigned managed identity access to your Azure file shares (Storage File Data Privileged Contributor role). 

- Grants the registered server(s) system-assigned managed identity access to the Azure file shares (Storage File Data Privileged Contributor role). 

- Configures the Storage Sync Service to use system-assigned managed identity. 

- Configures registered server(s) to use system-assigned managed identity.  

> [!NOTE] 
> Once the registered server(s) are configured to use a system-assigned managed identity, it can take up to one hour before the server uses the system-assigned managed identity to authenticate to the Storage Sync Service and file shares.


# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell) 
To configure the Storage Sync Service and registered servers to use system-assigned managed identities, run the following command from an elevated PowerShell window:

```powershell
Set-AzStorageSyncServiceIdentity -ResourceGroupName <string> -StorageSyncServiceName <string> -Verbose
```
The **Set-AzStorageSyncServiceIdentity** cmdlet performs the following steps for you and will take several minutes (or longer for large topologies) to complete:
- Validates at least one registered server has a system assigned managed identity. 
  - The cmdlet will stop at this step if there are no registered servers with a system-assigned managed identity.
-	Enables a system-assigned managed identity for Storage Sync Service resource.
- Grants the Storage Sync Service system-assigned managed identity access to your Storage Accounts (Storage Account Contributor role).
-	Grants the Storage Sync Service system-assigned managed identity access to your Azure file shares (Storage File Data Privileged Contributor role).
-	Grants the registered server(s) system-assigned managed identity access to the Azure file shares (Storage File Data Privileged Contributor role).
-	Configures the Storage Sync Service to use system-assigned managed identity.
- Configures registered server(s) to use system-assigned managed identity. 

Use the **Set-AzStorageSyncServiceIdentity** cmdlet anytime you need to configure additional registered servers to use managed identities.

> [!NOTE]
> Once the registered server(s) are configured to use a system-assigned managed identity, it can take up to one hour before the server uses the system-assigned managed identity to authenticate to the Storage Sync Service and file shares.

### How to check if the Storage Sync Service is using a system-assigned managed identity

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)  

To check if the Storage Sync Service is using a system-assigned managed identity, perform the following steps in the portal: 

1. Go to your **Storage Sync Service** in the Azure portal, expand **Settings** and select **Managed identity (preview)**. 

2. In the Registered Servers section, if you have at least one server listed in the **Using Managed ID** tile, your service is configured to use managed identities.  

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell) 
To check if the Storage Sync Service is using a system-assigned managed identity, run the following command from an elevated PowerShell window:

```powershell
Get-AzStorageSyncService -ResourceGroupName <string> -StorageSyncServiceName <string>
```
Verify the value for the **UseIdentity** property is **True**. If the value is **False**, the Storage Sync Service is using shared keys to authenticate to the Azure file shares.
