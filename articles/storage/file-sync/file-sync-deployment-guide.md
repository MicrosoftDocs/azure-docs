# Customer intent: As a system administrator, I want to deploy Azure File Sync by using the portal, PowerShell, or the CLI, so that I can centralize file shares in Azure while maintaining local access and performance.
---

# Deploy Azure File Sync

Use Azure File Sync to centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files, while keeping the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of an on-premises file server. Azure File Sync transforms Windows Server into a quick cache of your Azure file share. You can use any protocol that's available on Windows Server to access your data locally, including Server Message Block (SMB), Network File System (NFS), and File Transfer Protocol over SSL/TLS (FTPS). You can have as many caches as you need across the world.

We strongly recommend that you read [Plan to deploy Azure Files](../files/storage-files-planning.md) and [Plan for an Azure File Sync deployment](file-sync-planning.md) before you complete the steps in this article.

## Prerequisites

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

- You need an Azure file share in the same region where you want to deploy Azure File Sync. We recommend provisioned v2 file shares for all new deployments. For more information, see:

  - [Azure File Sync region availability](file-sync-planning.md#azure-file-sync-region-availability)
  - [Create an SMB Azure file share](../files/storage-how-to-create-file-share.md?toc=/azure/storage/filesync/toc.json)
  - [Provisioned v2 model](../files/understanding-billing.md#provisioned-v2-model)

- You must enable the following storage account settings to give Azure File Sync access to the storage account:  

  - SMB security settings must allow the SMB 3.1.1 protocol version, NTLM v2 authentication, and AES-128-GCM encryption. To check the SMB security settings on the storage account, see [SMB security settings](../files/files-smb-protocol.md#smb-security-settings).
  - **Allow storage account key access** must be set to **Enabled**. To check this setting, go to your storage account and select **Configuration** in the **Settings** section.

- You need at least one supported instance of Windows Server to sync with Azure File Sync. For more information about supported versions of Windows Server and recommended system resources, see [Considerations for Windows file servers](file-sync-planning.md#considerations-for-windows-file-servers).

- The following Windows updates must be installed on the Windows Server instance:

  - Windows Server 2012 R2: [KB5021653](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/kb5021653-out-of-band-update-for-windows-server-2012-r2-november-17-2022-8e6ec2e9-6373-46d7-95bc-852f992fd1ff)
  - Windows Server 2016: [KB5040562](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/kb5040562-servicing-stack-update-for-windows-10-version-1607-and-server-2016-july-9-2024-281c97b9-c566-417e-8406-a84efd30f70c)
  - Windows Server 2019: [KB5005112](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/kb5005112-servicing-stack-update-for-windows-10-version-1809-august-10-2021-df6a9e0d-8012-41f4-ae74-b79f1c1940b2) and [KB5040430](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/july-9-2024-kb5040430-os-build-17763-6054-0bb10c24-db8c-47eb-8fa9-9ebc06afa4e7)

- The administrator who registers the server and creates the cloud endpoint must be a member of the management role [Azure File Sync Administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/storage#azure-file-sync-administrator), Owner, or Contributor for the storage sync service. You can configure this role under **Access Control (IAM)** on the Azure portal page for the storage sync service.

- If you intend to use Azure File Sync with a Windows Server failover cluster, you must configure the **File Server for general use** role before you install the Azure File Sync agent on each node in the cluster. For more information on how to configure the **File Server for general use** role on a failover cluster, see [Deploy a two-node clustered file server](/windows-server/failover-clustering/deploy-two-node-clustered-file-server).

  > [!NOTE]
  > The only scenario that Azure File Sync supports is a Windows Server failover cluster with clustered disks. For more information, see [Failover clustering](file-sync-planning.md#failover-clustering).

- Although you can manage cloud resources by using the Azure portal, PowerShell cmdlets provide advanced functionality for registered servers. You run these cmdlets locally in either PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 6+. On Windows Server 2012 R2, you can verify that you're running at least PowerShell 5.1.\* by checking the value of the `PSVersion` property of the `$PSVersionTable` object:

  ```powershell
  $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
  ```

  If your `PSVersion` value is less than `5.1.*`, you need to upgrade by downloading and installing [Windows Management Framework 5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54616). The appropriate package to download and install for Windows Server 2012 R2 is **Win8.1AndW2K12R2-KB\*\*\*\*\*\*\*-x64.msu**.

  You can use PowerShell 6+ with any supported system and download it via its [GitHub page](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#get-powershell).

  You can use PowerShell 6+ with any supported system and download it via its [GitHub page](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#get-powershell).

- If you opted to use PowerShell 5.1, ensure that at least .NET 4.7.2 is installed. [Learn more about .NET Framework versions and dependencies](/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies) on your system.

  If you're installing .NET 4.7.2+ on Windows Server Core, you must install with the `quiet` and `norestart` flags, or the installation will fail. For example, if you're installing .NET 4.8, the command looks like the following example:

  ```PowerShell
   Start-Process -FilePath "ndp48-x86-x64-allos-enu.exe" -ArgumentList "/q /norestart" -Wait
   ```

- You need the Az PowerShell module. For instructions, see [Install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).

  The Az.StorageSync module is installed automatically when you install the Az PowerShell module.

- Complete the Azure CLI installation, authentication, and setup:

  1. [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

     If you prefer, you can also use Azure Cloud Shell to complete the steps in this article. Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive shell environment that you use through your browser. Open Cloud Shell by using one of these methods:

     - In the upper-right corner of a code block, select **Try It**. This action opens Azure Cloud Shell, but it doesn't automatically copy the code to Cloud Shell.

     - Go directly to [Cloud Shell in the Azure portal](https://shell.azure.com).

     - In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), on the menu bar, select the **Cloud Shell** button.

  1. Sign in to Azure. If you're using a local installation of the Azure CLI, use the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command:

     ```azurecli
     az login
     ```

     Follow the steps displayed in your terminal to complete the authentication process.

  1. Install the [`az filesync`](/cli/azure/storagesync) Azure CLI extension:

     ```azurecli
     az extension add --name storagesync
     ```

     After you install the `storagesync` extension reference, you receive the following warning:

     ```output
     The installed extension 'storagesync' is experimental and not covered by customer support. Please use with discretion.
     ```

- Although you can manage cloud resources by using the Azure CLI, PowerShell cmdlets provide advanced functionality for registered servers. You run these cmdlets locally in either PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 6+. On Windows Server 2012 R2, you can verify that you're running at least PowerShell 5.1.\* by checking the value of the `PSVersion` property of the `$PSVersionTable` object:

## <a name = "deploy-the-storage-sync-service"></a>Deploy a storage sync service

The deployment of Azure File Sync starts with placing a *storage sync service* resource in a resource group of your selected subscription. You'll create a trust relationship between your servers and this resource.

A server can be registered to only one storage sync service. As a result, we recommend deploying as many storage sync services as you need to separate groups of servers. Keep in mind that servers from different storage sync services can't sync with each other.

The storage sync service inherits access permissions from the subscription and resource group in which it's deployed. We recommend that you carefully check who has access to it. Entities that have write access can start syncing new sets of files from servers registered to this storage sync service and cause data to flow to Azure storage that's accessible to them.

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Create a resource**.

1. Search for **Azure File Sync** and select it in the results.

1. Select **Create**. On the **Deploy Storage Sync** tab, enter the following information:

   - **Name**: A unique name (per region) for the storage sync service.
   - **Subscription**: The subscription in which you want to create the storage sync service. Depending on your organization's configuration strategy, you might have access to one or more subscriptions. An Azure subscription is the most basic container for billing for each cloud service (such as Azure Files).
   - **Resource group**: A logical group of Azure resources, such as a storage account or a storage sync service. You can create a new resource group or use an existing resource group for Azure File Sync. We recommend using resource groups as containers to isolate resources logically for your organization, such as grouping HR resources or resources for a specific project.
   - **Location**: The region in which you want to deploy Azure File Sync. Only supported regions are available in this list.

1. Select **Create**.

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Use the following commands to create and deploy a storage sync service. Replace `<Az_Region>`, `<RG_Name>`, and `<my_storage_sync_service>` with your own values.

```powershell
$hostType = (Get-Host).Name

if ($installType -eq "Server Core" -or $hostType -eq "ServerRemoteHost") {
    Connect-AzAccount -UseDeviceAuthentication
}
else {
    Connect-AzAccount
}

# This variable holds the Azure region in which you want to deploy 
# Azure File Sync.
$region = '<Az_Region>'

# Check to ensure that Azure File Sync is available in the selected Azure
# region.
$regions = @()
Get-AzLocation | ForEach-Object { 
    if ($_.Providers -contains "Microsoft.StorageSync") { 
        $regions += $_.Location 
    } 
}

if ($regions -notcontains $region) {
    throw [System.Exception]::new("Azure File Sync is either not available in the selected Azure Region or the region is mistyped.")
}

# The resource group in which you want to deploy the storage sync service.
$resourceGroup = '<RG_Name>'

# Check to ensure that the resource group exists; create it if it doesn't.
$resourceGroups = @()
Get-AzResourceGroup | ForEach-Object { 
    $resourceGroups += $_.ResourceGroupName 
}

if ($resourceGroups -notcontains $resourceGroup) {
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroup -Location $region
}

$storageSyncName = "<my_storage_sync_service>"
$storageSync = New-AzStorageSyncService -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name $storageSyncName -Location $region
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Follow the instructions for the Azure portal or PowerShell.

## Install the Azure File Sync agent

The Azure File Sync agent is a downloadable package that enables Windows Server to be synced with an Azure file share.

If you intend to use Azure File Sync with a failover cluster, the Azure File Sync agent must be installed on every node in the cluster. Each node in the cluster must be registered to work with Azure File Sync.

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Download the agent from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=858257). When the download is finished, double-click the MSI package to start the agent installation.

   Alternatively, to silently install the agent, see [How to perform a silent installation for a new Azure File Sync agent installation](file-sync-agent-silent-installation.md).

2. On the welcome page, select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/storage-sync-files-deployment-guide/azure-file-sync-agent-installation-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the File Sync Agent Setup Wizard welcome page with Next and Cancel buttons.":::

## <a name = "register-windows-server-with-storage-sync-service"></a>Register Windows Server with a storage sync service

Registering your Windows Server instance with a storage sync service establishes a trust relationship between your server (or cluster) and the storage sync service. A server can be registered with only one storage sync service. That server can sync with other servers and Azure file shares associated with the same storage sync service.

> [!NOTE]
> Server registration uses your Azure credentials to create a trust relationship between your Windows Server instance and the storage sync service. Subsequently, the server creates and uses its own identity. This identity is valid as long as the server stays registered and the current shared access signature (SAS) token is valid. A new SAS token can't be issued to the server after the server is unregistered. Unregistering a server removes the server's ability to access your Azure file shares, and it stops any sync.

The administrator who registers the server must be a member of the management role [Azure File Sync Administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/storage#azure-file-sync-administrator), Owner, or Contributor for the storage sync service. You can configure this role under **Access Control (IAM)** on the Azure portal page for the storage sync service.

It's also possible to differentiate administrators who can register servers from administrators who can also configure sync in a storage sync service. To do this differentiation, create a custom role where you list the administrators who are only allowed to register servers. Give your custom role the following permissions:

- `Microsoft.StorageSync/storageSyncServices/registeredServers/write`
- `Microsoft.StorageSync/storageSyncServices/read`
- `Microsoft.StorageSync/storageSyncServices/workflows/read`
- `Microsoft.StorageSync/storageSyncServices/workflows/operations/read`

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. The **Server Registration** dialog should open automatically after you install the Azure File Sync agent. If it doesn't, you can open it manually from its file location: **C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\ServerRegistration.exe**. In the dialog, choose your Azure environment from the listed options.

## Create a sync group and a cloud endpoint

A *sync group* defines the sync topology for a set of files. Endpoints within a sync group stay in sync with each other. A sync group must contain:

- One or more *server endpoints*. A server endpoint represents a path on a registered server. A server can have server endpoints in multiple sync groups. You can create as many sync groups as you need to appropriately describe your desired sync topology.
- One *cloud endpoint*. A cloud endpoint is a pointer to an Azure file share. All server endpoints sync with a cloud endpoint to make the cloud endpoint the hub. The storage account for the Azure file share must be in the same region as the storage sync service.

The entirety of the Azure file share is synced, with one exception. A special folder, comparable to the hidden **System Volume Information** folder on an NTFS volume, is provisioned. This directory is called **.SystemShareInformation**. It contains important sync metadata that doesn't sync to other endpoints. Don't use or delete it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can make changes to any cloud endpoint or server endpoint in the sync group and have your files synced to the other endpoints in the sync group. If you make a change to the cloud endpoint (Azure file share) directly, an Azure File Sync change detection job first needs to discover the changes. A change detection job starts for a cloud endpoint only once every 24 hours. For more information, see [Frequently asked questions about Azure Files and Azure File Sync](../files/storage-files-faq.md?toc=/azure/storage/filesync/toc.json#afs-change-detection).

The administrator who creates the cloud endpoint must be a member of the management role [Azure File Sync Administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/storage#azure-file-sync-administrator) or Owner for the storage account that contains the Azure file share that the cloud endpoint points to. Configure this role under **Access Control (IAM)** on the Azure portal page for the storage account.

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to your storage sync service.

1. On the left pane, select **Sync** > **Sync groups**. Then select **+ Create a sync group**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/storage-sync-files-deployment-guide/create-sync-group-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the pane for sync groups in the Azure portal.":::

1. On the pane that opens, enter the following information. When you finish, select **Create**.

   - **Sync group name**: Enter the name of the sync group to be created. This name must be unique within the storage sync service, but it can be any name that's logical for you.
   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription where you deployed the storage sync service in the [Deploy a storage sync service](#deploy-a-storage-sync-service) section.
   - **Storage account**: If you choose **Select storage account**, another pane appears. There, you can select the storage account that has the Azure file share that you want to sync with.
   - **Azure File Share**: Select the name of the Azure file share that you want to sync with.

   :::image type="content" source="media/storage-sync-files-deployment-guide/create-sync-group-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the pane for entering details about a new sync group in the Azure portal.":::

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

To create the sync group, run the following PowerShell command. Replace `<my-sync-group>` with the desired name of the sync group.

```powershell
$syncGroupName = "<my-sync-group>"
$syncGroup = New-AzStorageSyncGroup -ParentObject $storageSync -Name $syncGroupName
```

After you successfully create the sync group, you can create your cloud endpoint. In the following code, replace `<my-storage-account>` and `<my-file-share>` with the expected values.

```powershell
# Get or create a storage account with the desired name
$storageAccountName = "<my-storage-account>"
$storageAccount = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup | Where-Object {
    $_.StorageAccountName -eq $storageAccountName
}

if ($storageAccount -eq $null) {
    $storageAccount = New-AzStorageAccount `
        -Name $storageAccountName `
        -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
        -Location $region `
        -SkuName Standard_LRS `
        -Kind StorageV2 `
        -EnableHttpsTrafficOnly:$true
}

# Get or create an Azure file share within the desired storage account
$fileShareName = "<my-file-share>"
$fileShare = Get-AzStorageShare -Context $storageAccount.Context | Where-Object {
    $_.Name -eq $fileShareName -and $_.IsSnapshot -eq $false
}

if ($fileShare -eq $null) {
    $fileShare = New-AzStorageShare -Context $storageAccount.Context -Name $fileShareName
}

# Create the cloud endpoint
New-AzStorageSyncCloudEndpoint `
    -Name $fileShare.Name `
    -ParentObject $syncGroup `
    -StorageAccountResourceId $storageAccount.Id `
    -AzureFileShareName $fileShare.Name
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Use the [`az storagesync sync-group`](/cli/azure/storagesync/sync-group#az-storagesync-sync-group-create) command to create a new sync group. To use a default resource group for all CLI commands, use [az configure](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-configure).

```azurecli
az storagesync sync-group create --resource-group myResourceGroupName \
                                 --name myNewSyncGroupName \
                                 --storage-sync-service myStorageSyncServiceName \
```

Use the [`az storagesync sync-group cloud-endpoint`](/cli/azure/storagesync/sync-group/cloud-endpoint#az-storagesync-sync-group-cloud-endpoint-create) command to create a new cloud endpoint:

```azurecli
az storagesync sync-group cloud-endpoint create --resource-group myResourceGroup \
                                                --storage-sync-service myStorageSyncServiceName \
                                                --sync-group-name mySyncGroupName \
                                                --name myNewCloudEndpointName \
                                                --storage-account mystorageaccountname \
                                                --azure-file-share-name azure-file-share-name
```

## Create a server endpoint

A server endpoint represents a specific location on a registered server, such as a folder on a server volume. A server endpoint is subject to the following conditions:

- A server endpoint must be a path on a registered server, rather than a mounted share. Network-attached storage (NAS) isn't supported.
- Although the server endpoint can be on the system volume, server endpoints on the system volume can't use cloud tiering.
- Changing the path or drive letter after you establish a server endpoint on a volume isn't supported. Make sure that you use a final path on your registered server.
- A registered server can support multiple server endpoints. However, a sync group can have only one server endpoint per registered server at any time. Other server endpoints within the sync group must be on different registered servers.

[!INCLUDE [storage-files-sync-create-server-endpoint](../../../includes/storage-files-sync-create-server-endpoint.md)]

## Optional: Configure firewall and virtual network settings

If you want to configure Azure File Sync to work with firewall and virtual network settings, use the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, go to the storage account that you want to help secure.

2. On the left menu, under **Security + networking**, select **Networking**.

3. Under **Public network access**, select **Enabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses**.

4. Under **Firewall**, make sure that the value for **Address range** is your server's IP address or virtual network.

5. Under **Exceptions**, make sure that **Allow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage account** is selected.

6. Select **Save**.

## <a name = "optional-self-service-restore-through-previous-versions-and-vss-volume-shadow-copy-service"></a>Optional: Use self-service restore through previous versions and VSS

In Windows, you can use server-side Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) snapshots of a volume to present restorable versions of a file to an SMB client. This feature enables a powerful scenario, commonly called *self-service restore*, directly for information workers instead of depending on the restore from an IT admin.

VSS snapshots and the ability to restore previous versions work independently of Azure File Sync. However, you must set cloud tiering to a compatible mode. Many Azure File Sync server endpoints can exist on the same volume. You have to make the following PowerShell call for each volume that has even one server endpoint where you plan to use (or are using) cloud tiering:

```powershell
Import-Module '<SyncAgentInstallPath>\StorageSync.Management.ServerCmdlets.dll'
Enable-StorageSyncSelfServiceRestore [-DriveLetter] <string> [[-Force]] 
```

VSS snapshots include an entire volume. By default, up to 64 snapshots can exist for a volume, as long as there's enough space to store the snapshots. The default snapshot schedule takes two snapshots per day, Monday through Friday. You can configure that schedule by using a Windows scheduled task.

The preceding PowerShell cmdlet does two things:

- It configures Azure File Sync cloud tiering on the specified volume to be compatible with previous versions. This configuration guarantees that a file can be restored from a previous version, even if it was tiered to the cloud on the server.
- It enables the default VSS schedule. You can then decide whether to modify it later.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the `-Force` parameter and VSS is currently enabled, the cmdlet overwrites the current VSS snapshot schedule and replaces it with the default schedule. Be sure to save your custom configuration before you run the cmdlet.
>
> If you're using the cmdlet on a cluster node, you must also run it on all the other nodes in the cluster.

To see if self-service restore compatibility is enabled, you can run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-StorageSyncSelfServiceRestore [[-Driveletter] <string>]
```

This cmdlet lists all volumes on the server, along with the number of cloud-tiering compatible days for each. This number is automatically calculated based on the maximum possible snapshots per volume and the default snapshot schedule.

By default, all previous versions presented to an information worker can be used for the restore. The same is true if you change the default schedule to take more snapshots. However, if you change the schedule in a way that results in an available snapshot on the volume that's older than the value for compatible days, users can't use this older snapshot (previous version) to restore from.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling self-service restore can have an impact on your Azure storage consumption and bill. This impact is limited to files currently tiered on the server. Enabling this feature ensures that a file version available in the cloud can be referenced via a VSS snapshot entry.
>
> If you disable the feature, the Azure storage consumption slowly declines until the window of compatible days passes. You can't speed up the process.

The default maximum number of VSS snapshots per volume (64), along with the default schedule to take them, results in a maximum of 45 days of previous versions that an information worker can restore from.

The maximum number of days depends on how many VSS snapshots you can store on your volume. If a maximum of 64 VSS snapshots per volume isn't the correct setting for you, [change that value by using a registry key](/windows/win32/backup/registry-keys-for-backup-and-restore#maxshadowcopies).

For the new limit to take effect, you need to rerun the cmdlet to enable previous version compatibility on every volume where it was previously enabled. Use the `-Force` flag to take the new maximum number of VSS snapshots per volume into account. This action results in a newly calculated number of compatible days. This change takes effect only on newly tiered files, and it overwrites any customizations on the VSS schedule that you made.

By default, VSS snapshots can consume up to 10% of the volume space. To adjust the amount of storage that can be used for VSS snapshots, use the [`vssadmin resize shadowstorage`](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/cc788050(v=ws.11)) command.

<a id="proactive-recall"></a>

## Optional: Proactively recall new and changed files from an Azure file share

Azure File Sync has a mode that allows globally distributed companies to have the server cache in a remote region prepopulated even before local users access any files. When this mode is enabled on a server endpoint, it causes the server to recall files that were created or changed in the Azure file share.

### Scenario

A globally distributed company has branch offices in the United States and in India. In the morning (US time), information workers create a new folder and new files for a new project and work all day on it. Azure File Sync syncs the folder and files to the Azure file share (cloud endpoint).

Information workers in India continue working on the project in their time zone. When they arrive in the morning, the local Azure File Sync-enabled server in India needs to have these new files available locally, such that the India team can efficiently work from a local cache. Enabling this mode prevents on-demand recall from slowing down the initial file access. It also enables the server to proactively recall the files as soon as they're changed or created in the Azure file share.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tracking changes in the Azure file share that closely on the server can increase your egress traffic and bill from Azure. If files recalled to the server aren't needed locally, we don't recommend unnecessary recall to the server. Use this mode only when you know that prepopulating the cache on a server with recent changes in the cloud will have a positive effect on users or applications that use the files on that server.

### Enable a server endpoint to proactively recall what changed in an Azure file share

# [Portal](#tab/proactive-portal)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to your storage sync service, select the correct sync group, and then identify the server endpoint for which you want to closely track changes in the Azure file share (cloud endpoint).

1. In the section for cloud tiering, find the **Azure file share download** topic. You can change the currently selected mode to track changes in the Azure file share more closely and proactively recall them to the server.

:::image type="content" source="media/storage-sync-files-deployment-guide/proactive-download.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Azure file share download behavior for a server endpoint currently in effect and a button to open a menu for changing it.":::

# [PowerShell](#tab/proactive-powershell)

You can modify server endpoint properties in PowerShell through the [Set-AzStorageSyncServerEndpoint](/powershell/module/az.storagesync/set-azstoragesyncserverendpoint) cmdlet:

```powershell
# Optional parameter. Default: "UpdateLocallyCachedFiles", alternative behavior: "DownloadNewAndModifiedFiles"
$recallBehavior = "DownloadNewAndModifiedFiles"

Set-AzStorageSyncServerEndpoint -InputObject <PSServerEndpoint> -LocalCacheMode $recallBehavior
```

## Optional: Use SMB over QUIC on a server endpoint

The Azure file share (cloud endpoint) is a full SMB endpoint that's capable of direct access from the cloud or on-premises. However, customers who want to access the file share data on the cloud side often deploy an Azure File Sync server endpoint on a Windows Server instance hosted on an Azure virtual machine.

The most common reason to have an additional server endpoint rather than accessing the Azure file share directly is that changes made directly on the Azure file share can take up to 24 hours or longer for Azure File Sync to discover them. Changes made on a server endpoint are discovered nearly immediately and synced to all other server and cloud endpoints. This configuration is extremely common in environments where a substantial portion of users are remote.

Traditionally, accessing any file share with SMB over the public internet can be difficult because many organizations and internet service providers (ISPs) block port 445. This situation includes file shares hosted on a Windows file server and on Azure Files directly. You can work around this limitation by using [private endpoints and virtual private networks](file-sync-networking-overview.md#private-endpoints). However, Windows Server 2022 Azure Edition provides an additional access strategy: SMB over the QUIC transport protocol.

SMB over QUIC communicates over port 443, which most organizations and ISPs have open to support HTTPS traffic. Using SMB over QUIC greatly simplifies the networking required to access a file share hosted on an Azure File Sync server endpoint for clients that use Windows 11 or later. To learn more about how to set up and configure SMB over QUIC on Windows Server Azure Edition, see [SMB over QUIC](/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-over-quic).

## Onboard Azure File Sync

To onboard Azure File Sync for the first time with zero downtime while preserving full file fidelity and access control lists (ACLs), we recommend that you follow these steps:

1. Deploy a storage sync service.

1. Create a sync group.

1. Install the Azure File Sync agent on the server with the full data set.

1. Register that server and create a server endpoint on the share.

1. Let sync do the full upload to the Azure file share (cloud endpoint).

1. After the initial upload is complete, install the Azure File Sync agent on each of the remaining servers.

1. Create new file shares on each of the remaining servers.

1. Create server endpoints on new file shares with a cloud tiering policy, if necessary. (This step requires additional storage to be available for the initial setup.)

1. Let the Azure File Sync agent do a rapid restore of the full namespace without the actual data transfer. After the full namespace sync, the sync engine fills the local disk space based on the cloud tiering policy for the server endpoint.

1. Ensure that sync finishes, and test your topology as needed.

1. Redirect users and applications to the new share.

1. Optionally, delete any duplicate shares on the servers.

If you don't have extra storage for initial onboarding and you want to attach to the existing shares, you can pre-seed the data in the Azure file shares by using another data transfer tool instead of using the storage sync service to upload the data. We suggest the pre-seeding approach only if you can accept downtime.

1. Ensure that data on any of the servers can't change during the onboarding process.

1. Pre-seed Azure file shares with the server data by using any data transfer tool over SMB, such as Robocopy or AzCopy over REST.

   If you use Robocopy, be sure to mount the Azure file shares by using the storage account access key. Don't use a domain identity.

   If you use AzCopy, be sure to set the appropriate switches to preserve ACL time stamps and attributes.

1. Create an Azure File Sync topology with the desired server endpoints pointing to the existing shares.

1. Let sync finish the reconciliation process on all endpoints.

1. After reconciliation is complete, you can open shares for changes.

Currently, pre-seeding has these limitations:

- Data changes on the server before the sync topology is fully up and running can cause conflicts on the server endpoints.
- After the cloud endpoint is created, Azure File Sync runs a process to detect the files in the cloud before starting the initial sync. The time to complete this process varies depending on factors like network speed, available bandwidth, and the number of files and folders.

  For the rough estimation in the preview release, the detection process runs at approximately 10 files per second. Even if pre-seeding runs fast, the overall time to get a fully running system can be significantly longer when data is pre-seeded in the cloud.

## Migrate a DFS-R deployment to Azure File Sync

1. Create a sync group to represent the DFS Replication (DFS-R) topology that you're replacing.

1. Start on the server that has the full set of data in your DFS-R topology to migrate. Install Azure File Sync on that server.

1. Register that server and create a server endpoint for the first server to be migrated. Don't enable cloud tiering.

1. Let all of the data sync to your Azure file share (cloud endpoint).

1. Install and register the Azure File Sync agent on each of the remaining DFS-R servers.

1. Disable DFS-R.

1. Create a server endpoint on each of the DFS-R servers. Don't enable cloud tiering.

1. Ensure that sync finishes, and test your topology as needed.

1. Retire DFS-R.

1. You can now enable cloud tiering on any server endpoint as needed.
