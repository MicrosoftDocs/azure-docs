# Quickstart: Azure Queue Storage client library for JavaScript

Get started with the Azure Queue Storage client library for JavaScript. Azure Queue Storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages for later retrieval and processing. Follow these steps to install the package and try out example code for basic tasks.

[API reference documentation](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-queue/) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/storage/storage-queue) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/storage-queue) | [Samples](../common/storage-samples-javascript.md?toc=/azure/storage/queues/toc.json#queue-samples)

Use the Azure Queue Storage client library for JavaScript to:

- Create a queue
- Add messages to a queue
- Peek at messages in a queue
- Update a message in a queue
- Get the queue length
- Receive messages from a queue
- Delete messages from a queue
- Delete a queue

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Azure Storage account - [create a storage account](../common/storage-account-create.md)
- Current [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) for your operating system.

## Setting up

This section walks you through preparing a project to work with the Azure Queue Storage client library for JavaScript.

### Create the project

Create a Node.js application named `queues-quickstart`.

1. In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for the project:

    ```console
    mkdir queues-quickstart
    ```

1. Switch to the newly created `queues-quickstart` directory:

    ```console
    cd queues-quickstart
    ```

1. Create a *package.json* file:

    ```console
    npm init -y
    ```

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code:

    ```console
    code .
    ```

### Install the packages

From the project directory, install the following packages using the `npm install` command. 

1. Install the Azure Queue Storage npm package:

    ```console
    npm install @azure/storage-queue
    ```

1. Install the Azure Identity npm package to support passwordless connections:

    ```console
    npm install @azure/identity
    ```
    
1. Install other dependencies used in this quickstart:

    ```console
    npm install uuid dotenv
    ```

### Set up the app framework

From the project directory:

1. Open a new text file in your code editor
1. Add `require` calls to load Azure and Node.js modules
1. Create the structure for the program, including basic exception handling

    Here's the code:

    ```javascript
    const { QueueClient } = require("@azure/storage-queue");
    const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require('@azure/identity');
    const { v1: uuidv1 } = require("uuid");

    async function main() {
        console.log("Azure Queue Storage client library - JavaScript quickstart sample");

        // Quickstart code goes here
    }

    main().then(() => console.log("\nDone")).catch((ex) => console.log(ex.message));

    ```

1. Save the new file as `index.js` in the `queues-quickstart` directory.

## Authenticate to Azure

[!INCLUDE [passwordless-overview](../../../includes/passwordless/passwordless-overview.md)]

### [Passwordless (Recommended)](#tab/passwordless)

`DefaultAzureCredential` is a class provided by the Azure Identity client library for JavaScript. To learn more about `DefaultAzureCredential`, see the [DefaultAzureCredential overview](/javascript/api/overview/azure/identity-readme#defaultazurecredential). `DefaultAzureCredential` supports multiple authentication methods and determines which method should be used at runtime. This approach enables your app to use different authentication methods in different environments (local vs. production) without implementing environment-specific code.

For example, your app can authenticate using your Azure CLI sign-in credentials when developing locally, and then use a [managed identity](../../../articles/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) once it has been deployed to Azure. No code changes are required for this transition.

[!INCLUDE [storage-queues-create-assign-roles](../../../includes/passwordless/storage-queues/storage-queues-assign-roles.md)]

### [Connection String](#tab/connection-string)

[!INCLUDE [storage-quickstart-credentials-include](../../../includes/storage-quickstart-credentials-include.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The account access key should be used with caution. If your account access key is lost or accidentally placed in an insecure location, your service may become vulnerable. Anyone who has the access key is able to authorize requests against the storage account, and effectively has access to all the data. `DefaultAzureCredential` provides enhanced security features and benefits and is the recommended approach for managing authorization to Azure services.

## Object model

Azure Queue Storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages. A queue message can be up to 64 KB in size. A queue may contain millions of messages, up to the total capacity limit of a storage account. Queues are commonly used to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously. Queue Storage offers three types of resources:

- **Storage account**: All access to Azure Storage is done through a storage account. For more information about storage accounts, see [Storage account overview](../common/storage-account-overview.md)
- **Queue**: A queue contains a set of messages. All messages must be in a queue. Note that the queue name must be all lowercase. For information on naming queues, see [Naming Queues and Metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/Naming-Queues-and-Metadata).
- **Message**: A message, in any format, of up to 64 KB. A message can remain in the queue for a maximum of 7 days. For version 2017-07-29 or later, the maximum time-to-live can be any positive number, or -1 indicating that the message doesn't expire. If this parameter is omitted, the default time-to-live is seven days.

The following diagram shows the relationship between these resources.

![Diagram of Queue storage architecture](./media/storage-queues-introduction/queue1.png)

Use the following JavaScript classes to interact with these resources:

- [`QueueServiceClient`](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-queue/queueserviceclient): A `QueueServiceClient` instance represents a connection to a given storage account in the Azure Storage Queue service. This client allows you to manage the all queues in your storage account.
- [`QueueClient`](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-queue/queueclient): A `QueueClient` instance represents a single queue in a storage account. This client allows you to manage and manipulate an individual queue and its messages.

## Code examples

These example code snippets show you how to do the following actions with the Azure Queue Storage client library for JavaScript:

- [Authorize access and create a client object](#authorize-access-and-create-a-client-object)
- [Create a queue](#create-a-queue)
- [Add messages to a queue](#add-messages-to-a-queue)
- [Peek at messages in a queue](#peek-at-messages-in-a-queue)
- [Update a message in a queue](#update-a-message-in-a-queue)
- [Get the queue length](#get-the-queue-length)
- [Receive messages from a queue](#receive-messages-from-a-queue)
- [Delete messages from a queue](#delete-messages-from-a-queue)
- [Delete a queue](#delete-a-queue)

## [Passwordless (Recommended)](#tab/passwordless)

### Authorize access and create a client object

[!INCLUDE [default-azure-credential-sign-in-no-vs](../../../includes/passwordless/default-azure-credential-sign-in-no-vs.md)]

Once authenticated, you can create and authorize a `QueueClient` object using `DefaultAzureCredential` to access queue data in the storage account. `DefaultAzureCredential` automatically discovers and uses the account you signed in with in the previous step.

To authorize using `DefaultAzureCredential`, make sure you've added the **@azure/identity** package, as described in [Install the packages](#install-the-packages). Also, be sure to load the **@azure/identity** module in the *index.js* file:

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require('@azure/identity');
```

Decide on a name for the queue and create an instance of the [`QueueClient`](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-queue/queueclient) class, using `DefaultAzureCredential` for authorization. We use this client object to create and interact with the queue resource in the storage account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Queue names may only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, and must begin with a letter or a number. Each hyphen must be preceded and followed by a non-hyphen character. The name must also be between 3 and 63 characters long. For more information about naming queues, see [Naming queues and metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/naming-queues-and-metadata).

Add the following code inside the `main` method, and make sure to replace the `<storage-account-name>` placeholder value:

```javascript
// Create a unique name for the queue
const queueName = "quickstart" + uuidv1();

// Instantiate a QueueClient which will be used to create and interact with a queue
// TODO: replace <storage-account-name> with the actual name
const queueClient = new QueueClient(`https://<storage-account-name>.queue.core.windows.net/${queueName}`, new DefaultAzureCredential());
```

## [Connection String](#tab/connection-string)

### Get the connection string and create a client

The following code retrieves the connection string for the storage account. The connection string is stored in the environment variable created in the [Configure your storage connection string](#configure-your-storage-connection-string) section.

Add this code inside the `main` method:

```javascript
// Retrieve the connection string for use with the application. The storage
// connection string is stored in an environment variable on the machine
// running the application called AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING. If the
// environment variable is created after the application is launched in a
// console or with Visual Studio, the shell or application needs to be
// closed and reloaded to take the environment variable into account.
const AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING = process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING;
```

Decide on a name for the queue and create an instance of the [`QueueClient`](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-queue/queueclient) class, using the connection string for authorization. We use this client object to create and interact with the queue resource in the storage account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Queue names may only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, and must begin with a letter or a number. Each hyphen must be preceded and followed by a non-hyphen character. The name must also be between 3 and 63 characters long. For more information, see [Naming queues and metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/naming-queues-and-metadata).

Add this code to the end of the `main` method:

```javascript
// Create a unique name for the queue
const queueName = "quickstart" + uuidv1();

// Instantiate a QueueClient which will be used to create and interact with a queue
const queueClient = new QueueClient(AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING, queueName);
```

> [!NOTE]
> Messages sent using the [`QueueClient`](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-queue/queueclient) class must be in a format that can be included in an XML request with UTF-8 encoding. To include markup in the message, the contents of the message must either be XML-escaped or Base64-encoded.

Queues messages are stored as strings. If you need to send a different data type, you must serialize that data type into a string when sending the message and deserialize the string format when reading the message.

To convert **JSON** to a string format and back again in Node.js, use the following helper functions:

```javascript
function jsonToBase64(jsonObj) {
    const jsonString = JSON.stringify(jsonObj)
    return  Buffer.from(jsonString).toString('base64')
}
function encodeBase64ToJson(base64String) {
    const jsonString = Buffer.from(base64String,'base64').toString()
    return JSON.parse(jsonString)
}
``` 

### Create a queue

Using the `QueueClient` object, call the [`create`](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-queue/queueclient#@azure-storage-queue-queueclient-create) method to create the queue in your storage account.

Add this code to the end of the `main` method:

```javascript
console.log("\nCreating queue...");
console.log("\t", queueName);

// Create the queue
const createQueueResponse = await queueClient.create();
console.log("Queue created, requestId:", createQueueResponse.requestId);
```

### Add messages to a queue

The following code snippet adds messages to queue by calling the [`sendMessage`](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-queue/queueclient#sendmessage-string--queuesendmessageoptions-) method. It also saves the [`QueueSendMessageResponse`](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-queue/queuesendmessageresponse) returned from the third `sendMessage` call. The returned `sendMessageResponse` is used to update the message content later in the program.

Add this code to the end of the `main` function:

```javascript
console.log("\nAdding messages to the queue...");

// Send several messages to the queue
await queueClient.sendMessage("First message");
await queueClient.sendMessage("Second message");
const sendMessageResponse = await queueClient.sendMessage("Third message");

console.log("Messages added, requestId:", sendMessageResponse.requestId);
```

### Peek at messages in a queue

Peek at the messages in the queue by calling the [`peekMessages`](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-queue/queueclient#peekmessages-queuepeekmessagesoptions-) method. This method retrieves one or more messages from the front of the queue but doesn't alter the visibility of the message. By default, `peekMessages` peeks at a single message.

Add this code to the end of the `main` function:

```javascript
console.log("\nPeek at the messages in the queue...");

// Peek at messages in the queue
const peekedMessages = await queueClient.peekMessages({ numberOfMessages : 5 });

for (i = 0; i < peekedMessages.peekedMessageItems.length; i++) {
    // Display the peeked message
    console.log("\t", peekedMessages.peekedMessageItems[i].messageText);
}
```

### Update a message in a queue

Update the contents of a message by calling the [`updateMessage`](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-queue/queueclient#updatemessage-string--string--string--undefined---number--queueupdatemessageoptions-) method. This method can change a message's visibility timeout and contents. The message content must be a UTF-8 encoded string that is up to 64 KB in size. Along with the new content, pass in `messageId` and `popReceipt` from the response that was saved earlier in the code. The `sendMessageResponse` properties identify which message to update.

```javascript
console.log("\nUpdating the third message in the queue...");

// Update a message using the response saved when calling sendMessage earlier
updateMessageResponse = await queueClient.updateMessage(
    sendMessageResponse.messageId,
    sendMessageResponse.popReceipt,
    "Third message has been updated"
);

console.log("Message updated, requestId:", updateMessageResponse.requestId);
```

### Get the queue length

The [`getProperties`](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-queue/queueclient#getproperties-queuegetpropertiesoptions-) method returns metadata about the queue, including the approximate number of messages waiting in the queue.

```javascript
const properties = await queueClient.getProperties();
console.log("Approximate queue length: ", properties.approximateMessagesCount);
```

### Receive messages from a queue

Download previously added messages by calling the [`receiveMessages`](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-queue/queueclient#receivemessages-queuereceivemessageoptions-) method. In the `numberOfMessages` field, pass in the maximum number of messages to receive for this call.

Add this code to the end of the `main` function:

```javascript
console.log("\nReceiving messages from the queue...");

// Get messages from the queue
const receivedMessagesResponse = await queueClient.receiveMessages({ numberOfMessages : 5 });

console.log("Messages received, requestId:", receivedMessagesResponse.requestId);
```

When calling the `receiveMessages` method, you can optionally specify values in [QueueReceiveMessageOptions](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-queue/queuereceivemessageoptions) to customize message retrieval. You can specify a value for `numberOfMessages`, which is the number of messages to retrieve from the queue. The default is 1 message and the maximum is 32 messages. You can also specify a value for `visibilityTimeout`, which hides the messages from other operations for the timeout period. The default is 30 seconds.

### Delete messages from a queue

You can delete messages from the queue after they're received and processed. In this case, processing is just displaying the message on the console.

Delete messages by calling the [`deleteMessage`](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-queue/queueclient#deletemessage-string--string--queuedeletemessageoptions-) method. Any messages not explicitly deleted eventually become visible in the queue again for another chance to process them.

Add this code to the end of the `main` function:

```javascript
// 'Process' and delete messages from the queue
for (i = 0; i < receivedMessagesResponse.receivedMessageItems.length; i++) {
    receivedMessage = receivedMessagesResponse.receivedMessageItems[i];

    // 'Process' the message
    console.log("\tProcessing:", receivedMessage.messageText);

    // Delete the message
    const deleteMessageResponse = await queueClient.deleteMessage(
        receivedMessage.messageId,
        receivedMessage.popReceipt
    );
    console.log("\tMessage deleted, requestId:", deleteMessageResponse.requestId);
}
```

### Delete a queue

The following code cleans up the resources the app created by deleting the queue using the [`delete`](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-queue/queueclient#delete-queuedeleteoptions-) method.

Add this code to the end of the `main` function and save the file:

```javascript
// Delete the queue
console.log("\nDeleting queue...");
const deleteQueueResponse = await queueClient.delete();
console.log("Queue deleted, requestId:", deleteQueueResponse.requestId);
```

## Run the code

This app creates and adds three messages to an Azure queue. The code lists the messages in the queue, then retrieves and deletes them, before finally deleting the queue.

In your console window, navigate to the directory containing the `index.js` file, then use the following `node` command to run the app.

```console
node index.js
```

The output of the app is similar to the following example:

```output
