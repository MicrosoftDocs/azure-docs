# What is Azure Queue Storage?

Azure Queue Storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages. You access messages from anywhere in the world via authenticated calls using HTTP or HTTPS. A queue message can be up to 64 KB in size. A queue may contain millions of messages, up to the total capacity limit of a storage account. Queues are commonly used to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously, like in the [Web-Queue-Worker architectural style](/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/web-queue-worker).

## Queue Storage concepts

Queue Storage contains the following components:

- **URL format:** Queues are addressable using the following URL format:

  `https://<storage account>.queue.core.windows.net/<queue>`

  The following URL addresses a queue in the diagram:

  `https://myaccount.queue.core.windows.net/images-to-download`

- **Storage account:** All access to Azure Storage is done through a storage account. For information about storage account capacity, see [Scalability and performance targets for standard storage accounts](../common/scalability-targets-standard-account.md?toc=/azure/storage/queues/toc.json).

- **Queue:** A queue contains a set of messages. The queue name **must** be all lowercase. For information on naming queues, see [Naming queues and metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/naming-queues-and-metadata).

- **Message:** A message, in any format, of up to 64 KB. Before version 2017-07-29, the maximum time-to-live allowed is seven days. For version 2017-07-29 or later, the maximum time-to-live can be any positive number, or -1 indicating that the message doesn't expire. If this parameter is omitted, the default time-to-live is seven days.
