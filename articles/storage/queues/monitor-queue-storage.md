# Monitoring Azure Queue Storage

When you have critical applications and business processes that rely on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. This article describes the monitoring data that's generated by Azure Queue Storage and how you can use the features of Azure Monitor to analyze alerts on this data.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Storage logs in Azure Monitor is in public preview and is available for preview testing in all public cloud regions. This preview enables logs for blobs (which includes Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2), files, queues, and tables. This feature is available for all storage accounts that are created with the Azure Resource Manager deployment model. See [Storage account overview](../common/storage-account-overview.md).

## Monitor overview

The **Overview** page in the Azure portal for each Queue Storage resource includes a brief view of the resource usage, such as requests and hourly billing. This information is useful, but only a small amount of the monitoring data is available. Some of this data is collected automatically and is available for analysis as soon as you create the resource. You can enable additional types of data collection with some configuration.

## What is Azure Monitor?

Azure Queue Storage creates monitoring data by using [Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/overview.md), which is a full stack monitoring service in Azure. Azure Monitor provides a complete set of features to monitor your Azure resources as well as resources in other clouds and on-premises.

Start with [Monitor Azure resources with Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md) which describes the following:

- What is Azure Monitor?
- Costs associated with monitoring
- Monitoring data collected in Azure
- Configuring data collection
- Standard tools in Azure for analyzing and alerting on monitoring data

The following sections build on this article by describing the specific data gathered from Azure Storage. Examples show how to configure data collection and analyze this data with Azure tools.

## Monitoring data

Azure Queue Storage collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources, which are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](../../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md#monitoring-data).

See [Azure Queue Storage monitoring data reference](monitor-queue-storage-reference.md) for detailed information on the metrics and logs metrics created by Azure Queue Storage.

Metrics and logs in Azure Monitor support only Azure Resource Manager storage accounts. Azure Monitor doesn't support classic storage accounts. If you want to use metrics or logs on a classic storage account, you need to migrate to an Azure Resource Manager storage account. See [Migrate to Azure Resource Manager](../../virtual-machines/migration-classic-resource-manager-overview.md).

You can continue using classic metrics and logs if you want to. In fact, classic metrics and logs are available in parallel with metrics and logs in Azure Monitor. The support remains in place until Azure Storage ends the service on legacy metrics and logs.

## Collection and routing

Platform metrics and the activity log are collected automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.

To collect resource logs, you must create a diagnostic setting. When you create the setting, choose **queue** as the type of storage that you want to enable logs for. Then, specify one of the following categories of operations for which you want to collect logs.

| Category | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **StorageRead** | Read operations on objects. |
| **StorageWrite** | Write operations on objects. |
| **StorageDelete** | Delete operations on objects. |

## Creating a diagnostic setting

You can create a diagnostic setting by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or an Azure Resource Manager template.

For general guidance, see [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](../../azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Storage logs in Azure Monitor is in public preview and is available for preview testing in all public cloud regions. This preview enables logs for blobs (which includes Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2), files, queues, and tables. This feature is available for all storage accounts that are created with the Azure Resource Manager deployment model. See [Storage account overview](../common/storage-account-overview.md).

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.

2. Navigate to your storage account.

3. In the **Monitoring** section, click **Diagnostic settings (preview)**.

## Analyzing metrics

You can analyze metrics for Azure Storage with metrics from other Azure services by using Azure Metrics Explorer. Open Metrics Explorer by choosing **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. For details on using this tool, see [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started.md).

This example shows how to view **Transactions** at the account level.

![Screenshot of accessing metrics in the Azure portal](./media/monitor-queue-storage/access-metrics-portal.png)

For metrics that support dimensions, you can filter the metric with the desired dimension value. This example shows how to view **Transactions** at the account level on a specific operation by selecting values for the **API Name** dimension.

![Screenshot of accessing metrics with dimension in the Azure portal](./media/monitor-queue-storage/access-metrics-portal-with-dimension.png)

For a complete list of the dimensions that Azure Storage supports, see [Metrics dimensions](monitor-queue-storage-reference.md#metrics-dimensions).

Metrics for Azure Queue Storage are in these namespaces:

- Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts
- Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/queueServices

For a list of all Azure Monitor support metrics, which includes Azure Queue Storage, see [Azure Monitor supported metrics](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md).

### Accessing metrics

> [!TIP]
> To view Azure CLI or .NET examples, choose the corresponding tabs listed here.

### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

#### List the metric definition

You can list the metric definition of your storage account or the Queue Storage service. Use the [Get-AzMetricDefinition](/powershell/module/az.monitor/get-azmetricdefinition) cmdlet.

In this example, replace the `<resource-ID>` placeholder with the resource ID of the entire storage account or the resource ID of the queue. You can find these resource IDs on the **Properties** pages of your storage account in the Azure portal.

```powershell
   $resourceId = "<resource-ID>"
   Get-AzMetricDefinition -ResourceId $resourceId
```

#### Reading metric values

You can read account-level metric values of your storage account or the Queue Storage service. Use the [Get-AzMetric](/powershell/module/az.monitor/get-azmetric) cmdlet.

```powershell
   $resourceId = "<resource-ID>"
   Get-AzMetric -ResourceId $resourceId -MetricNames "UsedCapacity" -TimeGrain 01:00:00
```

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

#### List the account-level metric definition

You can list the metric definition of your storage account or the Queue Storage service. Use the [`az monitor metrics list-definitions`](/cli/azure/monitor/metrics#az_monitor_metrics_list_definitions) command.

In this example, replace the `<resource-ID>` placeholder with the resource ID of the entire storage account or the resource ID of the queue. You can find these resource IDs on the **Properties** pages of your storage account in the Azure portal.

```azurecli-interactive
   az monitor metrics list-definitions --resource <resource-ID>
```

#### Read account-level metric values

You can read the metric values of your storage account or the Queue Storage service. Use the [`az monitor metrics list`](/cli/azure/monitor/metrics#az_monitor_metrics_list) command.

```azurecli-interactive
   az monitor metrics list --resource <resource-ID> --metric "UsedCapacity" --interval PT1H
```

### [.NET](#tab/azure-portal)

Azure Monitor provides the [.NET SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/microsoft.azure.management.monitor/) to read metric definition and values. The [sample code](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/monitor-dotnet-metrics-api/) shows how to use the SDK with different parameters. You need to use `0.18.0-preview` or a later version for storage metrics.

In these examples, replace the `<resource-ID>` placeholder with the resource ID of the entire storage account or the queue. You can find these resource IDs on the **Properties** pages of your storage account in the Azure portal.

Replace the `<subscription-ID>` variable with the ID of your subscription. For guidance on how to obtain values for `<tenant-ID>`, `<application-ID>`, and `<AccessKey>`, see [Use the portal to create an Azure AD application and service principal that can access resources](../../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md).

#### List the account-level metric definition

The following example shows how to list a metric definition at the account level:

```csharp
    public static async Task ListStorageMetricDefinition()
    {
        var resourceId = "<resource-ID>";
        var subscriptionId = "<subscription-ID>";
        var tenantId = "<tenant-ID>";
        var applicationId = "<application-ID>";
        var accessKey = "<AccessKey>";

        MonitorManagementClient readOnlyClient = AuthenticateWithReadOnlyClient(tenantId, applicationId, accessKey, subscriptionId).Result;
        IEnumerable<MetricDefinition> metricDefinitions = await readOnlyClient.MetricDefinitions.ListAsync(resourceUri: resourceId, cancellationToken: new CancellationToken());

        foreach (var metricDefinition in metricDefinitions)
        {
            // Enumrate metric definition:
            //    Id
            //    ResourceId
            //    Name
            //    Unit
            //    MetricAvailabilities
            //    PrimaryAggregationType
            //    Dimensions
            //    IsDimensionRequired
        }
    }

```

#### Reading account-level metric values

The following example shows how to read `UsedCapacity` data at the account level:

```csharp
    public static async Task ReadStorageMetricValue()
    {
        var resourceId = "<resource-ID>";
        var subscriptionId = "<subscription-ID>";
        var tenantId = "<tenant-ID>";
        var applicationId = "<application-ID>";
        var accessKey = "<AccessKey>";

        MonitorClient readOnlyClient = AuthenticateWithReadOnlyClient(tenantId, applicationId, accessKey, subscriptionId).Result;

        Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.Response Response;

        string startDate = DateTime.Now.AddHours(-3).ToUniversalTime().ToString("o");
        string endDate = DateTime.Now.ToUniversalTime().ToString("o");
        string timeSpan = startDate + "/" + endDate;

        Response = await readOnlyClient.Metrics.ListAsync(
            resourceUri: resourceId,
            timespan: timeSpan,
            interval: System.TimeSpan.FromHours(1),
            metricnames: "UsedCapacity",

            aggregation: "Average",
            resultType: ResultType.Data,
            cancellationToken: CancellationToken.None);

        foreach (var metric in Response.Value)
        {
            // Enumrate metric value
            //    Id
            //    Name
            //    Type
            //    Unit
            //    Timeseries
            //        - Data
            //        - Metadatavalues
        }
    }

```

#### Reading multidimensional metric values

For multidimensional metrics, you need to define metadata filters if you want to read metric data on specific dimension values.

The following example shows how to read metric data on the metric supporting multidimension:

```csharp
    public static async Task ReadStorageMetricValueTest()
    {
        // Resource ID for queue storage
        var resourceId = "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}/queueServices/default";
        var subscriptionId = "<subscription-ID}";
        // How to identify Tenant ID, Application ID and Access Key: https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/
        var tenantId = "<tenant-ID>";
        var applicationId = "<application-ID>";
        var accessKey = "<AccessKey>";

        MonitorManagementClient readOnlyClient = AuthenticateWithReadOnlyClient(tenantId, applicationId, accessKey, subscriptionId).Result;

        Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.Response Response;

        string startDate = DateTime.Now.AddHours(-3).ToUniversalTime().ToString("o");
        string endDate = DateTime.Now.ToUniversalTime().ToString("o");
        string timeSpan = startDate + "/" + endDate;
        // It's applicable to define meta data filter when a metric support dimension
        // More conditions can be added with the 'or' and 'and' operators, example: BlobType eq 'BlockBlob' or BlobType eq 'PageBlob'
        ODataQuery<MetadataValue> odataFilterMetrics = new ODataQuery<MetadataValue>(
            string.Format("BlobType eq '{0}'", "BlockBlob"));

        Response = readOnlyClient.Metrics.List(
                        resourceUri: resourceId,
                        timespan: timeSpan,
                        interval: System.TimeSpan.FromHours(1),
                        metricnames: "BlobCapacity",
                        odataQuery: odataFilterMetrics,
                        aggregation: "Average",
                        resultType: ResultType.Data);

        foreach (var metric in Response.Value)
        {
            //Enumrate metric value
            //    Id
            //    Name
            //    Type
            //    Unit
            //    Timeseries
            //        - Data
            //        - Metadatavalues
        }
    }

```

## Analyzing logs

You can access resource logs either as a queue in a storage account, as event data, or through Log Analytics queries.

For a detailed reference of the fields that appear in these logs, see [Azure Queue Storage monitoring data reference](monitor-queue-storage-reference.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Storage logs in Azure Monitor is in public preview and is available for preview testing in all public cloud regions. This preview enables logs for blobs (which includes Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2), files, queues, tables, premium storage accounts in general-purpose v1, and general-purpose v2 storage accounts. Classic storage accounts aren't supported.

Log entries are created only if there are requests made against the service endpoint. For example, if a storage account has activity in its queue endpoint but not in its table or blob endpoints, only logs that pertain to Queue Storage are created. Azure Storage logs contain detailed information about successful and failed requests to a storage service. This information can be used to monitor individual requests and to diagnose issues with a storage service. Requests are logged on a best-effort basis.

### Log authenticated requests

The following types of authenticated requests are logged:

- Successful requests
- Failed requests, including timeout, throttling, network, authorization, and other errors
- Requests that use a shared access signature (SAS) or OAuth, including failed and successful requests
- Requests to analytics data (classic log data in the **$logs** container and class metric data in the **$metric** tables)

Requests made by the Queue Storage service itself, such as log creation or deletion, aren't logged. For a full list of the logged data, see [Storage logged operations and status messages](/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-logged-operations-and-status-messages) and [Storage log format](monitor-queue-storage-reference.md).

### Log anonymous requests

The following types of anonymous requests are logged:

- Successful requests
- Server errors
- Time-out errors for both client and server
- Failed `GET` requests with the error code 304 (`Not Modified`)

All other failed anonymous requests aren't logged. For a full list of the logged data, see [Storage logged operations and status messages](/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-logged-operations-and-status-messages) and [Storage log format](monitor-queue-storage-reference.md).

### Accessing logs in a storage account

Logs appear as blobs stored to a container in the target storage account. Data is collected and stored inside a single blob as a line-delimited JSON payload. The name of the blob follows this naming convention:

`https://<destination-storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net/insights-logs-<storage-operation>/resourceId=/subscriptions/<subscription-ID>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<source-storage-account>/queueServices/default/y=<year>/m=<month>/d=<day>/h=<hour>/m=<minute>/PT1H.json`

Here's an example:

`https://mylogstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/insights-logs-storagewrite/resourceId=/subscriptions/`<br>`208841be-a4v3-4234-9450-08b90c09f4/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/mystorageaccount/queueServices/default/y=2019/m=07/d=30/h=23/m=12/PT1H.json`

### Accessing logs in an event hub

Logs sent to an event hub aren't stored as a file, but you can verify that the event hub received the log information. In the Azure portal, go to your event hub and verify that the `incoming requests` count is greater than zero.

![Audit logs](media/monitor-queue-storage/event-hub-log.png)

You can access and read log data that's sent to your event hub by using security information and event management and monitoring tools. For more information, see [What can I do with the monitoring data being sent to my event hub?](../../azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs.md#partner-tools-with-azure-monitor-integration).

### Accessing logs in a Log Analytics workspace

You can access logs sent to a Log Analytics workspace by using Azure Monitor log queries.

For more information, see [Get started with Log Analytics in Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial.md).

Data is stored in the `StorageQueueLogs` table.

#### Sample Kusto queries

Here are some queries that you can enter in the **Log search** bar to help you monitor your queues. These queries work with the [new language](../../azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the storage account resource group menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current resource group. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource group. If you want to run a query that includes data from other resources or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](../../azure-monitor/logs/scope.md) for details.

Use these queries to help you monitor your Azure Storage accounts:

- To list the 10 most common errors over the last three days.

    ```Kusto
    StorageQueueLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d) and StatusText !contains "Success"
    | summarize count() by StatusText
    | top 10 by count_ desc
    ```

- To list the top 10 operations that caused the most errors over the last three days.

    ```Kusto
    StorageQueueLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d) and StatusText !contains "Success"
    | summarize count() by OperationName
    | top 10 by count_ desc
    ```

- To list the top 10 operations with the longest end-to-end latency over the last three days.

    ```Kusto
    StorageQueueLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d)
    | top 10 by DurationMs desc
    | project TimeGenerated, OperationName, DurationMs, ServerLatencyMs, ClientLatencyMs = DurationMs - ServerLatencyMs
    ```

- To list all operations that caused server-side throttling errors over the last three days.

    ```Kusto
    StorageQueueLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d) and StatusText contains "ServerBusy"
    | project TimeGenerated, OperationName, StatusCode, StatusText
    ```

- To list all requests with anonymous access over the last three days.

    ```Kusto
    StorageBlobLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d) and AuthenticationType == "Anonymous"
    | project TimeGenerated, OperationName, AuthenticationType, Uri
    ```

- To create a pie chart of operations used over the last three days.

    ```Kusto
    StorageQueueLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d)
    | summarize count() by OperationName
    | sort by count_ desc
    | render piechart
    ```

## FAQ

**Does Azure Storage support metrics for managed disks or unmanaged disks?**

No. Compute instances support the metrics on disks. For more information, see [Per disk metrics for managed and unmanaged disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/per-disk-metrics-managed-disks/).
