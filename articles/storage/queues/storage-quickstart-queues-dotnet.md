# Quickstart: Azure Queue Storage client library for .NET

Get started with the Azure Queue Storage client library for .NET. Azure Queue Storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages for later retrieval and processing. Follow these steps to install the package and try out example code for basic tasks.

[API reference documentation](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/storage/Azure.Storage.Queues) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Storage.Queues/12.0.0) | [Samples](../common/storage-samples-dotnet.md?toc=/azure/storage/queues/toc.json#queue-samples)

Use the Azure Queue Storage client library for .NET to:

- Create a queue
- Add messages to a queue
- Peek at messages in a queue
- Update a message in a queue
- Get the queue length
- Receive messages from a queue
- Delete messages from a queue
- Delete a queue

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Azure Storage account - [create a storage account](../common/storage-account-create.md)
- Current [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) for your operating system. Be sure to get the SDK and not the runtime.

## Setting up

This section walks you through preparing a project to work with the Azure Queue Storage client library for .NET.

### Create the project

Create a .NET application named `QueuesQuickstart`.

1. In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app with the name `QueuesQuickstart`. This command creates a simple "hello world" C# project with a single source file named *Program.cs*.

   ```console
   dotnet new console -n QueuesQuickstart
   ```

1. Switch to the newly created `QueuesQuickstart` directory.

   ```console
   cd QueuesQuickstart
   ```

### Install the packages

While still in the application directory, install the Azure Queue Storage client library for .NET package by using the `dotnet add package` command.

```console
dotnet add package Azure.Storage.Queues
```

The Azure Identity client library package is also needed for passwordless connections to Azure services.

```console
dotnet add package Azure.Identity
```

### Set up the app framework

1. Open the project in your editor of choice
1. Open the *Program.cs* file
1. Update the existing code to match the following:

```csharp
using Azure;
using Azure.Identity;
using Azure.Storage.Queues;
using Azure.Storage.Queues.Models;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

Console.WriteLine("Azure Queue Storage client library - .NET quickstart sample");

// Quickstart code goes here

```

## Authenticate to Azure

[!INCLUDE [passwordless-overview](../../../includes/passwordless/passwordless-overview.md)]

## [Passwordless (Recommended)](#tab/passwordless)

[!INCLUDE [dotnet-default-azure-credential-overview](../../../includes/passwordless/dotnet-default-azure-credential-overview.md)]

[!INCLUDE [storage-queues-create-assign-roles](../../../includes/passwordless/storage-queues/storage-queues-assign-roles.md)]

## [Connection String](#tab/connection-string)

[!INCLUDE [storage-quickstart-credentials-include](../../../includes/storage-quickstart-credentials-include.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The account access key should be used with caution. If your account access key is lost or accidentally placed in an insecure location, your service may become vulnerable. Anyone who has the access key is able to authorize requests against the storage account, and effectively has access to all the data. `DefaultAzureCredential` provides enhanced security features and benefits and is the recommended approach for managing authorization to Azure services.

## Object model

Azure Queue Storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages. A queue message can be up to 64 KB in size. A queue may contain millions of messages, up to the total capacity limit of a storage account. Queues are commonly used to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously. Queue Storage offers three types of resources:

- **Storage account**: All access to Azure Storage is done through a storage account. For more information about storage accounts, see [Storage account overview](../common/storage-account-overview.md)
- **Queue**: A queue contains a set of messages. All messages must be in a queue. Note that the queue name must be all lowercase. For information on naming queues, see [Naming Queues and Metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/Naming-Queues-and-Metadata).
- **Message**: A message, in any format, of up to 64 KB. A message can remain in the queue for a maximum of 7 days. For version 2017-07-29 or later, the maximum time-to-live can be any positive number, or -1 indicating that the message doesn't expire. If this parameter is omitted, the default time-to-live is seven days.

The following diagram shows the relationship between these resources.

![Diagram of Queue storage architecture](./media/storage-queues-introduction/queue1.png)

Use the following .NET classes to interact with these resources:

- [`QueueServiceClient`](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queueserviceclient): The `QueueServiceClient` allows you to manage the all queues in your storage account.
- [`QueueClient`](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queueclient): The `QueueClient` class allows you to manage and manipulate an individual queue and its messages.
- [`QueueMessage`](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.models.queuemessage): The `QueueMessage` class represents the individual objects returned when calling [`ReceiveMessages`](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queueclient.receivemessages) on a queue.

## Code examples

These example code snippets show you how to perform the following actions with the Azure Queue Storage client library for .NET:

- [Authorize access and create a client object](#authorize-access-and-create-a-client-object)
- [Create a queue](#create-a-queue)
- [Add messages to a queue](#add-messages-to-a-queue)
- [Peek at messages in a queue](#peek-at-messages-in-a-queue)
- [Update a message in a queue](#update-a-message-in-a-queue)
- [Get the queue length](#get-the-queue-length)
- [Receive messages from a queue](#receive-messages-from-a-queue)
- [Delete messages from a queue](#delete-messages-from-a-queue)
- [Delete a queue](#delete-a-queue)

## [Passwordless (Recommended)](#tab/passwordless)

### Authorize access and create a client object

[!INCLUDE [default-azure-credential-sign-in](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/passwordless/default-azure-credential-sign-in.md)]

Once authenticated, you can create and authorize a `QueueClient` object using `DefaultAzureCredential` to access queue data in the storage account. `DefaultAzureCredential` automatically discovers and uses the account you signed in with in the previous step.

To authorize using `DefaultAzureCredential`, make sure you've added the **Azure.Identity** package, as described in [Install the packages](#install-the-packages). Also, be sure to add a using directive for the `Azure.Identity` namespace in the *Program.cs* file:

```csharp
using Azure.Identity;
```

Next, decide on a name for the queue and create an instance of the [`QueueClient`](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queueclient) class, using `DefaultAzureCredential` for authorization. We use this client object to create and interact with the queue resource in the storage account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Queue names may only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, and must begin with a letter or a number. Each hyphen must be preceded and followed by a non-hyphen character. The name must also be between 3 and 63 characters long. For more information, see [Naming queues and metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/naming-queues-and-metadata).

Add the following code to the end of the *Program.cs* file. Make sure to replace the `<storage-account-name>` placeholder value:

```csharp
// Create a unique name for the queue
// TODO: Replace the <storage-account-name> placeholder 
string queueName = "quickstartqueues-" + Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
string storageAccountName = "<storage-account-name>";

// Instantiate a QueueClient to create and interact with the queue
QueueClient queueClient = new QueueClient(
    new Uri($"https://{storageAccountName}.queue.core.windows.net/{queueName}"),
    new DefaultAzureCredential());
```

## [Connection String](#tab/connection-string)

### Get the connection string and create a client

The following code retrieves the connection string for the storage account. The connection string is stored in the environment variable created in the [Configure your storage connection string](#configure-your-storage-connection-string) section.

Add this code to the end of the *Program.cs* file:

```csharp
// Retrieve the connection string for use with the application. The storage
// connection string is stored in an environment variable called
// AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING on the machine running the application.
// If the environment variable is created after the application is launched
// in a console or with Visual Studio, the shell or application needs to be
// closed and reloaded to take the environment variable into account.
string connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING");
```

Decide on a name for the queue and create an instance of the [`QueueClient`](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queueclient) class, using the connection string for authorization. We use this client object to create and interact with the queue resource in the storage account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Queue names may only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, and must begin with a letter or a number. Each hyphen must be preceded and followed by a non-hyphen character. The name must also be between 3 and 63 characters long. For more information, see [Naming queues and metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/naming-queues-and-metadata).

Add this code to the end of the *Program.cs* file:

```csharp
// Create a unique name for the queue
string queueName = "quickstartqueues-" + Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

// Instantiate a QueueClient to create and interact with the queue
QueueClient queueClient = new QueueClient(connectionString, queueName);
```

---

> [!NOTE]
> Messages sent using the [`QueueClient`](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queueclient) class must be in a format that can be included in an XML request with UTF-8 encoding. You can optionally set the [MessageEncoding](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queueclientoptions.messageencoding) option to [Base64](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queuemessageencoding) to handle non-compliant messages.

### Create a queue

Using the `QueueClient` object, call the [`CreateAsync`](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queueclient.createasync) method to create the queue in your storage account.

Add this code to the end of the *Program.cs* method:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"Creating queue: {queueName}");

// Create the queue
await queueClient.CreateAsync();
```

### Add messages to a queue

The following code snippet asynchronously adds messages to queue by calling the [`SendMessageAsync`](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queueclient.sendmessageasync) method. It also saves a [`SendReceipt`](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.models.sendreceipt) returned from a `SendMessageAsync` call. The receipt is used to update the message later in the program.

Add this code to the end of the *Program.cs* file:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nAdding messages to the queue...");

// Send several messages to the queue
await queueClient.SendMessageAsync("First message");
await queueClient.SendMessageAsync("Second message");

// Save the receipt so we can update this message later
SendReceipt receipt = await queueClient.SendMessageAsync("Third message");
```

### Peek at messages in a queue

Peek at the messages in the queue by calling the [`PeekMessagesAsync`](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queueclient.peekmessagesasync) method. This method retrieves one or more messages from the front of the queue but doesn't alter the visibility of the message.

Add this code to the end of the *Program.cs* file:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nPeek at the messages in the queue...");

// Peek at messages in the queue
PeekedMessage[] peekedMessages = await queueClient.PeekMessagesAsync(maxMessages: 10);

foreach (PeekedMessage peekedMessage in peekedMessages)
{
    // Display the message
    Console.WriteLine($"Message: {peekedMessage.MessageText}");
}
```

### Update a message in a queue

Update the contents of a message by calling the [`UpdateMessageAsync`](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queueclient.updatemessageasync) method. This method can change a message's visibility timeout and contents. The message content must be a UTF-8 encoded string that is up to 64 KB in size. Along with the new content for the message, pass in the values from the `SendReceipt` that was saved earlier in the code. The `SendReceipt` values identify which message to update.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nUpdating the third message in the queue...");

// Update a message using the saved receipt from sending the message
await queueClient.UpdateMessageAsync(receipt.MessageId, receipt.PopReceipt, "Third message has been updated");
```

### Get the queue length

You can get an estimate of the number of messages in a queue. The [`GetProperties`](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queueclient.getproperties) method returns queue properties including the message count. The `ApproximateMessagesCount` property contains the approximate number of messages in the queue. This number isn't lower than the actual number of messages in the queue, but could be higher.

Add this code to the end of the *Program.cs* file:

```csharp
QueueProperties properties = queueClient.GetProperties();

// Retrieve the cached approximate message count
int cachedMessagesCount = properties.ApproximateMessagesCount;

// Display number of messages
Console.WriteLine($"Number of messages in queue: {cachedMessagesCount}");
```

### Receive messages from a queue

Download previously added messages by calling the [`ReceiveMessagesAsync`](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queueclient.receivemessagesasync) method.

Add this code to the end of the *Program.cs* file:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nReceiving messages from the queue...");

// Get messages from the queue
QueueMessage[] messages = await queueClient.ReceiveMessagesAsync(maxMessages: 10);
```

You can optionally specify a value for `maxMessages`, which is the number of messages to retrieve from the queue. The default is 1 message and the maximum is 32 messages. You can also specify a value for `visibilityTimeout`, which hides the messages from other operations for the timeout period. The default is 30 seconds.

### Delete messages from a queue

Delete messages from the queue after they've been processed. In this case, processing is just displaying the message on the console.

The app pauses for user input by calling `Console.ReadLine` before it processes and deletes the messages. Verify in your [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) that the resources were created correctly, before they're deleted. Any messages not explicitly deleted eventually become visible in the queue again for another chance to process them.

Add this code to the end of the *Program.cs* file:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nPress Enter key to 'process' messages and delete them from the queue...");
Console.ReadLine();

// Process and delete messages from the queue
foreach (QueueMessage message in messages)
{
    // "Process" the message
    Console.WriteLine($"Message: {message.MessageText}");

    // Let the service know we're finished with
    // the message and it can be safely deleted.
    await queueClient.DeleteMessageAsync(message.MessageId, message.PopReceipt);
}
```

### Delete a queue

The following code cleans up the resources the app created by deleting the queue using the [`DeleteAsync`](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queueclient.deleteasync) method.

Add this code to the end of the *Program.cs* file:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nPress Enter key to delete the queue...");
Console.ReadLine();

// Clean up
Console.WriteLine($"Deleting queue: {queueClient.Name}");
await queueClient.DeleteAsync();

Console.WriteLine("Done");
```

## Run the code

This app creates and adds three messages to an Azure queue. The code lists the messages in the queue, then retrieves and deletes them, before finally deleting the queue.

In your console window, navigate to your application directory, then build and run the application.

```console
dotnet build
```

```console
dotnet run
```

The output of the app is similar to the following example:

```output
Azure Queue Storage client library - .NET quickstart sample

Creating queue: quickstartqueues-5c72da2c-30cc-4f09-b05c-a95d9da52af2

Adding messages to the queue...

Peek at the messages in the queue...
Message: First message
Message: Second message
Message: Third message

Updating the third message in the queue...

Receiving messages from the queue...

Press Enter key to 'process' messages and delete them from the queue...

Message: First message
Message: Second message
Message: Third message has been updated

Press Enter key to delete the queue...

Deleting queue: quickstartqueues-5c72da2c-30cc-4f09-b05c-a95d9da52af2
Done
```

When the app pauses before receiving messages, check your storage account in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Verify the messages are in the queue.

Press the `Enter` key to receive and delete the messages. When prompted, press the `Enter` key again to delete the queue and finish the demo.
