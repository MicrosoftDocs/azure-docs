# Azure Data Protection with Veeam

This article provides information for using Azure Blob storage with Veeam solutions, including details on how to get started and best practices.

Azure Blob storage can be used with many Veeam products to provide cost-effective data retention and recovery capabilities. Not all Azure Blob features are supported by each product, learn more about [using object storage with Veeam Products](https://www.veeam.com/kb4241).
## Backup on-premises workloads to Azure

You can store backups of your on-premises workloads on Azure Blob using [Veeam Backup & Replication](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/hyperv/overview.html), allowing you to use Azure Storage's pay-per-use model to easily scale your backup infrastructure with durable, cost-effective storage. This includes support for virtual workloads, physical workloads, enterprise applications and unstructured data.

## Restore on-premises workloads to Azure

To restore your on-premises workloads directly to Azure, you can use [Veeam Backup & Replication](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/hyperv/overview.html), giving you the ability to use Azure as an on-demand recovery site or for migration purposes.

## Protect Azure workloads with Veeam

To agentlessly protect Azure Virtual Machine, Azure Files and Azure SQL workloads, you can use [Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbazure/guide/overview.html), allowing you to perform snapshot, backup and recovery operations entirely within Azure.
Azure VMware Solution and enterprise application-specific workloads such as Oracle and SAP HANA can be protected with [Veeam Backup & Replication](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/hyperv/overview.html). This includes support for agent-based backup.
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure RedHat OpenShift (ARO) workloads are supported with [Kasten K10 by Veeam](https://docs.kasten.io/latest/), providing easy-to-use backup, restore, and application mobility.
