# Atempo Quick Start Guide

This document will provide assistance in getting started with configuring Atemop Miria to migrate data to Azure Storage.

## Reference Architecture

The following diagram provides a reference architecture for on-premises to Azure deployments.

:::image type="content" source="./media/atempo-quick-start-guide/picture-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of components required for a Miria migration, including source, destination, and Miria components such as Data Mover and Control Panel."::: 

&nbsp;

Your existing Atempo Miria deployment can easily integrate with Azure by adding and configuring a connection to Azure, either a standard connection or an ExpressRoute.

## Before you Begin

A little upfront planning helps configure your Miria software to use Azure as a data migration target.

### Get Started with Azure

Microsoft offers a framework to get you started with Azure. The [Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/) is a detailed approach to enterprise digital transformation and a comprehensive guide to planning a production-grade cloud adoption. The CAF includes a step-by-step Azure setup guide to help you get up and running quickly and securely. You will find sample architectures, specific best practices for deploying applications, and free training resources to put you on the path to Azure expertise.

### Considerations For Migrations

Several aspects are important when considering migrations of file data to Azure. Before proceeding learn more

- [Storage Migration Overview](https://www.atempo.com/solutions/miria-large-data-and-file-migration-and-copy-2/)
- Latest supported features by Miria in the [Migration tools comparison matrix](/azure/storage/solution-integration/validated-partners/data-management/migration-tools-comparison)

Remember, you need enough network capacity to support migrations without impacting production applications. This section outlines the tools and techniques that are available to assess your network needs.

### Determine Unutilized Internet Bandwidth

It's important to know how much unutilized bandwidth (or headroom) you have available on a day-to-day basis. To help you assess whether you can meet your goals for

- Initial time for migrations
- Time required to do incremental resync before final switch-over to the target file service

Use the following methods to identify the bandwidth headroom that is free to consume

- If you're an existing Azure ExpressRoute customer, view your circuit usage in the Azure portal
- Contact your ISP and request reports to show your existing daily and monthly utilization
- There are several tools that can measure utilization by monitoring your network traffic at the router/switch level

  - SolarWinds Bandwidth Analyzer Pack
  - Paessler PRTG
  - Cisco Network Assistant
  - WhatsUp Gold

## Implementation Guidance

### Before you begin

This documentation assumes that:
- you have the [read and write permissions](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor) in the Azure Storage Container that you are using, or an appropriate [RBAC role](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor).
- you already have a Miria Server and Miria Data Mover installed and running on a VM or on a server in your environment. If this is not the case, please refer to the following links for more information regarding:
    - [Miria Server and Data Movers deployment and initial configuration](https://www.atempo.com/privatedocs/Miria_2022_Migration_Documentation.pdf)
    - [Details on platforms and OS versions supported by Miria](https://www.atempo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/COMPATIBILITY-GUIDE_en_Miria_3.15_17-08-2022.pdf)

&nbsp;

The following section guides you in successive steps:

1. Creating and configuring your Azure BLOB Storage
2. Creating a Miria Target Storage - Azure BLOB
3. Creating a Miria Source Storage with SMB/CIFS share
4. Creating and launching your data migration task
5. Checking on progress, logs, and reports at the project and task level 
6. Creating other tasks in your migration project

### Azure Storage configuration

This section provides a brief guide for how to add Azure BLOB to an on-premises-to-Azure Miria deployment

1. Open the Azure portal, and search for storage accounts

:::image type="content" source="./media/atempo-quick-start-guide/marketplace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Marketplace listing for Storage Accounts.":::

&nbsp;

2. Select Create to add an account:

- Select an existing resource group or Create new
- Provide a unique name for your storage account
- Select the region
- Select Standard or Premium performance, depending on your needs
- Select the Redundancy that meets your data protection requirements

:::image type="content" source="./media/atempo-quick-start-guide/storage-creation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Basics panel for creating a new storage account.":::

3. Next, we recommend the default settings from the Advanced screen

:::image type="content" source="./media/atempo-quick-start-guide/advanced.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Advanced Options panel when creating a new storage account.":::

&nbsp;

4. Keep the default networking options for now and move on to Data protection. You can select to enable soft delete, which allows you to recover accidentally deleted data within the defined retention period. Soft delete offers protection against accidental or malicious deletion

:::image type="content" source="./media/atempo-quick-start-guide/data-protection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Data Protection Options panel when creating a new Storage Account.":::

5. Add tags for organization if you use tagging and Create your account

6. Another step is mandatory before you can add the account to your Miria environment. Navigate to the Access keys item under Security + Networking and copy the Storage account name and one of the two access keys.
   
:::image type="content" source="./media/atempo-quick-start-guide/access-keys.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Access Keys configuration panel in the Miria software.":::

You may monitor on the Azure side that your container is populated with your data

:::image type="content" source="./media/atempo-quick-start-guide/miria-target-container.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure container data was moved into.":::

### Checking on migration progress, logs, and reports

In the above step, we have created two objects at once

- A migration project,
- And a task in this migration project

You might want to create a migration task per subset of data to migrate, for instance by usage, user group, department, project, etc. to have more control of the migration of each data sets

The Web interface offer multiple options to check on progress

- At the project level - to get a global view of the progress of all tasks created in the project,
- At the individual task level - to check on the progress for a specific task such as the data subset

To access the logs or more details on the tasks in this project, select on the three dots located at the end to display this menu

- By selecting Show Logs, you see the logs for all tasks in the project
- By selecting See Tasks, you see a graphical overview of the volume associated to all tasks as shown in this screenshot

:::image type="content" source="./media/atempo-quick-start-guide/migration-tasks-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Migration Tasks dialog box.":::

&nbsp;

The above screenshot provides an overview of all iterations of the migration tasks in your project. We currently have only one iteration for our task. We can easily launch a new iteration of the same task to collect all the latest and changed files since the last run. Select the task in the bottom part of the panel and select Start Task. Each iteration of the task is shown on the above interface.

The bottom part of the screen is listing the tasks created in this project.

:::image type="content" source="./media/atempo-quick-start-guide/task-completed-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dialog box showing the completed tasks.":::

&nbsp;

To drill down on an individual task, just apply a similar process, select the three-dot menu at the end of the task line to display the task-related submenu

:::image type="content" source="./media/atempo-quick-start-guide/show-logs-integrity-check.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dialog box showing the logs collected.":::

&nbsp;

- Selecting Show logs shows the logs for this task only.
- Selecting Integrity check provides access to the associated report for this task.
- Selecting See Details provides a graphical volume report with details at the task level as shown in the following screenshot

:::image type="content" source="./media/atempo-quick-start-guide/task-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the output of the task details overview pane.":::

&nbsp;

The lower part of the screen provides more details on the job run.

:::image type="content" source="./media/atempo-quick-start-guide/runs-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the output of the runs details overview pane.":::

To download the report associated to this task, select the three-dot menu at the end of the line and select Download Report

### Creating other tasks in your migration project

More tasks can be added to a Migration project going back to the project level, by clicking the word project in the “bread crumb”

:::image type="content" source="./media/atempo-quick-start-guide/critical-data-breadcrumb.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the critical data breadcrumb.":::

To add a task, use the top menu with the three horizontal dots, select New Task and follow a similar process to create your task within the project

:::image type="content" source="./media/atempo-quick-start-guide/start-button-new-task.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create New Task dialog box.":::

&nbsp;

After the administrator adds multiple tasks to the project, the Start menu on the top provides a way to start new iterations for all the tasks in this project at once.
