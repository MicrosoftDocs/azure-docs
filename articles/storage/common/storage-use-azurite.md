# Use the Azurite storage emulator for development and testing (preview)

The Azurite emulator (preview) provides a local storage environment for development and testing purposes. Using Azurite, you can test your application against storage services locally. When you're satisfied with how your application is working, switch to using an Azure Storage account in the cloud.

Azurite is an open-source Azure Storage API compatible emulator. Based on Node.js, Azurite provides cross platform experiences for developers wanting to easily try Azure Storage in a local environment. Azurite simulates most of the commands supported by Azure Storage with minimal dependencies.

Azurite v3 implements a new architecture from previous versions. It uses code generated by a TypeScript server code generator that Microsoft created. The generator uses the same modified Swagger code used by the Azure Storage SDKs. The generator reduces manual effort and creates better code alignment with the Azure Storage APIs.

## Get Azurite version 3

Azurite is available in a GitHub repository, which you can easily clone, build, and deploy on your local system.

### Prerequisites

* [GitHub account](https://github.com)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

### Install the storage emulator from GitHub

To get the Azurite emulator on your local system, clone the GitHub repository for the project by using the following console command.

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure/Azurite.git
```

After cloning the source code, execute following commands from the local root directory of the cloned repo.

```console
npm install
npm run build
npm install -g azurite
```

## Running Azurite

To run Azurite v3, you need Node.js version 8.0 or later installed on your system. Azurite runs on Windows, Linux, or MacOS.

After installation you can run Azurite by using **npm**, which is the package management tool included with every Node.js installation.

```console
npm install -g azurite
```

Start Azurite with the following command:

```console
azurite -s -l c:\azurite -d c:\azurite\debug.log
```

or

```console
azurite --silent --location c:\azurite --debug c:\azurite\debug.log
```

This command tells Azurite to store all data in a particular directory **c:\azurite**. If the **-l** option is omitted, it will use the current working directory. You can also selectively start different storage services. For example, to start the blob service only:

```console
azurite-blob -l path/to/azurite/workspace
```

### Command-line syntax

```console
azurite [--blobHost <IP address>] [--blobPort <port address>] [-l | --location <workspace path>] [-s | --silent] [-d | --debug <log file path>]
```

## Supported command-line options

This section details the command line switches available when launching Azurite v3.

### Listening host configuration

**Optional** By default, Azurite v3 will listen to 127.0.0.1 as a local server. You can customize the listening address per your requirements.

Accept requests on the local machine only:

```console
--blobHost 127.0.0.1
```

Allow remote requests (may be unsafe):

```console
--blobHost 0.0.0.0
```

### Listening port configuration

**Optional** By default, Azurite v3 will listen for the blob service on port 10000. You can customize the listening port for your own requirements.

> [!WARNING]
> After using a customized port, you need to update the connection string or corresponding configuration in your Azure Storage tools or SDKs.

Customize the Blob Service listening port:

```console
--blobPort 8888
```

Let system auto select an available port:

```console
--blobPort 0
```

> [!NOTE]
> The port in use is displayed on Azurite startup.

### Workspace path configuration

**Optional** Azurite v3 needs to persist metadata and binary data to the local disk during execution. You can provide a customized path as the workspace location. By default, the current process working directory will be used.

```console
-l c:\azurite
--location c:\azurite
```

### Access log configuration

**Optional** By default the access log is displayed in the console window. Disable it by using the **--silent** switch:

```console
-s
--silent
```

### Debug log configuration

**Optional** Debug log includes detailed information on every request and exception stack traces. Enable it by providing a valid local file path for the debug log destination.

```console
-d path/debug.log
--debug path/debug.log
```

### Command-line options differences between Azurite v2

Azurite v3 supports SharedKey, account Shared Access Signature (SAS), Service SAS, and Public Container Access authentications. You may use any Azure Storage SDKs or tools like Storage Explorer to connect Azurite v3 with any authentication strategy. Authentication is required in Azurite v3.

## Usage with Azure Storage SDKs and tools

### Default Storage Account

Azurite v3 provides support for a General Storage Account v2 and associated features by default.

* Account name: `devstoreaccount1`
* Account key: `Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==`

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to SharedKey authentication, Azurite v3 supports account and service SAS authentication. Anonymous access is also available when a container is set to allow public access.

### Connection string

Typically, you can pass following connection strings to SDKs or tools (like Azure CLI2.0 or Storage Explorer). Using the blob service as an example, the full connection string is:

```
DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;AccountName=devstoreaccount1;AccountKey=Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==;BlobEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1;
```

Or if the SDK or tools support following short connection string:

```
UseDevelopmentStorage=true;
```

### Storage Explorer

Connect to Azurite by clicking the **Add Account** icon, then select **Attach to a local emulator** and click **Connect**.

## Differences between Azurite and Azure Storage

Because it runs as a local instance, there are functional differences between Azurite and an Azure storage account in the cloud.

### Storage accounts

Azurite v3 supports a default account as General Storage Account v2 and provides features.

* Account name: `devstoreaccount1`
* Account key: `Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==`

### Endpoint and connection URL

The service endpoints for Azurite are different from the endpoints of an Azure storage account. The local computer doesn't do domain name resolution, requiring Azurite endpoints to be local addresses.

When you address a resource in an Azure storage account, use the following scheme. The account name is part of the URI host name. The resource being addressed is part of the URI path:

`<http|https>://<account-name>.<service-name>.core.windows.net/<resource-path>`

For example, the following URI is a valid address for a blob in an Azure storage account:

`https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob.txt`

Since the local computer doesn't do domain name resolution, the account name is part of the URI path instead of the host name. Use the following URI format for a resource in Azurite:

`http://<local-machine-address>:<port>/<account-name>/<resource-path>`

For example, the following address might be used for accessing a blob in Azurite:

`http://127.0.0.1:10000/myaccount/mycontainer/myblob.txt`

The service endpoints for Azurite blob service:

`http://127.0.0.1:10000/<account-name>/<resource-path>`

### Scaling and performance

Azurite doesn't support many concurrent clients. There's no performance guarantee. Performance depends highly on the environment in which Azurite is deployed.

### Error handling

We've tried to align Azurite with Azure Storage error handling logic, but there are differences. For example, error messages may be different, while error status code will align.

### API version strategy

Azurite v3 follows a **Try best to serve** compatible strategy with Azure Storage API versions:

* An Azurite v3 instance has a baseline Azure Storage API version.
  * A Swagger definition (OpenAPI doc) with the same API version will be used to generate protocol layer APIs and interfaces.
  * Azurite should implement all the possible features provided in this API service version.
* If an incoming request has **the same API version** Azurite provides, Azurite should handle the request with parity to Azure Storage.
* If an incoming request has a **higher API version** than Azurite, Azurite will return a VersionNotSupportedByEmulator error (HTTP status code 400 - Bad Request).
* If an incoming request has a **lower API version** header, the emulator attempts to handle the request with Azurite’s baseline API version behavior.
* Azurite will return API version in the response header as the baseline API version
* SAS accepts the pattern from API version 2015-04-05

### RA-GRS

Azurite supports read-access geo-redundant replication (RA-GRS). For storage resources, you can access the secondary location by appending -secondary to the account name. For example, the following address might be used for accessing a blob using the read-only secondary in Azurite:

`http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1-secondary/mycontainer/myblob.txt`

## Differences between Azurite v3 and Azurite v2

Both Azurite v3 and Azurite v2 aim to provide a convenient emulation for customers to quickly try out Azure Storage services locally. There are lots of differences between Azurite v3 and legacy Azurite v2.

### Architecture

The Azurite v3 architecture has been refactored. It's now more flexible and robust. Azurite v3 provides the flexibility to support following scenarios in the future:

* Use other HTTP frameworks instead of express.js
* A customized new handler layer implementation, such as redirecting requests to Azure Storage services
* Implement and inject a new persistency layer implementation, such as one based on a different database service
* Provide support for multiple azure storage accounts and authentication
* Detailed debug logging for easy issue investigation and request tracking
* Create an HTTPS server

### Server code generator

Azurite v3 uses a TypeScript server code generator based on Azure Storage REST API swagger specifications. The generator reduces manual efforts and ensures alignment with the API implementation.

### Features scope

Legacy Azurite v2 supports Azure Storage Blob, Queue, and Table services. Azurite v3 currently supports the Azure Storage Blob Service, with Queue support scheduled to follow. Azure Table Service support is currently under review.

Azurite v3 supports features from Azure Storage API version 2018-03-28, and will maintain parity with the latest API versions, in a more frequent update frequency than legacy Azurite v2.
