# Synchronize with Azure Blob storage by using AzCopy

You can synchronize local storage with Azure Blob storage by using the AzCopy v10 command-line utility.

You can synchronize the contents of a local file system with a blob container. You can also synchronize containers and virtual directories with one another. Synchronization is one way. In other words, you choose which of these two endpoints is the source and which one is the destination. Synchronization also uses server to server APIs. The examples presented in this section also work with accounts that have a hierarchical namespace.

> [!NOTE]
> The current release of AzCopy doesn't synchronize between other sources and destinations (For example: File storage or Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 buckets).

To see examples for other types of tasks such as uploading files, downloading blobs, or copying blobs between accounts, see the links presented in the [Next Steps](#next-steps) section of this article.

## Get started

See the [Get started with AzCopy](storage-use-azcopy-v10.md) article to download AzCopy and learn about the ways that you can provide authorization credentials to the storage service.

> [!NOTE]
> The examples in this article assume that you've provided authorization credentials by using Microsoft Entra ID.
>
> If you'd rather use a SAS token to authorize access to blob data, then you can append that token to the resource URL in each AzCopy command. For example: `'https://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name><SAS-token>'`.

## Guidelines

[!INCLUDE [Azcopy sync command general guidelines](../../../includes/azure-storage-azcopy-sync-guidelines.md)]

- To prevent accidental deletions, make sure to enable the [soft delete](../blobs/soft-delete-blob-overview.md) feature before you use the `--delete-destination=prompt|true` flag.

## Update a container with changes to a local file system

In this case, the container is the destination, and the local file system is the source.

> [!TIP]
> This example encloses path arguments with single quotes (''). Use single quotes in all command shells except for the Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe). If you're using a Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe), enclose path arguments with double quotes ("") instead of single quotes ('').

**Syntax**

`azcopy sync '<local-directory-path>' 'https://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>' --recursive`

**Example**

```azcopy
azcopy sync 'C:\myDirectory' 'https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer' --recursive
```

## Update a local file system with changes to a container

In this case, the local file system is the destination, and the container is the source.

> [!TIP]
> This example encloses path arguments with single quotes (''). Use single quotes in all command shells except for the Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe). If you're using a Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe), enclose path arguments with double quotes ("") instead of single quotes ('').

**Syntax**

`azcopy sync 'https://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>' 'C:\myDirectory' --recursive`

**Example**

```azcopy
azcopy sync 'https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer' 'C:\myDirectory' --recursive
```

## Update a container with changes in another container

The first container that appears in this command is the source. The second one is the destination. 

If you provide authorization credentials by using Microsoft Entra ID, make sure that you've set up the proper roles in your source and destination account. See [Option 1: Use Microsoft Entra ID](storage-use-azcopy-v10.md?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json#option-1-use-azure-active-directory).

> [!TIP]
> This example encloses path arguments with single quotes (''). Use single quotes in all command shells except for the Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe). If you're using a Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe), enclose path arguments with double quotes ("") instead of single quotes ('').

**Syntax**

`azcopy sync 'https://<source-storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>/<SAS-token>' 'https://<destination-storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>' --recursive`

**Example**

```azcopy
azcopy sync 'https://mysourceaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer?sv=2018-03-28&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacup&se=2019-07-04T05:30:08Z&st=2019-07-03T21:30:08Z&spr=https&sig=CAfhgnc9gdGktvB=ska7bAiqIddM845yiyFwdMH481QA8%3D' 'https://mydestinationaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer' --recursive
```

## Update a directory with changes to a directory in another container

The first directory that appears in this command is the source. The second one is the destination.

If you provide authorization credentials by using Microsoft Entra ID, make sure that you've set up the proper roles in your source and destination account. See [Option 1: Use Microsoft Entra ID](storage-use-azcopy-v10.md?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json#option-1-use-azure-active-directory).

> [!TIP]
> This example encloses path arguments with single quotes (''). Use single quotes in all command shells except for the Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe). If you're using a Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe), enclose path arguments with double quotes ("") instead of single quotes ('').

**Syntax**

`azcopy sync 'https://<source-storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>/<directory-name>/<SAS-token>' 'https://<destination-storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>/<directory-name>' --recursive`

**Example**

```azcopy
azcopy sync 'https://mysourceaccount.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>/myDirectory?sv=2018-03-28&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacup&se=2019-07-04T05:30:08Z&st=2019-07-03T21:30:08Z&spr=https&sig=CAfhgnc9gdGktvB=ska7bAiqIddM845yiyFwdMH481QA8%3D' 'https://mydestinationaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myDirectory' --recursive
```

## Update a container with changes in another container by using a SAS token

The first container that appears in this command is the source. The second one is the destination.

If you provide a SAS token, make sure that you use a SAS token which corresponds to source and destination storage account, while using **azcopy sync**.

**Syntax**

`azcopy sync 'https://<source-storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>/<SAS-token>' 'https://<destination-storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>/<destination-SAS-token>' --recursive`

**Example**

```azcopy
azcopy sync 'https://mysourceaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer?sv=2018-03-28&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacup&se=2019-07-04T05:30:08Z&st=2019-07-03T21:30:08Z&spr=https&sig=CAfhgnc9gdGktvB=ska7bAiqIddM845yiyFwdMH481QA8%3D' 'https://mydestinationaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/?sv=2018-03-28&ss=qrdu&dst=mco&kp=rwdlapuc&se=2019-07-04T05:30:08Z&st=2019-07-03T21:31:10Z&spr=https&sig=CAfhgnc9gdGktvB=yzx9CAjMKeeN678yiyFwdNU092JC8%6D' --recursive
```

> [!TIP]
> If you are copying larger size of data, you can use :[Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/storage/storage-explorer).
> 
> Verify size details that you have copied. On the top bar menu, choose **More** -> **Folder Statistics** to help you get the details of the Directory including the size in bytes.


## Synchronize with optional flags

You can tweak your sync operation by using optional flags. Here's a few examples.

|Scenario|Flag|
|---|---|
|Specify how strictly MD5 hashes should be validated when downloading.|**--check-md5**=\[NoCheck\|LogOnly\|FailIfDifferent\|FailIfDifferentOrMissing\]|
|Exclude files based on a pattern.|**--exclude-path**|
|Specify how detailed you want your sync-related log entries to be.|**--log-level**=\[WARNING\|ERROR\|INFO\|NONE\]|
|Specify how to copy a vhd file.|**--blob-type=BlockBlob --include-pattern "*.vhd"** or **--blob-type=BlockBlob** |
                              


For a complete list of flags, see [options](storage-ref-azcopy-sync.md#options).

> [!NOTE]
> The `--recursive` flag is set to `true` by default. The `--exclude-pattern` and `--include-pattern` flags apply to only to file names and not other parts of the file path.
