# Setting up the Azure Import/Export Tool
The Microsoft Azure Import/Export Tool is the drive preparation and repair tool that you can use with the Microsoft Azure Import/Export service. You can use the tool for the following functions:  
  
-   Before creating an import job, you can use this tool to copy data to the hard drives you are going to ship to a Windows Azure data center.  
  
-   After an import job has completed, you can use this tool to repair any blobs that were corrupted, were missing, or conflicted with other blobs.  
  
-   After you receive the drives from a completed export job, you can use this tool to repair any files that were corrupted or missing on the drives.  
  
## Prerequisites  
If you are preparing drives for an import job, you will need to meet the following prerequisites:  
  
-   You must have an active Azure subscription.  
  
-   Your subscription must include a storage account with enough available space to store the files you are going to import.  
  
-   You need at least one of the account keys for the storage account.  
  
-   You need a computer (the "copy machine") with Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, or a newer Windows operating system installed.  
  
-   The .NET Framework 4 must be installed on the copy machine.  
  
-   BitLocker must be enabled on the copy machine.  
  
-   You will need one or more drives that contains data to be imported or empty 3.5-inch SATA hard drives connected to the copy machine.  
  
-   The files you plan to import must be accessible from the copy machine, whether they are on a network share or a local hard drive. 
  
If you are attempting to repair an import that has partially failed, you will need:  
  
- The copy log files  
  
- The storage account key  
  
  If you are attempting to repair an export that has partially failed, you will need:  
  
- The copy log files  
  
- The manifest files (optional)  
  
- The storage account key  
  
## Installing the Azure Import/Export Tool  
 The Azure Import/Export Tool consists of the following files:  
  
- WAImportExport.exe  
  
- WAImportExport.exe.config  
  
- WAImportExportCore.dll  
  
- WAImportExportRepair.dll  
  
- Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.dll  
  
- Hddid.dll  
  
  Copy these files to a working directory, for example, `c:\WAImportExport`. Next, open a command line window in Administrator mode, and set the above directory as current directory.  
  
  To output help for the command, run the tool without parameters:  
  
```

          For RepairImport, one or more semicolon-separated directories to repair;  
          For RepairExport, one directory to repair, e.g. root directory of the drive.  
    /format

          (tab-delimited). When first specified, it will be populated with file paths  
          with empty targets, which means either they are not found in TargetDirectories,  
          access denied, with invalid name, or they exist in multiple directories. The  
          path map file can be manually edited to include the correct target paths and  
          specified again for the tool to resolve the file paths correctly.  
    /ExportBlobListFile:<ExportBlobListFile>  
        - Required. Path to the XML file containing list of blob paths or blob path  
          prefixes for the blobs to be exported. The file format is the same as the
