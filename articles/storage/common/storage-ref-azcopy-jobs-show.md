# azcopy jobs show

Shows detailed information for the given job ID.

## Synopsis

If only the job ID is supplied without a flag, then the progress summary of the job is returned.

The byte counts and percent complete that appears when you run this command reflect only files that are completed in the job. They don't reflect partially completed files.

If the `with-status` flag is set, then the list of transfers in the job with the given value will be shown.

```azcopy
azcopy jobs show [jobID] [flags]
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

`--cap-mbps`    (float)    Caps the transfer rate, in megabits per second. Moment-by-moment throughput might vary slightly from the cap. If this option is set to zero, or it is omitted, the throughput isn't capped.

`--output-type`    (string)    Format of the command's output. The choices include: text, json. The default value is 'text'. (default "text")

`--trusted-microsoft-suffixes`    (string)    Specifies additional domain suffixes where Microsoft Entra login tokens may be sent.  The default is '*.core.windows.net;*.core.chinacloudapi.cn;*.core.cloudapi.de;*.core.usgovcloudapi.net;*.storage.azure.net'. Any listed here are added to the default. For security, you should only put Microsoft Azure domains here. Separate multiple entries with semi-colons.
