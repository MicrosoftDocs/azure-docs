# Azure Storage samples

Use the links below to view and download Azure Storage sample code and applications.

## Azure Code Samples library
The [Azure Code Samples](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/samples/?service=storage) library includes samples for Azure Storage that you can download and run locally. The Code Sample Library provides sample code in .zip format. Alternatively, you can browse and clone the GitHub repository for each sample.

## .NET samples
To explore the .NET samples, download the [.NET Storage Client Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage/) from NuGet. The .NET storage client library is also available in the [Azure SDK for .NET](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/).

* [Azure Storage samples using .NET](storage-samples-dotnet.md)

## Java samples
To explore the Java samples, download the [Java Storage Client Library](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-java).

* [Azure Storage samples using Java](storage-samples-java.md)

## Python samples
To explore the Python samples, download the [Python Storage Client Library](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-python).

* [Azure Storage samples using Python](storage-samples-python.md)


## Node.js samples
To explore the Node.js samples, download the [Node.js Storage Client Library](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node).

* [Blob uploader](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node/tree/master/examples/blobuploader)
* [Upload and download blob](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node/blob/master/examples/samples/blobuploaddownloadsample.js)
* [Continuation token](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node/blob/master/examples/samples/continuationsample.js)
* [Retry policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node/blob/master/examples/samples/retrypolicysample.js)
* [Shared access signature](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node/blob/master/examples/samples/sassample.js)
* [Snapshot](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node/blob/master/examples/samples/snapshotsample.js)
* [Table query](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node/blob/master/examples/samples/tablequerysample.js)

## C++ samples
To explore the C++ samples, download the [C++ Storage Client Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/wastorage/) from NuGet.
