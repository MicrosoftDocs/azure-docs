# Migrate an application to use passwordless connections with Azure Blob Storage

[!INCLUDE [passwordless-intro](../../../includes/passwordless/migration-guide/passwordless-intro.md)]

## Configure roles and users for local development authentication

[!INCLUDE [assign-roles](../../../includes/assign-roles.md)]

## Sign-in and migrate the app code to use passwordless connections

[!INCLUDE [default-azure-credential-sign-in](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/passwordless/default-azure-credential-sign-in.md)]

Next, update your code to use passwordless connections.

## [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

1. To use `DefaultAzureCredential` in a .NET application, install the `Azure.Identity` package:

   ```dotnetcli
   dotnet add package Azure.Identity
   ```

1. At the top of your file, add the following code:

   ```csharp
   using Azure.Identity;
   ```

1. Identify the locations in your code that create a `BlobServiceClient` to connect to Azure Blob Storage. Update your code to match the following example:

   ```csharp
   DefaultAzureCredential credential = new();

   BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient = new(
       new Uri($"https://{storageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net"),
       credential);
   ```

## [Go](#tab/go)

1. To use `DefaultAzureCredential` in a Go application, install the `azidentity` module:

    ```bash
    go get -u github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity
    ```

1. At the top of your file, add the following code:

    ```go
    import (
        "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity"
    )
    ```

1. Identify the locations in your code that create a `Client` instance to connect to Azure Blob Storage. Update your code to match the following example:

    ```go
    cred, err := azidentity.NewDefaultAzureCredential(nil)
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }

    serviceURL := fmt.Sprintf("https://%s.blob.core.windows.net", storageAccountName)
    client, err := azblob.NewClient(serviceURL, cred, nil)
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }
    ```

## [Java](#tab/java)

1. To use `DefaultAzureCredential` in a Java application, install the `azure-identity` package via one of the following approaches:
    1. [Include the BOM file](/java/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-java-stable&preserve-view=true#include-the-bom-file).
    1. [Include a direct dependency](/java/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-java-stable&preserve-view=true#include-direct-dependency).

1. At the top of your file, add the following code:

    ```java
    import com.azure.identity.DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder;
    ```

1. Identify the locations in your code that create a `BlobServiceClient` object to connect to Azure Blob Storage. Update your code to match the following example:

    ```java
    DefaultAzureCredential credential = new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder()
        .build();
    String endpoint = 
        String.format("https://%s.blob.core.windows.net", storageAccountName);

    BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClientBuilder()
        .endpoint(endpoint)
        .credential(credential)
        .buildClient();
    ```

## [Node.js](#tab/nodejs)

1. To use `DefaultAzureCredential` in a Node.js application, install the `@azure/identity` package:

    ```bash
    npm install --save @azure/identity
    ```

1. At the top of your file, add the following code:

    ```nodejs
    import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";
    ```

1. Identify the locations in your code that create a `BlobServiceClient` object to connect to Azure Blob Storage. Update your code to match the following example:

    ```nodejs
    const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
    
    const blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(
      `https://${storageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net`,
      credential
    );    
    ```

## [Python](#tab/python)

1. To use `DefaultAzureCredential` in a Python application, install the `azure-identity` package:
    
    ```bash
    pip install azure-identity
    ```

1. At the top of your file, add the following code:

    ```python
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    ```

1. Identify the locations in your code that create a `BlobServiceClient` object to connect to Azure Blob Storage. Update your code to match the following example:

    ```python
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

    blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(
        account_url = "https://%s.blob.core.windows.net" % storage_account_name,
        credential = credential
    )
    ```

---

4. Make sure to update the storage account name in the URI of your `BlobServiceClient`. You can find the storage account name on the overview page of the Azure portal.

### Run the app locally

After making these code changes, run your application locally. The new configuration should pick up your local credentials, such as the Azure CLI, Visual Studio, or IntelliJ. The roles you assigned to your local dev user in Azure allows your app to connect to the Azure service locally.

## Configure the Azure hosting environment

Once your application is configured to use passwordless connections and runs locally, the same code can authenticate to Azure services after it's deployed to Azure. The sections that follow explain how to configure a deployed application to connect to Azure Blob Storage using a managed identity.

### Create the managed identity

[!INCLUDE [create-managed-identity](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/passwordless/migration-guide/create-user-assigned-managed-identity.md)]

#### Associate the managed identity with your web app

You need to configure your web app to use the managed identity you created. Assign the identity to your app using either the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal-associate)

Complete the following steps in the Azure portal to associate an identity with your app. These same steps apply to the following Azure services:

* Azure Spring Apps
* Azure Container Apps
* Azure virtual machines
* Azure Kubernetes Service

1. Navigate to the overview page of your web app.
1. Select **Identity** from the left navigation.
1. On the **Identity** page, switch to the **User assigned** tab.
1. Select **+ Add** to open the **Add user assigned managed identity** flyout.
1. Select the subscription you used previously to create the identity.
1. Search for the **MigrationIdentity** by name and select it from the search results.
1. Select **Add** to associate the identity with your app.

   :::image type="content" source="~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/media/storage/create-user-assigned-identity-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to create a user assigned identity." lightbox="~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/media/storage/create-user-assigned-identity.png":::

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli-associate)

[!INCLUDE [associate-managed-identity-cli](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/passwordless/migration-guide/associate-managed-identity-cli.md)]

# [Service Connector](#tab/service-connector-associate)

[!INCLUDE [service-connector-commands](../../../includes/passwordless/migration-guide/service-connector-commands.md)]

---

### Assign roles to the managed identity

Next, you need to grant permissions to the managed identity you created to access your storage account. Grant permissions by assigning a role to the managed identity, just like you did with your local development user.

### [Azure portal](#tab/assign-role-azure-portal)

1. Navigate to your storage account overview page and select **Access Control (IAM)** from the left navigation.

1. Choose **Add role assignment**

   :::image type="content" source="media/migration-add-role-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to add a role to a managed identity." lightbox="media/migration-add-role.png":::

1. In the **Role** search box, search for *Storage Blob Data Contributor*, which is a common role used to manage data operations for blobs. You can assign whatever role is appropriate for your use case. Select the *Storage Blob Data Contributor* from the list and choose **Next**.

1. On the **Add role assignment** screen, for the **Assign access to** option, select **Managed identity**. Then choose **+Select members**.

1. In the flyout, search for the managed identity you created by name and select it from the results. Choose **Select** to close the flyout menu.

   :::image type="content" source="media/migration-select-identity-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to select the assigned managed identity." lightbox="media/migration-select-identity.png":::

1. Select **Next** a couple times until you're able to select **Review + assign** to finish the role assignment.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/assign-role-azure-cli)

To assign a role at the resource level using the Azure CLI, you first must retrieve the resource ID using the [az storage account](/cli/azure/storage/account) show command. You can filter the output properties using the `--query` parameter.

```azurecli
az storage account show \
    --resource-group '<your-resource-group-name>' \
    --name '<your-storage-account-name>' \
    --query id
```

Copy the output ID from the preceding command. You can then assign roles using the [az role assignment](/cli/azure/role/assignment) command of the Azure CLI.

```azurecli
az role assignment create \
    --assignee "<your-username>" \
    --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
    --scope "<your-resource-id>"
```

### [Service Connector](#tab/assign-role-service-connector)

If you connected your services using Service Connector you don't need to complete this step. The necessary role configurations were handled for you when you ran the Service Connector CLI commands.

### Test the app

After deploying the updated code, browse to your hosted application in the browser. Your app should be able to connect to the storage account successfully. Keep in mind that it may take several minutes for the role assignments to propagate through your Azure environment. Your application is now configured to run both locally and in a production environment without the developers having to manage secrets in the application itself.
