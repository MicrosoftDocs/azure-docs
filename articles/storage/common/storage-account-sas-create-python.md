# Create an account SAS with Python

This article shows how to use the storage account key to create an account SAS with the [Azure Storage client library for Python](/python/api/overview/azure/storage).

## About the account SAS

An account SAS is created at the level of the storage account. By creating an account SAS, you can:

- Delegate access to service-level operations that aren't currently available with a service-specific SAS, such as [Get Blob Service Properties](/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob-service-properties), [Set Blob Service Properties](/rest/api/storageservices/set-blob-service-properties) and [Get Blob Service Stats](/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob-service-stats).
- Delegate access to more than one service in a storage account at a time. For example, you can delegate access to resources in both Azure Blob Storage and Azure Files by using an account SAS.

Stored access policies aren't supported for an account SAS.

## Create an account SAS

An account SAS is signed with the account access key. The following code example shows how to call the [generate_account_sas](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob#azure-storage-blob-generate-account-sas) method to get the account SAS token string. 

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_create_sas.py" id="Snippet_create_account_sas":::

Valid parameters for the [ResourceTypes](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.resourcetypes) constructor are:

- **service**: default is `False`; set to `True` to grant access to service-level APIs.
- **container**: default is `False`; set to `True` to grant access to container-level APIs.
- **object**: default is `False`; set to `True` to grant access to object-level APIs for blobs, queue messages, and files.

For available permissions, see [AccountSasPermissions](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.accountsaspermissions).

## Use an account SAS from a client

To use the account SAS to access service-level APIs for the Blob service, create a [BlobServiceClient](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclient) object using the account SAS and the Blob Storage endpoint for your storage account.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob_devguide_create_sas.py" id="Snippet_use_account_sas":::

You can also use an account SAS to authorize and work with a [ContainerClient](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.containerclient) object or [BlobClient](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobclient) object, if those resource types are granted access as part of the signature values.
