# Configure customer-managed keys in the same tenant for a new storage account

Azure Storage encrypts all data in a storage account at rest. By default, data is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys. For additional control over encryption keys, you can manage your own keys. Customer-managed keys must be stored in an Azure Key Vault or in an Azure Key Vault Managed Hardware Security Model (HSM).

This article shows how to configure encryption with customer-managed keys at the time that you create a new storage account. The customer-managed keys are stored in a key vault.

To learn how to configure customer-managed keys for an existing storage account, see [Configure customer-managed keys in an Azure Key Vault for an existing storage account](customer-managed-keys-configure-existing-account.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Key Vault and Azure Key Vault Managed HSM support the same APIs and management interfaces for configuration of customer-managed keys. Any action that is supported for Azure Key Vault is also supported for Azure Key Vault Managed HSM.

## Use a user-assigned managed identity to authorize access to the key vault

[!INCLUDE [storage-customer-managed-keys-key-vault-user-assigned-identity-include](../../../includes/storage-customer-managed-keys-key-vault-user-assigned-identity-include.md)]

## Configure customer-managed keys for a new storage account

When you configure encryption with customer-managed keys for a new storage account, you can choose to automatically update the key version used for Azure Storage encryption whenever a new version is available in the associated key vault. Alternately, you can explicitly specify a key version to be used for encryption until the key version is manually updated.

You must use an existing user-assigned managed identity to authorize access to the key vault when you configure customer-managed keys while creating the storage account. The user-assigned managed identity must have appropriate permissions to access the key vault. For more information, see [Authenticate to Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/authentication).

### Configure encryption for automatic updating of key versions

Azure Storage can automatically update the customer-managed key that is used for encryption to use the latest key version from the key vault. Azure Storage checks the key vault daily for a new version of the key. When a new version becomes available, then Azure Storage automatically begins using the latest version of the key for encryption.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Storage checks the key vault for a new key version only once daily. When you rotate a key, be sure to wait 24 hours before disabling the older version.

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To configure customer-managed keys for a new storage account with automatic updating of the key version, follow these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Storage accounts** page, and select the **Create** button to create a new account.
1. Follow the steps outlined in [Create a storage account](storage-account-create.md) to fill out the fields on the **Basics**, **Advanced**, **Networking**, and **Data Protection** tabs.
1. On the **Encryption** tab, indicate for which services you want to enable support for customer-managed keys in the **Enable support for customer-managed keys** field.
1. In the **Encryption type** field, select **Customer-managed keys (CMK)**.
1. In the **Encryption key** field, choose **Select a key vault and key**, and specify the key vault and key.
1. For the **User-assigned identity** field, select an existing user-assigned managed identity.

1. Select the **Review** button to validate and create the account.

You can also configure customer-managed keys with manual updating of the key version when you create a new storage account. Follow the steps described in [Configure encryption for manual updating of key versions](#configure-encryption-for-manual-updating-of-key-versions).

### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

To configure customer-managed keys for a new storage account with automatic updating of the key version, call [New-AzStorageAccount](/powershell/module/az.storage/new-azstorageaccount), as shown in the following example. Use the variable you created previously for the resource ID for the user-assigned managed identity. You'll also need the key vault URI and key name:

```azurepowershell
$accountName = "<storage-account>"

New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
    -Name $accountName `
    -Kind StorageV2 `
    -SkuName Standard_LRS `
    -Location $location `
    -AllowBlobPublicAccess $false `
    -IdentityType SystemAssignedUserAssigned `
    -UserAssignedIdentityId $userIdentity.Id `
    -KeyVaultUri $keyVault.VaultUri `
    -KeyName $key.Name `
    -KeyVaultUserAssignedIdentityId $userIdentity.Id
```

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To configure customer-managed keys for a new storage account with automatic updating of the key version, call [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-create), as shown in the following example. Use the variable you created previously for the resource ID for the user-assigned managed identity. You'll also need the key vault URI and key name:

```azurecli
accountName="<storage-account>"

az storage account create \
    --name $accountName \
    --resource-group $rgName \
    --location $location \
    --sku Standard_LRS \
    --kind StorageV2 \
    --identity-type SystemAssigned,UserAssigned \
    --user-identity-id $identityResourceId \
    --encryption-key-vault <key-vault-uri> \
    --encryption-key-name $keyName \
    --encryption-key-source Microsoft.Keyvault \
    --key-vault-user-identity-id $identityResourceId
```

### Configure encryption for manual updating of key versions

If you prefer to manually update the key version, then explicitly specify the version when you configure encryption with customer-managed keys while creating the storage account. In this case, Azure Storage won't automatically update the key version when a new version is created in the key vault. To use a new key version, you must manually update the version used for Azure Storage encryption.

You must use an existing user-assigned managed identity to authorize access to the key vault when you configure customer-managed keys while creating the storage account. The user-assigned managed identity must have appropriate permissions to access the key vault. For more information, see [Authenticate to Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/authentication).

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To configure customer-managed keys with manual updating of the key version in the Azure portal, specify the key URI, including the version, while creating the storage account. To specify a key as a URI, follow these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Storage accounts** page, and select the **Create** button to create a new account.
1. Follow the steps outlined in [Create a storage account](storage-account-create.md) to fill out the fields on the **Basics**, **Advanced**, **Networking**, and **Data Protection** tabs.
1. On the **Encryption** tab, indicate for which services you want to enable support for customer-managed keys in the **Enable support for customer-managed keys** field.
1. In the **Encryption type** field, select **Customer-managed keys (CMK)**.
1. To locate the key URI in the Azure portal, navigate to your key vault, and select the **Keys** setting. Select the desired key, then select the key to view its versions. Select a key version to view the settings for that version.
1. Copy the value of the **Key Identifier** field, which provides the URI.

    :::image type="content" source="media/customer-managed-keys-configure-new-account/portal-copy-key-identifier.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing key vault key URI in Azure portal.":::

1. In the **Encryption key** settings for your storage account, choose the **Enter key URI** option.
1. Paste the URI that you copied into the **Key URI** field. Include the key version on the URI to configure manual updating of the key version.
1. Specify a user-assigned managed identity by choosing the **Select an identity** link.

    :::image type="content" source="media/customer-managed-keys-configure-new-account/portal-specify-key-uri.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to enter key URI in Azure portal.":::

1. Select the **Review** button to validate and create the account.

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

To configure customer-managed keys with manual updating of the key version, explicitly provide the key version when you configure encryption while creating the storage account. Call [Set-AzStorageAccount](/powershell/module/az.storage/set-azstorageaccount) to update the storage account's encryption settings, as shown in the following example, and include the **-KeyvaultEncryption** option to enable customer-managed keys for the storage account.

Remember to replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values and to use the variables defined in the previous examples.

```azurepowershell
$accountName = "<storage-account>"

New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
    -Name $accountName `
    -Kind StorageV2 `
    -SkuName Standard_LRS `
    -Location $location `
    -AllowBlobPublicAccess $false `
    -IdentityType SystemAssignedUserAssigned `
    -UserAssignedIdentityId $userIdentity.Id `
    -KeyVaultUri $keyVault.VaultUri `
    -KeyName $key.Name `
    -KeyVersion $key.Version `
    -KeyVaultUserAssignedIdentityId $userIdentity.Id
```

When you manually update the key version, you'll need to update the storage account's encryption settings to use the new version. First, call [Get-AzKeyVaultKey](/powershell/module/az.keyvault/get-azkeyvaultkey) to get the latest version of the key. Then call [Set-AzStorageAccount](/powershell/module/az.storage/set-azstorageaccount) to update the storage account's encryption settings to use the new version of the key, as shown in the previous example.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To configure customer-managed keys with manual updating of the key version, explicitly provide the key version when you configure encryption while creating the storage account. Call [az storage account update](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-update) to update the storage account's encryption settings, as shown in the following example. Include the `--encryption-key-source` parameter and set it to `Microsoft.Keyvault` to enable customer-managed keys for the account.

Remember to replace the placeholder values in brackets with your own values.

```azurecli
accountName="<storage-account>"

key_vault_uri=$(az keyvault show \
    --name <key-vault> \
    --resource-group <resource_group> \
    --query properties.vaultUri \
    --output tsv)

key_version=$(az keyvault key list-versions \
    --name <key> \
    --vault-name <key-vault> \
    --query [-1].kid \
    --output tsv | cut -d '/' -f 6)

az storage account create \
    --name $accountName \
    --resource-group $rgName \
    --location $location \
    --sku Standard_LRS \
    --kind StorageV2 \
    --allow-blob-public-access false \
    --identity-type SystemAssigned,UserAssigned \
    --user-identity-id $identityResourceId \
    --encryption-key-vault $keyVaultUri \
    --encryption-key-name $keyName \
    --encryption-key-source Microsoft.Keyvault \
    --encryption-key-version $keyVersion \
    --key-vault-user-identity-id $identityResourceId
```

When you manually update the key version, you'll need to update the storage account's encryption settings to use the new version. First, query for the key vault URI by calling [az keyvault show](/cli/azure/keyvault#az-keyvault-show), and for the key version by calling [az keyvault key list-versions](/cli/azure/keyvault/key#az-keyvault-key-list-versions). Then call [az storage account update](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-update) to update the storage account's encryption settings to use the new version of the key, as shown in the previous example.

If the new key is in a different key vault, you must [grant the managed identity access to the key in the new vault](#use-a-user-assigned-managed-identity-to-authorize-access-to-the-key-vault). If you choose manual updating of the key version, you will also need to [update the key vault URI](#configure-encryption-for-manual-updating-of-key-versions).

[!INCLUDE [storage-customer-managed-keys-revoke-include](../../../includes/storage-customer-managed-keys-revoke-include.md)]

Disabling the key will cause attempts to access data in the storage account to fail with error code 403 (Forbidden). For a list of storage account operations that will be affected by disabling the key, see [Revoke access to a storage account that uses customer-managed keys](customer-managed-keys-overview.md#revoke-access-to-a-storage-account-that-uses-customer-managed-keys).
