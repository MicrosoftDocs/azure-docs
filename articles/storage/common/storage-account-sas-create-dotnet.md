# Create an account SAS with .NET

This article shows how to use the storage account key to create an account SAS with the [Azure Storage client library for .NET](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/storage).

## About the account SAS

An account SAS is created at the level of the storage account. By creating an account SAS, you can:

- Delegate access to service-level operations that aren't currently available with a service-specific SAS, such as [Get Blob Service Properties](/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob-service-properties), [Set Blob Service Properties](/rest/api/storageservices/set-blob-service-properties) and [Get Blob Service Stats](/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob-service-stats).
- Delegate access to more than one service in a storage account at a time. For example, you can delegate access to resources in both Azure Blob Storage and Azure Files by using an account SAS.

Stored access policies aren't supported for an account SAS.

## Create an account SAS

An account SAS is signed with the account access key. You can use the [StorageSharedKeyCredential](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.storagesharedkeycredential) class to create the credential that is used to sign the SAS. 

The following code example shows how to create a new [AccountSasBuilder](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.sas.accountsasbuilder) object and call the [ToSasQueryParameters](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.sas.accountsasbuilder.tosasqueryparameters) method to get the account SAS token string.

## Use an account SAS from a client

To use the account SAS to access service-level APIs for the Blob service, create a [BlobServiceClient](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.blobserviceclient) object using the account SAS and the Blob Storage endpoint for your storage account.
