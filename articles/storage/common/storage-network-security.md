# Configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks

Azure Storage provides a layered security model. This model enables you to control the level of access to your storage accounts that your applications and enterprise environments demand, based on the type and subset of networks or resources that you use.

When you configure network rules, only applications that request data over the specified set of networks or through the specified set of Azure resources can access a storage account. You can limit access to your storage account to requests that come from specified IP addresses, IP ranges, subnets in an Azure virtual network, or resource instances of some Azure services.

Storage accounts have a public endpoint that's accessible through the internet. You can also create [private endpoints for your storage account](storage-private-endpoints.md). Creating private endpoints assigns a private IP address from your virtual network to the storage account. It helps secure traffic between your virtual network and the storage account over a private link.

The Azure Storage firewall provides access control for the public endpoint of your storage account. You can also use the firewall to block all access through the public endpoint when you're using private endpoints. Your firewall configuration also enables trusted Azure platform services to access the storage account.

An application that accesses a storage account when network rules are in effect still requires proper authorization for the request. Authorization is supported with Microsoft Entra credentials for blobs, tables, file shares and queues, with a valid account access key, or with a shared access signature (SAS) token. When you configure a blob container for anonymous access, requests to read data in that container don't need to be authorized. The firewall rules remain in effect and will block anonymous traffic.

Turning on firewall rules for your storage account blocks incoming requests for data by default, unless the requests originate from a service that operates within an Azure virtual network or from allowed public IP addresses. Requests that are blocked include those from other Azure services, from the Azure portal, and from logging and metrics services.

You can grant access to Azure services that operate from within a virtual network by allowing traffic from the subnet that hosts the service instance. You can also enable a limited number of scenarios through the exceptions mechanism that this article describes. To access data from the storage account through the Azure portal, you need to be on a machine within the trusted boundary (either IP or virtual network) that you set up.

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Scenarios

To secure your storage account, you should first configure a rule to deny access to traffic from all networks (including internet traffic) on the public endpoint, by default. Then, you should configure rules that grant access to traffic from specific virtual networks. You can also configure rules to grant access to traffic from selected public internet IP address ranges, enabling connections from specific internet or on-premises clients. This configuration helps you build a secure network boundary for your applications.

You can combine firewall rules that allow access from specific virtual networks and from public IP address ranges on the same storage account. You can apply storage firewall rules to existing storage accounts or when you create new storage accounts.

Storage firewall rules apply to the public endpoint of a storage account. You don't need any firewall access rules to allow traffic for private endpoints of a storage account. The process of approving the creation of a private endpoint grants implicit access to traffic from the subnet that hosts the private endpoint.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Storage firewall rules only apply to [data plane](../../azure-resource-manager/management/control-plane-and-data-plane.md#data-plane) operations. [Control plane](../../azure-resource-manager/management/control-plane-and-data-plane.md#control-plane) operations are not subject to the restrictions specified in firewall rules.
>
> Some operations, such as blob container operations, can be performed through both the control plane and the data plane. So if you attempt to perform an operation such as listing containers from the Azure portal, the operation will succeed unless it is blocked by another mechanism. Attempts to access blob data from an application such as Azure Storage Explorer are controlled by the firewall restrictions.
>
> For a list of data plane operations, see the [Azure Storage REST API Reference](/rest/api/storageservices/).
> For a list of control plane operations, see the [Azure Storage Resource Provider REST API Reference](/rest/api/storagerp/).

## Configure network access to Azure Storage

You can control access to the data in your storage account over network endpoints, or through trusted services or resources in any combination including:

- [Allow access from selected virtual network subnets using private endpoints](storage-private-endpoints.md).
- [Allow access from selected virtual network subnets using service endpoints](#grant-access-from-a-virtual-network).
- [Allow access from specific public IP addresses or ranges](#grant-access-from-an-internet-ip-range).
- [Allow access from selected Azure resource instances](#grant-access-from-azure-resource-instances).
- [Allow access from trusted Azure services](#grant-access-to-trusted-azure-services) (using [Manage exceptions](#manage-exceptions)).
- [Configure exceptions for logging and metrics services](#manage-exceptions).

### About virtual network endpoints

There are two types of virtual network endpoints for storage accounts:

- [Virtual Network service endpoints](../../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview.md)
- [Private endpoints](storage-private-endpoints.md)

Virtual network service endpoints are public and accessible via the internet. The Azure Storage firewall provides the ability to control access to your storage account over such public endpoints. When you enable public network access to your storage account, all incoming requests for data are blocked by default. Only applications that request data from allowed sources that you configure in your storage account firewall settings will be able to access your data. Sources can include the source IP address or virtual network subnet of a client, or an Azure service or resource instance through which clients or services access your data. Requests that are blocked include those from other Azure services, from the Azure portal, and from logging and metrics services, unless you explicitly allow access in your firewall configuration.

A private endpoint uses a private IP address from your virtual network to access a storage account over the Microsoft backbone network. With a private endpoint, traffic between your virtual network and the storage account are secured over a private link. Storage firewall rules only apply to the public endpoints of a storage account, not private endpoints. The process of approving the creation of a private endpoint grants implicit access to traffic from the subnet that hosts the private endpoint. You can use [Network Policies](../../private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy.md) to control traffic over private endpoints if you want to refine access rules. If you want to use private endpoints exclusively, you can use the firewall to block all access through the public endpoint.

To help you decide when to use each type of endpoint in your environment, see [Compare Private Endpoints and Service Endpoints](../../virtual-network/vnet-integration-for-azure-services.md#compare-private-endpoints-and-service-endpoints).

### How to approach network security for your storage account

To secure your storage account and build a secure network boundary for your applications:

1. Start by disabling all public network access for the storage account under the **Public network access** setting in the storage account firewall.
1. Where possible, configure private links to your storage account from private endpoints on virtual network subnets where the clients reside that require access to your data.
1. If client applications require access over the public endpoints, change the **Public network access** setting to **Enabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses**. Then, as needed:

    1. Specify the virtual network subnets from which you want to allow access.
    1. Specify the public IP address ranges of clients from which you want to allow access, such as those on on-premises networks.
    1. Allow access from selected Azure resource instances.
    1. Add exceptions to allow access from trusted services required for operations such as backing up data.
    1. Add exceptions for logging and metrics.

After you apply network rules, they're enforced for all requests. SAS tokens that grant access to a specific IP address serve to limit the access of the token holder, but they don't grant new access beyond configured network rules.

### Network security perimeter (preview)

[Network security perimeter](../../private-link/network-security-perimeter-concepts.md) (preview) allows organizations to define a logical network isolation boundary for PaaS resources (for example, Azure Blob Storage and SQL Database) that are deployed outside their virtual networks. The feature restricts public network access to PaaS resources outside the perimeter. However, you can exempt access by using explicit access rules for public inbound and outbound traffic. By design, access to a storage account from within a network security perimeter takes the highest precedence over other network access restrictions.

Currently, network security perimeter is in public preview for Azure Blob Storage, Azure Files (REST), Azure Tables, and Azure Queues. See [Transition to a network security perimeter](../../private-link/network-security-perimeter-transition.md). 

The list of services that have been onboarded to network security perimeter can be found [here](../../private-link/network-security-perimeter-concepts.md#onboarded-private-link-resources). 

For services that are not on this list, as they have not yet been onboarded to network security perimeter, if you would like to allow access you can use a subscription-based rule on the network security perimeter. All resources within that subscription will then be given access to that network security perimeter. For more information on adding subscription-based access rule, refer [here](/rest/api/networkmanager/nsp-access-rules/create-or-update).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Private endpoint traffic is considered highly secure and therefore isn't subject to network security perimeter rules. All other traffic, including trusted services, will be subject to network security perimeter rules if the storage account is associated with a perimeter.

#### Limitations

This preview doesn't support the following services, operations, and protocols on a storage account:

- [Object replication](../blobs/object-replication-overview.md) for Azure Blob Storage
- [Lifecycle management](../blobs/lifecycle-management-overview.md) for Azure Blob Storage
- [SSH File transfer protocol (SFTP)](../blobs/secure-file-transfer-protocol-support.md) over Azure Blob Storage
- Network file system (NFS) protocol with [Azure Blob Storage](../blobs/network-file-system-protocol-support.md) and [Azure Files](../files/files-nfs-protocol.md).
- Server message block (SMB) protocol with Azure Files can only be achieved through IP allowlisting at this time.
- [Azure Blob Inventory](../blobs/blob-inventory.md)

- Vaulted backups for Azure Blob Storage

We recommend you don't enable network security perimeter if you need to use any of these services, operations, or protocols. This is to prevent any potential data loss or data exfiltration risk.

> [!WARNING]
> For storage accounts that are associated with a network security perimeter, in order for customer managed keys (CMK) scenarios to work, ensure that the Azure Key Vault is accessible from within the perimeter to which the storage account has been associated.

#### Associate a network security perimeter with a storage account

To associate a network security perimeter with a storage account, follow these [common instructions](../../private-link/network-security-perimeter-concepts.md) for all PaaS resources.

## Restrictions and considerations

Before implementing network security for your storage accounts, review the important restrictions and considerations discussed in this section.

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Azure Storage firewall rules only apply to [data plane](../../azure-resource-manager/management/control-plane-and-data-plane.md#data-plane) operations. [Control plane](../../azure-resource-manager/management/control-plane-and-data-plane.md#control-plane) operations are not subject to the restrictions specified in firewall rules.
> - Review the [Restrictions for IP network rules](#restrictions-for-ip-network-rules).
> - To access data by using tools such as the Azure portal, Azure Storage Explorer, and AzCopy, you must be on a machine within the trusted boundary that you establish when configuring network security rules.
> - Network rules are enforced on all network protocols for Azure Storage, including REST and SMB.
> - Network rules don't affect virtual machine (VM) disk traffic, including mount and unmount operations and disk I/O, but they do help protect REST access to page blobs.
> - You can use unmanaged disks in storage accounts with network rules applied to back up and restore VMs by [creating an exception](#manage-exceptions). Firewall exceptions aren't applicable to managed disks, because Azure already manages them.
> - Classic storage accounts don't support firewalls and virtual networks.
> - If you delete a subnet that's included in a virtual network rule, it will be removed from the network rules for the storage account. If you create a new subnet by the same name, it won't have access to the storage account. To allow access, you must explicitly authorize the new subnet in the network rules for the storage account.
> - When referencing a service endpoint in a client application, it's recommended that you avoid taking a dependency on a cached IP address. The storage account IP address is subject to change, and relying on a cached IP address may result in unexpected behavior. Additionally, it's recommended that you honor the time-to-live (TTL) of the DNS record and avoid overriding it. Overriding the DNS TTL may result in unexpected behavior.
> - By design, access to a storage account from trusted services takes the highest precedence over other network access restrictions. If you set **Public network access** to **Disabled** after previously setting it to **Enabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses**, any [resource instances](#grant-access-from-azure-resource-instances) and [exceptions](#manage-exceptions) that you previously configured, including [Allow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage account](#grant-access-to-trusted-azure-services), will remain in effect. As a result, those resources and services might still have access to the storage account.

### Authorization

Clients granted access via network rules must continue to meet the authorization requirements of the storage account to access the data. Authorization is supported with Microsoft Entra credentials for blobs and queues, with a valid account access key, or with a shared access signature (SAS) token.

When you configure a blob container for anonymous public access, requests to read data in that container don't need to be authorized, but the firewall rules remain in effect and will block anonymous traffic.

## Change the default network access rule

By default, storage accounts accept connections from clients on any network. You can limit access to selected networks *or* prevent traffic from all networks and permit access only through a [private endpoint](storage-private-endpoints.md).

You must set the default rule to **deny**, or network rules have no effect. However, changing this setting can affect your application's ability to connect to Azure Storage. Be sure to grant access to any allowed networks or set up access through a private endpoint before you change this setting.

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Go to the storage account that you want to secure.

2. In the service menu, under **Security + networking**, select **Networking**.

3. Choose what network access is enabled through the storage account's public endpoint:

   - Select either **Enabled from all networks** or **Enabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses**. If you select the second option, you'll be prompted to add virtual networks and IP address ranges.

   - To restrict inbound access while allowing outbound access, select **Disabled**.

4. Select **Save** to apply your changes.

<a id="powershell"></a>

### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

1. Install [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) and [sign in](/powershell/azure/authenticate-azureps).

2. Choose which type of public network access you want to allow:

    - To allow traffic from all networks, use the `Update-AzStorageAccountNetworkRuleSet` command and set the `-DefaultAction` parameter to `Allow`:

      ```powershell
      Update-AzStorageAccountNetworkRuleSet -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -Name "mystorageaccount" -DefaultAction Allow
      ```
  
    - To allow traffic only from specific virtual networks, use the `Update-AzStorageAccountNetworkRuleSet` command and set the `-DefaultAction` parameter to `Deny`:

      ```powershell
      Update-AzStorageAccountNetworkRuleSet -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -Name "mystorageaccount" -DefaultAction Deny
      ```

    - To block traffic from all networks, use the `Set-AzStorageAccount` command and set the `-PublicNetworkAccess` parameter to `Disabled`. Traffic will be allowed only through a [private endpoint](storage-private-endpoints.md). You'll have to create that private endpoint.

      ```powershell
      Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -Name "mystorageaccount" -PublicNetworkAccess Disabled
      ```

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Install the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and [sign in](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

2. Choose which type of public network access you want to allow:

    - To allow traffic from all networks, use the `az storage account update` command and set the `--default-action` parameter to `Allow`:

      ```azurecli
      az storage account update --resource-group "myresourcegroup" --name "mystorageaccount" --default-action Allow
      ```

    - To allow traffic only from specific virtual networks, use the `az storage account update` command and set the `--default-action` parameter to `Deny`:

      ```azurecli
      az storage account update --resource-group "myresourcegroup" --name "mystorageaccount" --default-action Deny
      ```

    - To block traffic from all networks, use the `az storage account update` command and set the `--public-network-access` parameter to `Disabled`. Traffic will be allowed only through a [private endpoint](storage-private-endpoints.md). You'll have to create that private endpoint.

      ```azurecli
      az storage account update --name MyStorageAccount --resource-group MyResourceGroup --public-network-access Disabled
      ```

---

## Grant access from a virtual network

You can configure storage accounts to allow access only from specific subnets. The allowed subnets can belong to a virtual network in the same subscription or a different subscription, including those that belong to a different Microsoft Entra tenant. With [cross-region service endpoints](#azure-storage-cross-region-service-endpoints), the allowed subnets can also be in different regions from the storage account.

You can enable a [service endpoint](../../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview.md) for Azure Storage within the virtual network. The service endpoint routes traffic from the virtual network through an optimal path to the Azure Storage service. The identities of the subnet and the virtual network are also transmitted with each request. Administrators can then configure network rules for the storage account that allow requests to be received from specific subnets in a virtual network. Clients granted access via these network rules must continue to meet the authorization requirements of the storage account to access the data.

Each storage account supports up to 400 virtual network rules. You can combine these rules with [IP network rules](#grant-access-from-an-internet-ip-range).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When referencing a service endpoint in a client application, it's recommended that you avoid taking a dependency on a cached IP address. The storage account IP address is subject to change, and relying on a cached IP address may result in unexpected behavior.
>
> Additionally, it's recommended that you honor the time-to-live (TTL) of the DNS record and avoid overriding it. Overriding the DNS TTL may result in unexpected behavior.

### Required permissions

To apply a virtual network rule to a storage account, the user must have the appropriate permissions for the subnets that are being added. A [Storage Account Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#storage-account-contributor) or a user who has permission to the `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/joinViaServiceEndpoint/action` [Azure resource provider operation](../../role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations.md#microsoftnetwork) can apply a rule by using a custom Azure role.

The storage account and the virtual networks that get access can be in different subscriptions, including subscriptions that are a part of a different Microsoft Entra tenant.

Configuration of rules that grant access to subnets in virtual networks that are a part of a different Microsoft Entra tenant are currently supported only through PowerShell, the Azure CLI, and REST APIs. You can't configure such rules through the Azure portal, though you can view them in the portal.

### Azure Storage cross-region service endpoints

Cross-region service endpoints for Azure Storage became generally available in April 2023. They work between virtual networks and storage service instances in any region. With cross-region service endpoints, subnets no longer use a public IP address to communicate with any storage account, including those in another region. Instead, all the traffic from subnets to storage accounts uses a private IP address as a source IP. As a result, any storage accounts that use IP network rules to permit traffic from those subnets no longer have an effect.

Configuring service endpoints between virtual networks and service instances in a [paired region](../../best-practices-availability-paired-regions.md) can be an important part of your disaster recovery plan. Service endpoints allow continuity during a regional failover and access to read-only geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) instances. Network rules that grant access from a virtual network to a storage account also grant access to any RA-GRS instance.

When you're planning for disaster recovery during a regional outage, create the virtual networks in the paired region in advance. Enable service endpoints for Azure Storage, with network rules granting access from these alternative virtual networks. Then apply these rules to your geo-redundant storage accounts.

Local and cross-region service endpoints can't coexist on the same subnet. To replace existing service endpoints with cross-region ones, delete the existing `Microsoft.Storage` endpoints and re-create them as cross-region endpoints (`Microsoft.Storage.Global`).

### Managing virtual network and access rules

You can manage virtual network and access rules for storage accounts through the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI v2.

If you want to enable access to your storage account from a virtual network or subnet in another Microsoft Entra tenant, you must use PowerShell or the Azure CLI. The Azure portal doesn't show subnets in other Microsoft Entra tenants.

#### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Go to the storage account for which you want to configure virtual network and access rules.

2. In the service menu, under **Security + networking**, select **Networking**.

3. Check that you've chosen to enable public network access from selected virtual networks and IP addresses.

4. To grant access to a virtual network by using a new network rule, under **Virtual networks**, select **Add existing virtual network**. Select the **Virtual networks** and **Subnets** options, and then select **Add**. To create a new virtual network and grant it access, select **Add new virtual network**. Provide the necessary information to create the new virtual network, and then select **Create**. Currently, only virtual networks that belong to the same Microsoft Entra tenant appear for selection during rule creation. To grant access to a subnet in a virtual network that belongs to another tenant, use PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or REST API.

5. To remove a virtual network or subnet rule, select the ellipsis (**...**) to open the context menu for the virtual network or subnet, and then select **Remove**.

6. Select **Save** to apply your changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you delete a subnet that's included in a network rule, it will be removed from the network rules for the storage account. If you create a new subnet by the same name, it won't have access to the storage account. To allow access, you must explicitly authorize the new subnet in the network rules for the storage account.

#### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

1. Install [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) and [sign in](/powershell/azure/authenticate-azureps).

2. List virtual network rules:

    ```powershell
    (Get-AzStorageAccountNetworkRuleSet -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -AccountName "mystorageaccount").VirtualNetworkRules
    ```

3. Enable a service endpoint for Azure Storage on an existing virtual network and subnet:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -Name "myvnet" | Set-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name "mysubnet" -AddressPrefix "10.0.0.0/24" -ServiceEndpoint "Microsoft.Storage.Global" | Set-AzVirtualNetwork
    ```

4. Add a network rule for a virtual network and subnet:

    ```powershell
    $subnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -Name "myvnet" | Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name "mysubnet"
    Add-AzStorageAccountNetworkRule -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -Name "mystorageaccount" -VirtualNetworkResourceId $subnet.Id
    ```

    To add a network rule for a subnet in a virtual network that belongs to another Microsoft Entra tenant, use a fully qualified `VirtualNetworkResourceId` parameter in the form `/subscriptions/subscription-ID/resourceGroups/resourceGroup-Name/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vNet-name/subnets/subnet-name`.

5. Remove a network rule for a virtual network and subnet:

    ```powershell
    $subnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -Name "myvnet" | Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name "mysubnet"
    Remove-AzStorageAccountNetworkRule -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -Name "mystorageaccount" -VirtualNetworkResourceId $subnet.Id
    ```

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Install the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and [sign in](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

2. List virtual network rules:

    ```azurecli
    az storage account network-rule list --resource-group "myresourcegroup" --account-name "mystorageaccount" --query virtualNetworkRules
    ```

3. Enable a service endpoint for Azure Storage on an existing virtual network and subnet:

    ```azurecli
    az network vnet subnet update --resource-group "myresourcegroup" --vnet-name "myvnet" --name "mysubnet" --service-endpoints "Microsoft.Storage.Global"
    ```

4. Add a network rule for a virtual network and subnet:

    ```azurecli
    subnetid=$(az network vnet subnet show --resource-group "myresourcegroup" --vnet-name "myvnet" --name "mysubnet" --query id --output tsv)
    az storage account network-rule add --resource-group "myresourcegroup" --account-name "mystorageaccount" --subnet $subnetid
    ```

    To add a rule for a subnet in a virtual network that belongs to another Microsoft Entra tenant, use a fully qualified subnet ID in the form `/subscriptions/<subscription-ID>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroup-Name>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vNet-name>/subnets/<subnet-name>`. You can use the `subscription` parameter to retrieve the subnet ID for a virtual network that belongs to another Microsoft Entra tenant.

5. Remove a network rule for a virtual network and subnet:

    ```azurecli
    subnetid=$(az network vnet subnet show --resource-group "myresourcegroup" --vnet-name "myvnet" --name "mysubnet" --query id --output tsv)
    az storage account network-rule remove --resource-group "myresourcegroup" --account-name "mystorageaccount" --subnet $subnetid
    ```

## Grant access from an internet IP range

You can use IP network rules to allow access from specific public internet IP address ranges by creating IP network rules. Each storage account supports up to 400 rules. These rules grant access to specific internet-based services and on-premises networks and block general internet traffic.

### Restrictions for IP network rules

The following restrictions apply to IP address ranges:

- IP network rules are allowed only for *public internet* IP addresses.

  IP address ranges reserved for private networks (as defined in [RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918#section-3)) aren't allowed in IP rules. Private networks include addresses that start with 10, 172.16 to 172.31, and 192.168.

- You must provide allowed internet address ranges by using [CIDR notation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632) in the form 16.17.18.0/24 or as individual IP addresses like 16.17.18.19.

- Small address ranges that use /31 or /32 prefix sizes are not supported. Configure these ranges by using individual IP address rules.

- Only IPv4 addresses are supported for configuration of storage firewall rules.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't use IP network rules in the following cases:
>
> - To restrict access to clients in same Azure region as the storage account. IP network rules have no effect on requests that originate from the same Azure region as the storage account. Use [Virtual network rules](#grant-access-from-a-virtual-network) to allow same-region requests.
> - To restrict access to clients in a [paired region](../../reliability/cross-region-replication-azure.md) that are in a virtual network that has a service endpoint.
> - To restrict access to Azure services deployed in the same region as the storage account. Services deployed in the same region as the storage account use private Azure IP addresses for communication. So, you can't restrict access to specific Azure services based on their public outbound IP address range.

### Configuring access from on-premises networks

To grant access from your on-premises networks to your storage account by using an IP network rule, you must identify the internet-facing IP addresses that your network uses. Contact your network administrator for help.

If you're using [Azure ExpressRoute](../../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md) from your premises, you need to identify the NAT IP addresses used for Microsoft peering. Either the service provider or the customer provides the NAT IP addresses.

To allow access to your service resources, you must allow these public IP addresses in the firewall setting for resource IPs.

### Managing IP network rules

You can manage IP network rules for storage accounts through the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI v2.

#### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Go to the storage account for which you want to manage IP network rules.

2. In the service menu, under **Security + networking**, select **Networking**.

3. Check that you've chosen to enable public network access from selected virtual networks and IP addresses.

4. To grant access to an internet IP range, enter the IP address or address range (in CIDR format) under **Firewall** > **Address Range**.

5. To remove an IP network rule, select the delete icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/storage-network-security/delete-icon.png":::) next to the address range.

6. Select **Save** to apply your changes.

#### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

1. Install [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) and [sign in](/powershell/azure/authenticate-azureps).

2. List IP network rules:

    ```powershell
    (Get-AzStorageAccountNetworkRuleSet -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -AccountName "mystorageaccount").IPRules
    ```

3. Add a network rule for an individual IP address:

    ```powershell
    Add-AzStorageAccountNetworkRule -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -AccountName "mystorageaccount" -IPAddressOrRange "16.17.18.19"
    ```

4. Add a network rule for an IP address range:

    ```powershell
    Add-AzStorageAccountNetworkRule -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -AccountName "mystorageaccount" -IPAddressOrRange "16.17.18.0/24"
    ```

5. Remove a network rule for an individual IP address:

    ```powershell
    Remove-AzStorageAccountNetworkRule -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -AccountName "mystorageaccount" -IPAddressOrRange "16.17.18.19"
    ```

## Grant access from Azure resource instances

In some cases, an application might depend on Azure resources that can't be isolated through a virtual network or an IP address rule. But you still want to secure and restrict storage account access to only your application's Azure resources. You can configure storage accounts to allow access to specific resource instances of trusted Azure services by creating a resource instance rule.

The Azure role assignments of the resource instance determine the types of operations that a resource instance can perform on storage account data. Resource instances must be from the same tenant as your storage account, but they can belong to any subscription in the tenant.

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

You can add or remove resource network rules in the Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Locate your storage account and display the account overview.

3. In the service menu, under **Security + networking**, select **Networking**.

4. Check that you've chosen to enable public network access from selected virtual networks and IP addresses.

5. Scroll down to find **Resource instances**. In the **Resource type** dropdown list, select the resource type of your resource instance.

6. In the **Instance name** dropdown list, select the resource instance. You can also choose to include all resource instances in the current tenant, subscription, or resource group.

7. Select **Save** to apply your changes. The resource instance appears in the **Resource instances** section of the page for network settings.

To remove the resource instance, select the delete icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/storage-network-security/delete-icon.png":::) next to the resource instance.

### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

You can use PowerShell commands to add or remove resource network rules.

#### Grant access

Add a network rule that grants access from a resource instance:

```powershell
$resourceId = "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/myDataFactory"
$tenantId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
$resourceGroupName = "myResourceGroup"
$accountName = "mystorageaccount"

Add-AzStorageAccountNetworkRule -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $accountName -TenantId $tenantId -ResourceId $resourceId

```

Specify multiple resource instances at once by modifying the network rule set:

```powershell
$resourceId1 = "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/myDataFactory"
$resourceId2 = "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/mySQLServer"
$tenantId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
$resourceGroupName = "myResourceGroup"
$accountName = "mystorageaccount"

Update-AzStorageAccountNetworkRuleSet -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $accountName -ResourceAccessRule (@{ResourceId=$resourceId1;TenantId=$tenantId},@{ResourceId=$resourceId2;TenantId=$tenantId}) 
```

#### Remove access

Remove a network rule that grants access from a resource instance:

```powershell
$resourceId = "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/myDataFactory"
$tenantId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
$resourceGroupName = "myResourceGroup"
$accountName = "mystorageaccount"

Remove-AzStorageAccountNetworkRule -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $accountName -TenantId $tenantId -ResourceId $resourceId  
```

Remove all network rules that grant access from resource instances:

```powershell
$resourceGroupName = "myResourceGroup"
$accountName = "mystorageaccount"

Update-AzStorageAccountNetworkRuleSet -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $accountName -ResourceAccessRule @()  
```

#### View a list of allowed resource instances

View a complete list of resource instances that have access to the storage account:

```powershell
$resourceGroupName = "myResourceGroup"
$accountName = "mystorageaccount"

$rule = Get-AzStorageAccountNetworkRuleSet -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $accountName
$rule.ResourceAccessRules 
```

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

You can use Azure CLI commands to add or remove resource network rules.

#### Grant access

Add a network rule that grants access from a resource instance:

```azurecli
az storage account network-rule add \
    --resource-id /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Synapse/workspaces/testworkspace \
    --tenant-id xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx \
    -g myResourceGroup \
    --account-name mystorageaccount
```

#### Remove access

    --resource-id /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Synapse/workspaces/testworkspace \
    --tenant-id xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx \
    -g myResourceGroup \
    --account-name mystorageaccount
```

#### View a list of allowed resource instances

## Grant access to trusted Azure services

Some Azure services operate from networks that you can't include in your network rules. You can grant a subset of such trusted Azure services access to the storage account, while maintaining network rules for other apps. These trusted services will then use strong authentication to connect to your storage account.

You can grant access to trusted Azure services by creating a network rule exception. The [Manage exceptions](#manage-exceptions) section of this article provides step-by-step guidance.

If your account doesn't have the hierarchical namespace feature enabled on it, you can grant permission by explicitly assigning an Azure role to the [managed identity](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) for each resource instance. In this case, the scope of access for the instance corresponds to the Azure role that's assigned to the managed identity.

You can use the same technique for an account that has the hierarchical namespace feature enabled on it. However, you don't have to assign an Azure role if you add the managed identity to the access control list (ACL) of any directory or blob that the storage account contains. In that case, the scope of access for the instance corresponds to the directory or file to which the managed identity has access.

You can also combine Azure roles and ACLs together to grant access. To learn more, see [Access control model in Azure Data Lake Storage](../blobs/data-lake-storage-access-control-model.md).

We recommend that you [use resource instance rules to grant access to specific resources](#grant-access-from-azure-resource-instances).

<a id="manage-exceptions"></a>

## Manage exceptions

In some cases, like storage analytics, access to read resource logs and metrics is required from outside the network boundary. When you configure trusted services to access the storage account, you can allow read access for the log files, metrics tables, or both by creating a network rule exception. You can manage network rule exceptions through the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI v2.

To learn more about working with storage analytics, see [Use Azure Storage analytics to collect logs and metrics data](./storage-analytics.md).

#### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Go to the storage account for which you want to manage exceptions.

2. In the service menu, under **Security + networking**, select **Networking**.

3. Check that you've chosen to enable public network access from selected virtual networks and IP addresses.

4. Under **Exceptions**, select the exceptions that you want to grant.

5. Select **Save** to apply your changes.

#### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

1. Install [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) and [sign in](/powershell/azure/authenticate-azureps).

2. Display the exceptions for the storage account's network rules:

    ```powershell
    (Get-AzStorageAccountNetworkRuleSet -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -Name "mystorageaccount").Bypass
    ```

3. Configure the exceptions to the storage account's network rules:

    ```powershell
    Update-AzStorageAccountNetworkRuleSet -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -Name "mystorageaccount" -Bypass AzureServices,Metrics,Logging
    ```

4. Remove the exceptions to the storage account's network rules:

    ```powershell
    Update-AzStorageAccountNetworkRuleSet -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -Name "mystorageaccount" -Bypass None
    ```

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Install the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and [sign in](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

2. Display the exceptions for the storage account's network rules:

    ```azurecli
    az storage account show --resource-group "myresourcegroup" --name "mystorageaccount" --query networkRuleSet.bypass
    ```

3. Configure the exceptions to the storage account's network rules:

    ```azurecli
    az storage account update --resource-group "myresourcegroup" --name "mystorageaccount" --bypass Logging Metrics AzureServices
    ```

4. Remove the exceptions to the storage account's network rules:

    ```azurecli
    az storage account update --resource-group "myresourcegroup" --name "mystorageaccount" --bypass None
    ```
