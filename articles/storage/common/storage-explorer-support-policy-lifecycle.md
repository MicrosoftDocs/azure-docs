# Azure Storage Explorer support lifecycle and policy

This document covers the support lifecycle and policy for Azure Storage Explorer.

## Update schedule and process

Azure Storage Explorer is released four to six times a year. Microsoft may also bypass this schedule to release fixes for critical issues.

Storage Explorer checks for updates every hour, and downloads them when they're available. User acceptance is required, however, to start the install process. If users choose to update at a different time, they can manually check for update. On Windows and Linux, users can check for updates by selecting **Check for Updates** from the **Help** menu. On macOS, **Check for Updates** can be found under the **app menu**. Users may also directly go to the [Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) download page to download and install the latest release.

We strongly recommend to always use the latest versions of Storage Explorer. If an issue is preventing you from updating to the latest version of Storage Explorer, open an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureStorageExplorer).

## Support lifecycle

Storage Explorer is governed by the [Modern Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/help/30881/modern-lifecycle-policy). It's expected that users keep their installation of Storage Explorer up to date. Staying up to date ensures that users have the latest capabilities, performance enhancements, security, and service reliability.

Starting with version 1.14.1, any Storage Explorer release that is greater than 12 months old will be considered out of support. All releases before 1.14.1 will be considered out of support starting on July 14, 2021. Versions that are out of support are no longer guaranteed to work fully as designed and expected. For a list of all releases, their release date, and their end of support date, see [Releases](#releases).

Starting with version 1.13.0, an in-app alert will be displayed once a version is approximately one month away from being out of support. The alert encourages users to update to the latest version of Storage Explorer. Once a version is out of support, the in-app alert will be displayed on each start-up.
