# Monitoring Azure Storage

When you have critical applications and business processes that rely on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. This article describes the monitoring data that is generated by Azure Storage and how you can use the features of Azure Monitor to analyze alert on this data.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Storage logs in Azure Monitor is in public preview, and is available for preview testing in all public cloud regions. To enroll in the preview, see [this page](https://www.microsoft.com).  This preview enables logs for blobs (including Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2), files, queues, tables, premium storage accounts in general-purpose v1 and general-purpose v2 storage accounts. Classic storage accounts are not supported.

## Monitor overview

The **Overview** page in the Azure portal for each storage resource includes a brief view of the resource usage including its request and hourly billing usage. This is useful information, but only a small amount of the monitoring data available. Some of this data is collected automatically, and is available for analysis as soon as you create the storage resource. You can enable additional types of data collection with some configuration.

## What is Azure Monitor?
Azure Storage creates monitoring data using [Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/overview.md) which is a full stack monitoring service in Azure that provides a complete set of features to monitor your Azure resources in addition to resources in other clouds and on-premises. 

Start with the article [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/insights/monitor-azure-resource.md) which describes the following:

- What is Azure Monitor?
- Costs associated with monitoring
- Monitoring data collected in Azure
- Configuring data collection
- Standard tools in Azure for analyzing and alerting on monitoring data

The following sections build on this article by describing the specific data gathered from Azure Storage and providing examples for configuring data collection and analyzing this data with Azure tools.

## Monitoring data from Azure Storage

Azure Storage collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources which are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](../../azure-monitor/insights/monitor-azure-resource.md#monitoring-data). See [Azure Storage monitoring data reference](monitor-storage-reference.md) for a detailed reference of the logs and metrics created by Azure Storage.

Metrics and logs in Azure Monitor support only Azure Resource Manager storage accounts. Azure Monitor doesn't support classic storage accounts. If you want to use metrics or logs on a classic storage account, you need to migrate to Azure Resource Manager storage account. See [Migrate to Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/migration-classic-resource-manager-overview).

You can continue using classic metrics and logs if you want to. In fact, classic metrics and logs are available in parallel with metrics and logs in Azure Monitor. The support remains in place until Azure Storage ends the service on legacy metrics and logs. 

### Logs in Azure Monitor

Log entries are created only if there are requests made against the service endpoint. For example, if a storage account has activity in its blob endpoint but not in its table or queue endpoints, only logs pertaining to the blob service will be created.

#### Logging authenticated requests

 The following types of authenticated requests are logged:

- Successful requests
- Failed requests, including timeout, throttling, network, authorization, and other errors
- Requests using a Shared Access Signature (SAS) or OAuth, including failed and successful requests
- Requests to analytics data (classic log data in the **$logs** container, and class metric data in the **$metric** tables)

  Requests made by the storage service itself, such as log creation or deletion, are not logged. A full list of the logged data is documented in the [Storage Logged Operations and Status Messages](/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-logged-operations-and-status-messages) and [Storage Log Format](/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-log-format) topics.

#### Logging anonymous requests

 The following types of anonymous requests are logged:

- Successful requests
- Server errors
- Timeout errors for both client and server
- Failed GET requests with error code 304 (Not Modified)

  All other failed anonymous requests are not logged. A full list of the logged data is documented in the [Storage Logged Operations and Status Messages](/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-logged-operations-and-status-messages) and [Storage Log Format](/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-log-format) topics.

## Configuration

Platform metrics and the Activity log are collected automatically, but you must create a diagnostic setting to collect resource logs or forward them outside of Azure Monitor. See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](../../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings.md) for the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell.

When you create a diagnostic setting, you'll need to choose the type of storage that you want to enable logs for (blob, queue, table, file). If you create the diagnostic setting in the Azure portal, then you can select the resource from a list. If you use PowerShell or the Azure CLI, then you'll need to use the resource ID of the storage type. You can find the resource ID in the Azure portal by opening the **Properties** page of your storage account.

You'll also have to specify which categories of operations to collect logs for. The categories for Azure Storage are listed in the following table:

| Category | Description |
|:---|:---|
| StorageRead | Read operations on blobs.  |
| StorageWrite | Write operations on blobs. |
| StorageDelete | Delete operations on blobs. |

## Analyzing metric data

You can analyze metrics for Azure storage with metrics from other Azure services by using Metrics explorer. Open Metrics explorer by choosing **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](../../azure-monitor/platform/metrics-getting-started.md) for details on using this tool. 

The following example shows how to view **Transactions** at account level.

![screenshot of accessing metrics in the Azure portal](./media/monitor-storage/access-metrics-in-portal.png)

For metrics supporting dimensions, you can filter metric with the desired dimension value. The following example shows how to view **Transactions** at account level on a specific operation by selecting values for  **API Name** dimension.

![screenshot of accessing metrics with dimension in the Azure portal](./media/monitor-storage/access-metrics-in-portal-with-dimension.png)

For a complete list of the dimensions that Azure Storage supports, see [Metrics Dimensions](monitor-storage-reference.md#metrics-dimensions).

All metrics for Azure storage are located in the following namespaces:

- Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts
- Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices
- Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/fileServices
- Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/queueServices
- Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/tableServices

For a list of all Azure Monitor support metrics (including Azure Storage), see [Azure Monitor supported metrics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported).


### Access metrics

> [!TIP]
> To view Azure CLI or .NET examples, choose the corresponding tab below.

### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

#### List the metric definition

You can list the metric definition of your storage account, or the individual storage service such as the blob, file, table or queue service. Use the [Get-AzMetricDefinition](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.monitor/get-azmetricdefinition?view=azps-3.3.0) cmdlet.

In this example, replace the `<resource-ID>` placeholder with the resource ID of the entire storage account, or the resource ID of an individual storage service such as the as the blob, file, table or queue service. You can find these resource IDs in the **Properties** pages of your storage account on the Azure portal.

  ```powershell
    $resourceId = "<resource-ID>"
    Get-AzMetricDefinition -ResourceId $resourceId
  ```

#### Read metric values

You can read account-level metric values of your storage account, or the individual storage service such as the blob, file, table or queue service. Use the [Get-AzMetric](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/Az.Monitor/Get-AzMetric?view=azps-3.3.0) cmdlet.

In this example, replace the `<resource-ID>` placeholder with the resource ID of the entire storage account, or the resource ID of an individual storage service such as the as the blob, file, table or queue service. You can find these resource IDs in the **Properties** pages of your storage account on the Azure portal.

  ```powershell
    $resourceId = "<resource-ID>"
    Get-AzMetric -ResourceId $resourceId -MetricNames "UsedCapacity" -TimeGrain 01:00:00
  ```

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

#### List account level metric definition

You can list the metric definition of your storage account, or the individual storage service such as the blob, file, table or queue service. Use the the [az monitor metrics list-definitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/monitor/metrics?view=azure-cli-latest#az-monitor-metrics-list-definitions) command.
 
In this example, replace the `<resource-ID>` placeholder with the resource ID of the entire storage account, or the resource ID of an individual storage service such as the as the blob, file, table or queue service. You can find these resource IDs in the **Properties** pages of your storage account on the Azure portal.

```azurecli-interactive
   az monitor metrics list-definitions --resource <resource-ID>
```

#### Read account-level metric values

You can read the metric values of your storage account, or the individual storage service such as the blob, file, table or queue service. Use the [az monitor metrics list](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/monitor/metrics?view=azure-cli-latest#az-monitor-metrics-list) command.
 
In this example, replace the `<resource-ID>` placeholder with the resource ID of the entire storage account, or the resource ID of an individual storage service such as the as the blob, file, table or queue service. You can find these resource IDs in the **Properties** pages of your storage account on the Azure portal.

```azurecli-interactive
   az monitor metrics list --resource <resource-ID> --metric "UsedCapacity" --interval PT1H
```

### [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

Azure Monitor provides [.NET SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor/) to read metric definition and values. The [sample code](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/monitor-dotnet-metrics-api/) shows how to use the SDK with different parameters. You need to use `0.18.0-preview` or later version for storage metrics.
 
In these examples, replace the `<resource-ID>` placeholder with the resource ID of the entire storage account, or the resource ID of an individual storage service such as the as the blob, file, table or queue service. You can find these resource IDs in the **Properties** pages of your storage account on the Azure portal.

Replace the `<subscription-ID>` variable with the ID of your subscription.  For guidance on how to obtain values for the `<tenant-ID>`, `<application-ID>`, and `<AccessKey>`, see [How to: Use the portal to create an Azure AD application and service principal that can access resources](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/). 

#### List account level metric definition

The following examples show how to list metric definition at account level:

```csharp
    public static async Task ListStorageMetricDefinition()
    {
        var resourceId = "<resource-ID>";
        var subscriptionId = "<subscription-ID>";
        var tenantId = "<tenant-ID>";
        var applicationId = "<application-ID>";
        var accessKey = "<AccessKey>";


        MonitorManagementClient readOnlyClient = AuthenticateWithReadOnlyClient(tenantId, applicationId, accessKey, subscriptionId).Result;
        IEnumerable<MetricDefinition> metricDefinitions = await readOnlyClient.MetricDefinitions.ListAsync(resourceUri: resourceId, cancellationToken: new CancellationToken());

        foreach (var metricDefinition in metricDefinitions)
        {
            // Enumrate metric definition:
            //    Id
            //    ResourceId
            //    Name
            //    Unit
            //    MetricAvailabilities
            //    PrimaryAggregationType
            //    Dimensions
            //    IsDimensionRequired
        }
    }

```

#### Read account-level metric values

The following example shows how to read `UsedCapacity` data at account level:

```csharp
    public static async Task ReadStorageMetricValue()
    {
        var resourceId = "<resource-ID>";
        var subscriptionId = "<subscription-ID>";
        var tenantId = "<tenant-ID>";
        var applicationId = "<application-ID>";
        var accessKey = "<AccessKey>";

        MonitorClient readOnlyClient = AuthenticateWithReadOnlyClient(tenantId, applicationId, accessKey, subscriptionId).Result;

        Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.Response Response;

        string startDate = DateTime.Now.AddHours(-3).ToUniversalTime().ToString("o");
        string endDate = DateTime.Now.ToUniversalTime().ToString("o");
        string timeSpan = startDate + "/" + endDate;

        Response = await readOnlyClient.Metrics.ListAsync(
            resourceUri: resourceId,
            timespan: timeSpan,
            interval: System.TimeSpan.FromHours(1),
            metricnames: "UsedCapacity",

            aggregation: "Average",
            resultType: ResultType.Data,
            cancellationToken: CancellationToken.None);

        foreach (var metric in Response.Value)
        {
            // Enumrate metric value
            //    Id
            //    Name
            //    Type
            //    Unit
            //    Timeseries
            //        - Data
            //        - Metadatavalues
        }
    }

```

#### Read multi-dimensional metric values

For multi-dimensional metrics, you need to define meta data filter if you want to read metric data on specific dimension value.

The following example shows how to read metric data on the metric supporting multi-dimension:

```csharp
    public static async Task ReadStorageMetricValueTest()
    {
        // Resource ID for blob storage
        var resourceId = "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}/blobServices/default";
        var subscriptionId = "<subscription-ID}";
        // How to identify Tenant ID, Application ID and Access Key: https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/
        var tenantId = "<tenant-ID>";
        var applicationId = "<application-ID>";
        var accessKey = "<AccessKey>";

        MonitorManagementClient readOnlyClient = AuthenticateWithReadOnlyClient(tenantId, applicationId, accessKey, subscriptionId).Result;

        Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.Response Response;

        string startDate = DateTime.Now.AddHours(-3).ToUniversalTime().ToString("o");
        string endDate = DateTime.Now.ToUniversalTime().ToString("o");
        string timeSpan = startDate + "/" + endDate;
        // It's applicable to define meta data filter when a metric support dimension
        // More conditions can be added with the 'or' and 'and' operators, example: BlobType eq 'BlockBlob' or BlobType eq 'PageBlob'
        ODataQuery<MetadataValue> odataFilterMetrics = new ODataQuery<MetadataValue>(
            string.Format("BlobType eq '{0}'", "BlockBlob"));

        Response = readOnlyClient.Metrics.List(
                        resourceUri: resourceId,
                        timespan: timeSpan,
                        interval: System.TimeSpan.FromHours(1),
                        metricnames: "BlobCapacity",
                        odataQuery: odataFilterMetrics,
                        aggregation: "Average",
                        resultType: ResultType.Data);

        foreach (var metric in Response.Value)
        {
            //Enumrate metric value
            //    Id
            //    Name
            //    Type
            //    Unit
            //    Timeseries
            //        - Data
            //        - Metadatavalues
        }
    }

```

## Analyzing log data

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Storage logs in Azure Monitor is in public preview, and is available for preview testing in all public cloud regions. To enroll in the preview, see [this page](https://www.microsoft.com).  This preview enables logs for blobs (including Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2), files, queues, tables, premium storage accounts in general-purpose v1 and general-purpose v2 storage accounts. Classic storage accounts are not supported.

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables. Azure Storage stores data in the following tables.

| Table | Description |
|:---|:---|
|StorageBlobLogs | Logs that describe activity in blob storage. |
|StorageFileLogs | Logs that describe activity in file shares. |
|StorageQueueLogs | Logs that describe activity in queues.|
|StorageTableLogs| Logs that describe activity in tables.|

See [Azure Storage monitoring data reference](monitor-storage-reference.md) for a detailed reference of the fields that appear in these logs.

### Azure Storage Log Analytics queries in Azure Monitor

Here are some queries that you can enter into the **Log search** search bar to help you monitor your Azure Storage accounts. These queries work with the [new language](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/log-query-overview).

Following are queries that you can use to help you monitor your Azure Storage accounts.

* To list 10 most common errors over the last 3 days.

    ```Kusto
    StorageBlobLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d) and StatusText !contains "Success"
    | summarize count() by StatusText
    | top 10 by count_ desc
    ```
* To list top 10 operations causing the most errors over the last 3 days.

    ```Kusto
    StorageBlobLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d) and StatusText !contains "Success"
    | summarize count() by OperationName
    | top 10 by count_ desc
    ```
* To list top 10 operations with the longest end to end latency over the last 3 days.

    ```Kusto
    StorageBlobLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d)
    | top 10 by DurationMs desc
    | project TimeGenerated, OperationName, DurationMs, ServerLatencyMs, ClientLatencyMs = DurationMs - ServerLatencyMs
    ```
* To list all operations causing server side throttling errors over the last 3 days.

    ```Kusto
    StorageBlobLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d) and StatusText contains "ServerBusy"
    | project TimeGenerated, OperationName, StatusCode, StatusText
    ```
* To list all requests with anonymous access over the last 3 days.

    ```Kusto
    StorageBlobLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d) and AuthenticationType == "Anonymous"
    | project TimeGenerated, OperationName, AuthenticationType, Uri
    ```
* To create a pie chart of operations used over the last 3 days.
    ```Kusto
    StorageBlobLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d)
    | summarize count() by OperationName
    | sort by count_ desc 
    | render piechart
    ```
