# Azure AD Domain Services - Contact Us
## Contact the product team
If you have issues with your managed domain, check to see if the steps outlined in the [Troubleshooting Guide](active-directory-ds-troubleshooting.md) resolve the issue. If you're still having trouble, feel free to contact us.

You may email us at: [Azure AD Domain Services Feedback](mailto:aaddsfb@microsoft.com).

Ensure that you include the following, so we can investigate the issue.

* The **tenant ID** for your Azure AD directory. The tenant ID is the GUID you notice in the browser's address bar when you navigate to the page from where you enable AAD Domain Services for your directory.
* The **DNS domain name** you've configured for your AAD Domain Services managed domain.

## Provide Feedback
We welcome your feedback about Azure AD Domain Services via the **[Azure Active Directory User Voice channel](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/169401-azure-active-directory/)**.

Ensure that you pre-pend your question or feedback with the words **'AADDS'**, for it to reach us.
