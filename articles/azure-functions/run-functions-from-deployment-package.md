# Run your functions from a package file in Azure

In Azure, you can run your functions directly from a deployment package file in your function app. The other option is to deploy your files in the `c:\home\site\wwwroot` (Windows) or `/home/site/wwwroot` (Linux) directory of your function app.

This article describes the benefits of running your functions from a package. It also shows how to enable this functionality in your function app.

## Benefits of running from a package file
  
There are several benefits to running functions from a package file:

+ Reduces the risk of file copy locking issues.
+ Can be deployed to a production app (with restart).
+ Verifies the files that are running in your app.
+ Improves the performance of [Azure Resource Manager deployments](functions-infrastructure-as-code.md).
+ Reduces cold-start times, particularly for JavaScript functions with large npm package trees.

For more information, see [this announcement](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/issues/84).

## Enable functions to run from a package

Function apps on the [Flex Consumption](./flex-consumption-plan.md) hosting plan run from a package by default. No special configuration needs to be done.

To enable your function app to run from a package on the [Consumption](./consumption-plan.md), [Elastic Premium](./functions-premium-plan.md), and [Dedicated (App Service)](./dedicated-plan.md) hosting plans, add a `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` app setting to your function app. The `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` app setting can have one of the following values:

| Value  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
| **`1`**  | Indicates that the function app runs from a local package file deployed in the `c:\home\data\SitePackages` (Windows) or `/home/data/SitePackages` (Linux) folder of your function app.  |
|**`<URL>`**  | Sets a URL that is the remote location of the specific package file you want to run. Required for functions apps running on Linux in a Consumption plan.  |

The following table indicates the recommended `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` values for deployment to a specific operating system and hosting plan:

| Hosting plan | Windows | Linux |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Consumption](consumption-plan.md) | `1` is highly recommended. | Only `<URL>` is supported. |
| [Premium](functions-premium-plan.md) | `1` is recommended. | `1` is recommended. |
| [Dedicated](dedicated-plan.md) | `1` is recommended. | `1` is recommended. |

## General considerations

+ Do not add the `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` app setting to apps on the [Flex Consumption](./flex-consumption-plan.md) plan.
+ The package file must be .zip formatted. Tar and gzip formats aren't supported.
+ [Zip deployment](#integration-with-zip-deployment) is recommended.
+ When deploying your function app to Windows, you should set `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` to `1` and publish with zip deployment.
+ When you run from a package, the `wwwroot` folder is read-only and you receive an error if you write files to this directory. Files are also read-only in the Azure portal.
+ The maximum size for a deployment package file is 1 GB.
  + The deployment uses temporary storage when unpacking your project files. This means that your function app must have enough available temporary storage space to hold the contents of your package. Keep in mind that the temporary storage limit for a Consumption plan is [500 MB per plan](functions-scale.md#service-limits). To learn about how to troubleshoot issues with temporary storage, see [How to troubleshoot temporary storage on Azure App Service](/troubleshoot/azure/app-service/temporary-storage-for-azure-app-service).
+ You can't use the local cache when running from a deployment package.
+ If your project needs to use remote build, don't use the `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` app setting. Instead, add the `SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=true` deployment customization app setting. For Linux, also add the `ENABLE_ORYX_BUILD=true` setting. For more information, see [Remote build](functions-deployment-technologies.md#remote-build).

> [!NOTE]
> The `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` app setting does not work with MSDeploy as described in [MSDeploy VS. ZipDeploy](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/MSDeploy-VS.-ZipDeploy). You will receive an error during deployment, such as `ARM-MSDeploy Deploy Failed`. To resolve this error, change `/MSDeploy` to `/ZipDeploy`.

### Add the WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE setting

[!INCLUDE [Function app settings](../../includes/functions-app-settings.md)]

### Creating the zip archive

[!INCLUDE [functions-deployment-zip-structure](../../includes/functions-deployment-zip-structure.md)]

## Use WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE = 1

This section provides information about how to run your function app from a local package file.

### Considerations for deploying from an on-site package

<a name="troubleshooting"></a>

+ Using an on-site package is the recommended option for running from the deployment package, except when running on Linux hosted in a Consumption plan.
+ [Zip deployment](#integration-with-zip-deployment) is the recommended way to upload a deployment package to your site.
+ When not using zip deployment, make sure the `c:\home\data\SitePackages` (Windows) or `/home/data/SitePackages` (Linux) folder has a file named `packagename.txt`. This file contains only the name, without any whitespace, of the package file in this folder that's currently running.

### Integration with zip deployment

Zip deployment is a feature of Azure App Service that lets you deploy your function app project to the `wwwroot` directory. The project is packaged as a .zip deployment file. The same APIs can be used to deploy your package to the `c:\home\data\SitePackages` (Windows) or `/home/data/SitePackages` (Linux) folder.

When you set the `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` app setting value to `1`, the zip deployment APIs copy your package to the `c:\home\data\SitePackages` (Windows) or `/home/data/SitePackages` (Linux) folder instead of extracting the files to `c:\home\site\wwwroot` (Windows) or `/home/site/wwwroot` (Linux). It also creates the `packagename.txt` file. After your function app is automatically restarted, the package is mounted to `wwwroot` as a read-only filesystem. For more information about zip deployment, see [Zip deployment for Azure Functions](deployment-zip-push.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When a deployment occurs, a restart of the function app is triggered. Function executions currently running during the deploy are terminated. For information about how to write stateless and defensive functions, sett [Write functions to be stateless](performance-reliability.md#write-functions-to-be-stateless).

## Use WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE = URL

This section provides information about how to run your function app from a package deployed to a URL endpoint. This option is the only one supported for running from a Linux-hosted package with a Consumption plan. This option is not supported in the [Flex Consumption](./flex-consumption-plan.md) plan.

### Considerations for deploying from a URL

+ Do not set `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE = <URL>` in apps on the [Flex Consumption](./flex-consumption-plan.md) plan. This option is not supported.
+ Function apps running on Windows experience a slight increase in [cold-start time](event-driven-scaling.md#cold-start) when the application package is deployed to a URL endpoint via `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE = <URL>`.
+ When you specify a URL, you must also [manually sync triggers](functions-deployment-technologies.md#trigger-syncing) after you publish an updated package.
+ The Functions runtime must have permissions to access the package URL.
+ Don't deploy your package to Azure Blob Storage as a public blob. Instead, use a private container with a [shared access signature (SAS)](../storage/common/storage-sas-overview.md) or [use a managed identity](#fetch-a-package-from-azure-blob-storage-using-a-managed-identity) to enable the Functions runtime to access the package.
+ You must maintain any SAS URLs used for deployment. When an SAS expires, the package can no longer be deployed. In this case, you must generate a new SAS and update the setting in your function app. You can eliminate this management burden by [using a managed identity](#fetch-a-package-from-azure-blob-storage-using-a-managed-identity).
+ When running on a Premium plan, make sure to [eliminate cold starts](functions-premium-plan.md#eliminate-cold-starts).
+ When you're running on a Dedicated plan, ensure you enable [Always On](dedicated-plan.md#always-on).
+ You can use [Azure Storage Explorer](../vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer.md) to upload package files to blob containers in your storage account.

### Manually uploading a package to Blob Storage

To deploy a zipped package when using the URL option, you must create a .zip compressed deployment package and upload it to the destination. The following procedure deploys to a container in Blob Storage:

1. Create a .zip package for your project using the utility of your choice.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for your storage account name or browse for it in the storage accounts list.

1. In the storage account, select **Containers** under **Data storage**.

1. Select **+ Container** to create a new Blob Storage container in your account.

1. In the **New container** page, provide a **Name** (for example, *deployments*), ensure the **Anonymous access level** is **Private**, and then select **Create**.

1. Select the container you created, select **Upload**, browse to the location of the .zip file you created with your project, and then select **Upload**.

1. After the upload completes, choose your uploaded blob file, and copy the URL. If you aren't [using a managed identity](#fetch-a-package-from-azure-blob-storage-using-a-managed-identity), you might need to generate a SAS URL.

1. Search for your function app or browse for it in the **Function App** page.

1. In your function app, expand **Settings**, and then select **Environment variables**.

1. In the **App settings** tab, select **+ Add**.

1. Enter the value `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` for the **Name**, and paste the URL of your package in Blob Storage for the **Value**.

1. Select **Apply**, and then select **Apply** and **Confirm** to save the setting and restart the function app.

Now you can run your function in Azure to verify that deployment of the deployment package .zip file was successful.
