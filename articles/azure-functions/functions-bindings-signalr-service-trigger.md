# SignalR Service trigger binding for Azure Functions

Use the *SignalR* trigger binding to respond to messages sent from Azure SignalR Service. When function is triggered, messages passed to the function is parsed as a json object.

In SignalR Service serverless mode, SignalR Service uses the [Upstream](../azure-signalr/concept-upstream.md) feature to send messages from client to Function App. And Function App uses SignalR Service trigger binding to handle these messages. The general architecture is shown below:

:::image type="content" source="media/functions-bindings-signalr-service/signalr-trigger.png" alt-text="SignalR Trigger Architecture":::

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-signalr-service.md).

## Example

[!INCLUDE [functions-in-process-model-retirement-note](../../includes/functions-in-process-model-retirement-note.md)]

# [Isolated worker model](#tab/isolated-process)

The following sample shows a C# function that receives a message event from clients and logs the message content.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/samples/Extensions/SignalR/SignalRTriggerFunctions.cs" id="snippet_on_message":::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Class based model of SignalR Service bindings in C# isolated worker doesn't optimize how you write SignalR triggers due to the limitation of C# worker model. For more information about class based model, see [Class based model](../azure-signalr/signalr-concept-serverless-development-config.md#class-based-model).

# [In-process model](#tab/in-process)

SignalR Service trigger binding for C# in-process model has two programming models. Class based model and traditional model. Class based model provides a consistent SignalR server-side programming experience. Traditional model provides more flexibility and is similar to other function bindings.

### With class-based model

See [Class based model](../azure-signalr/signalr-concept-serverless-development-config.md#class-based-model) for details.

```cs
public class HubName1 : ServerlessHub
{
    [FunctionName("SignalRTest")]
    public Task SendMessage([SignalRTrigger]InvocationContext invocationContext, string message, ILogger logger)
    {
        logger.LogInformation($"Receive {message} from {invocationContext.ConnectionId}.");
    }
}
```

### With a traditional model

Traditional model obeys the convention of Azure Function developed by C#. If you're not familiar with it, you can learn from [documents](./functions-dotnet-class-library.md).

```cs
[FunctionName("SignalRTest")]
public static Task Run([SignalRTrigger("SignalRTest", "messages", "SendMessage", parameterNames: new string[] {"message"})]InvocationContext invocationContext, string message, ILogger logger)
{
    logger.LogInformation($"Receive {message} from {invocationContext.ConnectionId}.");
}
```

Because it can be hard to use `ParameterNames` in the trigger, the following example shows you how to use the `SignalRParameter` attribute to define the `message` attribute.

```cs
[FunctionName("SignalRTest")]
public static Task Run([SignalRTrigger("SignalRTest", "messages", "SendMessage")]InvocationContext invocationContext, [SignalRParameter]string message, ILogger logger)
{
    logger.LogInformation($"Receive {message} from {invocationContext.ConnectionId}.");
}
```

## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library.md) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md) C# libraries use the `SignalRTrigger` attribute to define the function. C# script instead uses a [function.json configuration file](#configuration).

# [Isolated worker model](#tab/isolated-process)

The following table explains the properties of the `SignalRTrigger` attribute.

| Attribute property |Description|
|---------|----------------------|
|**HubName**| This value must be set to the name of the SignalR hub for the function to be triggered.|
|**Category**| This value must be set as the category of messages for the function to be triggered. The category can be one of the following values: <ul><li>**connections**: Including *connected* and *disconnected* events</li><li>**messages**: Including all other events except those in *connections* category</li></ul> |
|**Event**| This value must be set as the event of messages for the function to be triggered. For *messages* category, event is the *target* in [invocation message](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/master/src/SignalR/docs/specs/HubProtocol.md#invocation-message-encoding) that clients send. For *connections* category, only *connected* and *disconnected* is used. |
|**ParameterNames**| (Optional) A list of names that binds to the parameters. |
|**ConnectionStringSetting**| The name of the app setting or settings collection that contains the SignalR Service connection string, which defaults to `AzureSignalRConnectionString`. |

# [In-process model](#tab/in-process)

## Usage

### Managed identity-based connections

[!INCLUDE [functions-azure-signalr-authorization-note](../../includes/functions-azure-signalr-authorization-note.md)] 

### Payloads

The trigger input type is declared as either `InvocationContext` or a custom type. If you choose `InvocationContext`, you get full access to the request content. For a custom type, the runtime tries to parse the JSON request body to set the object properties.

### InvocationContext

`InvocationContext` contains all the content in the message sent from a SignalR service, which includes the following properties:

|Property | Description|
|------------------------------|------------|
|Arguments| Available for *messages* category. Contains *arguments* in [invocation message](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/master/src/SignalR/docs/specs/HubProtocol.md#invocation-message-encoding)|
|Error| Available for *disconnected* event. It can be Empty if the connection closed with no error, or it contains the error messages.|
|Hub| The hub name that the message belongs to.|
|Category| The category of the message.|
|Event| The event of the message.|
|ConnectionId| The connection ID of the client that sends the message.|
|UserId| The user identity of the client that sends the message.|
|Headers| The headers of the request.|
|Query| The query of the request when clients connect to the service.|
|Claims| The claims of the client.|

### Using `ParameterNames`

The property `ParameterNames` in `SignalRTrigger` lets you bind arguments of invocation messages to the parameters of functions. You can use the name you defined as part of [binding expressions](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-expressions-patterns.md) in other binding or as parameters in your code. That gives you a more convenient way to access arguments of `InvocationContext`.

Say you have a JavaScript SignalR client trying to invoke method `broadcast` in Azure Function with two arguments `message1`, `message2`.

```javascript
await connection.invoke("broadcast", message1, message2);
```

After you set `parameterNames`, the names you defined correspond to the arguments sent on the client side.

```cs
[SignalRTrigger(parameterNames: new string[] {"arg1, arg2"})]
```

Then, the `arg1` contains the content of `message1`, and `arg2` contains the content of `message2`.

### `ParameterNames` considerations

For the parameter binding, the order matters. If you're using `ParameterNames`, the order in `ParameterNames` matches the order of the arguments you invoke in the client. If you're using attribute `[SignalRParameter]` in C#, the order of arguments in Azure Function methods matches the order of arguments in clients.

`ParameterNames` and attribute `[SignalRParameter]` **cannot** be used at the same time, or you'll get an exception.

### SignalR Service integration

SignalR Service needs a URL to access Function App when you're using SignalR Service trigger binding. The URL should be configured in **Upstream Settings** on the SignalR Service side.

:::image type="content" source="../azure-signalr/media/concept-upstream/upstream-portal.png" alt-text="Upstream Portal":::

When using SignalR Service trigger, the URL can be simple and formatted as follows:

```http
<Function_App_URL>/runtime/webhooks/signalr?code=<API_KEY>
```

The `Function_App_URL` can be found on Function App's Overview page and the `API_KEY` is generated by Azure Function. You can get the `API_KEY` from `signalr_extension` in the **App keys** blade of Function App.
:::image type="content" source="media/functions-bindings-signalr-service/signalr-keys.png" alt-text="API key":::

If you want to use more than one Function App together with one SignalR Service, upstream can also support complex routing rules. Find more details at [Upstream settings](../azure-signalr/concept-upstream.md).

### Step-by-step sample

You can follow the sample in GitHub to deploy a chat room on Function App with SignalR Service trigger binding and upstream feature: [Bidirectional chat room sample](https://github.com/aspnet/AzureSignalR-samples/tree/master/samples/BidirectionChat)
