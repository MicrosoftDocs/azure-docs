# Azure CLI Samples

These end-to-end Azure CLI scripts are provided to help you learn how to provision and managing the Azure resources required by Azure Functions. You must use the [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md) to create actual Azure Functions code projects from the command line on your local computer and deploy code to these Azure resources. For a complete end-to-end example of developing and deploying from the command line using both Core Tools and the Azure CLI, see one of these language-specific command line quickstarts: 

+ [C#](how-to-create-function-azure-cli.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp)
+ [Java](how-to-create-function-azure-cli.md?pivots=programming-language-java)
+ [JavaScript](how-to-create-function-azure-cli.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript)
+ [PowerShell](how-to-create-function-azure-cli.md?pivots=programming-language-powershell)
+ [Python](how-to-create-function-azure-cli.md?pivots=programming-language-python)

The following table includes links to bash scripts that you can use to create and manage the Azure resources required by Azure Functions using the Azure CLI.
