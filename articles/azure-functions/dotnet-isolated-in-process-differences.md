#Customer intent: As a developer, I need to understand the differences between running in-process and running in an isolated worker process so that I can choose the best process model for my functions.

# Differences between the isolated worker model and the in-process model for .NET on Azure Functions

There are two execution models for .NET functions:

[!INCLUDE [functions-dotnet-execution-model](../../includes/functions-dotnet-execution-model.md)] 

[!INCLUDE [functions-in-process-model-retirement-note](../../includes/functions-in-process-model-retirement-note.md)]

This article describes the current state of the functional and behavioral differences between the two models. To migrate from the in-process model to the isolated worker model, see [Migrate .NET apps from the in-process model to the isolated worker model][migrate].

## Execution model comparison table 

Use the following table to compare feature and functional differences between the two models:

| Feature/behavior | Isolated worker model  |  In-process model<sup>3</sup> |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [Supported .NET versions](#supported-versions) | Long Term Support (LTS) versions,<br/>Standard Term Support (STS) versions,<br/>.NET Framework | Long Term Support (LTS) versions, ending with .NET 8 |

<sup>1</sup> When you need to interact with a service using parameters determined at runtime, using the corresponding service SDKs directly is recommended over using imperative bindings. The SDKs are less verbose, cover more scenarios, and have advantages for error handling and debugging purposes. This recommendation applies to both models.

<sup>2</sup> Cold start times could be additionally impacted on Windows when using some preview versions of .NET due to just-in-time loading of preview frameworks. This impact applies to both the in-process and out-of-process models but can be noticeable when comparing across different versions. This delay for preview versions isn't present on Linux plans.

<sup>3</sup> C# Script functions also run in-process and use the same libraries as in-process class library functions. For more information, see the [Azure Functions C# script (.csx) developer reference](functions-reference-csharp.md). 

<sup>4</sup> Service SDK types include types from the [Azure SDK for .NET](/dotnet/azure/sdk/azure-sdk-for-dotnet) such as [BlobClient](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.blobclient).

<sup>5</sup> ASP.NET Core types are not supported for .NET Framework.
