# Azure OpenAI assistant post input binding for Azure Functions

[!INCLUDE [preview-support](../../includes/functions-openai-support-limitations.md)]

The Azure OpenAI assistant post input binding lets you send prompts to assistant chat bots.

For information on setup and configuration details of the Azure OpenAI extension, see [Azure OpenAI extensions for Azure Functions](./functions-bindings-openai.md). To learn more about Azure OpenAI assistants, see [Azure OpenAI Assistants API](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/assistants).

## Attributes

Apply the `PostUserQuery` attribute to define an assistant post input binding, which supports these parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **Id** | The ID of the assistant to update. |
| **UserMessage** | Gets or sets the user message for the chat completion model, encoded as a string. |
| **AIConnectionName** |  _Optional_. Gets or sets the name of the configuration section for AI service connectivity settings. For Azure OpenAI: If specified, looks for "Endpoint" and "Key" values in this configuration section. If not specified or the section doesn't exist, falls back to environment variables: AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT and AZURE_OPENAI_KEY. For user-assigned managed identity authentication, this property is required. For OpenAI service (non-Azure), set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.|
| **ChatModel** |  _Optional_. Gets or sets the ID of the model to use as a string, with a default value of `gpt-3.5-turbo`. |
| **Temperature** | _Optional_. Gets or sets the sampling temperature to use, as a string between `0` and `2`. Higher values (`0.8`) make the output more random, while lower values like (`0.2`) make output more focused and deterministic. You should use either  `Temperature` or `TopP`, but not both. |
| **TopP** | _Optional_. Gets or sets an alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, as a string. In this sampling method, the model considers the results of the tokens with `top_p` probability mass. So `0.1` means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. You should use either  `Temperature` or `TopP`, but not both. |
| **MaxTokens** | _Optional_. Gets or sets the maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion, as a string with a default of `100`. The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` can't exceed the model's context length. Most models have a context length of 2,048 tokens (except for the newest models, which support 4096). |
| **IsReasoningModel** | _Optional_. Gets or sets a value indicating whether the chat completion model is a reasoning model. This option is experimental and associated with the reasoning model until all models have parity in the expected properties, with a default value of `false`.|

## Annotations

The `PostUserQuery` annotation enables you to define an assistant post input binding, which supports these parameters:

| **userMessage** | Gets or sets the user message for the chat completion model, encoded as a string. |
