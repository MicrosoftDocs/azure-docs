# Azure Functions warmup trigger

This article explains how to work with the warmup trigger in Azure Functions. A warmup trigger is invoked when an instance is added to scale a running function app. The warmup trigger lets you define a function that runs when a new instance of your function app is started. You can use a warmup trigger to preload custom dependencies so your functions are ready to start processing requests immediately. Some actions for a warmup trigger might include opening connections, loading dependencies, or running any other custom logic before your app begins receiving traffic.

The following considerations apply when using a warmup trigger:

* There can be only one warmup trigger function per function app, and it can't be invoked after the instance is already running.
* The name of the function that is the warmup trigger for your app should be `warmup` (case-insensitive). 
* The warmup trigger isn't available to apps running on the [Consumption plan](./consumption-plan.md).
* The warmup trigger isn't supported on version 1.x of the Functions runtime.  
* Support for the warmup trigger is provided by default in all development environments. You don't have to manually install the package or register the extension.
* The warmup trigger is only called during scale-out operations, not during restarts or other nonscaling startups. Make sure your logic can load all required dependencies without relying on the warmup trigger. Lazy loading is a good pattern to achieve this goal.
* Dependencies created by warmup trigger should be shared with other functions in your app. To learn more, see [Static clients](manage-connections.md#static-clients).
* If the [built-in authentication](../app-service/overview-authentication-authorization.md) (also known as Easy Auth) is used, [HTTPS Only](../app-service/configure-ssl-bindings.md#enforce-https) should be enabled for the warmup trigger to get invoked.

# [Model v4](#tab/nodejs-v4)

The following example shows a [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node.md) with a warmup trigger that runs on each new instance when added to your app:

:::code language="javascript" source="~/azure-functions-nodejs-v4/js/src/functions/warmupTrigger.js" :::

# [Model v3](#tab/nodejs-v3)

The following example shows a warmup trigger in a *function.json* file and a [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node.md) that runs on each new instance when added to your app.

Here's the *function.json* file:

```json
{
    "bindings": [
        {
            "type": "warmupTrigger",
            "direction": "in",
            "name": "warmupContext"
        }
    ]
}
```

The [configuration](#configuration) section explains these properties.

Here's the JavaScript code:

```JavaScript
module.exports = async function (warmupContext, context) {
    context.log('Function App instance is warm.');
};
```

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"  

The following example shows a warmup trigger in a *function.json* file and a [Python function](functions-reference-python.md) that runs on each new instance when it'is added to your app.

Your function must be named `warmup` (case-insensitive) and there can only be one warmup function per app.

Here's the *function.json* file:

```json
{
    "bindings": [
        {
            "type": "warmupTrigger",
            "direction": "in",
            "name": "warmupContext"
        }
    ]
}
```

For more information, see [Configuration](#configuration).

Here's the Python code:

```python
import logging
import azure.functions as func


def main(warmupContext: func.Context) -> None:
    logging.info('Function App instance is warm.')
```

## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library.md) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md) C# libraries use the `WarmupTrigger` attribute to define the function. C# script instead uses a [function.json configuration file](#configuration).

# [Isolated worker model](#tab/isolated-process)

Use the `WarmupTrigger` attribute to define the function. This attribute has no parameters.

# [In-process model](#tab/in-process)

Use the `WarmupTrigger` attribute to define the function. This attribute has no parameters.

## Annotations

Warmup triggers don't require annotations. Just use a name of `warmup` (case-insensitive) for the `FunctionName` annotation.

::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript,programming-language-typescript"  
## Configuration

# [Model v4](#tab/nodejs-v4)

- Your function-trigger must be named `warmupTrigger` (case-insensitive).
- There are no properties that need to be set on the `options` object passed to the `app.warmup()` method.

# [Model v3](#tab/nodejs-v3)

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file. 

|function.json property |Description|
|---------|----------------------|
| **type** | Required - must be set to `warmupTrigger`. |
| **direction** | Required - must be set to `in`. |
| **name** | Required - the variable name used in function code. A `name` of `warmupContext` is recommended for the binding parameter.|

## Usage

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"  
The following considerations apply to using a warmup function in C#:

# [Isolated worker model](#tab/isolated-process)

- Your function must be named `warmup` (case-insensitive) using the `Function` attribute.
- A return value attribute isn't required.
- Use the `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Warmup` package
- You can pass an object instance to the function.

# [In-process model](#tab/in-process)

- Your function must be named `warmup` (case-insensitive) using the `FunctionName` attribute.
- A return value attribute isn't required.
- You must be using version `3.0.5` of the `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions` package, or a later version. 
- You can pass a `WarmupContext` instance to the function.
