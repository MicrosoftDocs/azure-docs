# Quickstart: Set a durable functions app to use Azure Functions durable task scheduler (preview)

Write stateful functions in a serverless environment using durable functions, a feature of [Azure Functions](../../functions-overview.md). Scenarios where durable functions is useful include orchestrating microservices and workflows, stateful patterns like fan-out/fan-in, and long-running tasks.  

Durable functions supports several [storage providers](../durable-functions-storage-providers.md), also known as *backends*, for storing orchestration and entity runtime state. 

In this quickstart, you configure a durable functions app to use the [durable task scheduler](../durable-functions-storage-providers.md#dts) as the backend and deploy the app to Azure using **Visual Studio Code**. 

> [!NOTE]
>
> - To learn more about the benefit of using durable task scheduler, see [durable functions backend providers overview](../durable-functions-storage-providers.md).
>
> - Migrating [task hub data](../durable-functions-task-hubs.md) across backend providers currently isn't supported. Function apps that have existing runtime data need to start with a fresh, empty task hub after they switch to the durable task scheduler. Similarly, the task hub contents that are created by using the scheduler resource can't be preserved if you switch to a different backend provider.
>
> - Durable task scheduler currently only supports durable functions running on **Functions Premium** and **App Service** plans. 

## Prerequisites

This quickstart assumes you already have an Azure Functions project on your local computer with:
- Durable functions added to your project including:
  - An [orchestrator function](../durable-functions-bindings.md#orchestration-trigger). 
  - A [client function](../durable-functions-bindings.md#orchestration-client) that triggers the durable functions app.
- The project configured for local debugging.

If you don't meet these prerequisites, we recommend that you begin with one of the following quickstarts to set up a local Functions project:

::: zone pivot="csharp"  

- [Create a durable functions app - C#](../durable-functions-isolated-create-first-csharp.md)

::: zone-end 

::: zone pivot="other"  

- [Create a durable functions app - JavaScript](../quickstart-js-vscode.md)
- [Create a durable functions app - Python](../quickstart-python-vscode.md)
- [Create a durable functions app - PowerShell](../quickstart-powershell-vscode.md)
- [Create a durable functions app - Java](../quickstart-java.md)

::: zone-end 

You also need:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed to run the durable task scheduler emulator. 
- [Azurite](../../../storage/common/storage-use-azurite.md#run-azurite) installed.
- An [HTTP test tool](../../functions-develop-local.md#http-test-tools) that keeps your data secure.

## Add the durable task scheduler package

::: zone pivot="csharp" 

> [!NOTE] 
> The durable task scheduler extension requires **Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.DurableTask** version `1.2.2` or higher. 

Install the latest version of the [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.DurableTask.AzureManaged](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.DurableTask.AzureManaged) package by using the [dotnet add package](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) command:

   ```bash
   dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.DurableTask.AzureManaged --prerelease
   ```

::: zone-end 

::: zone pivot="other"  

In host.json, update the `extensionBundle` property to use the preview version that contains the durable task scheduler package:

```json
{
  "extensionBundle": {
    "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Preview",
    "version": "[4.29.0, 5.0.0)"
  }
}
```

::: zone-end 

## Update host.json

Update the host.json as follows to use durable task scheduler as the backend. 

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "durableTask": {
      "hubName": "%TASKHUB_NAME%",
      "storageProvider": {
        "type": "azureManaged",
        "connectionStringName": "DURABLE_TASK_SCHEDULER_CONNECTION_STRING"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configure local.settings.json 

Add connection information for local development:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "<DEPENDENT ON YOUR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE>",
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "DURABLE_TASK_SCHEDULER_CONNECTION_STRING": "Endpoint=http://localhost:8080;Authentication=None",
    "TASKHUB_NAME": "default"
  }
}
```

Get the durable task scheduler emulator port number in [the next step](#set-up-durable-task-scheduler-emulator). 

## Set up durable task scheduler emulator 

1. Pull the docker image containing the emulator. 

   ```bash
   docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dts/dts-emulator:v0.0.5
   ```

1. Run the emulator.

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 8082:8082 mcr.microsoft.com/dts/dts-emulator:v0.0.5
   ```
   
   The following output indicates the emulator started successfully.

     :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-durable-task-scheduler/emulator-started.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing emulator started successfully on terminal.":::

1. Make note of the ports exposed on Docker desktop. The scheduler exposes multiple ports for different purposes:  

   - `8080`: gRPC endpoint that allows an app to connect to the scheduler
   - `8082`: Endpoint for durable task scheduler dashboard

   :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-durable-task-scheduler/docker-ports.png" alt-text="Screenshot of ports on Docker.":::


## Test locally 

1. Go to the root directory of your app and start Azurite.

   ```bash
   azurite start
   ```

1. Run the application.

   ```bash
   func start
   ```

   You should see a list of the functions in your app. If you created your app following one of the durable functions quickstarts, you should see something similar to the following output:

   :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-durable-task-scheduler/function-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot of functions listed when running app locally.":::

1. Start an orchestration instance by sending an HTTP `POST` request to the URL endpoint using the [HTTP test tool](../../functions-develop-local.md#http-test-tools) you chose. 

1. Copy the URL value for `statusQueryGetUri` and paste it in your browser's address bar. You should see the status on the orchestration instance:

   ```json
     {
       "name": "DurableFunctionsOrchestrationCSharp1",
       "instanceId": "b50f8b723f2f44149ab9fd2e3790a0e8",
       "runtimeStatus": "Completed",
       "input": null,
       "customStatus": null,
       "output": [
         "Hello Tokyo!",
         "Hello Seattle!",
         "Hello London!"
       ],
       "createdTime": "2025-02-21T21:09:59Z",
       "lastUpdatedTime": "2025-02-21T21:10:00Z"
     }
   ```

1. To view more details about the orchestration instance, go to **http://localhost:8082/** access the durable task scheduler dashboard. 

1. Click on the *default* task hub to see its dashboard. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Learn more about the [durable task scheduler dashboard](./durable-task-scheduler-dashboard.md). 
>
> The [durable task scheduler emulator](./durable-task-scheduler.md#emulator-for-local-development) stores orchestration data in memory, which means all data is lost when it shuts down.

## Run your app in Azure 

### Create required resources

Create a durable task scheduler instance and Azure Functions app on Azure following the *Function app integrated creation flow*. This experience will automatically set up identity-based access and configure the required environment variables for the app to access the scheduler. 

[!INCLUDE [function-app-integrated-creation](./includes/function-app-integrated-creation.md)]

Resource deployment could take around 15 to 20 minutes. Once that is finished, you can deploy your app to Azure. 

### Deploy your function app to Azure

[!INCLUDE [functions-publish-project-vscode](../../../../includes/functions-deploy-project-vs-code.md)]

#### Apps on Functions Premium plan

If your app is running on the Functions Premium plan, turn on the *Runtime Scale Monitoring* setting after deployment to ensure your app autoscales based on load:

  ```azurecli
  az resource update -g <resource_group> -n <function_app_name>/config/web --set properties.functionsRuntimeScaleMonitoringEnabled=1 --resource-type Microsoft.Web/sites
  ```

## Test your function app 

Run the following command to get your function's URL: 
  
```azurecli
az functionapp function list --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name <FUNCTION_APP_NAME>  --query '[].{Function:name, URL:invokeUrlTemplate}' --output json
```

### Check orchestration status

Check the status of the orchestration instance and activity details on the durable task scheduler dashboard. Accessing the dashboard requires you to log in. 

[!INCLUDE [assign-dev-identity-role-based-access-control-portal](./includes/assign-dev-identity-role-based-access-control-portal.md)]

## Clean up resources

If you no longer need the resources that you created to complete the quickstart, to avoid related costs in your Azure subscription, [delete the resource group](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/delete-resource-group?tabs=azure-portal#delete-resource-group) and all related resources.
