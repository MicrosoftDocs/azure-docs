# HTTP API reference

The Durable Functions extension exposes a set of built-in HTTP APIs that can be used to perform management tasks on [orchestrations](durable-functions-types-features-overview.md#orchestrator-functions), [entities](durable-functions-types-features-overview.md#entity-functions), and [task hubs](durable-functions-task-hubs.md). These HTTP APIs are extensibility webhooks that are authorized by the Azure Functions host but handled directly by the Durable Functions extension.

The base URL for the APIs mentioned in this article is the same as the base URL for your function app. When developing locally using the [Azure Functions Core Tools](../functions-run-local.md), the base URL is typically `http://localhost:7071`. In the Azure Functions hosted service, the base URL is typically `https://{appName}.azurewebsites.net`. Custom hostnames are also supported if configured on your App Service app.

All HTTP APIs implemented by the extension require the following parameters. The data type of all parameters is `string`.

| Parameter        | Parameter Type  | Description |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **`taskHub`**    | Query string    | The name of the [task hub](durable-functions-task-hubs.md). If not specified, the current function app's task hub name is assumed. |
| **`connection`** | Query string    | The **name** of the connection app setting for the backend storage provider. If not specified, the default connection configuration for the function app is assumed. |
| **`systemKey`**  | Query string    | The authorization key required to invoke the API. |

`systemKey` is an authorization key autogenerated by the Azure Functions host. It specifically grants access to the Durable Task extension APIs and can be managed the same way as [other Azure Functions access keys](../security-concepts.md#function-access-keys). You can generate URLs that contain the correct `taskHub`, `connection`, and `systemKey` query string values using [orchestration client binding](durable-functions-bindings.md#orchestration-client) APIs, such as the `CreateCheckStatusResponse` and `CreateHttpManagementPayload` APIs in .NET, the `createCheckStatusResponse` and `createHttpManagementPayload` APIs in JavaScript, etc.

The next few sections cover the specific HTTP APIs supported by the extension and provide examples of how they can be used.

## Start orchestration

Starts executing a new instance of the specified orchestrator function.

### Request

For version 1.x of the Functions runtime, the request is formatted as follows (multiple lines are shown for clarity):

```http
POST /admin/extensions/DurableTaskExtension/orchestrators/{functionName}/{instanceId?}
     ?taskHub={taskHub}
     &connection={connectionName}
     &code={systemKey}
```

In version 2.x of the Functions runtime, the URL format has all the same parameters but with a slightly different prefix:

```http
POST /runtime/webhooks/durabletask/orchestrators/{functionName}/{instanceId?}
     ?taskHub={taskHub}
     &connection={connectionName}
     &code={systemKey}
```

Request parameters for this API include the default set mentioned previously as well as the following unique parameters:

| Field              | Parameter type  | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **`functionName`** | URL             | The name of the orchestrator function to start. |
| **`instanceId`**   | URL             | Optional parameter. The ID of the orchestration instance. If not specified, the orchestrator function will start with a random instance ID. |
| **`{content}`**    | Request content | Optional. The JSON-formatted orchestrator function input. |

### Response

Several possible status code values can be returned.

* **HTTP 202 (Accepted)**: The specified orchestrator function was scheduled to start running. The `Location` response header contains a URL for polling the orchestration status.
* **HTTP 400 (Bad request)**: The specified orchestrator function doesn't exist, the specified instance ID was not valid, or request content was not valid JSON.

The following is an example request that starts a `RestartVMs` orchestrator function and includes  JSON object payload:

```http
POST /runtime/webhooks/durabletask/orchestrators/RestartVMs?code=XXX
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 83

{
    "resourceGroup": "myRG",
    "subscriptionId": "aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e"
}
```

The response payload for the **HTTP 202** cases is a JSON object with the following fields:

| Field                       | Description                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **`id`**                    |The ID of the orchestration instance. |
| **`statusQueryGetUri`**     |The status URL of the orchestration instance. |
| **`sendEventPostUri`**      |The "raise event" URL of the orchestration instance. |
| **`terminatePostUri`**      |The "terminate" URL of the orchestration instance. |
| **`purgeHistoryDeleteUri`** |The "purge history" URL of the orchestration instance. |
| **`rewindPostUri`**         |(preview) The "rewind" URL of the orchestration instance. |
| **`suspendPostUri`**        |The "suspend" URL of the orchestration instance. |
| **`resumePostUri`**         |The "resume" URL of the orchestration instance. |

The data type of all fields is `string`.

Here is an example response payload for an orchestration instance with `abc123` as its ID (formatted for readability):

```http
{
    "id": "abc123",
    "purgeHistoryDeleteUri": "http://localhost:7071/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/abc123?code=XXX",
    "sendEventPostUri": "http://localhost:7071/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/abc123/raiseEvent/{eventName}?code=XXX",
    "statusQueryGetUri": "http://localhost:7071/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/abc123?code=XXX",
    "terminatePostUri": "http://localhost:7071/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/abc123/terminate?reason={text}&code=XXX",
    "suspendPostUri": "http://localhost:7071/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/abc123/suspend?reason={text}&code=XXX",
    "resumePostUri": "http://localhost:7071/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/abc123/resume?reason={text}&code=XXX"
}
```

The HTTP response is intended to be compatible with the *Polling Consumer Pattern*. It also includes the following notable response headers:

* **Location**: The URL of the status endpoint. This URL contains the same value as the `statusQueryGetUri` field.
* **Retry-After**: The number of seconds to wait between polling operations. The default value is `10`.

For more information on the asynchronous HTTP polling pattern, see the [HTTP async operation tracking](durable-functions-http-features.md#async-operation-tracking) documentation.

## Get instance status

Gets the status of a specified orchestration instance.

### Request

For version 1.x of the Functions runtime, the request is formatted as follows (multiple lines are shown for clarity):

```http
GET /admin/extensions/DurableTaskExtension/instances/{instanceId}
    ?taskHub={taskHub}
    &connection={connectionName}
    &code={systemKey}
    &showHistory=[true|false]
    &showHistoryOutput=[true|false]
    &showInput=[true|false]
    &returnInternalServerErrorOnFailure=[true|false]
```

In version 2.x of the Functions runtime, the URL format has all the same parameters but with a slightly different prefix:

```http
GET /runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/{instanceId}
    ?taskHub={taskHub}
    &connection={connectionName}
    &code={systemKey}
    &showHistory=[true|false]
    &showHistoryOutput=[true|false]
    &showInput=[true|false]
    &returnInternalServerErrorOnFailure=[true|false]
```

Request parameters for this API include the default set mentioned previously as well as the following unique parameters:

| Field                   | Parameter type  | Description |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **`instanceId`**        | URL             | The ID of the orchestration instance. |
| **`showInput`**         | Query string    | Optional parameter. If set to `false`, the function input will not be included in the response payload.|
| **`showHistory`**       | Query string    | Optional parameter. If set to `true`, the orchestration execution history will be included in the response payload.|
| **`showHistoryOutput`** | Query string    | Optional parameter. If set to `true`, the function outputs will be included in the orchestration execution history.|
| **`createdTimeFrom`**   | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of returned instances that were created at or after the given ISO8601 timestamp.|
| **`createdTimeTo`**     | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of returned instances that were created at or before the given ISO8601 timestamp.|
| **`runtimeStatus`**     | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of returned instances based on their runtime status. To see the list of possible runtime status values, see the [Querying instances](durable-functions-instance-management.md) article. |
| **`returnInternalServerErrorOnFailure`**  | Query string    | Optional parameter. If set to `true`, this API will return an HTTP 500 response instead of a 200 if the instance is in a failure state. This parameter is intended for automated status polling scenarios. |

### Response

Several possible status code values can be returned.

* **HTTP 200 (OK)**: The specified instance is in a completed or failed state.
* **HTTP 202 (Accepted)**: The specified instance is in progress.
* **HTTP 400 (Bad Request)**: The specified instance failed or was terminated.
* **HTTP 404 (Not Found)**: The specified instance doesn't exist or has not started running.
* **HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error)**: Returned only when the `returnInternalServerErrorOnFailure` is set to `true` and the specified instance failed with an unhandled exception.

The response payload for the **HTTP 200** and **HTTP 202** cases is a JSON object with the following fields:

| Field                 | Data type | Description |
|-----------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **`runtimeStatus`**   | string    | The runtime status of the instance. Values include *Running*, *Pending*, *Failed*, *Canceled*, *Terminated*, *Completed*, *Suspended*. |
| **`input`**           | JSON      | The JSON data used to initialize the instance. This field is `null` if the `showInput` query string parameter is set to `false`.|
| **`customStatus`**    | JSON      | The JSON data used for custom orchestration status. This field is `null` if not set. |
| **`output`**          | JSON      | The JSON output of the instance. This field is `null` if the instance is not in a completed state. |
| **`createdTime`**     | string    | The time at which the instance was created. Uses ISO 8601 extended notation. |
| **`lastUpdatedTime`** | string    | The time at which the instance last persisted. Uses ISO 8601 extended notation. |
| **`historyEvents`**   | JSON      | A JSON array containing the orchestration execution history. This field is `null` unless the `showHistory` query string parameter is set to `true`. |

Here is an example response payload including the orchestration execution history and activity outputs (formatted for readability):

```json
{
  "createdTime": "2018-02-28T05:18:49Z",
  "historyEvents": [
      {
          "EventType": "ExecutionStarted",
          "FunctionName": "E1_HelloSequence",
          "Timestamp": "2018-02-28T05:18:49.3452372Z"
      },
      {
          "EventType": "TaskCompleted",
          "FunctionName": "E1_SayHello",
          "Result": "Hello Tokyo!",
          "ScheduledTime": "2018-02-28T05:18:51.3939873Z",
          "Timestamp": "2018-02-28T05:18:52.2895622Z"
      },
      {
          "EventType": "TaskCompleted",
          "FunctionName": "E1_SayHello",
          "Result": "Hello Seattle!",
          "ScheduledTime": "2018-02-28T05:18:52.8755705Z",
          "Timestamp": "2018-02-28T05:18:53.1765771Z"
      },
      {
          "EventType": "TaskCompleted",
          "FunctionName": "E1_SayHello",
          "Result": "Hello London!",
          "ScheduledTime": "2018-02-28T05:18:53.5170791Z",
          "Timestamp": "2018-02-28T05:18:53.891081Z"
      },
      {
          "EventType": "ExecutionCompleted",
          "OrchestrationStatus": "Completed",
          "Result": [
              "Hello Tokyo!",
              "Hello Seattle!",
              "Hello London!"
          ],
          "Timestamp": "2018-02-28T05:18:54.3660895Z"
      }
  ],
  "input": null,
  "customStatus": { "nextActions": ["A", "B", "C"], "foo": 2 },
  "lastUpdatedTime": "2018-02-28T05:18:54Z",
  "output": [
      "Hello Tokyo!",
      "Hello Seattle!",
      "Hello London!"
  ],
  "runtimeStatus": "Completed"
}
```

The **HTTP 202** response also includes a **Location** response header that references the same URL as the `statusQueryGetUri` field mentioned previously.

## Get all instances status

You can also query the status of all instances by removing the `instanceId` from the 'Get instance status' request. In this case, the basic parameters are the same as the 'Get instance status'. Query string parameters for filtering are also supported.

### Request

For version 1.x of the Functions runtime, the request is formatted as follows (multiple lines are shown for clarity):

```http
GET /admin/extensions/DurableTaskExtension/instances
    ?taskHub={taskHub}
    &connection={connectionName}
    &code={systemKey}
    &createdTimeFrom={timestamp}
    &createdTimeTo={timestamp}
    &runtimeStatus={runtimeStatus1,runtimeStatus2,...}
    &instanceIdPrefix={prefix}
    &showInput=[true|false]
    &top={integer}
```

In version 2.x of the Functions runtime, the URL format has all the same parameters but with a slightly different prefix:

```http
GET /runtime/webhooks/durableTask/instances?
    taskHub={taskHub}
    &connection={connectionName}
    &code={systemKey}
    &createdTimeFrom={timestamp}
    &createdTimeTo={timestamp}
    &runtimeStatus={runtimeStatus1,runtimeStatus2,...}
    &instanceIdPrefix={prefix}
    &showInput=[true|false]
    &top={integer}
```

Request parameters for this API include the default set mentioned previously as well as the following unique parameters:

| Field                   | Parameter type  | Description |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **`showInput`**         | Query string    | Optional parameter. If set to `false`, the function input will not be included in the response payload.|
| **`showHistoryOutput`** | Query string    | Optional parameter. If set to `true`, the function outputs will be included in the orchestration execution history.|
| **`createdTimeFrom`**   | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of returned instances that were created at or after the given ISO8601 timestamp.|
| **`createdTimeTo`**     | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of returned instances that were created at or before the given ISO8601 timestamp.|
| **`runtimeStatus`**     | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of returned instances based on their runtime status. To see the list of possible runtime status values, see the [Querying instances](durable-functions-instance-management.md) article. |
| **`instanceIdPrefix`**  | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of returned instances to include only instances whose instance ID starts with the specified prefix string.  Available starting with [version 2.7.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask/2.7.2) of the extension. |
| **`top`**               | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, limits the number of instances returned by the query. |

### Response

Here is an example of response payloads including the orchestration status (formatted for readability):

```json
[
    {
        "instanceId": "7af46ff000564c65aafbfe99d07c32a5",
        "runtimeStatus": "Completed",
        "input": null,
        "customStatus": null,
        "output": [
            "Hello Tokyo!",
            "Hello Seattle!",
            "Hello London!"
        ],
        "createdTime": "2018-06-04T10:46:39Z",
        "lastUpdatedTime": "2018-06-04T10:46:47Z"
    },
    {
        "instanceId": "80eb7dd5c22f4eeba9f42b062794321e",
        "runtimeStatus": "Running",
        "input": null,
        "customStatus": null,
        "output": null,
        "createdTime": "2018-06-04T15:18:28Z",
        "lastUpdatedTime": "2018-06-04T15:18:38Z"
    },
    {
        "instanceId": "9124518926db408ab8dfe84822aba2b1",
        "runtimeStatus": "Completed",
        "input": null,
        "customStatus": null,
        "output": [
            "Hello Tokyo!",
            "Hello Seattle!",
            "Hello London!"
        ],
        "createdTime": "2018-06-04T10:46:54Z",
        "lastUpdatedTime": "2018-06-04T10:47:03Z"
    },
    {
        "instanceId": "d100b90b903c4009ba1a90868331b11b",
        "runtimeStatus": "Pending",
        "input": null,
        "customStatus": null,
        "output": null,
        "createdTime": "2018-06-04T15:18:39Z",
        "lastUpdatedTime": "2018-06-04T15:18:39Z"
    }
]
```

> [!NOTE]
> This operation can be very expensive in terms of Azure Storage I/O if you are using the [default Azure Storage provider](durable-functions-storage-providers.md#azure-storage) and if there are a lot of rows in the Instances table. More details on Instance table can be found in the [Azure Storage provider](durable-functions-azure-storage-provider.md#instances-table) documentation.

If more results exist, a continuation token is returned in the response header.  The name of the header is `x-ms-continuation-token`.

> [!CAUTION]
> The query result may return fewer items than the limit specified by `top`. When receiving results, you should therefore *always* check to see if there is a continuation token.

If you set continuation token value in the next request header, you can get the next page of results. This name of the request header is also `x-ms-continuation-token`.

## Purge single instance history

Deletes the history and related artifacts for a specified orchestration instance.

### Request

For version 1.x of the Functions runtime, the request is formatted as follows (multiple lines are shown for clarity):

```http
DELETE /admin/extensions/DurableTaskExtension/instances/{instanceId}
    ?taskHub={taskHub}
    &connection={connection}
    &code={systemKey}
```

In version 2.x of the Functions runtime, the URL format has all the same parameters but with a slightly different prefix:

```http
DELETE /runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/{instanceId}
    ?taskHub={taskHub}
    &connection={connection}
    &code={systemKey}
```

Request parameters for this API include the default set mentioned previously as well as the following unique parameters:

| Field             | Parameter type  | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **`instanceId`**  | URL             | The ID of the orchestration instance. |

### Response

The following HTTP status code values can be returned.

* **HTTP 200 (OK)**: The instance history has been purged successfully.
* **HTTP 404 (Not Found)**: The specified instance doesn't exist.

The response payload for the **HTTP 200** case is a JSON object with the following field:

| Field                  | Data type | Description |
|------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **`instancesDeleted`** | integer   | The number of instances deleted. For the single instance case, this value should always be `1`. |

Here is an example response payload (formatted for readability):

```json
{
    "instancesDeleted": 1
}
```

## Purge multiple instance histories

You can also delete the history and related artifacts for multiple instances within a task hub by removing the `{instanceId}` from the 'Purge single instance history' request. To selectively purge instance history, use the same filters described in the 'Get all instances status' request.

### Request

For version 1.x of the Functions runtime, the request is formatted as follows (multiple lines are shown for clarity):

```http
DELETE /admin/extensions/DurableTaskExtension/instances
    ?taskHub={taskHub}
    &connection={connectionName}
    &code={systemKey}
    &createdTimeFrom={timestamp}
    &createdTimeTo={timestamp}
    &runtimeStatus={runtimeStatus1,runtimeStatus2,...}
```

In version 2.x of the Functions runtime, the URL format has all the same parameters but with a slightly different prefix:

```http
DELETE /runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances
    ?taskHub={taskHub}
    &connection={connectionName}
    &code={systemKey}
    &createdTimeFrom={timestamp}
    &createdTimeTo={timestamp}
    &runtimeStatus={runtimeStatus1,runtimeStatus2,...}
```

Request parameters for this API include the default set mentioned previously as well as the following unique parameters:

| Field                 | Parameter type  | Description |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **`createdTimeFrom`** | Query string    | Filters the list of purged instances that were created at or after the given ISO8601 timestamp.|
| **`createdTimeTo`**   | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of purged instances that were created at or before the given ISO8601 timestamp.|
| **`runtimeStatus`**   | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of purged instances based on their runtime status. To see the list of possible runtime status values, see the [Querying instances](durable-functions-instance-management.md) article. |

> [!NOTE]
> This operation can be very expensive in terms of Azure Storage I/O if you are using the [default Azure Storage provider](durable-functions-storage-providers.md#azure-storage) and if there are many rows in the Instances and/or History tables. More details on these tables can be found in the [Performance and scale in Durable Functions (Azure Functions)](durable-functions-azure-storage-provider.md#instances-table) documentation.

### Response

The following HTTP status code values can be returned.

* **HTTP 200 (OK)**: The instance history has been purged successfully.
* **HTTP 404 (Not Found)**: No instances were found that match the filter expression.

The response payload for the **HTTP 200** case is a JSON object with the following field:

| Field                   | Data type | Description |
|-------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **`instancesDeleted`**  | integer   | The number of instances deleted. |

Here is an example response payload (formatted for readability):

```json
{
    "instancesDeleted": 250
}
```

## Raise event

Sends an event notification message to a running orchestration instance.

### Request

For version 1.x of the Functions runtime, the request is formatted as follows (multiple lines are shown for clarity):

```http
POST /admin/extensions/DurableTaskExtension/instances/{instanceId}/raiseEvent/{eventName}
    ?taskHub={taskHub}
    &connection={connectionName}
    &code={systemKey}
```

In version 2.x of the Functions runtime, the URL format has all the same parameters but with a slightly different prefix:

```http
POST /runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/{instanceId}/raiseEvent/{eventName}
    ?taskHub={taskHub}
    &connection={connectionName}
    &code={systemKey}
```

Request parameters for this API include the default set mentioned previously as well as the following unique parameters:

| Field             | Parameter type  | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **`instanceId`**  | URL             | The ID of the orchestration instance. |
| **`eventName`**   | URL             | The name of the event that the target orchestration instance is waiting on. |
| **`{content}`**   | Request content | The JSON-formatted event payload. |

### Response

Several possible status code values can be returned.

* **HTTP 202 (Accepted)**: The raised event was accepted for processing.
* **HTTP 400 (Bad request)**: The request content was not of type `application/json` or was not valid JSON.
* **HTTP 404 (Not Found)**: The specified instance was not found.
* **HTTP 410 (Gone)**: The specified instance has completed or failed and cannot process any raised events.

Here is an example request that sends the JSON string `"incr"` to an instance waiting for an event named **operation**:

```http
POST /admin/extensions/DurableTaskExtension/instances/bcf6fb5067b046fbb021b52ba7deae5a/raiseEvent/operation?taskHub=DurableFunctionsHub&connection=Storage&code=XXX
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 6

"incr"
```

The responses for this API do not contain any content.

## Terminate instance

Terminates a running orchestration instance.

### Request

The responses for this API do not contain any content.

## Signal entity

Sends a one-way operation message to a [Durable Entity](durable-functions-types-features-overview.md#entity-functions). If the entity doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> Durable entities are available starting in Durable Functions 2.0.

### Request

The HTTP request is formatted as follows (multiple lines are shown for clarity):

```http
POST /runtime/webhooks/durabletask/entities/{entityName}/{entityKey}
    ?taskHub={taskHub}
    &connection={connectionName}
    &code={systemKey}
    &op={operationName}
```

Request parameters for this API include the default set mentioned previously as well as the following unique parameters:

| Field             | Parameter type  | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **`entityName`**  | URL             | The name (type) of the entity. |
| **`entityKey`**   | URL             | The key (unique ID) of the entity. |
| **`op`**          | Query string    | Optional. The name of the user-defined operation to invoke. |
| **`{content}`**   | Request content | The JSON-formatted event payload. |

Here is an example request that sends a user-defined "Add" message to a `Counter` entity named `steps`. The content of the message is the value `5`. If the entity does not already exist, it will be created by this request:

```http
POST /runtime/webhooks/durabletask/entities/Counter/steps?op=Add
Content-Type: application/json

5
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default with [class-based entities in .NET](durable-functions-dotnet-entities.md#defining-entity-classes), specifying the `op` value of `delete` will delete the state of an entity. If the entity defines an operation named `delete`, however, that user-defined operation will be invoked instead.

### Response

This operation has several possible responses:

* **HTTP 202 (Accepted)**: The signal operation was accepted for asynchronous processing.
* **HTTP 400 (Bad request)**: The request content was not of type `application/json`, was not valid JSON, or had an invalid `entityKey` value.
* **HTTP 404 (Not Found)**: The specified `entityName` was not found.

A successful HTTP request does not contain any content in the response. A failed HTTP request may contain JSON-formatted error information in the response content.

## Get entity

Gets the state of the specified entity.

### Request

The HTTP request is formatted as follows (multiple lines are shown for clarity):

```http
GET /runtime/webhooks/durabletask/entities/{entityName}/{entityKey}
    ?taskHub={taskHub}
    &connection={connectionName}
    &code={systemKey}
```

### Response

This operation has two possible responses:

* **HTTP 200 (OK)**: The specified entity exists.
* **HTTP 404 (Not Found)**: The specified entity was not found.

A successful response contains the JSON-serialized state of the entity as its content.

### Example
The following example HTTP request gets the state of an existing `Counter` entity named `steps`:

```http
GET /runtime/webhooks/durabletask/entities/Counter/steps
```

If the `Counter` entity simply contained a number of steps saved in a `currentValue` field, the response content might look like the following (formatted for readability):

```json
{
    "currentValue": 5
}
```

## List entities

You can query for multiple entities by the entity name or by the last operation date.

### Request

The HTTP request is formatted as follows (multiple lines are shown for clarity):

```http
GET /runtime/webhooks/durabletask/entities/{entityName}
    ?taskHub={taskHub}
    &connection={connectionName}
    &code={systemKey}
    &lastOperationTimeFrom={timestamp}
    &lastOperationTimeTo={timestamp}
    &fetchState=[true|false]
    &top={integer}
```

Request parameters for this API include the default set mentioned previously as well as the following unique parameters:

| Field                       | Parameter type  | Description |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **`entityName`**            | URL             | Optional. When specified, filters the list of returned entities by their entity name (case-insensitive). |
| **`fetchState`**            | Query string    | Optional parameter. If set to `true`, the entity state will be included in the response payload. |
| **`lastOperationTimeFrom`** | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of returned entities that processed operations after the given ISO8601 timestamp. |
| **`lastOperationTimeTo`**   | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, filters the list of returned entities that processed operations  before the given ISO8601 timestamp. |
| **`top`**                   | Query string    | Optional parameter. When specified, limits the number of entities returned by the query. |


### Response

A successful HTTP 200 response contains a JSON-serialized array of entities and optionally the state of each entity.

By default the operation returns the first 100 entities that match the query criteria. The caller can specify a query string parameter value for `top` to return a different maximum number of results. If more results exist beyond what is returned, a continuation token is also returned in the response header. The name of the header is `x-ms-continuation-token`.

If you set continuation token value in the next request header, you can get the next page of results. This name of the request header is also `x-ms-continuation-token`.

### Example - list all entities

The following example HTTP request lists all entities in the task hub:

```http
GET /runtime/webhooks/durabletask/entities
```

The response JSON may look like the following (formatted for readability):

```json
[
    {
        "entityId": { "key": "cats", "name": "counter" },
        "lastOperationTime": "2019-12-18T21:45:44.6326361Z",
    },
    {
        "entityId": { "key": "dogs", "name": "counter" },
        "lastOperationTime": "2019-12-18T21:46:01.9477382Z"
    },
    {
        "entityId": { "key": "mice", "name": "counter" },
        "lastOperationTime": "2019-12-18T21:46:15.4626159Z"
    },
    {
        "entityId": { "key": "radio", "name": "device" },
        "lastOperationTime": "2019-12-18T21:46:18.2616154Z"
    },
]
```

### Example - filtering the list of entities

The following example HTTP request lists just the first two entities of type `counter` and also fetches their state:

```http
GET /runtime/webhooks/durabletask/entities/counter?top=2&fetchState=true
```

The response JSON may look like the following (formatted for readability):

```json
[
    {
        "entityId": { "key": "cats", "name": "counter" },
        "lastOperationTime": "2019-12-18T21:45:44.6326361Z",
        "state": { "value": 9 }
    },
    {
        "entityId": { "key": "dogs", "name": "counter" },
        "lastOperationTime": "2019-12-18T21:46:01.9477382Z",
        "state": { "value": 10 }
    }
]
```
