# Create your first containerized functions on Azure Container Apps 

In this article, you create a function app running in a Linux container and deploy it to an Azure Container Apps environment from a container registry. By deploying to Container Apps, you're able to integrate your function apps into cloud-native microservices. For more information, see [Azure Container Apps hosting of Azure Functions](functions-container-apps-hosting.md).

This article shows you how to create functions running in a Linux container and deploy the container to a Container Apps environment. 

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account, which you can minimize by [cleaning-up resources](#clean-up-resources) when you're done.

## Create supporting Azure resources for your function

Before you can deploy your container to Azure, you need to create three resources:

* A [resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md), which is a logical container for related resources.
* A [Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md), which is used to maintain state and other information about your functions.
* An Azure Container Apps environment with a Log Analytics workspace.
* A user-assigned managed identity, which enables your function app to securely connect to Azure resources without using shared secrets. Connections to both the Azure Storage account and to the Azure Container Registry instance are instead made using Microsoft Entra authentication with the identity, which is recommended for this scenario.

>[!NOTE]  
>Docker Hub doesn't support managed identities. 

Use these commands to create your required Azure resources: 

1. If necessary, sign in to Azure:

    The [`az login`](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command signs you into your Azure account. Use `az account set` when you have more than one subscription associated with your account.

1. Run the following command to update the Azure CLI to the latest version:
     
    ```azurecli
    az upgrade
    ```
   
    If your version of Azure CLI isn't the latest version, an installation begins. The manner of upgrade depends on your operating system. You can proceed after the upgrade is complete.

1. Run the following commands that upgrade the Azure Container Apps extension and register namespaces required by Container Apps:

    ```azurecli
    az extension add --name containerapp --upgrade -y
    az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Web 
    az provider register --namespace Microsoft.App 
    az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights 
    ```

1. Create a resource group named `AzureFunctionsContainers-rg`.

    
    ```azurecli
    az group create --name AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --location eastus
    ```
 
    This [`az group create`](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command creates a resource group in the East US region. If you instead want to use a region near you, using an available region code returned from the [az account list-locations](/cli/azure/account#az-account-list-locations) command. You must modify subsequent commands to use your custom region instead of `eastus`.

1. Create Azure Container App environment with workload profiles enabled.

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp env create --name MyContainerappEnvironment --enable-workload-profiles --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --location eastus
    ```
    This command can take a few minutes to complete.

1. Create a general-purpose storage account in your resource group and region, without shared key access.

    ```azurecli
    az storage account create --name <STORAGE_NAME> --location eastus --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --sku Standard_LRS --allow-blob-public-access false --allow-shared-key-access false
    ```

    The [`az storage account create`](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-create) command creates the storage account that can only be accessed by using Microsoft Entra-authenticated identities that have been granted permissions to specific resources. 

    In the previous example, replace `<STORAGE_NAME>` with a name that is appropriate to you and unique in Azure Storage. Storage names must contain 3 to 24 characters numbers and lowercase letters only. `Standard_LRS` specifies a general-purpose account [supported by Functions](storage-considerations.md#storage-account-requirements).

1. Create a managed identity and use the returned `principalId` to grant it both access to your storage account and pull permissions in your registry instance. 

    ```azurecli
    principalId=$(az identity create --name <USER_IDENTITY_NAME> --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --location eastus --query principalId -o tsv) 
    acrId=$(az acr show --name <REGISTRY_NAME> --query id --output tsv)
    az role assignment create --assignee-object-id $principalId --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal --role acrpull --scope $acrId
    storageId=$(az storage account show --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --name glengatestaca2 --query 'id' -o tsv)
    az role assignment create --assignee-object-id $principalId --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal --role "Storage Blob Data Owner" --scope $storageId
    ```

    The [`az identity create`](/cli/azure/identity#az-identity-create) command creates a user-assigned managed identity and the [`az role assignment create`](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create) commands adds your identity to the required roles. Replace `<REGISTRY_NAME>`, `<USER_IDENTITY_NAME>`, and `<STORAGE_NAME>` with the name your existing container registry, the name for your managed identity, and the storage account name, respectively. The managed identity can now be used by an app to access both the storage account and Azure Container Registry without using shared secrets.  
  
## Create and configure a function app on Azure with the image

A function app on Azure manages the execution of your functions in your Azure Container Apps environment. In this section, you use the Azure resources from the previous section to create a function app from an image in a container registry in a Container Apps environment. You also configure the new environment with a connection string to the required Azure Storage account.

Use the [`az functionapp create`](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command to create a function app in the new managed environment backed by Azure Container Apps. In [`az functionapp create`](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create), the `--environment` parameter specifies the Container Apps environment. 

### [Azure Container Registry](#tab/acr)

>[!TIP]  
> To make sure that your function app uses a managed identity-based connection to your registry instance, don't set the `--image` parameter in `az functionapp create`. When you set `--image` to the fully qualified name of your image in the repository, shared secret credentials are obtained from your registry and stored in app settings. 

First you must get the fully qualified ID value of your user-assigned managed identity with pull access to the registry, and then use the [`az functionapp create`](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command to create a function app using the default image and with this identity assigned to it. 

```azurecli
UAMI_RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity show --name $uami_name --resource-group $group --query id -o tsv)
az functionapp create --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --environment MyContainerappEnvironment --workload-profile-name "Consumption" --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --functions-version 4 --assign-identity $UAMI_RESOURCE_ID
```

In [`az functionapp create`](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create), the `--assign-identity` assigns your managed identity to the new app. Because you didn't set the `--image` parameter in `az functionapp create`, the application is created using a placeholder image. 

In this example, replace `<APP_NAME>`, `<STORAGE_NAME>`, and `<USER_IDENTITY_NAME>` with a name for your new function app as well as the name of your storage account and the identity. 

Finally, you must update the [`linuxFxVersion`](./functions-app-settings.md#linuxfxversion) site setting to the fully qualified name of your image in the repository. You must also update the [`acrUseManagedIdentityCreds`](./functions-app-settings.md#acrusemanagedidentitycreds) and  [`acrUserManagedIdentityID`](./functions-app-settings.md#acrusermanagedidentityid) site settings so that managed identities are used when obtaining the image from the registry.   

```azurecli
UAMI_RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity show --name <USER_IDENTITY_NAME> --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --query id -o tsv)
az resource patch --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --name <APP_NAME> --resource-type "Microsoft.Web/sites" --properties "{ \"siteConfig\": { \"linuxFxVersion\": \"DOCKER|<REGISTRY_NAME>.azurecr.io/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0\", \"acrUseManagedIdentityCreds\": true, \"acrUserManagedIdentityID\":\"$UAMI_RESOURCE_ID\", \"appSettings\": [{\"name\": \"DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_URL\", \"value\": \"<REGISTRY_NAME>.azurecr.io\"}]}}"
```

In addition to the required site settings, the [`az resource patch`](/cli/azure/resource#az-resource-patch) command also updates the [`DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_URL`](./functions-app-settings.md#docker_registry_server_url) app setting to the URL of your registry server.

In this example, replace `<APP_NAME>`, `<REGISTRY_NAME>`, and `<USER_IDENTITY_NAME>` with the names of your function app, container registry, and identity, respectively.  

### [Docker Hub](#tab/docker)

First you must get fully qualified ID value of your user-assigned managed identity, and then use the [`az functionapp create`](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command to create a function app using the default image and with this identity assigned to it.

```azurecli
az functionapp create --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --environment MyContainerappEnvironment --workload-profile-name "Consumption" --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --functions-version 4 --assign-identity --image <DOCKER_ID>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0  
```

In the [`az functionapp create`](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command, the `--environment` parameter specifies the Container Apps environment and the `--image` parameter specifies the image to use for the function app. In this example, replace `<STORAGE_NAME>` with the name you used in the previous section for the storage account. Also, replace `<APP_NAME>` with a globally unique name appropriate to you and `<DOCKER_ID>` with your public Docker Hub account ID. 

If you're using a private registry, you need to include the fully qualified domain name of your registry instead of just the Docker ID for `<DOCKER_ID>`, along with the `--registry-username` and `--registry-password` credential required to access the registry. 

---

Specifying `--workload-profile-name "Consumption"` creates your app in an environment using the default `Consumption` workload profile, which costs the same as running in a Container Apps Consumption plan. When you first create the function app, it pulls the initial image from your registry. 

## Update application settings

To enable the Functions host to connect to the default storage account using shared secrets, you must replace the `AzureWebJobsStorage` connection string setting with an equivalent setting that uses the user-assigned managed identity to connect to the storage account.

1. Remove the existing `AzureWebJobsStorage` connection string setting:

    ```azurecli    
    az functionapp config appsettings delete --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --setting-names AzureWebJobsStorage 
    ```

    The [az functionapp config appsettings delete](/cli/azure/functionapp/config/appsettings#az-functionapp-config-appsettings-delete) command removes this setting from your app. Replace `<APP_NAME>` with the name of your function app. 

1. Add equivalent settings, with an `AzureWebJobsStorage__` prefix, that define a user-assigned managed identity connection to the default storage account:
 
    ```azurecli
    clientId=$(az identity show --name <USER_IDENTITY_NAME> --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --query 'clientId' -o tsv)
    az functionapp config appsettings set --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --settings AzureWebJobsStorage__accountName=<STORAGE_NAME> AzureWebJobsStorage__credential=managedidentity AzureWebJobsStorage__clientId=$clientId
    ```
  
    In this example, replace `<APP_NAME>`, `<USER_IDENTITY_NAME>`, `<STORAGE_NAME>` with your function app name, the name of your identity, and the storage account name, respectively. 

At this point, your functions are running in a Container Apps environment, with the required application settings already added. When needed, you can add other settings in your functions app in the standard way for Functions. For more information, see [Use application settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings).

>[!TIP] 
> When you make subsequent changes to your function code, you need to rebuild the container, republish the image to the registry, and update the function app with the new image version. For more information, see [Update an image in the registry](functions-how-to-custom-container.md#update-an-image-in-the-registry)

## Clean up resources

If you want to continue working with Azure Function using the resources you created in this article, you can leave all those resources in place. 

When you're done working with this function app deployment, delete the `AzureFunctionsContainers-rg` resource group to clean up all the resources in that group:

```azurecli
az group delete --name AzureFunctionsContainers-rg
```
