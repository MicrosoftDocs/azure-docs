# Azure Functions pricing

Azure Functions has three kinds of pricing plans. Choose the one that best fits your needs:

- **Consumption plan**: Azure provides all of the necessary computational resources. You don't have to worry about resource management, and only pay for the time that your code runs.

- **Premium plan**: You specify a number of pre-warmed instances that are always online and ready to immediately respond. When your function runs, Azure provides any additional computational resources that are needed. You pay for the pre-warmed instances running continuously and any additional instances you use as Azure scales your app in and out.

- **App Service plan**: Run your functions just like your web apps. If you use App Service for your other applications, your functions can run on the same plan at no additional cost.

For more information about hosting plans, see [Azure Functions hosting plan comparison](functions-scale.md). Full pricing details are available on the [Functions Pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/).
