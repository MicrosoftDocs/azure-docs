# Apache Kafka output binding for Azure Functions

The output binding allows an Azure Functions app to write messages to a Kafka topic. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Kafka bindings are only available for Functions on the [Elastic Premium Plan](functions-premium-plan.md) and [Dedicated (App Service) plan](dedicated-plan.md). They are only supported on version 3.x and later version of the Functions runtime.

## Example
::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

The usage of the binding depends on the C# modality used in your function app, which can be one of the following:

# [Isolated worker model](#tab/isolated-process)

An [isolated worker process class library](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md) compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.   

# [In-process model](#tab/in-process)

[!INCLUDE [functions-in-process-model-retirement-note](../../includes/functions-in-process-model-retirement-note.md)]

An [in-process class library](functions-dotnet-class-library.md) is a compiled C# function runs in the same process as the Functions runtime.
 
---

The attributes you use depend on the specific event provider.

# [Confluent](#tab/confluent/in-process)

The following example shows a C# function that sends a single message to a Kafka topic, using data provided in HTTP GET request.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-functions-kafka-extension/samples/dotnet/Confluent/KafkaOutput.cs" range="12-32" :::

To send events in a batch, use an array of `KafkaEventData` objects, as shown in the following example:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-functions-kafka-extension/samples/dotnet/Confluent/KafkaOutputMany.cs" range="12-30" :::

The following function adds headers to the Kafka output data:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-functions-kafka-extension/samples/dotnet/Confluent/KafkaOutputWithHeaders.cs" range="11-31" :::

For a complete set of working .NET examples, see the [Kafka extension repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-kafka-extension/blob/dev/samples/dotnet/Confluent/). 

# [Event Hubs](#tab/event-hubs/in-process)

The following example shows a C# function that sends a single message to a Kafka topic, using data provided in HTTP GET request.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-functions-kafka-extension/samples/dotnet/EventHub/KafkaOutput.cs" range="11-31" :::

To send events in a batch, use an array of `KafkaEventData` objects, as shown in the following example:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-functions-kafka-extension/samples/dotnet/EventHub/KafkaOutputMany.cs" range="12-30" :::

The following function adds headers to the Kafka output data:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-functions-kafka-extension/samples/dotnet/EventHub/KafkaOutputWithHeaders.cs" range="11-31" :::

For a complete set of working .NET examples, see the [Kafka extension repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-kafka-extension/blob/dev/samples/dotnet/EventHub). 

# [Confluent](#tab/confluent/isolated-process)

The following example has a custom return type that is `MultipleOutputType`, which consists of an HTTP response and a Kafka output. 

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-functions-kafka-extension/samples/dotnet-isolated/confluent/KafkaOutput.cs" range="11-31" :::

In the class `MultipleOutputType`, `Kevent` is the output binding variable for the Kafka binding.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-functions-kafka-extension/samples/dotnet-isolated/confluent/KafkaOutput.cs" range="34-46" :::

To send a batch of events, pass a string array to the output type, as shown in the following example:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-functions-kafka-extension/samples/dotnet-isolated/confluent/KafkaOutputMany.cs" range="11-30" :::

The string array is defined as `Kevents` property on the class, on which the output binding is defined:  

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-functions-kafka-extension/samples/dotnet-isolated/confluent/KafkaOutputMany.cs" range="33-45" :::

The following function adds headers to the Kafka output data:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-functions-kafka-extension/samples/dotnet-isolated/Confluent/KafkaOutputWithHeaders.cs" range="11-31" :::

## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library.md) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md) C# libraries use the `Kafka` attribute to define the function trigger. 

The following table explains the properties you can set using this attribute:

| Parameter |Description|
| --- | --- |
| **BrokerList** | (Required) The list of Kafka brokers to which the output is sent. See [Connections](#connections) for more information. |
| **Topic** | (Required) The topic to which the output is sent. |
| **AvroSchema** | (Optional) Schema of a generic record when using the Avro protocol. |
| **MaxMessageBytes** | (Optional) The maximum size of the output message being sent (in MB), with a default value of `1`. |
| **BatchSize** | (Optional) Maximum number of messages batched in a single message set, with a default value of `10000`.  |
| **EnableIdempotence** | (Optional) When set to `true`, guarantees that messages are successfully produced exactly once and in the original produce order, with a default value of `false`|
| **MessageTimeoutMs** | (Optional) The local message timeout, in milliseconds. This value is only enforced locally and limits the time a produced message waits for successful delivery, with a default `300000`. A time of `0` is infinite. This value is the maximum time used to deliver a message (including retries). Delivery error occurs when either the retry count or the message timeout are exceeded. |
| **RequestTimeoutMs** | (Optional) The acknowledgment timeout of the output request, in milliseconds, with a default of `5000`. |
| **MaxRetries** | (Optional) The number of times to retry sending a failing Message, with a default of `2`. Retrying may cause reordering, unless `EnableIdempotence` is set to `true`.|
| **AuthenticationMode** | (Optional) The authentication  mode when using Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) authentication. The supported values are `Gssapi`, `Plain` (default), `ScramSha256`, `ScramSha512`. |
| **Username** | (Optional) The username for SASL authentication. Not supported when `AuthenticationMode` is `Gssapi`. See [Connections](#connections) for more information.| 
| **Password** | (Optional) The password for SASL authentication. Not supported when `AuthenticationMode` is `Gssapi`. See [Connections](#connections) for more information.| 
| **Protocol** | (Optional) The security protocol used when communicating with brokers. The supported values are `plaintext` (default), `ssl`, `sasl_plaintext`, `sasl_ssl`. |
| **SslCaLocation** | (Optional) Path to CA certificate file for verifying the broker's certificate. |
| **SslCertificateLocation** | (Optional) Path to the client's certificate. |
| **SslKeyLocation** | (Optional) Path to client's private key (PEM) used for authentication. |
| **SslKeyPassword** | (Optional) Password for client's certificate. |

## Annotations

The `KafkaOutput` annotation allows you to create a function that writes to a specific topic. Supported options include the following elements:

|Element | Description|
|---------|----------------------|
|**name** | The name of the variable that represents the brokered data in function code. |
| **brokerList** | (Required) The list of Kafka brokers to which the output is sent. See [Connections](#connections) for more information. |
| **topic** | (Required) The topic to which the output is sent. |
| **dataType** | Defines how Functions handles the parameter value. By default, the value is obtained as a string and Functions tries to  deserialize the string to actual plain-old Java object (POJO). When `string`, the input is treated as just a string. When `binary`, the message is received as binary data, and Functions tries to deserialize it to an actual parameter type byte[]. | 
| **avroSchema** | (Optional) Schema of a generic record when using the Avro protocol. ([Currently not supported for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-java-library/issues/198).) |
| **maxMessageBytes** | (Optional) The maximum size of the output message being sent (in MB), with a default value of `1`. |
| **batchSize** | (Optional) Maximum number of messages batched in a single message set, with a default value of `10000`.  |
| **enableIdempotence** | (Optional) When set to `true`, guarantees that messages are successfully produced exactly once and in the original produce order, with a default value of `false`|
| **messageTimeoutMs** | (Optional) The local message timeout, in milliseconds. This value is only enforced locally and limits the time a produced message waits for successful delivery, with a default `300000`. A time of `0` is infinite. This is the maximum time used to deliver a message (including retries). Delivery error occurs when either the retry count or the message timeout are exceeded. |
| **requestTimeoutMs** | (Optional) The acknowledgment timeout of the output request, in milliseconds, with a default of `5000`. |
| **maxRetries** | (Optional) The number of times to retry sending a failing Message, with a default of `2`. Retrying may cause reordering, unless `EnableIdempotence` is set to `true`.|
| **authenticationMode** | (Optional) The authentication  mode when using Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) authentication. The supported values are `Gssapi`, `Plain` (default), `ScramSha256`, `ScramSha512`. |
| **username** | (Optional) The username for SASL authentication. Not supported when `AuthenticationMode` is `Gssapi`. See [Connections](#connections) for more information.| 
| **password** | (Optional) The password for SASL authentication. Not supported when `AuthenticationMode` is `Gssapi`. See [Connections](#connections) for more information.| 
| **protocol** | (Optional) The security protocol used when communicating with brokers. The supported values are `plaintext` (default), `ssl`, `sasl_plaintext`, `sasl_ssl`. |

## Usage

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
Both keys and values types are supported with built-in [Avro](http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/) and [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) serialization.

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript,programming-language-python,programming-language-powershell"
The offset, partition, and timestamp for the event are generated at runtime. Only value and headers can be set inside the function. Topic is set in the function.json.
::: zone-end

Please make sure to have access to the Kafka topic to which you are trying to write. You configure the binding with access and connection credentials to the Kafka topic. 

In a Premium plan, you must enable runtime scale monitoring for the Kafka output to be able to scale out to multiple instances. To learn more, see [Enable runtime scaling](functions-bindings-kafka.md#enable-runtime-scaling).

For a complete set of supported host.json settings for the Kafka trigger, see [host.json settings](functions-bindings-kafka.md#hostjson-settings).
