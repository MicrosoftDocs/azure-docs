# Azure Tables bindings for Azure Functions

Azure Functions integrates with [Azure Tables](/azure/cosmos-db/table/introduction) via [triggers and bindings](./functions-triggers-bindings.md). Integrating with Azure Tables allows you to build functions that read and write data using [Azure Cosmos DB for Table](/azure/cosmos-db/table/introduction) and [Azure Table Storage](../storage/tables/table-storage-overview.md).

| Action | Type |
|---------|---------|
| Read table data in a function | [Input binding](./functions-bindings-storage-table-input.md) |
| Allow a function to write table data |[Output binding](./functions-bindings-storage-table-output.md) |

## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app: 

# [Isolated worker model](#tab/isolated-process)

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md).

# [In-process model](#tab/in-process)

[!INCLUDE [functions-in-process-model-retirement-note](../../includes/functions-in-process-model-retirement-note.md)]

Functions execute in the same process as the Functions host. To learn more, see [Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library.md).

In a variation of this model, Functions can be run using [C# scripting], which is supported primarily for C# portal editing. To update existing binding extensions for C# script apps running in the portal without having to republish your function app, see [Update your extensions].

---

The process for installing the extension varies depending on the extension version:

<a name="storage-extension"></a>
<a name="table-api-extension"></a>

# [Azure Tables extension](#tab/table-api/in-process)

_This section describes using a [class library](./functions-dotnet-class-library.md). For [C# scripting], you would need to instead [install the extension bundle][Update your extensions], version 4.x._

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-supports-identity-connections-note](../../includes/functions-bindings-supports-identity-connections-note.md)]

This version allows you to bind to types from [`Azure.Data.Tables`][Azure.Data.Tables]. It also introduces the ability to use Azure Cosmos DB for Table.

This extension is available by installing the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Tables NuGet package][table-api-package] into a project using version 5.x or higher of the extensions for [blobs](./functions-bindings-storage-blob.md?tabs=in-process%2Cextensionv5) and [queues](./functions-bindings-storage-queue.md?tabs=in-process%2Cextensionv5).

Using the .NET CLI:

```dotnetcli
# Install the Azure Tables extension
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Tables

# Update the combined Azure Storage extension (to a version which no longer includes Azure Tables)
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage
``` 

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-storage-extension-v5-tables-note](../../includes/functions-bindings-storage-extension-v5-tables-note.md)]

# [Combined Azure Storage extension](#tab/storage-extension/in-process)

_This section describes using a [class library](./functions-dotnet-class-library.md). For [C# scripting], you would need to instead [install the extension bundle][Update your extensions], version 2.x._

Working with the bindings requires that you reference the appropriate NuGet package. Tables are included in a combined package for Azure Storage. Install the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage NuGet package][storage-4.x], version 3.x or 4.x. 

> [!NOTE]
> Tables have been moved out of this package starting in its 5.x version. You need to instead use version 4.x of the extension NuGet package or additionally include the [Azure Tables extension](#table-api-extension) when using version 5.x.

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functionsv1/in-process)

[!INCLUDE [functions-runtime-1x-retirement-note](../../includes/functions-runtime-1x-retirement-note.md)]

Functions 1.x apps automatically have a reference the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs) NuGet package, version 2.x.

[!INCLUDE [functions-storage-sdk-version](../../includes/functions-storage-sdk-version.md)]

# [Azure Tables extension](#tab/table-api/isolated-process)

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-supports-identity-connections-note](../../includes/functions-bindings-supports-identity-connections-note.md)]

This version allows you to bind to types from [`Azure.Data.Tables`](/dotnet/api/azure.data.tables). It also introduces the ability to use Azure Cosmos DB for Table.

This extension is available by installing the [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables) into a project using version 5.x or higher of the extensions for [blobs](./functions-bindings-storage-blob.md?tabs=isolated-process%2Cextensionv5) and [queues](./functions-bindings-storage-queue.md?tabs=isolated-process%2Cextensionv5).

Using the .NET CLI:

```dotnetcli
# Install the Azure Tables extension
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables --version 1.0.0

# Update the combined Azure Storage extension (to a version which no longer includes Azure Tables)
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage --version 5.0.0
``` 

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-storage-extension-v5-isolated-worker-tables-note](../../includes/functions-bindings-storage-extension-v5-isolated-worker-tables-note.md)]

If you're writing your application using F#, you must also configure this extension as part of the app's [startup configuration](./dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md#start-up-and-configuration). In the call to `ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults()` or `ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication()`, add a delegate that takes an `IFunctionsWorkerApplication` parameter. Then within the body of that delegate, call `ConfigureTablesExtension()` on the object:

```fsharp
let hostBuilder = new HostBuilder()
hostBuilder.ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults(fun (context: HostBuilderContext) (appBuilder: IFunctionsWorkerApplicationBuilder) ->
    appBuilder.ConfigureTablesExtension() |> ignore
) |> ignore
```

# [Combined Azure Storage extension](#tab/storage-extension/isolated-process)

Tables are included in a combined package for Azure Storage. Install the [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage/4.0.4), version 4.x. 

> [!NOTE]
> Tables have been moved out of this package starting in its 5.x version. You need to instead use version 4.x of the extension NuGet package or additionally include the [Azure Tables extension](#table-api-extension) when using version 5.x.

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functionsv1/isolated-process)

Functions version 1.x doesn't support isolated worker process.

## Install bundle

The Azure Tables bindings are part of an [extension bundle], which is specified in your host.json project file. You may need to modify this bundle to change the version of the bindings, or if bundles aren't already installed. To learn more, see [extension bundle].

# [Bundle v3.x](#tab/extensionv3)

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-supports-identity-connections-note](../../includes/functions-bindings-supports-identity-connections-note.md)]

You can add this version of the extension from the extension bundle v3 by adding or replacing the following code in your `host.json` file:

[!INCLUDE [functions-extension-bundles-json-v3](../../includes/functions-extension-bundles-json-v3.md)]

# [Bundle v2.x](#tab/extensionv2)

You can install this version of the extension in your function app by registering the [extension bundle], version 2.x.

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functions1)

Functions 1.x apps automatically have a reference to the extension.

## Binding types

The binding types supported for .NET depend on both the extension version and C# execution mode, which can be one of the following: 
   
# [Isolated worker model](#tab/isolated-process)

An isolated worker process class library compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.  

# [In-process model](#tab/in-process)

An in-process class library is a compiled C# function runs in the same process as the Functions runtime.

Choose a version to see binding type details for the mode and version.

# [Azure Tables extension](#tab/table-api/in-process)

The Azure Tables extension supports parameter types according to the table below.

| Binding scenario | Parameter types |
|-|-|
| Table input (single entity) | A type deriving from [ITableEntity] |
| Table input (multiple entities from query) | `IEnumerable<T>` where `T` derives from [ITableEntity]<br/>[TableClient] |
| Table output (single entity) | A type deriving from [ITableEntity] |
| Table output (multiple entities) | [TableClient]<br/>`ICollector<T>` or `IAsyncCollector<T>` where `T` implements `ITableEntity` |

# [Combined Azure Storage extension](#tab/storage-extension/in-process)

Earlier versions of the extension exposed types from the now deprecated [Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Table] namespace. Newer types from [Azure.Data.Tables] are exclusive to the **Azure Tables extension**.

This version of the extension supports parameter types according to the table below.

| Binding scenario | Parameter types |
|-|-|
| Table input | A plain old CLR object (POCO) representing the entity<br/>[CloudTable] |
| Table output | A plain old CLR object (POCO) representing the entity<br/>[CloudTable] |

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functionsv1/in-process)

Functions 1.x exposed types from the deprecated [Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Table] namespace. Newer types from [Azure.Data.Tables] are exclusive to the **Azure Tables extension**. To use these, you will need to [upgrade your application to Functions 4.x].

# [Azure Tables extension](#tab/table-api/isolated-process)

The isolated worker process supports parameter types according to the tables below. Support for binding to types from [Azure.Data.Tables] is in preview.

**Azure Tables input binding**

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-table-input-dotnet-isolated-types](../../includes/functions-bindings-table-input-dotnet-isolated-types.md)]

**Azure Tables output binding**

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-table-output-dotnet-isolated-types](../../includes/functions-bindings-table-output-dotnet-isolated-types.md)]

# [Combined Azure Storage extension](#tab/storage-extension/isolated-process)

Earlier versions of extensions in the isolated worker process only support binding to plain-old CLR object (POCO) types. Additional options are available to the **Azure Tables extension**.

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functionsv1/isolated-process)

Functions version 1.x doesn't support isolated worker process. To use the isolated worker model, [upgrade your application to Functions 4.x].
