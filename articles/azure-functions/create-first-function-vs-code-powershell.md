# Quickstart: Create a PowerShell function in Azure using Visual Studio Code

[!INCLUDE [functions-language-selector-quickstart-vs-code](../../includes/functions-language-selector-quickstart-vs-code.md)]

In this article, you use Visual Studio Code to create a PowerShell function that responds to HTTP requests. After testing the code locally, you deploy it to the serverless environment of Azure Functions.

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

There's also a [CLI-based version](create-first-function-cli-powershell.md) of this article.

## Configure your environment

Before you get started, make sure you have the following requirements in place:

[!INCLUDE [functions-requirements-visual-studio-code-powershell](../../includes/functions-requirements-visual-studio-code-powershell.md)]

## <a name="create-an-azure-functions-project"></a>Create your local project

In this section, you use Visual Studio Code to create a local Azure Functions project in PowerShell. Later in this article, you'll publish your function code to Azure.

1. Choose the Azure icon in the Activity bar. Then in the **Workspace (local)** area, select the **+** button, choose **Create Function** in the dropdown. When prompted, choose **Create new project**.

1. Choose the directory location for your project workspace and choose **Select**. You should either create a new folder or choose an empty folder for the project workspace. Don't choose a project folder that is already part of a workspace.

1. Provide the following information at the prompts:

    |Prompt|Selection|
    |--|--|
    |**Select a language for your function project**|Choose `PowerShell`.|
    |**Select a template for your project's first function**|Choose `HTTP trigger`.|
    |**Provide a function name**|Type `HttpExample`.|
    |**Authorization level**|Choose `Anonymous`, which enables anyone to call your function endpoint. To learn about authorization level, see [Authorization keys](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger.md#authorization-keys).|
    |**Select how you would like to open your project**|Choose `Open in current window`.|

    Using this information, Visual Studio Code generates an Azure Functions project with an HTTP trigger. You can view the local project files in the Explorer. To learn more about files that are created, see [Generated project files](functions-develop-vs-code.md?tabs=powershell#generated-project-files). 

[!INCLUDE [functions-run-function-test-local-vs-code](../../includes/functions-run-function-test-local-vs-code.md)]

After you've verified that the function runs correctly on your local computer, it's time to use Visual Studio Code to publish the project directly to Azure. 

[!INCLUDE [functions-sign-in-vs-code](../../includes/functions-sign-in-vs-code.md)]

[!INCLUDE [functions-publish-project-vscode](../../includes/functions-publish-project-vscode.md)]

[!INCLUDE [functions-vs-code-run-remote](../../includes/functions-vs-code-run-remote.md)]

[!INCLUDE [functions-cleanup-resources-vs-code.md](../../includes/functions-cleanup-resources-vs-code.md)]

## Next steps

You have used [Visual Studio Code](functions-develop-vs-code.md?tabs=powershell) to create a function app with a simple HTTP-triggered function. In the next article, you expand that function by connecting to Azure Storage. To learn more about connecting to other Azure services, see [Add bindings to an existing function in Azure Functions](add-bindings-existing-function.md?tabs=powershell).
