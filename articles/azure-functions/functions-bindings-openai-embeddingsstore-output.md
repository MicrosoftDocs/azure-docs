# Azure OpenAI embeddings store output binding for Azure Functions

[!INCLUDE [preview-support](../../includes/functions-openai-support-limitations.md)]

The Azure OpenAI embeddings store output binding allows you to write files to a semantic document store that can be referenced later in a semantic search.

For information on setup and configuration details of the Azure OpenAI extension, see [Azure OpenAI extensions for Azure Functions](./functions-bindings-openai.md). To learn more about semantic ranking in Azure AI Search, see [Semantic ranking in Azure AI Search](/azure/search/semantic-search-overview).

## Attributes

Apply the `EmbeddingsStoreOutput` attribute to define an embeddings store output binding, which supports these parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **Input** | The input string for which to generate embeddings. |
| **Model** | _Optional_. The ID of the model to use, which defaults to `text-embedding-ada-002`. You shouldn't change the model for an existing database. For more information, see [Usage](#usage). |
| **MaxChunkLength** | _Optional_. The maximum number of characters used for chunking the input. For more information, see [Usage](#usage).|
| **MaxOverlap** | _Optional_. Gets or sets the maximum number of characters to overlap between chunks.|
| **InputType** | _Optional_. Gets the type of the input. |
| **ConnectionName** | The name of an app setting or environment variable that contains the connection string value. This property supports binding expressions. |
| **Collection** | The name of the collection or table or index to search. This property supports binding expressions.|

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"
## Annotations

The `EmbeddingsStoreOutput` annotation enables you to define an embeddings store output binding, which supports these parameters: 

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **name** | Gets or sets the name of the output binding. |
| **input** | The input string for which to generate embeddings. |
| **model** | _Optional_. The ID of the model to use, which defaults to `text-embedding-ada-002`. You shouldn't change the model for an existing database. For more information, see [Usage](#usage). |
| **maxChunkLength** | _Optional_. The maximum number of characters used for chunking the input. For more information, see [Usage](#usage).|
| **maxOverlap** | _Optional_. Gets or sets the maximum number of characters to overlap between chunks.|
| **inputType** |  _Optional_. Gets the type of the input. |
| **connectionName** | The name of an app setting or environment variable that contains the connection string value. This property supports binding expressions. |
| **collection** | The name of the collection or table or index to search. This property supports binding expressions.|

## Decorators
<!--- Replace with typed decorator when available.-->
During the preview, define the output binding as a `generic_output_binding` binding of type `semanticSearch`, which supports these parameters:

|Parameter | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **arg_name** | The name of the variable that represents the binding parameter. |
| **input** | The input string for which to generate embeddings. |
| **model** | _Optional_. The ID of the model to use, which defaults to `text-embedding-ada-002`. You shouldn't change the model for an existing database. For more information, see [Usage](#usage). |
| **maxChunkLength** | _Optional_. The maximum number of characters used for chunking the input. For more information, see [Usage](#usage).|
| **max_overlap** | _Optional_. Gets or sets the maximum number of characters to overlap between chunks.|
| **input_type** | Gets the type of the input. |
| **connection_name** | The name of an app setting or environment variable that contains the connection string value. This property supports binding expressions. |
| **collection** | The name of the collection or table or index to search. This property supports binding expressions.|
