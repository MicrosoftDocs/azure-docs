This set of articles explains how to work with Azure Functions bindings for IoT Hub. The IoT Hub support is based on the [Azure Event Hubs Binding](functions-bindings-event-hubs.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While the following code samples use the Event Hub API, the given syntax is applicable for IoT Hub functions.

| Action | Type |
|--------|------|
| Respond to events sent to an IoT hub event stream. | [Trigger](./functions-bindings-event-iot-trigger.md) |
