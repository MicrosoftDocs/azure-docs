# Stage 1: Discover workloads to migrate from AWS Lambda to Azure Functions

In this stage, you conduct a detailed discovery process to evaluate existing AWS Lambda workloads, including their configuration, dependencies, and usage patterns. The goal is to understand which AWS features and services your workload relies on.

## Evaluate your current workload

Compile a comprehensive inventory of your AWS Lambda functions by using familiar AWS tooling like service-specific SDKs, APIs, and CloudTrail to assess the workloads on AWS. You should understand the following key aspects of your inventory.

### Use cases

- Identify the primary business or technical purposes that each Lambda function serves.

- Categorize functions based on their use cases, such as event-driven workflows, data processing, real-time analytics, or API back ends.

### Configuration

- Document configuration settings for each function, including memory allocation, time-out settings, and environment variables.

- Note versioning details, aliases, and any deployment-specific configurations, such as language runtime and architectures like x86 or ARM. 

### Security and networking setup

- Assess the identity and access management roles and policies associated with each function to ensure proper access control.

- Identify virtual private cloud configurations, including subnets, security groups, and NAT gateway dependencies, if applicable.

### Tooling

- List the continuous integration and continuous delivery tools and deployment frameworks that each function uses, such as AWS SAM, Serverless Framework, or custom pipelines.

- Document build and packaging tools, including testing frameworks and staging workflows.

### Monitoring, logging, and observability mechanisms

- Evaluate the current monitoring and logging mechanisms, such as Amazon CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray, or partner tools.

- Identify log retention policies and patterns for troubleshooting.

- Document tracked metrics and alerts, such as error rates, invocation counts, and duration trends.

### Dependencies

- Determine which AWS services, like DynamoDB, S3, or API Gateway, and partner tools that your Lambda functions rely on. Document their configurations, interactions, and dataflows.

- Map interdependencies, such as shared resources or invocation chains, between Lambda functions, and evaluate potential bottlenecks or latency problems.

- Assess service limits, operational considerations, and monitoring tools like CloudWatch and X-Ray. Ensure that you understand how these dependencies affect the workload.

By the end of this stage, you should have a comprehensive inventory of your AWS Lambda functions, including their:

- Use cases.

- Configurations.

- Security and networking setups.

- Tooling, monitoring, logging, and observability mechanisms.

- Dependencies.

This detailed inventory is the foundation for the next stage, where you assess the readiness and suitability of these functions for migration to Azure Functions.
