# AZF0002: Inefficient HttpClient usage

This rule is triggered when an [HttpClient](/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient?view=netcore-3.1&preserve-view=true) is instantiated within a `[FunctionName]`-decorated method.

| **Severity** |Warning|

## Rule description

Simple usage of [`HttpClient`](/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient?view=netcore-3.1&preserve-view=true) to make HTTP requests presents several issues, including vulnerability to socket exhaustion. In a Function app, calling the `HttpClient` constructor in the body of a function method will create a new instance with every function invocation, amplifying these issues. For apps running on a [Consumption hosting plan](../../consumption-plan.md), inefficient `HttpClient` usage can exhaust the plan's [outbound connection limits](../../../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md#azure-functions-limits).

The [recommended best practice](/dotnet/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/use-httpclientfactory-to-implement-resilient-http-requests) is to use an [`IHttpClientFactory`] with dependency injection _or_ a single static `HttpClient` instance, depending on the nature of your application.

## How to fix violations

+ Move your `HttpClient` instantiation to a static instance defined outside of the function, such as in [this example](../../manage-connections.md?tabs=csharp#http-requests).

+ Supply an `HttpClient` to your functions using [IHttpClientFactory](/dotnet/api/system.net.http.ihttpclientfactory?view=dotnet-plat-ext-5.0&preserve-view=true) through [dependency injection](../../functions-dotnet-dependency-injection.md). This is the recommended approach for fixing this violation.

## When to suppress the rule

This rule should not be suppressed.
