# AZF0001: Avoid async void

This rule is triggered when the `void` return type is used in an async function definition.

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |AZF0001|
| **Category** |[Usage]|
| **Severity** |Error|

## Rule description

Defining `async` functions with a `void` return type make it impossible for the Functions runtime to track invocation completion or catch and handle exceptions thrown by the function method.

Refer to this article for general `async void` information: https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/jj991977.aspx

## How to fix violations

To fix violations, change the function's return type from `void` to `Task` and make the necessary code changes to appropriately return a `Task`.

## When to suppress the rule

This rule should not be suppressed. Use of `async void` will lead to unpredictable behavior.
