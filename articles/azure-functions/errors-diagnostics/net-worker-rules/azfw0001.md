# AZFW0001: Invalid binding attributes

This rule occurs when invalid binding attributes are used in the function definition.

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |AZFW0001|
| **Severity** |Error|

## Rule description

The Azure Functions .NET language worker uses an [isolated worker model](../../dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md) for input and output bindings. This model requires libraries that are incompatible with the original in-process binding model used by both [in-process .NET class library functions](../../functions-dotnet-class-library.md) and WebJobs.

A new set of packages were introduced to support the existing bindings and triggers using the new .NET isolated worker model. The two package naming conventions are:

.NET isolated worker model: `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.*`. 
.NET In-process and WebJobs: `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.*` 

## How to fix violations

To fix violations, change or add a reference to the appropriate package as described above and use the correct attributes from that package. For more information, see the binding reference articles for your specific binding extensions. 

## When to suppress the rule

This rule shouldn't be suppressed, as the existing bindings won't work in the isolated model.
