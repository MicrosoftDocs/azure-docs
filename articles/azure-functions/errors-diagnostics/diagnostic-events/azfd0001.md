## Event description
The `AzureWebJobsStorage` app setting is used to store the connection string of the Azure Storage account associated with the function app. The Azure Functions runtime uses this connection for core behaviors such as coordinating singleton execution of timer triggers, default app key storage, and storing diagnostic events.

For more information, see [AzureWebJobsStorage](../../functions-app-settings.md#azurewebjobsstorage).

## How to resolve the event

Create a new app setting on your function app with name `AzureWebJobsStorage` with a valid storage account connection string as the value. For more information, see [Work with application settings](../../functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings).

## When to suppress the event

This event shouldn't be suppressed.
