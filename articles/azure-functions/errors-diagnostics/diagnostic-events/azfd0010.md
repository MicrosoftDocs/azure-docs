# AZFD0010: Linux Consumption Does Not Support TZ & WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE Error

This event occurs when a function app running on Linux in an Azure Functions Consumption plan app has either `WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE` or `TZ` set as an application setting. 

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Event ID** |AZFD0010|
| **Severity** |Error|

## Event description

Using `WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE` or `TZ` when running on Linux in a Consumption plan can create SSL-related issues and cause metrics to stop working for your app. For more information, see the [`WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE`](../../functions-app-settings.md#website_time_zone) reference. You can learn more about NCRONTAB timezones in the [Timer trigger reference](../../functions-bindings-timer.md#ncrontab-time-zones). 

## How to resolve the event

Remove either `WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE` or `TZ` from the [application settings](../../functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings). If your scenario requires you to adjust the timezone of your function app, consider using a different [hosting plan](../../functions-scale.md) or running on Windows, if possible.

## When to suppress the event

This event shouldn't be suppressed.
