# AZFD0009: Unable to parse host configuration file

The Azure Functions runtime was unable to parse the host configuration file (host.json) for your function app.

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Event ID** |AZFD0009|
| **Severity** |Error|

## Event description

For some reason, the Functions runtime couldn't parse the host configuration file (host.json) in the root of your function app. When the Functions host can't read this file, your app can't start.

## How to resolve the event

To resolve this error, you should make sure that the host.json file in the root of your function app contains valid JSON in a valid configuration. For more information about the configuration allowed in this file, see the [host.json file](../../functions-host-json.md#sample-hostjson-file) reference article. 

Because you use the same host.json file when running your functions locally, it could be helpful to debug this configuration file [during local development](../../functions-develop-local.md).

## When to suppress the event

This event shouldn't be suppressed.
