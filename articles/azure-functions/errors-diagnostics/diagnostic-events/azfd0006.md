# AZFD0006: SAS Token Expiring Warning


This event occurs when an SAS token in an application setting is set to expire within 45 days.


| | Value |

| **Event ID** |AZFD0006|
| **Severity** |Warning|

## Event description

This warning event occurs when an SAS token within a URI is set to expire within 45 days. If the token has already expired, an error event will be triggered.


Functions currently only checks the following application settings for expiring SAS tokens: 
+ [`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`](../../functions-app-settings.md#website_run_from_package) 
+ [`AzureWebJobsStorage`](../../functions-app-settings.md#azurewebjobsstorage)
+ [`WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING`](../../functions-app-settings.md#website_contentazurefileconnectionstring)
The warning message specifies which variable has the SAS token that's going to expire and how much time is left.



## How to resolve the event

There are two ways to resolve this event:

+ Renew the SAS token so that it doesn't expire within the next 45 days and set the new value in application settings. For more information, see [Manually uploading a package to Blob Storage](../../run-functions-from-deployment-package.md#manually-uploading-a-package-to-blob-storage).

+ Switch to using managed identities instead relying on using an SAS URI. For more information, see [Fetch a package from Azure Blob Storage using a managed identity](../../run-functions-from-deployment-package.md#fetch-a-package-from-azure-blob-storage-using-a-managed-identity).


## When to suppress the event

This event shouldn't be suppressed.
