# AZFD0002: Value of AzureWebJobsStorage app setting is invalid.

This event occurs when the value of the `AzureWebJobsStorage` app setting is set to either an invalid Azure Storage account connection string or to a Key Vault reference.

| **Severity** |Error|

## Event description
The `AzureWebJobsStorage` app setting is used to store the connection string of the storage account associated with the function app. The Azure Functions runtime uses this connection for core behaviors such as coordinating singleton execution of timer triggers, default app key storage, and storing diagnostic events. This app setting needs to be set to a valid connection string.

For more information, see [AzureWebJobsStorage](../../functions-app-settings.md#azurewebjobsstorage).

## How to resolve the event
Update the value of the `AzureWebJobsStorage` app setting on your function app with a valid storage account connection string. For more information, see [Troubleshoot error: "Azure Functions Runtime is unreachable"](../../functions-recover-storage-account.md).

## When to suppress the event
You should suppress this event when your function app uses an Azure Key Vault reference in the `AzureWebjobsStorage` app setting instead of a connection string. For more information, see [Source application settings from Key Vault](../../../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references.md?toc=%2Fazure%2Fazure-functions%2Ftoc.json#source-app-settings-from-key-vault)
