# Azure OpenAI assistant create output binding for Azure Functions

[!INCLUDE [preview-support](../../includes/functions-openai-support-limitations.md)]

The Azure OpenAI assistant create output binding allows you to create a new assistant chat bot from your function code execution.

For information on setup and configuration details of the Azure OpenAI extension, see [Azure OpenAI extensions for Azure Functions](./functions-bindings-openai.md). To learn more about Azure OpenAI assistants, see [Azure OpenAI Assistants API](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/assistants).

[!INCLUDE [functions-support-notes-samples-openai](../../includes/functions-support-notes-samples-openai.md)]

## Example

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"  
This example demonstrates the creation process, where the HTTP PUT function that creates a new assistant chat bot with the specified ID. The response to the prompt is returned in the HTTP response.  

:::code language="csharp" source="~/functions-openai-extension/samples/assistant/csharp-ooproc/AssistantApis.cs" range="20-45"::: 

::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"
This example demonstrates the creation process, where the HTTP PUT function that creates a new assistant chat bot with the specified ID. The response to the prompt is returned in the HTTP response.  

:::code language="java" source="~/functions-openai-extension/samples/assistant/java/src/main/java/com/azfs/AssistantApis.java" range="33-58":::  

::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript,programming-language-typescript"  
This example demonstrates the creation process, where the HTTP PUT function that creates a new assistant chat bot with the specified ID. The response to the prompt is returned in the HTTP response.  
::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript"

:::code language="javascript" source="~/functions-openai-extension/samples/assistant/javascript/src/functions/assistantApis.js" range="6-33" :::

::: zone-end 
::: zone pivot="programming-language-typescript"

:::code language="typescript" source="~/functions-openai-extension/samples/assistant/typescript/src/functions/assistantApis.ts" range="4-33" :::

::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-powershell"  
This example demonstrates the creation process, where the HTTP PUT function that creates a new assistant chat bot with the specified ID. The response to the prompt is returned in the HTTP response.  

Here's the _function.json_ file for Create Assistant:

:::code language="json" source="~/functions-openai-extension/samples/assistant/powershell/CreateAssistant/function.json" :::

For more information about *function.json* file properties, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

:::code language="powershell" source="~/functions-openai-extension/samples/assistant/powershell/CreateAssistant/run.ps1" :::

::: zone-end   
::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"  
This example demonstrates the creation process, where the HTTP PUT function that creates a new assistant chat bot with the specified ID. The response to the prompt is returned in the HTTP response.  

:::code language="python" source="~/functions-openai-extension/samples/assistant/python/assistant_apis.py" range="7-22" :::
