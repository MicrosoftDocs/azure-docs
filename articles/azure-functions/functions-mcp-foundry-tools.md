# Connect an MCP server on Azure Functions to a Foundry Agent Service agent

This article shows you how to connect your [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) (MCP) server hosted on Azure Functions to Microsoft Foundry Agent Service. After completing this guide, your agent can discover and invoke the tools exposed by your MCP server.

This article follows this basic process for configuring the MCP server connection from Foundry Agent Service: 

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create and deploy an MCP server to your function app in Azure.
> * Get the MCP server endpoint URL.
> * Get the authentication credentials (as required).
> * Disable key-based authentication (when not needed).
> * Add an MCP server tool connection to an existing agent. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have these resources in place:

* An MCP server hosted as a function app. You can create your MCP server by completing the quickstart for one of these supported hosting options:
  * [Using the Azure Functions MCP extension](scenario-custom-remote-mcp-server.md).
  * [Self-host a server that uses standard MCP SDKs](scenario-host-mcp-server-sdks.md).
* [Configure built-in authentication in your function app](./functions-mcp-tutorial.md#configure-authentication-on-server-app), when using Microsoft Entra ID-based authentication.
* [An existing Foundry project and model](/azure/ai-foundry/tutorials/quickstart-create-foundry-resources?view=foundry&tabs=portal&preserve-view=true).
* [An existing agent](/azure/ai-foundry/quickstarts/get-started-code?view=foundry&preserve-view=true#create-an-agent).

## Review connection options

This table summarizes the currently supported options for authenticating your agent connection to an MCP server in Foundry Agent Service: 

| Method | Description | Use case | Additional setup | Functions supports |
| ------ | ----------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| **Key-based** (default) | Agent authenticates by passing a shared [function access key](./function-keys-how-to.md) in the request header. This method is the default authentication for HTTP endpoints in Functions. | Use during development or when the MCP server doesn't require Microsoft Entra authentication. | None | Yes |
| **Microsoft Entra** | Agent authenticates using either its own identity (*agent identity*) or the shared identity of the Foundry project (*project managed identity*). | Use agent identity for production scenarios, but limit shared identity to development. | [Disable key-based authentication](functions-mcp-tutorial.md?tabs=mcp-extension#disable-key-based-authentication) and [configure built-in server authorization and authentication](functions-mcp-tutorial.md?tabs=mcp-extension#enable-built-in-server-authorization-and-authentication). | Project managed (shared) identity |
| **OAuth identity passthrough** | Agent prompts users to sign in and authorize access, using the provided token to authenticate. | Use in production when each user must authenticate with their own identity and user context must be persisted. | [Disable key-based authentication](functions-mcp-tutorial.md?tabs=mcp-extension#disable-key-based-authentication) and [configure built-in server authorization and authentication](functions-mcp-tutorial.md?tabs=mcp-extension#enable-built-in-server-authorization-and-authentication). | Yes |
| **Unauthenticated access** | Agent makes unauthenticated calls. | Use during development or when your MCP server accesses only public information. | [Disable key-based authentication](functions-mcp-tutorial.md?tabs=mcp-extension#disable-key-based-authentication). | Yes |

To learn more about the MCP server authentication options that the Foundry Agent Service supports, see [Set up authentication for MCP tools](/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/mcp-authentication?view=foundry&preserve-view=true).

## Get the remote MCP server endpoint

Before you can connect the agent to a Functions-hosed MCP server, you must get the endpoint URL for the service. The specific URL format depends on how you created and deployed your MCP server:

| MCP server type | Endpoint format |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| MCP extension-based server | `https://<FUNCTION_APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/mcp` |
| Self-hosted MCP server | `https://<FUNCTION_APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/mcp` (unless you changed the route) |

For more information, see [Remote MCP servers](./functions-create-ai-enabled-apps.md#remote-mcp-servers).

## Get credentials

The credentials that your agent needs to connect to the MCP server depend on the way you plan to secure the connection. Choose the tab that indicates your connection authentication option.

### [Key-based](#tab/key-based)

When you use an access key to connect to your MCP server endpoint, you use a shared secret key to make it more difficult for random agents to connect to your server.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>While access keys can help prevent unwanted endpoint access by default, consider using Microsoft Entra ID or OAuth identity authentication to provide enhanced security to your MCP server endpoints in production.   

The name of the access key you need depends on your MCP server deployment:

| MCP server type | Key name | Key type |
| --------------- | -------- | -------- |
| MCP extension-based server | `mcp_extension` | System key |
| Self-hosted MCP server | `default` | Host key |

To get the key from the Azure portal:

1. Go to your function app resource in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Expand the **Functions** dropdown in the left menu.
1. Select **App keys**.
1. Copy either the `mcp_extension` key (under **System keys**) or the `default` key (under **Host keys**), depending on your MCP server type.

For more information, see [Work with access keys in Azure Functions](function-keys-how-to.md).

### [Microsoft Entra](#tab/entra)

Both **Agent Identity** and **Project Managed Identity** use Microsoft Entra authentication. Currently, Functions only supports **Project managed identity**, which requires your server to use [built-in authentication and authorization](../app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad.md). 

1. If your function app doesn't have a user-assigned managed identity, [first create one](../app-service/overview-managed-identity.md#add-a-user-assigned-identity).
 
1. Connect the user-assigned managed identity from your function app to your Foundry project: 

    1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for `Foundry`. In Microsoft Foundry, select your Foundry resource from **All resources**.
    
    1. In **Resource management** > **Identity** > **User assigned**, select **+ Add**. Select the user-assigned managed identity used by your function app, and then select **Add**.   
    
    1. Select the newly added identity and copy the **Client ID** value. 
    
1. Add the user-assigned managed identity as an allowed client application in your [function app's Entra app registration](functions-mcp-tutorial.md?tabs=mcp-extension#configure-protected-resource-metadata-preview):

    1. Go to your function app resource in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
    
    1. Select **Settings** > **Authentication** from the left menu.
    
    1. Select the **Edit** icon for your registered Entra identity provider.
    
    1. In your provider, set **Client application requirement** to **Allow requests from specific client applications** and select the edit button next to **Allowed client applications**.
    
    1. Add the client ID of your user-assigned managed identity, and select **OK** and then **Save**.    

1. Get the **Application ID URI** from your function app's Entra app registration, which you need to complete the Entra authentication registration in your agent:

    1. Back in the **Authentication** page for your app, select the name of the registered Entra identity provider. This selection takes you to the Entra app resource page.
    
    1. In the left menu, select **Manage** > **Expose an API**.
    
    1. Copy the **Application ID URI** at the top of the page. This ID value looks like `api://00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444`.

### [OAuth identity](#tab/oauth-id)

OAuth identity passthrough prompts users to sign in and authorize access to your MCP server. For a Functions-hosted MCP server with built-in authentication, use custom OAuth with a Microsoft Entra app registration. 

To get the required credentials from the Azure portal:

1. Go to your function app resource in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Select **Settings** > **Authentication** from the left menu.

1. Select the name of the Entra app next to **Microsoft**. This selection takes you to the Entra app resource.

1. From **Essentials** in the **Overview** page, copy the values from these fields:

    + **Application (client) ID**
    + **Directory (tenant) ID**
    + **Application ID URI**

1. Use the tenant ID to construct these required OAuth URLs:

    | URL type | Format |
    | -------- | ------ |
    | **Auth URL** | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize` |
    | **Token URL** | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/token` |
    | **Refresh URL** | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/token` |

    Replace `<TENANT_ID>` with your actual tenant ID value.

1. Select **Manage** > **Expose an API** and copy the existing scope.  

<!---Seems like we don't need this...
1. (Optional) If your app requires a client secret, select **Manage** > **Certificates & secrets**, and then create or copy an existing client secret value.
-->
After you configure OAuth identity passthrough in the Foundry portal, you receive a redirect URL. You must return to your Entra app registration to add this redirect URL to the Microsoft Entra app registration.

### [Unauthenticated](#tab/unauthenticated)

Because unauthenticated access requires no shared secrets or authentication, you can skip to the next section. 

>[!IMPORTANT]  
>This option allows any client or agent to access your MCP server endpoint. Use it only for tools that return read-only public information or during private development.

---

## Disable key-based authentication

When you choose to use a different authentication method than the default key-based authentication, you don't need Functions to enforce key-based access to your MCP endpoints. You can disable key-based access requirement by changing the access setting from `system` (key-based) to `anonymous` (unauthenticated). How you make this change depends on the type of MCP server you're hosting:

### [MCP extension server](#tab/mcp-extension/key-based)

When you use the default key-based authentication, no changes are required.

### [MCP extension server](#tab/mcp-extension/entra)

[!INCLUDE [functions-mcp-extension-disable-key-access](../../includes/functions-mcp-extension-disable-key-access.md)]

### [MCP extension server](#tab/mcp-extension/oauth-id)

[!INCLUDE [functions-mcp-extension-disable-key-access](../../includes/functions-mcp-extension-disable-key-access.md)]

### [MCP extension server](#tab/mcp-extension/unauthenticated)

[!INCLUDE [functions-mcp-extension-disable-key-access](../../includes/functions-mcp-extension-disable-key-access.md)]

### [Self-hosted server](#tab/self-hosted/key-based)

Skip this section when using key-based authentication.

### [Self-hosted server](#tab/self-hosted/entra)

[!INCLUDE [functions-mcp-custom-handler-disable-key-access](../../includes/functions-mcp-custom-handler-disable-key-access.md)]

### [Self-hosted server](#tab/self-hosted/oauth-id)

[!INCLUDE [functions-mcp-custom-handler-disable-key-access](../../includes/functions-mcp-custom-handler-disable-key-access.md)]

### [Self-hosted server](#tab/self-hosted/unauthenticated)

[!INCLUDE [functions-mcp-custom-handler-disable-key-access](../../includes/functions-mcp-custom-handler-disable-key-access.md)]

    | **Authentication** | The authentication method to use. | `Unauthenticated` |

1. Select **Connect** to create an unauthenticated connection to your MCP server endpoint. You should now see your server name listed under **Tools**.

1. Select **Save** to save the MCP tool configuration in your agent.

---

## Test your MCP tools

After connecting your MCP server to your agent, verify that the tools work correctly.

1. In the Agent Builder, find the chat window under **Playground**.
1. Enter a prompt that triggers one of your MCP tools. For example, if your MCP server has a greeting tool, try: `Use the greeting tool to say hello`.
1. If you're using OAuth identity passthrough, select **Open Consent** and sign in with your Entra account.
1. When the agent requests to invoke an MCP tool, review the tool name and arguments, and select **Approve** to allow the call.
1. Verify the tool returns the expected result.

Your agent can now use the tools exposed by your MCP server hosted on Azure Functions.
