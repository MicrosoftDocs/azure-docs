# RabbitMQ bindings for Azure Functions overview

Azure Functions integrates with [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) via [triggers and bindings](./functions-triggers-bindings.md). 

[!INCLUDE [functions-rabbitmq-plans-support-note](../../includes/functions-rabbitmq-plans-support-note.md)]

The Azure Functions RabbitMQ extension allows you to send and receive messages using the RabbitMQ API with Functions.

| Action | Type |
|---------|---------|
| Run a function when a RabbitMQ message comes through the queue | [Trigger](./functions-bindings-rabbitmq-trigger.md) |
| Send RabbitMQ messages |[Output binding](./functions-bindings-rabbitmq-output.md) |

## Prerequisites

Before working with the RabbitMQ extension, you must [set up your RabbitMQ endpoint](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-rabbitmq-extension/wiki/Setting-up-a-RabbitMQ-Endpoint). To learn more about RabbitMQ, see the [getting started page](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html).

## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app: 

# [Isolated worker model](#tab/isolated-process)

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md).

Add the extension to your project by installing this [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Rabbitmq).

# [In-process model](#tab/in-process)

[!INCLUDE [functions-in-process-model-retirement-note](../../includes/functions-in-process-model-retirement-note.md)]

Functions execute in the same process as the Functions host. To learn more, see [Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library.md).

Add the extension to your project by installing this [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.RabbitMQ).

## Install bundle    

The RabbitMQ extension is part of an [extension bundle], which is specified in your host.json project file. When you create a project that targets version 3.x or later, you should already have this bundle installed. To learn more, see [extension bundle].
