# Monitor Azure Functions

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-insights](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-insights.md)]

### Application Insights

Azure Functions offers built-in integration with Application Insights to monitor functions executions. For detailed information about how to integrate, configure, and use Application Insights to monitor Azure Functions, see the following articles:

- [Monitor executions in Azure Functions](functions-monitoring.md)
- [How to configure monitoring for Azure Functions](configure-monitoring.md)
- [Analyze Azure Functions telemetry in Application Insights](analyze-telemetry-data.md).
- [Monitor Azure Functions with Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/monitor-functions)

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-resource-types](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-resource-types.md)]
For more information about the resource types for Azure Functions, see [Azure Functions monitoring data reference](monitor-functions-reference.md).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-data-storage](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-data-storage.md)]

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-platform-metrics](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-platform-metrics.md)]
For a list of available metrics for Azure Functions, see [Azure Functions monitoring data reference](monitor-functions-reference.md#metrics).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-resource-logs](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-resource-logs.md)]

Azure Functions integrates with Azure Monitor Logs to monitor functions. For detailed instructions on how to set up diagnostic settings to configure and route resource logs, see [Create diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings).

For the available resource log categories, their associated Log Analytics tables, and the logs schemas for Azure Functions, see [Azure Functions monitoring data reference](monitor-functions-reference.md#resource-logs).

## Other logs

Azure Functions also offers the ability to collect more than Azure Monitor resource logs. To view a near real time stream of application log files generated by your function running in Azure, you can connect to Application Insights and use Live Metrics Stream. Or, you can use the App Service platform built-in log streaming to view a stream of application log files. For more information, see [Enable streaming execution logs in Azure Functions](streaming-logs.md).

### Analyze metrics for Azure Functions

The following examples use Azure Monitor metrics to help estimate the cost of running your function app on a Consumption plan. To learn more about estimating Consumption plan costs, see [Estimating Consumption plan costs](functions-consumption-costs.md).

[!INCLUDE [functions-monitor-metrics-consumption](../../includes/functions-monitor-metrics-consumption.md)]  

### Analyze logs for Azure Functions

Azure Functions writes all logs to the **FunctionAppLogs** table under **LogManagement** in the Log Analytics workspace where you send the data. You can use Kusto queries to query the data.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-functions/querying.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Query window for Azure Functions in a Log Analytics workspace.":::

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-kusto-queries](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-kusto-queries.md)]

The following sample queries can help you monitor all your functions app logs:

```Kusto

FunctionAppLogs
| order by TimeGenerated desc

```

```Kusto
FunctionAppLogs
| project TimeGenerated, HostInstanceId, Message, _ResourceId
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

The following sample query can help you monitor a specific functions app's logs:

```Kusto
FunctionAppLogs
| where FunctionName == "<Function name>" 
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

The following sample query can help you monitor exceptions on all your functions app logs:

```Kusto

FunctionAppLogs
| where ExceptionDetails != ""  
| order by TimeGenerated asc

```

The following sample query can help you monitor exceptions on a specific functions app's logs:

```Kusto
FunctionAppLogs
| where ExceptionDetails != ""  
| where FunctionName == "<Function name>" 
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Azure Functions alert rules
The following table lists common and recommended alert rules for Azure Functions. These are just recommended alerts. You can set alerts for any metric, log entry, or activity log entry listed in the [Monitoring data reference for Azure Functions](monitor-functions-reference.md).


| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Metric | Average connections| When number of connections exceed a set value|
| Metric | HTTP 404| When HTTP 404 responses exceed a set value|
| Metric | HTTP Server Errors| When HTTP 5xx errors exceed a set value|
| Activity Log | Create or update function app | When app is created or updated|
| Activity Log | Delete function app | When app is deleted|
| Activity Log | Restart function app| When app is restarted|
| Activity Log | Stop function app| When app is stopped|
