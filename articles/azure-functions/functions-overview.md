# Azure Functions Overview

## Life's about to get a whole lot easier 

Write any function under a minute - either when you need a simple job to cleanse a database or to build functionality that processes millions of messages from connected devices. User your development language of choice (C#, Node.JS, Python and more). Pay only for the time your code runs and trust Azure to scale as needed.
