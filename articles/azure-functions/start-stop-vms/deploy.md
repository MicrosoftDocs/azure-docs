# Deploy Start/Stop VMs v2 to an Azure subscription

Perform the steps in this article in sequence to install the Start/Stop VMs v2 feature. After completing the setup process, configure the schedules to customize it to your requirements.

## Permissions and Policy considerations

Keep the following considerations in mind before and during deployment:

+   The solution allows users with appropriate role-based access control (RBAC) permissions on the Start/Stop v2 deployment to add, remove, and manage schedules for virtual machines under the scope of the Start/Stop VMs v2 instance. This behavior is by design. In practice, this means a user who doesn't have explicit permissions on a virtual machine could still create start, stop, and autostop operations on that virtual machine when they have the permission to modify the Start/Stop v2 solution managing the virtual machine.

+ Any users with access to the Start/Stop v2 solution could uncover cost, savings, operation history, and other data that is stored in the Application Insights instance used by the Start/Stop v2 application.

+ When managing a Start/Stop v2 solution, you should consider the permissions of users to the Start/Stop v2 solution, particularly when whey don't have permission to directly modify the target virtual machines.

+ When you deploy the Start/Stop v2 solution to a new or existing resource group, a tag named **SolutionName** with a value of **StartStopV2** is added to resource group and to its resources that are deployed by Start/Stop v2. Any other tags on these resources are removed. If you have an Azure policy that denies management operations based on resource tags, you must allow management operations for resources that contain only this tag.


## Deploy feature

The deployment is initiated from the [Start/Stop VMs v2 GitHub organization](https://github.com/microsoft/startstopv2-deployments/blob/main/README.md). While this feature is intended to manage all of your VMs in your subscription across all resource groups from a single deployment within the subscription, you can install another instance of it based on the operations model or requirements of your organization. It also can be configured to centrally manage VMs across multiple subscriptions.

To simplify management and removal, we recommend you deploy Start/Stop VMs v2 to a dedicated resource group.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently this solution does not support specifying an existing Storage account or Application Insights resource.

> [!NOTE]
> The naming format for the function app and storage account has changed. To guarantee global uniqueness, a random and unique string is now appended to the names of these resource.

1. Open your browser and navigate to the Start/Stop VMs v2 [GitHub organization](https://github.com/microsoft/startstopv2-deployments/blob/main/README.md).
1. Select the deployment option based on the Azure cloud environment your Azure VMs are created in.
1. If prompted, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Choose the appropriate **Plan** from the drop-down box. When choosing a Zone Redundant plan (**Start/StopV2-AZ**), you must create your deployment in one of the following regions:
    + Australia East
    + Brazil South
    + Canada Central
    + Central US
    + East US
    + East US 2
    + France Central
    + Germany West Central
    + Japan East
    + North Europe
    + Southeast Asia
    + UK South
    + West Europe
    + West US 2
    + West US 3

1. Select **Create**, which opens the custom Azure Resource Manager deployment page in the Azure portal.

## Configure schedules overview

To manage the automation method to control the start and stop of your VMs, you configure one or more of the included logic apps based on your requirements.

- Scheduled - Start and stop actions are based on a schedule you specify against Azure Resource Manager and classic VMs. **ststv2_vms_Scheduled_start** and **ststv2_vms_Scheduled_stop** configure the scheduled start and stop.

- Sequenced - Start and stop actions are based on a schedule targeting VMs with pre-defined sequencing tags. Only two named tags are supported - **sequencestart** and **sequencestop**. **ststv2_vms_Sequenced_start** and **ststv2_vms_Sequenced_stop** configure the sequenced start and stop.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This scenario only supports Azure Resource Manager VMs.

- AutoStop - This functionality is only used for performing a stop action against both Azure Resource Manager and classic VMs based on its CPU utilization. It can also be a scheduled-based *take action*, which creates alerts on VMs and based on the condition, the alert is triggered to perform the stop action.**ststv2_vms_AutoStop** configures the auto-stop functionality.

If you need additional schedules, you can duplicate one of the Logic Apps provided using the **Clone** option in the Azure portal.

## Scheduled start and stop scenario

Perform the following steps to configure the scheduled start and stop action for Azure Resource Manager and classic VMs. For example, you can configure the **ststv2_vms_Scheduled_start** schedule to start them in the morning when you are in the office, and stop all VMs across a subscription when you leave work in the evening based on the **ststv2_vms_Scheduled_stop** schedule.

Configuring the logic app to just start the VMs is supported.

For each scenario, you can target the action against one or more subscriptions, single or multiple resource groups, and specify one or more VMs in an inclusion or exclusion list. You cannot specify them together in the same logic app.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and then navigate to **Logic apps**.

1. From the list of Logic apps, to configure scheduled start, select **ststv2_vms_Scheduled_start**. To configure scheduled stop, select **ststv2_vms_Scheduled_stop**.

1. Select **Logic app designer** from the left-hand pane.

1. After Logic App Designer appears, in the designer pane, select **Recurrence** to configure the logic app schedule. To learn about the specific recurrence options, see [Schedule recurring task](../../connectors/connectors-native-recurrence.md#add-the-recurrence-trigger).

    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy/schedule-recurrence-property.png" alt-text="Configure the recurrence frequency for logic app":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you do not provide a start date and time for the first recurrence, a recurrence will immediately run when you save the logic app, which might cause the VMs to start or stop before the scheduled run.

1. In the designer pane, select **Function-Try** to configure the target settings. In the request body, if you want to manage VMs across all resource groups in the subscription, modify the request body as shown in the following example.

    ```json
    {
      "Action": "start",
      "EnableClassic": false,
      "RequestScopes": {
        "ExcludedVMLists": [],
        "Subscriptions": [
          "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/"
        ]
     }
    }
    ```

    Specify multiple subscriptions in the `subscriptions` array with each value separated by a comma as in the following example.

    ```json
    "Subscriptions": [
          "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/",
          "/subscriptions/bbbb1b1b-cc2c-dd3d-ee4e-ffffff5f5f5f/"
        ]
    ```

    In the request body, if you want to manage VMs for specific resource groups, modify the request body as shown in the following example. Each resource path specified must be separated by a comma. You can specify one resource group or more if required.

    This example also demonstrates excluding a virtual machine. You can exclude the VM by specifying the VMs resource path or by wildcard.

    ```json
    {
      "Action": "start",
      "EnableClassic": false,
      "RequestScopes": {
        "Subscriptions": [
          "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/",
          "/subscriptions/bbbb1b1b-cc2c-dd3d-ee4e-ffffff5f5f5f/"
         ],
        "ResourceGroups": [
          "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/rg1/",
          "/subscriptions/bbbb1b1b-cc2c-dd3d-ee4e-ffffff5f5f5f/resourceGroups/rg2/"
        ],
        "ExcludedVMLists": [
         "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/vmrg1/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm1"
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    Here the action will be performed on all the VMs except on the VM name starts with Az and Bz in both subscriptions.

    ```json
    {
      "Action": "start",
      "EnableClassic": false,
      "RequestScopes": {
        "ExcludedVMLists": [“Az*”,“Bz*”],
       "Subscriptions": [
          "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/",
          "/subscriptions/bbbb1b1b-cc2c-dd3d-ee4e-ffffff5f5f5f/"
    
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    In the request body, if you want to manage a specific set of VMs within the subscription, modify the request body as shown in the following example. Each resource path specified must be separated by a comma. You can specify one VM if required.

    ```json
    {
      "Action": "start",
      "EnableClassic": false,
      "RequestScopes": {
        "ExcludedVMLists": [],
        "VMLists": [
          "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/rg1/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm1",
          "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/rg3/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm2",
          "/subscriptions/bbbb1b1b-cc2c-dd3d-ee4e-ffffff5f5f5f/resourceGroups/rg2/providers/Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/vm30"
          
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

1. In the overview pane for the logic app, select **Enable**.  

## Sequenced start and stop scenario

In an environment that includes two or more components on multiple Azure Resource Manager VMs in a distributed application architecture, supporting the sequence in which components are started and stopped in order is important. Make sure you have applied the **sequencestart** and **sequencestop** tags to the target VMs as described on the [Overview page](../../azure-functions/start-stop-vms/overview.md#overview) before configuring this scenario.

1. From the list of Logic apps, to configure sequenced start, select **ststv2_vms_Sequenced_start**. To configure sequenced stop, select **ststv2_vms_Sequenced_stop**.

1. Select **Logic app designer** from the left-hand pane.

1. After Logic App Designer appears, in the designer pane, select **Recurrence** to configure the logic app schedule. To learn about the specific recurrence options, see [Schedule recurring task](../../connectors/connectors-native-recurrence.md#add-the-recurrence-trigger).

    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy/schedule-recurrence-property.png" alt-text="Configure the recurrence frequency for logic app":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you do not provide a start date and time for the first recurrence, a recurrence will immediately run when you save the logic app, which might cause the VMs to start or stop before the scheduled run.

1. In the designer pane, select **Function-Try** to configure the target settings and then select the **</> Code view** button in the top menu to edit the code for the **Function-Try** element. In the request body, if you want to manage VMs across all resource groups in the subscription, modify the request body as shown in the following example.

    ```json
    {
      "Action": "start",
      "EnableClassic": false,
      "RequestScopes": {
        "ExcludedVMLists": [],
        "Subscriptions": [
          "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/"
        ]
     },
       "Sequenced": true
    }
    ```

    Specify multiple subscriptions in the `subscriptions` array with each value separated by a comma as in the following example.

    ```json
    "Subscriptions": [
          "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/",
          "/subscriptions/bbbb1b1b-cc2c-dd3d-ee4e-ffffff5f5f5f/"
        ]
    ```

    In the request body, if you want to manage VMs for specific resource groups, modify the request body as shown in the following example. Each resource path specified must be separated by a comma. You can specify one resource group if required.

    This example also demonstrates excluding a virtual machine by its resource path compared to the example for scheduled start/stop, which used wildcards.

    ```json
    {
      "Action": "start",
      "EnableClassic": false,
      "RequestScopes": {
        "Subscriptions":[
          "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/",
          "/subscriptions/bbbb1b1b-cc2c-dd3d-ee4e-ffffff5f5f5f/"
        ],
        "ResourceGroups": [
          "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/rg1/",
          "/subscriptions/bbbb1b1b-cc2c-dd3d-ee4e-ffffff5f5f5f/resourceGroups/rg2/"
        ],
        "ExcludedVMLists": [
         "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/vmrg1/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm1"
        ]
      },
       "Sequenced": true
    }
    ```

    In the request body, if you want to manage a specific set of VMs within a subscription, modify the request body as shown in the following example. Each resource path specified must be separated by a comma. You can specify one VM if required.

    ```json
    {
      "Action": "start",
      "EnableClassic": false,
      "RequestScopes": {
        "ExcludedVMLists": [],
        "VMLists": [
          "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/rg1/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm1",
          "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/rg2/providers/Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/vm2",
          "/subscriptions/bbbb1b1b-cc2c-dd3d-ee4e-ffffff5f5f5f/resourceGroups/rg2/providers/Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/vm30"
        ]
      },
       "Sequenced": true
    }
    ```

## Auto stop scenario

Start/Stop VMs v2 can help manage the cost of running Azure Resource Manager and classic VMs in your subscription by evaluating machines that aren't used during non-peak periods, such as after hours, and automatically shutting them down if processor utilization is less than a specified percentage.

The following metric alert properties in the request body support customization:

- AutoStop_MetricName
- AutoStop_Condition
- AutoStop_Threshold
- AutoStop_Description
- AutoStop_Frequency
- AutoStop_Severity
- AutoStop_Threshold
- AutoStop_TimeAggregationOperator
- AutoStop_TimeWindow

To learn more about how Azure Monitor metric alerts work and how to configure them see [Metric alerts in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-metric-overview).

1. From the list of Logic apps, to configure auto stop, select **ststv2_vms_AutoStop**.

1. Select **Logic app designer** from the left-hand pane.

1. After Logic App Designer appears, in the designer pane, select **Recurrence** to configure the logic app schedule. To learn about the specific recurrence options, see [Schedule recurring task](../../connectors/connectors-native-recurrence.md#add-the-recurrence-trigger).

    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy/schedule-recurrence-property.png" alt-text="Configure the recurrence frequency for logic app":::

1. In the designer pane, select **Function-Try** to configure the target settings. In the request body, if you want to manage VMs across all resource groups in the subscription, modify the request body as shown in the following example.

    ```json
    {
      "Action": "stop",
      "EnableClassic": false,    
      "AutoStop_MetricName": "Percentage CPU",

            "/subscriptions/12345678-2222-4444-5555-1234567891234/"
        ],
        "ExcludedVMLists":[]
      }        
    }
    ```

    In the request body, if you want to manage VMs for specific resource groups, modify the request body as shown in the following example. Each resource path specified must be separated by a comma. You can specify one resource group if required.

    ```json
    {
      "Action": "stop",
      "AutoStop_Condition": "LessThan",
      "AutoStop_Description": "Alert to stop the VM if the CPU % falls below the threshold",
      "AutoStop_Frequency": "00:05:00",
      "AutoStop_MetricName": "Percentage CPU",
      "AutoStop_Severity": "2",
      "AutoStop_Threshold": "5",
      "AutoStop_TimeAggregationOperator": "Average",
      "AutoStop_TimeWindow": "06:00:00",
      "EnableClassic": false,
      "RequestScopes": {
        "ExcludedVMLists": [],
        "ResourceGroups": [
          "/subscriptions/12345678-1111-2222-3333-1234567891234/resourceGroups/vmrg1/",
          "/subscriptions/12345678-1111-2222-3333-1234567891234/resourceGroupsvmrg2/",
          "/subscriptions/12345678-2222-4444-5555-1234567891234/resourceGroups/VMHostingRG/"
          ]
      }
    }
    ```

    In the request body, if you want to manage a specific set of VMs within the subscription, modify the request body as shown in the following example. Each resource path specified must be separated by a comma. You can specify one VM if required.

    ```json
    {
      "Action": "stop",
      "AutoStop_Condition": "LessThan",
      "AutoStop_Description": "Alert to stop the VM if the CPU % falls below the threshold",
      "AutoStop_Frequency": "00:05:00",
      "AutoStop_MetricName": "Percentage CPU",
      "AutoStop_Severity": "2",
      "AutoStop_Threshold": "5",
      "AutoStop_TimeAggregationOperator": "Average",
      "AutoStop_TimeWindow": "06:00:00",
      "EnableClassic": false,
      "RequestScopes": {

        ]
      }
    }
    ```
## VM Tags

You can also include or exclude specific VMs from start and stop actions by settings tags on the VMs themselves. To add a tag, navigate to the specific VM, select **Tags** from the left menu, and add a tag named `ssv2excludevm`. To exclude this VM from the start or stop action, set the value of this new tag to `true`. To include the VM in the action, set the value to `false`. This gives you a way to exclude specific VMs without having to update `ExcludedVMLists` in the payload configuration.
