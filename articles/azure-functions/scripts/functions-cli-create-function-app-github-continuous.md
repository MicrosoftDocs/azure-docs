# Create an App Service

This sample script creates a function app using the [consumption plan](../functions-scale.md#consumption-plan) with its related resources, and continuously deploys your function code from a GitHub repository. In this sample, you need:

* A GitHub repository with functions code, that you have administrative permissions for.
* A [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use) for your GitHub account.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

## Sample script

This sample creates an Azure Function app and deploys function code from GitHub.

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/azure-functions/deploy-function-app-with-function-github-continuous/deploy-function-app-with-function-github-continuous.sh?highlight=3-4 "Azure Service")]
