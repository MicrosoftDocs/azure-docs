# Create a function app for serverless code execution 

This Azure Functions sample script creates a function app, which is a container for your functions. The function app is created using the [Consumption plan](../consumption-plan.md), which is ideal for event-driven serverless workloads.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

 - This tutorial requires version 2.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed. 

## Sample script

This script creates an Azure Function app using the [Consumption plan](../consumption-plan.md).

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/azure-functions/create-function-app-consumption/create-function-app-consumption.sh "Create an Azure Function on a Consumption plan")]

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]

## Script explanation

| [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#az_storage_account_create) | Creates an Azure Storage account. |
| [az functionapp create](/cli/azure/functionapp#az_functionapp_create) | Creates a function app. |
