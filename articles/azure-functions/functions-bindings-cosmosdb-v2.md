# Azure Cosmos DB trigger and bindings for Azure Functions 2.x and higher overview

> [!div class="op_single_selector" title1="Select the version of the Azure Functions runtime you are using: "]
> * [Version 1](functions-bindings-cosmosdb.md)
> * [Version 2 and higher](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2.md)

This set of articles explains how to work with [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/serverless-computing-database) bindings in Azure Functions 2.x and higher. Azure Functions supports trigger, input, and output bindings for Azure Cosmos DB.

| Action | Type |
|---------|---------|
| Run a function when an Azure Cosmos DB document is created or modified | [Trigger](./functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-trigger.md) |
| Read an Azure Cosmos DB document | [Input binding](./functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-input.md) |
| Save changes to an Azure Cosmos DB document  |[Output binding](./functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-output.md) |

> [!NOTE]
> This reference is for [Azure Functions version 2.x and higher](functions-versions.md).  For information about how to use these bindings in Functions 1.x, see [Azure Cosmos DB bindings for Azure Functions 1.x](functions-bindings-cosmosdb.md).
>
> This binding was originally named DocumentDB. In Azure Functions version 2.x and higher, the trigger, bindings, and package are all named Azure Cosmos DB.

## Supported APIs

[!INCLUDE [SQL API support only](../../includes/functions-cosmosdb-sqlapi-note.md)]

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app: 

# [Isolated worker model](#tab/isolated-process)

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md).

# [In-process model](#tab/in-process)

[!INCLUDE [functions-in-process-model-retirement-note](../../includes/functions-in-process-model-retirement-note.md)]

Functions execute in the same process as the Functions host. To learn more, see [Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library.md).

In a variation of this model, Functions can be run using [C# scripting], which is supported primarily for C# portal editing. To update existing binding extensions for C# script apps running in the portal without having to republish your function app, see [Update your extensions].

---

The process for installing the extension varies depending on the extension version:

# [Extension 4.x+](#tab/extensionv4/in-process)

_This section describes using a [class library](./functions-dotnet-class-library.md). For [C# scripting], you would need to instead [install the extension bundle][Update your extensions], version 4.x._

This version of the Azure Cosmos DB bindings extension introduces the ability to [connect using an identity instead of a secret](./functions-reference.md#configure-an-identity-based-connection). For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](./functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial.md). 

This version also changes the types that you can bind to, replacing the types from the v2 SDK `Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB` with newer types from the v3 SDK [Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos](/azure/cosmos-db/sql/sql-api-sdk-dotnet-standard). Learn more about how these new types are different and how to migrate to them from the [SDK migration guide](/azure/cosmos-db/sql/migrate-dotnet-v3), [trigger](./functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-trigger.md), [input binding](./functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-input.md), and [output binding](./functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-output.md) examples.

This extension version is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.CosmosDB), version 4.x.

# [Functions 2.x+](#tab/functionsv2/in-process)

_This section describes using a [class library](./functions-dotnet-class-library.md). For [C# scripting], you would need to instead [install the extension bundle][Update your extensions], version 2.x or 3.x._

Working with the trigger and bindings requires that you reference the appropriate NuGet package. Install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.CosmosDB/3.0.10), version 3.x.

# [Extension 4.x+](#tab/extensionv4/isolated-process)

This version of the Azure Cosmos DB bindings extension introduces the ability to [connect using an identity instead of a secret](./functions-reference.md#configure-an-identity-based-connection). For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](./functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial.md). 

Add the extension to your project by installing the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.CosmosDB/), version 4.x.

If you're writing your application using F#, you must also configure this extension as part of the app's [startup configuration](./dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md#start-up-and-configuration). In the call to `ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults()` or `ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication()`, add a delegate that takes an `IFunctionsWorkerApplication` parameter. Then within the body of that delegate, call `ConfigureCosmosDBExtension()` on the object:

```fsharp
let hostBuilder = new HostBuilder()
hostBuilder.ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults(fun (context: HostBuilderContext) (appBuilder: IFunctionsWorkerApplicationBuilder) ->
    appBuilder.ConfigureCosmosDBExtension() |> ignore
) |> ignore
```

# [Functions 2.x+](#tab/functionsv2/isolated-process)

Add the extension to your project by installing the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.CosmosDB/), version 3.x.

## Install bundle

The Azure Cosmos DB bindings extension is part of an [extension bundle], which is specified in your *host.json* project file. You may need to modify this bundle to change the version of the binding, or if bundles aren't already installed. To learn more, see [extension bundle].

::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"

# [Bundle v4.x](#tab/extensionv4)

This version of the bundle contains version 4.x of the Azure Cosmos DB bindings extension that introduces the ability to [connect using an identity instead of a secret](./functions-reference.md#configure-an-identity-based-connection). For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](./functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial.md).

You can add this version of the extension from the preview extension bundle v4 by adding or replacing the following code in your `host.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "extensionBundle": {
    "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Preview",
    "version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
  }
}
```

To learn more, see [Update your extensions].

# [Bundle v2.x and v3.x](#tab/functionsv2)

You can install this version of the extension in your function app by registering the [extension bundle], version 2.x or 3.x.

[!INCLUDE [functions-extension-bundles-json-v3](../../includes/functions-extension-bundles-json-v3.md)]

## Binding types

The binding types supported for .NET depend on both the extension version and C# execution mode, which can be one of the following: 
   
# [Isolated worker model](#tab/isolated-process)

An isolated worker process class library compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.  

# [In-process model](#tab/in-process)

An in-process class library is a compiled C# function runs in the same process as the Functions runtime.

# [Extension 4.x+](#tab/extensionv4/in-process)

The Azure Cosmos DB extension supports parameter types according to the table below.

| Binding scenario | Parameter types |
|-|-|-| 
| Cosmos DB trigger (single document) | JSON serializable types<sup>1</sup> |
| Cosmos DB trigger (batch of documents) | `IEnumerable<T>`where `T` is a JSON serializable type<sup>1</sup> |
| Cosmos DB input (single document) | JSON serializable types<sup>1</sup><br/> | 
| Cosmos DB input (query returning multiple documents) | [CosmosClient]<br/>`IEnumerable<T>` where `T` is a JSON serializable type<sup>1</sup> |
| Cosmos DB output (single document) | JSON serializable types<sup>1</sup> |
| Cosmos DB output (multiple documents) | `ICollector<T>` or `IAsyncCollector<T>` where `T` is a JSON serializable type<sup>1</sup> |

<sup>1</sup> Documents containing JSON data can be deserialized into known plain-old CLR object (POCO) types.

# [Functions 2.x+](#tab/functionsv2/in-process)

Earlier versions of the extension exposed types from the now deprecated [Microsoft.Azure.Documents] namespace. Newer types from [Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos] are exclusive to **extension 4.x and higher**.

# [Extension 4.x+](#tab/extensionv4/isolated-process)

The isolated worker process supports parameter types according to the tables below. Support for binding to types from [Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos]is in preview.

**Cosmos DB trigger**

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-trigger-dotnet-isolated-types](../../includes/functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-trigger-dotnet-isolated-types.md)]

**Cosmos DB input binding**

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-input-dotnet-isolated-types](../../includes/functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-input-dotnet-isolated-types.md)]

**Cosmos DB output binding**

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-output-dotnet-isolated-types](../../includes/functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-output-dotnet-isolated-types.md)]

# [Functions 2.x+](#tab/functionsv2/isolated-process)

Earlier versions of extensions in the isolated worker process only support binding to JSON serializable types. Additional options are available to **extension 4.x and higher**.
