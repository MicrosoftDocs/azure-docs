# Manage your function app

In Azure Functions, a function app provides the execution context for your individual functions. Function app behaviors apply to all functions hosted by a given function app. All functions in a function app must be of the same [language](supported-languages.md).

Individual functions in a function app are deployed together and are scaled together. All functions in the same function app share resources, per instance, as the function app scales.

Connection strings, environment variables, and other application settings are defined separately for each function app. Any data that must be shared between function apps should be stored externally in a persisted store.

## Get started in the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [Don't mix development environments](../../includes/functions-mixed-dev-environments.md)]

To view the app settings in your function app, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal] using your Azure account. Search for your function app and select it.

2. In the left pane of your function app, expand **Settings**, select **Environment variables**, and then select the **App settings** tab.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings/azure-function-app-main.png" alt-text="Screen shot that how to select the App settings page in a function app." lightbox="./media/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings/azure-function-app-main.png":::

## <a name="settings"></a>Work with application settings

In addition to the predefined app settings used by Azure Functions, you can create any number of app settings, as required by your function code. For more information, see [App settings reference for Azure Functions](functions-app-settings.md).

These settings are stored encrypted. For more information, see [App settings security](security-concepts.md#application-settings).

You can manage app settings from the [Azure portal](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md?tabs=portal#settings), and by using the [Azure CLI](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md?tabs=azurecli#settings) and [Azure PowerShell](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md?tabs=powershell#settings). You can also manage app settings from [Visual Studio Code](functions-develop-vs-code.md#application-settings-in-azure) and from [Visual Studio](functions-develop-vs.md#function-app-settings).

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To view your app settings, see [Get started in the Azure portal](#get-started-in-the-azure-portal).

The **App settings** tab maintains settings that are used by your function app:

1. To see the values of the app settings, select **Show values**.

1. To add a setting, select **+ Add**, and then enter the **Name** and **Value** of the new key-value pair.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings/azure-function-app-settings-tab.png" alt-text="Screen shot that shows the App settings page in a function app." lightbox="./media/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings/azure-function-app-settings-tab.png":::

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

The [`az functionapp config appsettings list`](/cli/azure/functionapp/config/appsettings#az-functionapp-config-appsettings-list) command returns the existing application settings, for example:

```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp config appsettings list --name <FUNCTION_APP_NAME> \
--resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>
```

The [`az functionapp config appsettings set`](/cli/azure/functionapp/config/appsettings#az-functionapp-config-appsettings-set) command adds or updates an application setting. The following example creates a setting with a key named `CUSTOM_FUNCTION_APP_SETTING` and a value of `12345`:

```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp config appsettings set --name <FUNCTION_APP_NAME> \
--resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> \
--settings CUSTOM_FUNCTION_APP_SETTING=12345
```

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

The [`Get-AzFunctionAppSetting`](/powershell/module/az.functions/get-azfunctionappsetting) cmdlet returns the existing application settings, for example:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzFunctionAppSetting -Name <FUNCTION_APP_NAME> -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>
```

The [`Update-AzFunctionAppSetting`](/powershell/module/az.functions/update-azfunctionappsetting) command adds or updates an application setting. The following example creates a setting with a key named `CUSTOM_FUNCTION_APP_SETTING` and a value of `12345`:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Update-AzFunctionAppSetting -Name <FUNCTION_APP_NAME> -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> -AppSetting @{"CUSTOM_FUNCTION_APP_SETTING" = "12345"}
```

---

### Use application settings

[!INCLUDE [functions-environment-variables](../../includes/functions-environment-variables.md)]

When you develop a function app locally, you must maintain local copies of these values in the *local.settings.json* project file. For more information, see [Local settings file](functions-develop-local.md#local-settings-file).

## FTPS deployment settings

Azure Functions supports deploying project code to your function app by using FTPS. Because this deployment method requires you to [sync triggers](functions-deployment-technologies.md#trigger-syncing), it isn't recommended. To securely transfer project files, always use FTPS and not FTP.

To get the credentials required for FTPS deployment, use one of these methods:

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

You can get the FTPS publishing credentials in the Azure portal by downloading the publishing profile for your function app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The publishing profile contains important security credentials. Always secure the downloaded file on your local computer.  

[!INCLUDE [functions-download-publish-profile](../../includes/functions-download-publish-profile.md)]

3. In the file, locate the `publishProfile` element with the attribute `publishMethod="FTP"`. In this element, the `publishUrl`, `userName`, and `userPWD` attributes contain the target URL and credentials for FTPS publishing.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Run this Azure CLI command that returns the FTPS credentials from the publishing profile.

```azurecli
az functionapp deployment list-publishing-profiles --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group <GROUP_NAME> --query "[?publishMethod=='FTP'].{URL:publishUrl, username:userName, password:userPWD}" -o table
```

In this example, replace `<APP_NAME>` with your function app name and `<GROUP_NAME>` with the resource group. The returned `URL`, `username`, and `password` columns contain the target URL and credentials for FTPS publishing.

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Run this Azure PowerShell command that returns the FTPS credentials from the publishing profile.

```azurepowershell
$profile = [xml](Get-AzWebAppPublishingProfile -ResourceGroupName "<GROUP_NAME>" -Name "<APP_NAME>" -Format "Ftp") 
$profile.publishData.publishProfile | Where-Object -Property publishMethod -eq Ftp | Select-Object -Property @{Name="URL"; Expression = {$_.publishUrl}}, 
@{Name="username"; Expression = {$_.userName}}, @{Name="password"; Expression = {$_.userPWD}} | Format-Table
```

In this example, replace `<APP_NAME>` with your function app name and `<GROUP_NAME>` with the resource group. The returned `URL`, `username`, and `password` columns contain the target URL and credentials for FTPS publishing.

---

## Hosting plan type

When you create a function app, you also create a hosting plan in which the app runs. A plan can have one or more function apps. The functionality, scaling, and pricing of your functions depend on the type of plan. For more information, see [Azure Functions hosting options](functions-scale.md).

You can determine the type of plan being used by your function app from the Azure portal, or by using the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell APIs.

The following values indicate the plan type:

| Plan type | Azure portal | Azure CLI/PowerShell |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Consumption](consumption-plan.md) | **Consumption** | `Dynamic` |
| [Premium](functions-premium-plan.md) | **ElasticPremium** | `ElasticPremium` |
| [Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan.md) | Various | Various |

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. To determine the type of plan used by your function app, see the **App Service Plan** in the **Overview** page of the function app in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

   ![Screenshot that shows the App Service Plan link on the Overview page of a function app.](./media/functions-scale/function-app-overview-portal.png)

1. To see the pricing tier, select the name of the **App Service Plan**, and then select **Settings > Properties** from the left pane.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Run the following Azure CLI command to get your hosting plan type:

```azurecli-interactive
functionApp=<FUNCTION_APP_NAME>
resourceGroup=FunctionMonitoringExamples
appServicePlanId=$(az functionapp show --name $functionApp --resource-group $resourceGroup --query appServicePlanId --output tsv)
az appservice plan list --query "[?id=='$appServicePlanId'].sku.tier" --output tsv

```  

In the previous example, replace `<RESOURCE_GROUP>` and `<FUNCTION_APP_NAME>` with the resource group and function app names, respectively.

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Run the following Azure PowerShell command to get your hosting plan type:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$FunctionApp = '<FUNCTION_APP_NAME>'
$ResourceGroup = '<RESOURCE_GROUP>'

$PlanID = (Get-AzFunctionApp -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup -Name $FunctionApp).AppServicePlan
(Get-AzFunctionAppPlan -Name $PlanID -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup).SkuTier
```

In the previous example, replace `<RESOURCE_GROUP>` and `<FUNCTION_APP_NAME>` with the resource group and function app names, respectively.

---

## Plan migration

You can migrate a function app between a Consumption plan and a Premium plan on Windows. When migrating between plans, keep in mind the following considerations:

+ Direct migration to a Dedicated (App Service) plan isn't supported.
+ Migration isn't supported on Linux.
+ The source plan and the target plan must be in the same resource group and geographical region. For more information, see [Move an app to another App Service plan](../app-service/app-service-plan-manage.md#move-an-app-to-another-app-service-plan).
+ The specific CLI commands depend on the direction of the migration.
+ Downtime in your function executions occurs as the function app is migrated between plans.
+ State and other app-specific content is maintained, because the same Azure Files share is used by the app both before and after migration.

You can migrate your plan using these tools:

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

You can use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to switch to a different plan.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

You can use the Azure CLI commands to manually create a new plan, switch your app to use the new plan, and delete the original plan.

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

You can use Azure PowerShell commands to manually create a new plan, switch your app to use the new plan, and delete the original plan.

---

Choose the direction of the migration for your app on Windows.

### [Consumption-to-Premium](#tab/to-premium/azure-portal)

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Consumption plan app and choose **Change App Service plan** under **App Service plan**.

1. Select **Premium** under **Plan type**, create a new Premium plan, and select **OK**.

For more information, see [Move an app to another App Service plan](../app-service/app-service-plan-manage.md#move-an-app-to-another-app-service-plan).

### [Premium-to-Consumption](#tab/to-consumption/azure-portal)

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Premium plan app and choose **Change App Service plan** under **App Service plan**.

1. Select **Consumption** under **Plan type**, create a new Consumption plan, and select **OK**.

For more information, see [Move an app to another App Service plan](../app-service/app-service-plan-manage.md#move-an-app-to-another-app-service-plan).

### [Consumption-to-Premium](#tab/to-premium/azure-cli)

Use the following procedure to migrate from a Consumption plan to a Premium plan on Windows:

1. Run the [az functionapp create](/cli/azure/functionapp/plan#az-functionapp-plan-create) command as follows to create a new App Service plan (Elastic Premium) in the same region and resource group as your existing function app:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az functionapp plan create --name <NEW_PREMIUM_PLAN_NAME> --resource-group <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP> --location <REGION> --sku EP1
    ```

1. Run the [az functionapp update](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-update) command as follows to migrate the existing function app to the new Premium plan:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az functionapp update --name <MY_APP_NAME> --resource-group <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP> --plan <NEW_PREMIUM_PLAN>
    ```

1. When you no longer need the Consumption plan originally used by the app, delete your original plan after confirming you've successfully migrated to the new one. Run the [az functionapp plan list](/cli/azure/functionapp/plan#az-functionapp-plan-list) command as follows to get a list of all Consumption plans in your resource group:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az functionapp plan list --resource-group <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP> --query "[?sku.family=='Y'].{PlanName:name,Sites:numberOfSites}" -o table
    ```

    You can safely delete the plan with zero sites, which is the one you migrated from.

1. Run the [az functionapp plan delete](/cli/azure/functionapp/plan#az-functionapp-plan-delete) command as follows to delete the Consumption plan you migrated from.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az functionapp plan delete --name <CONSUMPTION_PLAN_NAME> --resource-group <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP>
    ```

### [Premium-to-Consumption](#tab/to-consumption/azure-cli)

Use the following procedure to migrate from a Premium plan to a Consumption plan on Windows:

1. Run the [az functionapp create](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command as follows to create a new function app (Consumption) in the same region and resource group as your existing function app. This command also creates a new Consumption plan in which the function app runs:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az functionapp create --resource-group <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <NEW_CONSUMPTION_APP_NAME> --consumption-plan-location <REGION> --runtime <LANGUAGE_RUNTIME> --functions-version 4 --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME>
    ```

1. Run the [az functionapp show](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-show) command as follows to get the name of the Consumption plan created with the new function app:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az functionapp show --resource-group <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <NEW_CONSUMPTION_APP_NAME> --query "{appServicePlanId}" -o tsv
    ```

    The Consumption plan name is the final segment of the fully qualified resource ID that is returned.

1. Run the [az functionapp update](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-update) command as follows to migrate the existing function app to the new Consumption plan:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az functionapp update --name <MY_APP_NAME> --resource-group <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP> --plan <NEW_CONSUMPTION_PLAN> --force
    ```

1. Run the [az functionapp delete](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-delete) command as follows to delete the function app you created in step 1, since you only need the plan that was created to run the existing function app:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az functionapp delete --name <NEW_CONSUMPTION_APP_NAME> --resource-group <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP>
    ```

1. When you no longer need the Premium plan originally used by the app, delete your original plan after confirming you've successfully migrated to the new one. Until the Premium plan is deleted, you continue to be charged for it. Run the [az functionapp plan list](/cli/azure/functionapp/plan#az-functionapp-plan-list) command as follows to get a list of all Premium plans in your resource group:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az functionapp plan list --resource-group <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP> --query "[?sku.family=='EP'].{PlanName:name,Sites:numberOfSites}" -o table
    ```

1. Run the [az functionapp plan delete](/cli/azure/functionapp/plan#az-functionapp-plan-delete) command as follows to delete the Premium plan you migrated from:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az functionapp plan delete --name <PREMIUM_PLAN> --resource-group <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP>
    ```

### [Consumption-to-Premium](#tab/to-premium/azure-powershell)

Use the following procedure to migrate from a Consumption plan to a Premium plan on Windows:

1. Run the [New-AzFunctionAppPlan](/powershell/module/az.functions/new-azfunctionappplan) command as follows to create a new App Service plan (Elastic Premium) in the same region and resource group as your existing function app:

    ```powershell-interactive
    New-AzFunctionAppPlan -Name <NEW_PREMIUM_PLAN_NAME> -ResourceGroupName <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP> -Location <REGION> -Sku EP1 -WorkerType Windows
    ```

1. Run the [Update-AzFunctionApp](/powershell/module/az.functions/update-azfunctionapp) command as follows to migrate the existing function app to the new Premium plan:

    ```powershell-interactive
    Update-AzFunctionApp -Name <MY_APP_NAME> -ResourceGroupName <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP> -PlanName <NEW_PREMIUM_PLAN> -Force
    ```

1. When you no longer need the Consumption plan originally used by the app, you can run the [Remove-AzFunctionAppPlan](/powershell/module/az.functions/remove-azfunctionappplan) command as follows to delete the Consumption plan you migrated from:

    ```powershell-interactive
    Remove-AzFunctionAppPlan -Name <CONSUMPTION_PLAN_NAME> -ResourceGroupName <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP> -Force
    ```

### [Premium-to-Consumption](#tab/to-consumption/azure-powershell)

Use the following procedure to migrate from a Premium plan to a Consumption plan on Windows:

1. Run the [New-AzFunctionApp](/powershell/module/az.functions/new-azfunctionapp) command as follows to create a new function app (Consumption) in the same region and resource group as your existing function app. This command also creates a new Consumption plan in which the function app runs:

    ```powershell-interactive
    New-AzFunctionApp -Name <NEW_CONSUMPTION_APP_NAME> -StorageAccountName <STORAGE_NAME> -Location <REGION> -ResourceGroupName <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP> -Runtime <LANGUAGE_RUNTIME> -RuntimeVersion <LANGUAGE_VERSION> -FunctionsVersion 4 -OSType Windows
    ```

1. Run the [Get-AzFunctionApp](/powershell/module/az.functions/get-azfunctionapp) command as follows to get the name of the Consumption plan created with the new function app:

    ```powershell-interactive
    Get-AzFunctionApp -ResourceGroupName <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP> -Name <NEW_CONSUMPTION_APP_NAME> | Select-Object -Property AppServicePlan | Format-List
    ```

1. Run the [Update-AzFunctionApp](/powershell/module/az.functions/update-azfunctionapp) command as follows to migrate the existing function app to the new Consumption plan:

    ```powershell-interactive
    Update-AzFunctionApp -Name <MY_APP_NAME> -ResourceGroupName <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP> -PlanName <NEW_CONSUMPTION_PLAN> -Force
    ```

1. When you no longer need the Consumption plan originally used by the app, you can run the [Remove-AzFunctionAppPlan](/powershell/module/az.functions/remove-azfunctionappplan) command as follows to delete the Consumption plan you migrated from:

    ```powershell-interactive
    Remove-AzFunctionAppPlan -Name <CONSUMPTION_PLAN_NAME> -ResourceGroupName <MY_RESOURCE_GROUP> -Force
    ```

## Development limitations in the Azure portal

The following table shows the operating systems and languages that support in-portal editing:

| Language | Windows Consumption | Windows Premium | Windows Dedicated | Linux Consumption | Linux Premium | Linux Dedicated |
|-|:-----------------: |:----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------:|:---------------:|
| C# | | | | | |
| Java | | | | | | |
| JavaScript (Node.js) |✔|✔|✔| |✔|✔|
| Python | | | |✔ |✔ |✔ |
| PowerShell |✔|✔|✔| | | |
| TypeScript (Node.js) | | | | | | |

Consider these limitations when you develop your functions in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com):

+ In-portal editing is supported only for functions that were created or last modified in the Azure portal.
+ In-portal editing is supported only for JavaScript, PowerShell, Python, and C# Script functions.
+ In-portal editing isn't currently supported by the [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan.md#considerations).
+ When you deploy code to a function app from outside the Azure portal, you can no longer edit any of the code for that function app in the portal. In this case, just continue using [local development](functions-develop-local.md).
+ For Python, development with custom modules isn't currently supported in the portal. To add custom modules to your function app, you must [develop your app locally](functions-develop-local.md).
+ For compiled C# functions and Java functions, you can create the function app and related resources in the portal. However, you must create the functions code project locally and then publish it to Azure.

When possible, develop your functions locally and publish your code project to a function app in Azure. For more information, see [Code and test Azure Functions locally](functions-develop-local.md).

## Manually install extensions

C# class library functions can include the NuGet packages for [binding extensions](functions-bindings-register.md) directly in the class library project. For other non-.NET languages and C# script, you should [use extension bundles](functions-bindings-register.md#extension-bundles). If you must manually install extensions, you can do so by [using Azure Functions Core Tools](./functions-core-tools-reference.md#func-extensions-install) locally. If you can't use extension bundles and are only able to work in the portal, you need to use [Advanced Tools (Kudu)](#kudu) to manually create the extensions.csproj file directly in the site. Make sure to first remove the `extensionBundle` element from the *host.json* file.

This same process works for any other file you need to add to your app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When possible, don't edit files directly in your function app in Azure. We recommend [downloading your app files locally](deployment-zip-push.md#download-your-function-app-files), using [Core Tools to install extensions](./functions-core-tools-reference.md#func-extensions-install) and other packages, validating your changes, and then [republishing your app using Core Tools](functions-run-local.md#publish) or one of the other [supported deployment methods](functions-deployment-technologies.md#deployment-methods).

The Functions editor built into the Azure portal lets you update your function code and configuration files directly in the portal:

1. Select your function app, then under **Functions**, select **Functions**.

1. Choose your function and select **Code + test** under **Developer**.

1. Choose your file to edit and select **Save** when you finish.

Files in the root of the app, such as function.proj or extensions.csproj need to be created and edited by using the [Advanced Tools (Kudu)](#kudu):

1. Select your function app, expand **Development tools**, and then select **Advanced tools** > **Go**.
1. If prompted, sign in to the Source Control Manager (SCM) site with your Azure credentials.
1. From the **Debug console** menu, choose **CMD**.
1. Navigate to `.\site\wwwroot`, select the plus (**+**) button at the top, and select **New file**.
1. Give the file a name, such as `extensions.csproj`, and then press Enter.
1. Select the edit button next to the new file, add or update code in the file, and then select **Save**.
1. For a project file like *extensions.csproj*, run the following command to rebuild the extensions project:

    ```bash
    dotnet build extensions.csproj
    ```

## Platform features

Function apps run in the Azure App Service platform, which maintains them. As such, your function apps have access to most of the features of Azure's core web hosting platform. When you use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), the left pane is where you access the many features of the App Service platform that you can use in your function apps.

The following matrix indicates Azure portal feature support by hosting plan and operating system:

| Feature | Consumption plan | Flex Consumption plan | Premium plan  | Dedicated plan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Advanced tools (Kudu)](#kudu) | Windows: ✔ <br/>Linux: **X** | **X** | ✔ | ✔|
| [App Service editor](#editor) | Windows: ✔ <br/>Linux: **X**   | **X** | Windows: ✔ <br/>Linux: **X** | Windows: ✔ <br/>Linux: **X**|
| [Backups](../app-service/manage-backup.md) |**X** |**X** | **X** | ✔|
| [Console](#console) | Windows: command-line <br/>Linux: **X** | **X** | Windows: command-line <br/>Linux: SSH | Windows: command-line <br/>Linux: SSH |

The rest of this article focuses on the following features in the portal that are useful for your function apps:

+ [App Service editor](#editor)
+ [Console](#console)
+ [Advanced tools (Kudu)](#kudu)
+ [Deployment options](#deployment)
+ [CORS](#cors)
+ [Authentication](#auth)

For more information about how to work with App Service settings, see [Configure Azure App Service Settings](../app-service/configure-common.md).

### <a name="editor"></a>App Service editor

The App Service editor is an advanced in-portal editor that you can use to modify JSON configuration files and code files alike. Choosing this option launches a separate browser tab with a basic editor. This editor enables you to integrate with the Git repository, run and debug code, and modify function app settings. This editor provides an enhanced development environment for your functions compared with the built-in function editor.

![Screenshot that shows the App Service editor.](./media/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings/configure-function-app-appservice-editor.png)

We recommend that you consider developing your functions on your local computer. When you develop locally and publish to Azure, your project files are read-only in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Code and test Azure Functions locally](functions-develop-local.md).

### <a name="console"></a>Console

The in-portal console is an ideal developer tool when you prefer to interact with your function app from the command line. Common commands include directory and file creation and navigation, as well as executing batch files and scripts.

![Screenshot that shows the function app console.](./media/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings/configure-function-console.png)

When developing locally, we recommend using the [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md) and the [Azure CLI].

### <a name="kudu"></a>Advanced tools (Kudu)

The advanced tools for App Service (also known as Kudu) provide access to advanced administrative features of your function app. From Kudu, you manage system information, app settings, environment variables, site extensions, HTTP headers, and server variables. You can also launch **Kudu** by browsing to the SCM endpoint for your function app, for example: `https://<myfunctionapp>.scm.azurewebsites.net/`.

![Screenshot that shows the advanced tools for App Service (Kudo).](./media/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings/configure-function-app-kudu.png)

### <a name="deployment"></a>Deployment Center

When you use a source control solution to develop and maintain your functions code, Deployment Center lets you build and deploy from source control. Your project is built and deployed to Azure when you make updates. For more information, see [Deployment technologies in Azure Functions](functions-deployment-technologies.md).

### <a name="cors"></a>Cross-origin resource sharing

To prevent malicious code execution on the client, modern browsers block requests from web applications to resources running in a separate domain. [Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) lets an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header declare which origins are allowed to call endpoints on your function app.

#### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

When you configure the **Allowed origins** list for your function app, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is automatically added to all responses from HTTP endpoints in your function app.

![Screenshot that shows how to configure CORS list of your function app.](./media/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings/configure-function-app-cors.png)

If there's another domain entry, the wildcard (\*) is ignored.

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Use the [`az functionapp cors add`](/cli/azure/functionapp/cors#az-functionapp-cors-add) command to add a domain to the allowed origins list. The following example adds the contoso.com domain:

```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp cors add --name <FUNCTION_APP_NAME> \
--resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> \
--allowed-origins https://contoso.com
```

Use the [`az functionapp cors show`](/cli/azure/functionapp/cors#az-functionapp-cors-show) command to list the current allowed origins.

#### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

You can't currently update CORS settings using Azure PowerShell.

---

### <a name="auth"></a>Authentication

When functions use an HTTP trigger, you can require calls to first be authenticated. App Service supports Microsoft Entra authentication and sign-in with social providers, such as Facebook, Microsoft, and X. For information about configuring specific authentication providers, see [Azure App Service authentication overview](../app-service/overview-authentication-authorization.md).

![Screenshot that shows how to configure authentication for a function app.](./media/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings/configure-function-app-authentication.png)
