# Azure Functions Core Tools reference

This article provides reference documentation for the Azure Functions Core Tools, which lets you develop, manage, and deploy Azure Functions projects from your local computer. To learn more about using Core Tools, see [Work with Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md). 

Core Tools commands are organized into the following contexts, each providing a unique set of actions.

| Command context | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| [`func`](#func-init) | Commands used to create and run functions on your local computer. |
| [`func azure`](#func-azure-functionapp-fetch-app-settings) | Commands for working with Azure resources, including publishing. |
| [`func azurecontainerapps`](#func-azurecontainerapps-deploy) | Deploy containerized function app to Azure Container Apps. |
| [`func durable`](#func-durable-delete-task-hub)    | Commands for working with [Durable Functions](./durable/durable-functions-overview.md). |
| [`func extensions`](#func-extensions-install) | Commands for installing and managing extensions. |
| [`func kubernetes`](#func-kubernetes-deploy) | Commands for working with Kubernetes and Azure Functions. |
| [`func settings`](#func-settings-decrypt)   | Commands for managing environment settings for the local Functions host. |
| [`func templates`](#func-templates-list)  | Commands for listing available function templates. |

Before using the commands in this article, you must [install the Core Tools](functions-run-local.md#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools). 

## `func init`

Creates a new Functions project in a specific language.

```command
func init <PROJECT_FOLDER>
```

When you supply `<PROJECT_FOLDER>`, the project is created in a new folder with this name. Otherwise, the current folder is used.

`func init` supports the following options, which don't support version 1.x unless otherwise noted:

| Option     | Description                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **`--csx`** | Creates .NET functions as C# script, which is the version 1.x behavior. Valid only with `--worker-runtime dotnet`. |
| **`--docker`** | Creates a Dockerfile for a container using a base image that is based on the chosen `--worker-runtime`. Use this option when you plan to deploy a containerized function app. |
| **`--docker-only`** |  Adds a Dockerfile to an existing project. Prompts for the worker-runtime if not specified or set in local.settings.json. Use this option when you plan to deploy a containerized function app and the project already exists. |
| **`--force`** | Initialize the project even when there are existing files in the project. This setting overwrites existing files with the same name. Other files in the project folder aren't affected. |
| **`--language`** | Initializes a language-specific project. Currently supported when `--worker-runtime` set to `node`. Options are `typescript` and `javascript`. You can also use `--worker-runtime javascript` or `--worker-runtime typescript`.  |
| **`--managed-dependencies`**  | Installs managed dependencies. Currently, only the PowerShell worker runtime supports this functionality. |
| **`--model`** | Sets the desired programming model for a target language when more than one model is available. Supported options are `V1` and `V2` for Python and `V3` and `V4` for Node.js. For more information, see the [Python developer guide](functions-reference-python.md#programming-model) and the [Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node.md), respectively. |
| **`--source-control`** | Controls whether a git repository is created. By default, a repository isn't created. When `true`, a repository is created. |
| **`--worker-runtime`** | Sets the language runtime for the project. Supported values are: `csharp`, `dotnet`, `dotnet-isolated`, `javascript`,`node` (JavaScript), `powershell`, `python`, and `typescript`. For Java, use [Maven](functions-reference-java.md#create-java-functions). To generate a language-agnostic project with just the project files, use `custom`. When not set, you're prompted to choose your runtime during initialization. |
| **`--target-framework`** | Sets the target framework for the function app project. Valid only with `--worker-runtime dotnet-isolated`. Supported values are: `net9.0` (preview), `net8.0` (default), `net6.0`, and `net48` (.NET Framework 4.8). |
|

> [!NOTE]
> When you use either `--docker` or `--docker-only` options, Core Tools automatically create the Dockerfile for C#, JavaScript, Python, and PowerShell functions. For Java functions, you must manually create the Dockerfile. For more information, see [Creating containerized function apps](functions-how-to-custom-container.md#creating-containerized-function-apps).

## `func logs`

Gets logs for functions running in a Kubernetes cluster.

```
func logs --platform kubernetes --name <APP_NAME>
``` 

The `func logs` action supports the following options:

| Option     | Description                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **`--platform`** | Hosting platform for the function app. Supported options: `kubernetes`. |
| **`--name`** | Function app name in Azure. |

To learn more, see [Azure Functions on Kubernetes with KEDA](functions-kubernetes-keda.md).

## `func new`

Creates a new function in the current project based on a template.

```
func new
``` 

When you run `func new` without the `--template` option, you're prompted to choose a template. In version 1.x, you're also required to choose the language. 

The `func new` action supports the following options:

| Option     | Description                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **`--authlevel`** | Lets you set the authorization level for an HTTP trigger. Supported values are: `function`, `anonymous`, `admin`. Authorization isn't enforced when running locally. For more information, see [Authorization level](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger.md#http-auth). |
| **`--csx`** | (Version 2.x and later versions.) Generates the same C# script (.csx) templates used in version 1.x and in the portal. |
| **`--language`**, **`-l`**| The template programming language, such as C#, F#, or JavaScript. This option is required in version 1.x. In version 2.x and later versions, you don't use this option because the language is defined by the worker runtime. |
| **`--name`**, **`-n`** | The function name. |
| **`--template`**, **`-t`** | Use the `func templates list` command to see the complete list of available templates for each supported language.   |

To learn more, see [Create a function](functions-run-local.md#create-func).

## `func run`

*Version 1.x only.*

Enables you to invoke a function directly, which is similar to running a function using the **Test** tab in the Azure portal. This action is only supported in version 1.x. For later versions, use `func start` and [call the function endpoint directly](functions-run-local.md#run-a-local-function).

```command
func run
```

The `func run` action supports the following options:

| Option     | Description                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **`--content`** | Inline content passed to the function. |
| **`--debug`** | Attach a debugger to the host process before running the function.|
| **`--file`** | The file name to use as content.|
| **`--no-interactive`** | Doesn't prompt for input, which is useful for automation scenarios.|
| **`--timeout`** | Time to wait (in seconds) until the local Functions host is ready.|

For example, to call an HTTP-triggered function and pass content body, run the following command:

```
func run MyHttpTrigger --content '{\"name\": \"Azure\"}'
```

## `func start`

Starts the local runtime host and loads the function project in the current folder. 

The specific command depends on the [runtime version](functions-versions.md).   

### [v2.x+](#tab/v2)

```command
func start
```

`func start` supports the following options:

| Option     | Description                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **`--cert`** | The path to a .pfx file that contains a private key. Only supported with `--useHttps`. |
| **`--cors`** | A comma-separated list of CORS origins, with no spaces. |
| **`--cors-credentials`** | Allow cross-origin authenticated requests using cookies and the Authentication header. |
| **`--dotnet-isolated-debug`** | When set to `true`, pauses the .NET worker process until a debugger is attached from the .NET isolated project being debugged. |
| **`--enable-json-output`** | Emits console logs as JSON, when possible. |
| **`--enableAuth`** | Enable full authentication handling pipeline, with authorization requirements. |
| **`--functions`** | A space-separated list of functions to load. |
| **`--language-worker`** | Arguments to configure the language worker. For example, you can enable debugging for language worker by providing [debug port and other required arguments](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/wiki/Enable-Debugging-for-language-workers). |
| **`--no-build`** | Don't build the current project before running. For .NET class projects only. The default is `false`.  |
| **`--password`** | Either the password or a file that contains the password for a .pfx file. Only used with `--cert`. |
| **`--port`** | The local port to listen on. Default value: 7071. |
| **`--timeout`** | The timeout for the Functions host to start, in seconds. Default: 20 seconds.|
| **`--useHttps`** | Bind to `https://localhost:{port}` rather than to `http://localhost:{port}`. By default, this option creates a trusted certificate on your computer.|

With the project running, you can [verify individual function endpoints](functions-run-local.md#run-a-local-function).

### [v1.x](#tab/v1)

```command
func host start
```

`func start` supports the following options:

| Option     | Description                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |

| **`--port`** | The local port to listen on. Default value: 7071. |
| **`--pause-on-error`** | Pause for more input before exiting the process. Used only when launching Core Tools from an integrated development environment (IDE).|
| **`--script-root`** | Used to specify the path to the root of the function app that is to be run or deployed. This is used for compiled projects that generate project files into a subfolder. For example, when you build a C# class library project, the host.json, local.settings.json, and function.json files are generated in a *root* subfolder with a path like `MyProject/bin/Debug/netstandard2.0`. In this case, set the prefix as `--script-root MyProject/bin/Debug/netstandard2.0`. This is the root of the function app when running in Azure. |
| **`--timeout`** | The timeout for the Functions host to start, in seconds. Default: 20 seconds.|
| **`--useHttps`** | Bind to `https://localhost:{port}` rather than to `http://localhost:{port}`. By default, this option creates a trusted certificate on your computer.|

In version 1.x, you can also use the [`func run`](#func-run) command to run a specific function and pass test data to it.

| **`--configPath`** | Path of the directory containing extensions.csproj file.|
| **`--csx`** |   Supports C# scripting (.csx) projects. |
| **`--force`** |  Update the versions of existing extensions. |
| **`--output`** |  Output path for the extensions. |
| **`--package`** |   Identifier for a specific extension package. When not specified, all referenced extensions are installed, as with `func extensions sync`.|
| **`--source`** |  NuGet feed source when not using NuGet.org.|
| **`--version`** |  Extension package version. |

The following example installs version 5.0.1 of the Event Hubs extension in the local project:

```command
func extensions install --package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs --version 5.0.1
```

The following considerations apply when using `func extensions install`:

+ For compiled C# projects (both in-process and isolated worker process), instead use standard NuGet package installation methods, such as `dotnet add package`.

+ To manually install extensions using Core Tools, you must have the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.

+ When possible, you should instead use [extension bundles](functions-bindings-register.md#extension-bundles). The following are some reasons why you might need to install extensions manually:

    + You need to access a specific version of an extension not available in a bundle.
    + You need to access a custom extension not available in a bundle.
    + You need to access a specific combination of extensions not available in a single bundle.

+ Before you can manually install extensions, you must first remove the [`extensionBundle`](functions-host-json.md#extensionbundle) object from the host.json file that defines the bundle. No action is taken when an extension bundle is already set in your [host.json file](functions-host-json.md#extensionbundle).

+ The first time you explicitly install an extension, a .NET project file named extensions.csproj is added to the root of your app project. This file defines the set of NuGet packages required by your functions. While you can work with the [NuGet package references](/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files) in this file, Core Tools lets you install extensions without having to manually edit this C# project file.

## `func extensions sync`

Installs all extensions added to the function app.

The `sync` action supports the following options:

| Option     | Description                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **`--configPath`** | Path of the directory containing extensions.csproj file.|
| **`--csx`** |   Supports C# scripting (.csx) projects. |
| **`--output`** |  Output path for the extensions. |

Regenerates a missing extensions.csproj file. No action is taken when an extension bundle is defined in your host.json file.

## `func kubernetes deploy`

Deploys a Functions project as a custom docker container to a Kubernetes cluster.

```command
func kubernetes deploy 
```

This command builds your project as a custom container and publishes it to a Kubernetes cluster. Custom containers must have a Dockerfile. To create an app with a Dockerfile, use the `--dockerfile` option with the [`func init`](#func-init) command. 

The following Kubernetes deployment options are available:

| Option     | Description                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **`--dry-run`** | Optionally displays the deployment template, without execution. |
| **`--config-map-name`** | Optional name of an existing config map with [function app settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings) to use in the deployment. Requires `--use-config-map`. The default behavior is to create settings based on the `Values` object in the [local.settings.json file].|
| **`--cooldown-period`** | The cool-down period (in seconds) after all triggers are no longer active before the deployment scales back down to zero, with a default of 300 s. |
| **`--ignore-errors`** | Continues the deployment after a resource returns an error. The default behavior is to stop on error. |
| **`--image-name`** | The name of the image to use for the pod deployment and from which to read functions. |
| **`--keda-version`** | Sets the version of KEDA to install. Valid options are: `v1` and `v2` (default). |
| **`--keys-secret-name`** | The name of a Kubernetes Secrets collection to use for storing [access keys](function-keys-how-to.md). |
| **`--max-replicas`** | Sets the maximum replica count for to which the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) scales. |
| **`--min-replicas`** | Sets the minimum replica count below which HPA won't scale. |
| **`--mount-funckeys-as-containervolume`** | Mounts the [access keys](function-keys-how-to.md) as a container volume. |
| **`--name`** | The name used for the deployment and other artifacts in Kubernetes. |
| **`--namespace`** | Sets the Kubernetes namespace to which to deploy, which defaults to the default namespace. |
| **`--no-docker`** | Functions are read from the current directory instead of from an image. Requires mounting the image filesystem. |
| **`--registry`** | When set, a Docker build is run and the image is pushed to a registry of that name. You can't use `--registry` with `--image-name`. For Docker, use your username. |
| **`--polling-interval`** | The polling interval (in seconds) for checking non-HTTP triggers, with a default of 30s. |
| **`--pull-secret`** | The secret used to access private registry credentials. |
| **`--secret-name`** | The name of an existing Kubernetes Secrets collection that contains [function app settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings) to use in the deployment. The default behavior is to create settings based on the `Values` object in the [local.settings.json file]. |
| **`--show-service-fqdn`** | Displays the URLs of HTTP triggers with the Kubernetes FQDN instead of the default behavior of using an IP address. |
| **`--service-type`** | Sets the type of Kubernetes Service. Supported values are: `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, and `LoadBalancer` (default). |
| **`--use-config-map`** | Use a `ConfigMap` object (v1) instead of a `Secret` object (v1) to configure [function app settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings). The map name is set using `--config-map-name`.|

Core Tools uses the local Docker CLI to build and publish the image. Make sure your Docker is already installed locally. Run the `docker login` command to connect to your account.

Azure Functions supports hosting your containerized functions either in Azure Container Apps or in Azure Functions. Running your containers directly in a Kubernetes cluster or in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) isn't officially supported by Azure Functions. To learn more, see [Linux container support in Azure Functions](container-concepts.md).
