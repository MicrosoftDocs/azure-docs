# Azure Cache for Redis output binding for Azure Functions

The Azure Cache for Redis output bindings lets you change the keys in a cache based on a set of available trigger on the cache.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-cache.md).

## Scope of availability for functions bindings

| Binding Type    | Azure Managed Redis | Azure Cache for Redis |
|---------|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| Output | Yes   | Yes               |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using Azure Managed Redis or the Enterprise tiers of Azure Cache for Redis, use port 10000 rather than port 6380 or 6379.

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-csharp-intro](../../includes/functions-bindings-csharp-intro.md)]

The following example shows a pub/sub trigger on the set event with an output binding to the same Redis instance. The set event triggers the cache and the output binding returns a delete command for the key that triggered the function.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
>For .NET functions, using the _isolated worker_ model is recommended over the _in-process_ model. For a comparison of the _in-process_ and _isolated worker_ models, see differences between the _isolated worker_ model and the _in-process_ model for .NET on Azure Functions.

### [Isolated process](#tab/isolated-process)

```c#

using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Redis.Samples.RedisOutputBinding
{
    internal class SetDeleter
    {
        [Function(nameof(SetDeleter))]
        [RedisOutput(Common.connectionString, "DEL")]
        public static string Run(
            [RedisPubSubTrigger(Common.connectionString, "__keyevent@0__:set")] string key,
            ILogger logger)
        {
            logger.LogInformation($"Deleting recently SET key '{key}'");
            return key;
        }
    }
}
```

---

### [In-process](#tab/in-process)

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Redis.Samples.RedisOutputBinding
{
    internal class SetDeleter
    {
        [FunctionName(nameof(SetDeleter))]
        public static void Run(
            [RedisPubSubTrigger(Common.connectionStringSetting, "__keyevent@0__:set")] string key,
            [Redis(Common.connectionStringSetting, "DEL")] out string[] arguments,
            ILogger logger)
        {
            logger.LogInformation($"Deleting recently SET key '{key}'");
            arguments = new string[] { key };
        }
    }
}
```

<!---Note: it might be confusing that the binding `name` and the parameter name are the same in these examples. --->
```java
package com.function.RedisOutputBinding;

import com.microsoft.azure.functions.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.redis.annotation.*;

public class SetDeleter {
    @FunctionName("SetDeleter")
    @RedisOutput(
                name = "value",
                connection = "redisConnectionString",
                command = "DEL")
    public String run(
            @RedisPubSubTrigger(
                name = "key",
                connection = "redisConnectionString",
                channel = "__keyevent@0__:set")
                String key,
            final ExecutionContext context) {
        context.getLogger().info("Deleting recently SET key '" + key + "'");
        return key;
    }
}

```

This example shows a pub/sub trigger on the set event with an output binding to the same Redis instance. The set event triggers the cache and the output binding returns a delete command for the key that triggered the function.

### [Model v3](#tab/nodejs-v3)

The bindings are defined in the `function.json`` file:

```json
{
    "bindings": [
        {
            "type": "redisPubSubTrigger",
            "connection": "redisConnectionString",
            "channel": "__keyevent@0__:set",
            "name": "key",
            "direction": "in"
        },
        {
            "type": "redis",
            "connection": "redisConnectionString",
            "command": "DEL",
            "name": "$return",
            "direction": "out"
        }
    ],
    "scriptFile": "index.js"
}
```

This code from the `index.js` file takes the key from the trigger and returns it to the output binding to delete the cached item.

```javascript
module.exports = async function (context, key) {
    context.log("Deleting recently SET key '" + key + "'");
    return key;
}

```

### [Model v4](#tab/nodejs-v4)

<!--- Replace with the following when Node.js v4 is supported:
[!INCLUDE [functions-nodejs-model-tabs-description](../../includes/functions-nodejs-model-tabs-description.md)]
-->
[!INCLUDE [functions-nodejs-model-tabs-redis-preview](../../includes/functions-nodejs-model-tabs-redis-preview.md)]

This example shows a pub/sub trigger on the set event with an output binding to the same Redis instance. The set event triggers the cache and the output binding returns a delete command for the key that triggered the function.

The bindings are defined in this `function.json` file:

```json
{
    "bindings": [
        {
            "type": "redisPubSubTrigger",
            "connection": "redisLocalhost",
            "channel": "__keyevent@0__:set",
            "name": "key",
            "direction": "in"
        },
        {
            "type": "redis",
            "connection": "redisLocalhost",
            "command": "DEL",
            "name": "retVal",
            "direction": "out"
        }
    ],
    "scriptFile": "run.ps1"
}

```

This code from the `run.ps1` file takes the key from the trigger and passes it to the output binding to delete the cached item.

```powershell
param($key, $TriggerMetadata)
Write-Host "Deleting recently SET key '$key'"
Push-OutputBinding -Name retVal -Value $key
```

### [v1](#tab/python-v1)

The bindings are defined in this `function.json` file:

```json
{
    "bindings": [
        {
            "type": "redisPubSubTrigger",
            "connection": "redisLocalhost",
            "channel": "__keyevent@0__:set",
            "name": "key",
            "direction": "in"
        },
        {
            "type": "redis",
            "connection": "redisLocalhost",
            "command": "DEL",
            "name": "$return",
            "direction": "out"
        }
    ],
    "scriptFile": "__init__.py"
}
```

This code from the `__init__.py` file takes the key from the trigger and passes it to the output binding to delete the cached item.

```python
import logging

def main(key: str) -> str:
    logging.info("Deleting recently SET key '" + key + "'")
    return key
```

## Attributes

> [!NOTE]
> All commands are supported for this binding.

The way in which you define an output binding parameter depends on whether your C# functions runs [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library.md) or in an [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md).

The output binding is defined this way:

| Definition | Example | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| On an `out` parameter | `[Redis(<Connection>, <Command>)] out string <Return_Variable>` | The string variable returned by the method is a key value that the binding uses to execute the command against the specific cache. |

In this case, the type returned by the method is a key value that the binding uses to execute the command against the specific cache.

When your function has multiple output bindings, you can instead apply the binding attribute to the property of a type that is a key value, which the binding uses to execute the command against the specific cache. For more information, see [Multiple output bindings](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md#multiple-output-bindings).

---

Regardless of the C# process mode, the same properties are supported by the output binding attribute:

| Attribute property | Description  |
|--------------------| -------------|
| `Connection`  | The name of the [application setting](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings) that contains the cache connection string, such as: `<cacheName>.redis.cache.windows.net:6380,password...` |
| `Command`  | The redis-cli command to be executed on the cache, such as:  `DEL`.  |

::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"  

## Annotations

The `RedisOutput` annotation supports these properties:

| Property | Description                            |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `name` | The name of the specific input binding. |
| `connection`   | The name of the [application setting](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings) that contains the cache connection string, such as: `<cacheName>.redis.cache.windows.net:6380,password...` |
| `command` | The redis-cli command to be executed on the cache, such as:  `DEL`. |

::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript,programming-language-powershell,programming-language-python"  

## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the _function.json_ file.

| Property | Description                            |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `name` | The name of the specific input binding. |
| `connection`   | The name of the [application setting](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings) that contains the cache connection string, such as: `<cacheName>.redis.cache.windows.net:6380,password...` |
| `command` | The redis-cli command to be executed on the cache, such as:  `DEL`. |

::: zone-end

See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

The output returns a string, which is the key of the cache entry on which apply the specific command.

There are three types of connections that are allowed from an Azure Functions instance to a Redis Cache in your deployments. For local development, you can also use service principal secrets. Use the `appsettings` to configure each of the following types of client authentication, assuming the `Connection` was set to `Redis` in the function.
