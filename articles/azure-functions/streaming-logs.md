# Enable streaming execution logs in Azure Functions

While developing an application, you often want to see what's being written to the logs in near real time when running in Azure.

There are two ways to view a stream of log files being generated by your function executions.

* **Live Metrics Stream (recommended)**: when your function app is [connected to Application Insights](configure-monitoring.md#enable-application-insights-integration), you can view log data and other metrics in near real-time in the Azure portal using [Live Metrics Stream](/azure/azure-monitor/app/live-stream). Use this method when monitoring functions running on multiple-instances and supports all plan types. This method uses [sampled data](configure-monitoring.md#configure-sampling).

* **Built-in log streaming**: the App Service platform lets you view a stream of your application log files. This is equivalent to the output seen when you debug your functions during [local development](functions-develop-local.md) and when you use the **Test** tab in the portal. All log-based information is displayed. For more information, see [Stream logs](../app-service/troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs.md#stream-logs). This streaming method supports only a single instance, and can't be used with an app running on Linux in a Consumption plan. When your function is scaled to multiple instances, data from other instances isn't shown using this method. 

Log streams can be viewed both in the portal and in most local development environments. 

## [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

You can view both types of log streams in the portal.

To view streaming logs in the portal, select the **Platform features** tab in your function app. Then, under **Monitoring**, choose **Log streaming**.

This connects your app to the log streaming service and application logs are displayed in the window. You can toggle between **Application logs** and **Web server logs**.

To view the Live Metrics Stream for your app, select the **Overview** tab of your function app. When you have Application Insights enabled, you see an **Application Insights** link under **Configured features**. This link takes you to the Application Insights page for your app.

In Application Insights, select **Live Metrics Stream**. [Sampled log entries](configure-monitoring.md#configure-sampling) are displayed under **Sample Telemetry**.

## [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vs-code)

To turn on the streaming logs for your function app in Azure:

1. Select F1 to open the command palette, and then search for and run the command **Azure Functions: Start Streaming Logs**.

1. Select your function app in Azure, and then select **Yes** to enable application logging for the function app.

1. Trigger your functions in Azure. Notice that log data is displayed in the Output window in Visual Studio Code.

1. When you're done, remember to run the command **Azure Functions: Stop Streaming Logs** to disable logging for the function app.

## [Core Tools](#tab/core-tools)

Use the [`func azure functionapp logstream` command](functions-core-tools-reference.md#func-azure-functionapp-list-functions) to start receiving streaming logs of a specific function app running in Azure, as in this example:

```bash
func azure functionapp logstream <FunctionAppName>
```

>[!NOTE] 
>Because built-in log streaming isn't yet enabled for function apps running on Linux in a Consumption plan, you need to instead enable the [Live Metrics Stream](/azure/azure-monitor/app/live-stream) to view the logs in near-real time. 

Use this command to display the Live Metrics Stream in a new browser window.

```bash
func azure functionapp logstream <FunctionAppName> --browser
```

## [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

You can enable streaming logs by using the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Use the following commands to sign in, choose your subscription, and stream log files:

```azurecli
az login
az account list
az account set --subscription <subscriptionNameOrId>
az webapp log tail --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name <FUNCTION_APP_NAME>
```

## [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

You can enable streaming logs by using [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/). For PowerShell, use the [Set-AzWebApp](/powershell/module/az.websites/set-azwebapp) command to enable logging on the function app, as shown in the following snippet: 

:::code language="powershell" source="~/powershell_scripts/app-service/monitor-with-logs/monitor-with-logs.ps1" range="19-20":::

For more information, see the [complete code example](../app-service/scripts/powershell-monitor.md#sample-script).
