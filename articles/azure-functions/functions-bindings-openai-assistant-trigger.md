# Azure OpenAI assistant trigger for Azure Functions

[!INCLUDE [preview-support](../../includes/functions-openai-support-limitations.md)]

The Azure OpenAI assistant trigger lets you run your code based on custom chat bot or skill request made to an assistant. 

For information on setup and configuration details of the Azure OpenAI extension, see [Azure OpenAI extensions for Azure Functions](./functions-bindings-openai.md). To learn more about Azure OpenAI assistants, see [Azure OpenAI Assistants API](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/assistants).

## Example

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"  
This example demonstrates how to create an assistant that adds a new todo task to a database. The trigger has a static description of `Create a new todo task` used by the model. The function itself takes a string, which represents a new task to add. When executed, the function adds the task as a new todo item in a custom item store and returns a response from the store.

## Attributes

Apply the `AssistantSkillTrigger` attribute to define an assistant trigger, which supports these parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **FunctionDescription** | Gets the description of the assistant function, which is provided to the model. |
| **FunctionName** | _Optional_. Gets or sets the name of the function called by the assistant.|
| **ParameterDescriptionJson** | _Optional_. Gets or sets a JSON description of the function parameter, which is provided to the model. For more information, see [Usage](#usage).|
| **Model** | _Optional_. Gets or sets the OpenAI chat model deployment to use, with a default value of `gpt-3.5-turbo`. |

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"
## Annotations

The `AssistantSkillTrigger` annotation enables you to define an assistant trigger, which supports these parameters: 

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **name** | Gets or sets the name of the input binding. |
| **functionDescription** | Gets the description of the assistant function, which is provided to the model. |
| **functionName** | _Optional_. Gets or sets the name of the function called by the assistant.|
| **parameterDescriptionJson** | _Optional_. Gets or sets a JSON description of the function parameter, which is provided to the model. For more information, see [Usage](#usage).|

::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"  
## Decorators
<!--- Replace with typed decorator when available.-->
During the preview, define the input binding as a `generic_trigger` binding of type `assistantSkillTrigger`, which supports these parameters:

|Parameter | Description |
