# Azure OpenAI Semantic Search Input Binding for Azure Functions

[!INCLUDE [preview-support](../../includes/functions-openai-support-limitations.md)]

The Azure OpenAI semantic search input binding allows you to use semantic search on your embeddings.

For information on setup and configuration details of the Azure OpenAI extension, see [Azure OpenAI extensions for Azure Functions](./functions-bindings-openai.md). To learn more about semantic ranking in Azure AI Search, see [Semantic ranking in Azure AI Search](/azure/search/semantic-search-overview).

## Example

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"  
This example shows how to perform a semantic search on a file.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/functions-openai-extension/samples/rag-aisearch/csharp-ooproc/FilePrompt.cs" range="63-70"::: 

::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"
This example shows how to perform a semantic search on a file.  

:::code language="java" source="~/functions-openai-extension/samples/rag-aisearch/java/src/main/java/com/azfs/FilePrompt.java" range="70-84":::

::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript,programming-language-typescript"

## Attributes

Apply the `SemanticSearchInput` attribute to define a semantic search input binding, which supports these parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **ConnectionName** | The name of an app setting or environment variable that contains the connection string value. This property supports binding expressions. |
| **Collection** | The name of the collection or table or index to search. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **Query** |  The semantic query text to use for searching. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **EmbeddingsModel** | The ID of the model to use for embeddings. The default value is `text-embedding-3-small`. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **ChatModel** | Gets or sets the name of the Large Language Model to invoke for chat responses. The default value is `gpt-3.5-turbo`. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **SystemPrompt** | _Optional_. Gets or sets the system prompt to use for prompting the large language model. The system prompt is appended with knowledge that is fetched as a result of the `Query`. The combined prompt is sent to the OpenAI Chat API. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **MaxKnowledgeCount** | _Optional_. Gets or sets the number of knowledge items to inject into the `SystemPrompt`.|

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"
## Annotations

The `SemanticSearchInput` annotation enables you to define a semantic search input binding, which supports these parameters: 

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **name** | Gets or sets the name of the input binding. |
| **connectionName** | The name of an app setting or environment variable that contains the connection string value. This property supports binding expressions. |
| **collection** | The name of the collection or table or index to search. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **query** |  The semantic query text to use for searching. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **embeddingsModel** | The ID of the model to use for embeddings. The default value is `text-embedding-3-small`. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **chatModel** | Gets or sets the name of the Large Language Model to invoke for chat responses. The default value is `gpt-3.5-turbo`. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **systemPrompt** | _Optional_. Gets or sets the system prompt to use for prompting the large language model. The system prompt is appended with knowledge that is fetched as a result of the `Query`. The combined prompt is sent to the OpenAI Chat API. This property supports binding expressions.|
| **maxKnowledgeCount** | _Optional_. Gets or sets the number of knowledge items to inject into the `SystemPrompt`.|

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"  
## Decorators
<!--- Replace with typed decorator when available.-->
During the preview, define the input binding as a `generic_input_binding` binding of type `semanticSearch`, which supports these parameters:

|Parameter | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **arg_name** | The name of the variable that represents the binding parameter. |
| **connection_name** | The name of an app setting or environment variable that contains the connection string value. This property supports binding expressions. |
| **collection** | The name of the collection or table or index to search. This property supports binding expressions.|
