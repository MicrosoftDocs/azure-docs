# Monitor Azure Functions

[Azure Functions](functions-overview.md) offers built-in integration with [Azure Application Insights](../azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview.md) to monitor functions. This article shows you how to configure Azure Functions to send system-generated log files to Application Insights.

We recommend using Application Insights because it collects log, performance, and error data. It automatically detects performance anomalies and includes powerful analytics tools to help you diagnose issues and to understand how your functions are used. It's designed to help you continuously improve performance and usability. You can even use Application Insights during local function app project development. For more information, see [What is Application Insights?](../azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview.md).

As the required Application Insights instrumentation is built into Azure Functions, all you need is a valid instrumentation key to connect your function app to an Application Insights resource. The instrumentation key should be added to your application settings when your function app resource is created in Azure. If your function app doesn't already have this key, you can [set it manually](configure-monitoring.md#enable-application-insights-integration).  

## Application Insights pricing and limits

You can try out Application Insights integration with Azure Functions for free. There's a daily limit to how much data can be processed for free. You might hit this limit during testing. Azure provides portal and email notifications when you're approaching your daily limit. If you miss those alerts and hit the limit, new logs won't appear in Application Insights queries. Be aware of the limit to avoid unnecessary troubleshooting time. For more information, see [Manage pricing and data volume in Application Insights](../azure-monitor/app/pricing.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Application Insights has a [sampling](../azure-monitor/app/sampling.md) feature that can protect you from producing too much telemetry data on completed executions at times of peak load. Sampling is enabled by default. If you appear to be missing data, you might need to adjust the sampling settings to fit your particular monitoring scenario. To learn more, see [Configure sampling](configure-monitoring.md#configure-sampling).

The full list of Application Insights features available to your function app is detailed in [Application Insights for Azure Functions supported features](../azure-monitor/app/azure-functions-supported-features.md).

## Application Insights integration

Typically, you create an Application Insights instance when you create your function app. In this case, the instrumentation key required for the integration is already set as an application setting named *APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY*. If for some reason your function app doesn't have the instrumentation key set, you need to [enable Application Insights integration](configure-monitoring.md#enable-application-insights-integration).  

## Collecting telemetry data

With Application Insights integration enabled, telemetry data is sent to your connected Application Insights instance. This data includes logs generated by the Functions host, traces written from your functions code, and performance data. 

>[!NOTE]
>In addition to data from your functions and the Functions host, you can also collect data from the [Functions scale controller](#scale-controller-logs-preview).   

### Log levels and categories

When you write traces from your application code, you should assign a log level to the traces. Log levels provide a way for you to limit the amount of data that is collected from your traces.  

[!INCLUDE [functions-log-levels](../../includes/functions-log-levels.md)]

To learn more about log levels, see [Configure log levels](configure-monitoring.md#configure-log-levels).

A logged item is also assigned to a category, which gives you more control over telemetry generated from specific sources in your function app. By using categories, it's also easier to run analytics over collected data. These categories range from status messages logged by the runtime host to data in the aggregate. Traces written from your function code are assigned to individual categories based on the function name. To learn more about categories, see [Configure categories](configure-monitoring.md#configure-categories).

### Custom telemetry data

For some languages, you can also use an Application Insights SDK to write custom telemetry data. To learn more, see the [C# developer reference](functions-dotnet-class-library.md#log-custom-telemetry-in-c-functions) or the [JavaScript developer reference](functions-reference-node.md#log-custom-telemetry).    

### Dependencies

Starting with version 2.x of Functions, the runtime automatically collects data for certain dependencies. Because Functions bindings use instrumented client SDKs for the following services, dependencies for these services are also captured:

+ Azure Cosmos DB 
+ Azure Event Hubs
+ Azure Service Bus
+ Azure Storage services (Blob, Queue, and Table)

HTTP requests and database calls using `SqlClient` are also captured. For the complete list of dependencies supported by Application Insights, see [automatically tracked dependencies](../azure-monitor/app/asp-net-dependencies.md#automatically-tracked-dependencies).

The following is an example of an _application map_ in Application Insights of an HTTP trigger function with a Queue storage output binding.  

![Application map with dependency](./media/functions-monitoring/app-map.png)

Dependencies are written at the `Information` level. If you filter at `Warning` or above, you won't see the dependency data. Also, automatic collection of dependencies happens at a non-user scope. To capture dependency data, make sure the level is set to at least `Information` outside the user scope (`Function.<YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME>.User`) in your host.

In addition to automatic dependency data collection, you can also use one of the language specific Application Insights SDKs to write custom dependency information to the logs. For an example how to write custom dependencies, see one of the following language-specific examples:

+ [Log custom telemetry in C# functions](functions-dotnet-class-library.md#log-custom-telemetry-in-c-functions)
+ [Log custom telemetry in JavaScript functions](functions-reference-node.md#log-custom-telemetry) 

## Writing to logs 

The way that you write to logs and the APIs you use depend on the language of your function app project.   
See the developer guide for your language to learn more about writing logs from your functions.

+ [C# (.NET class library)](functions-dotnet-class-library.md#logging)
+ [Java](functions-reference-java.md#logger)
+ [JavaScript](functions-reference-node.md#write-trace-output-to-logs) 
+ [PowerShell](functions-reference-powershell.md#logging)
+ [Python](functions-reference-python.md#logging)

## Streaming Logs

While developing an application, you often want to see what's being written to the logs in near real time when running in Azure.

There are two ways to view a stream of the log data being generated by your function executions.

* **Built-in log streaming**: the App Service platform lets you view a stream of your application log files. This is equivalent to the output seen when you debug your functions during [local development](functions-develop-local.md) and when you use the **Test** tab in the portal. All log-based information is displayed. For more information, see [Stream logs](../app-service/troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs.md#stream-logs). This streaming method supports only a single instance, and can't be used with an app running on Linux in a Consumption plan.

* **Live Metrics Stream**: when your function app is [connected to Application Insights](configure-monitoring.md#enable-application-insights-integration), you can view log data and other metrics in near real-time in the Azure portal using [Live Metrics Stream](../azure-monitor/app/live-stream.md). Use this method when monitoring functions running on multiple-instances or on Linux in a Consumption plan. This method uses [sampled data](configure-monitoring.md#configure-sampling).

Log streams can be viewed both in the portal and in most local development environments. To learn how to enable log streams, see [Enable streaming execution logs in Azure Functions](streaming-logs.md).

## Diagnostic logs (preview)

_This feature is in preview._ 

Application Insights lets you export telemetry data to long-term storage or other analysis services.  

Because Functions also integrates with Azure Monitor, you can also use diagnostic settings to send telemetry data to various destinations, including Azure Monitor logs. To learn more, see [Monitoring Azure Functions with Azure Monitor Logs](functions-monitor-log-analytics.md).

## Scale controller logs (preview)

_This feature is in preview._ 

The [Azure Functions scale controller](./functions-scale.md#runtime-scaling) monitors instances of the Azure Functions host on which your app runs. This controller makes decisions about when to add or remove instances based on current performance. You can have the scale controller emit logs to either Application Insights or to Blob storage to better understand the decisions the scale controller is making for your function app.

To enable this feature, add a new application setting named `SCALE_CONTROLLER_LOGGING_ENABLED`. The value of this setting must be of the format `<DESTINATION>:<VERBOSITY>`, based on the following:

[!INCLUDE [functions-scale-controller-logging](../../includes/functions-scale-controller-logging.md)]

For example, the following Azure CLI command turns on verbose logging from the scale controller to Application Insights:

```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp config appsettings set --name <FUNCTION_APP_NAME> \
--resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> \
--settings SCALE_CONTROLLER_LOGGING_ENABLED=AppInsights:Verbose
```

In this example, replace `<FUNCTION_APP_NAME>` and `<RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>` with the name of your function app and the resource group name, respectively. 

The following Azure CLI command disables logging by setting the verbosity to `None`:

```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp config appsettings set --name <FUNCTION_APP_NAME> \
--resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> \
--settings SCALE_CONTROLLER_LOGGING_ENABLED=AppInsights:None
```

You can also disable logging by removing the `SCALE_CONTROLLER_LOGGING_ENABLED` setting using the following Azure CLI command:

```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp config appsettings delete --name <FUNCTION_APP_NAME> \
--resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> \
--setting-names SCALE_CONTROLLER_LOGGING_ENABLED
```
