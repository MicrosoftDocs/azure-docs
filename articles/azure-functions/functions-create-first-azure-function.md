# Create your first Azure Function

This topic shows you how to use the Azure Functions quickstart in the portal to create a simple "hello world"  function that is invoked by an HTTP request. To learn more about Azure Functions, see the [Azure Functions Overview](functions-overview.md).

Before you start, you must have an Azure account. [Free accounts](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) are available. You can also [try Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/app-service/functions/) without having to register with Azure.

## Create a function from the portal quickstart

1. Go to the [Azure Functions portal](https://functions.azure.com/signin) and sign in with your Azure account. 
 
2. Type a unique **Name** for your new function app or accept the autogenerated one, select your preferred **Region**, then click **Create + get started**. A valid name can contain only letters, numbers, and hyphens. Underscore (**_**) is not an allowed character.

3. In the **Quickstart** tab, click **WebHook + API** and choose a language for your function, then click **Create this function**. A new predefined function is created in your chosen language.

4. (Optional) At this point in the quickstart, you can choose to take a quick tour of Azure Functions features in the portal. After you have completed or skipped the tour, you can test your new function by sending an HTTP request.
