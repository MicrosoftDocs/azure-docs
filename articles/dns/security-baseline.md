# Azure security baseline for Azure DNS

The Azure Security Baseline for Microsoft Azure DNS contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment. The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance. For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](../security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview.md).

## Logging and monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and monitoring](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: The Activity Log is a platform log in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. Send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace, Azure event hub, or Azure storage account for archive. Activity Log provides insight into the operations that were performed on your Azure DNS resources at the control plane level. Using Azure Activity Log data, you can determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed at the control plane level for your DNS zones.

Ingest logs via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by endpoint devices, network resources, and other security systems. Alternatively, you can enable and on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

## Identity and access control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and access control](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) allows you to manage access to Azure resources through role assignments. You can assign these roles to users, groups service principals, and managed identities. There are pre-defined built-in roles for certain resources, and these roles can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal.

In Azure DNS, there exists the DNS Zone Contributor role, as well as zone level and record set level Azure RBAC. It is also possible to build your own custom Azure roles to provide finer-grained control. Note, the private DNS zone resources use a different role name, Private DNS Zone Contributor.
