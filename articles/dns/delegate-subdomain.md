# Delegate an Azure DNS subdomain

You can use the Azure portal to delegate a DNS subdomain. For example, if you own the *adatum.com* domain, you can delegate a subdomain called *engineering.adatum.com* to another separate zone that you can administer separately from the adatum.com zone.

You can also delegate a subdomain using [Azure PowerShell](delegate-subdomain-ps.md).

## Prerequisites

To delegate an Azure DNS subdomain, the parent public domain must first be delegated to Azure DNS. See [Delegate a domain to Azure DNS](./dns-delegate-domain-azure-dns.md) for instructions on how to configure your name servers for delegation. Once your domain is delegated to Azure DNS, you can delegate a subdomain.

> [!NOTE]
> The `adatum.com` zone is used as an example of a parent DNS zone and `engineering.adatum.com` is used for the subdomain. Substitute your own domain names for these domains.

## Delegate a subdomain

The **engineering.adatum.com** subdomain can already exist. If it doesn't exist, it is created. The parent domain (in this example: **adatum.com**) must already exist as an Azure-hosted domain.

To delegate the **engineering** subdomain under **adatum.com**:

1. From the Azure portal, search for **DNS zones** and select the **adatum.com** parent zone.
2. Select **+ Child zone** and enter **engineering** next to **Name**. The **Create DNS zone** window opens.

3. If desired, change the **Subscription** and **Resource group**. In this example, we use the same subscription and resource group as the parent zone.
4. Select **Review create**, and then select **Create**.
5. When deployment is complete, select **Go to resource** to view the new delegated zone: **engineering.adatum.com**.

6. Select the parent **adatum.com** zone again and then select **Recordsets**. Notice that an **NS** record has been added with the name **engineering** and contents the same as NS records in the child zone. These are the Azure DNS nameservers that are authoritative for the subdomain (child zone).

## Manual entry of NS records (optional)

If desired, you can also create your subdomain and add the subdomain NS record manually.

To create a new subdomain zone, use **Create a resource > DNS zone** and create a zone named **engineering.adatum.com**.

To create a subdomain delegation manually, add a new NS record set (**+ Record set** option) to the parent zone **adatum.com** with the name: **engineering** and specify each of the nameserver entries that are listed in the subdomain (child) zone.

This method doesn't use the **+ Child zone** option, but both methods result in the same delegation.

## Create a test record

Next, create an **A** record in the **engineering.adatum.com** zone to use for testing. For example, create a **www** A record and configure it with a **10.10.10.10** IP address.

## Test the delegation

Use nslookup to test the delegation.

1. Open a command prompt.
2. At command prompt, type `nslookup www.engineering.adatum.com.`
3. You should receive a non-authoritative answer showing the address **10.10.10.10**.
