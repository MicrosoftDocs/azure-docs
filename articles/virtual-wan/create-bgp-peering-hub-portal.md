# Configure BGP peering to an NVA - Azure portal

This article helps you configure an Azure Virtual WAN hub router to peer with a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) in your virtual network using BGP Peering using the Azure portal. The virtual hub router learns routes from the NVA in a spoke VNet that is connected to a virtual WAN hub. The virtual hub router also advertises the virtual network routes to the NVA. For more information, see [Scenario: BGP peering with a virtual hub](scenario-bgp-peering-hub.md). You can also create this configuration using [Azure PowerShell](create-bgp-peering-hub-powershell.md).

## Prerequisites

Verify that you've met the following criteria before beginning your configuration:

[!INCLUDE [Before you begin](../../includes/virtual-wan-before-include.md)]

## Create a virtual WAN

[!INCLUDE [Create a virtual WAN](../../includes/virtual-wan-create-vwan-include.md)]

## Create a hub

A hub is a virtual network that can contain gateways for site-to-site, ExpressRoute, or point-to-site functionality. Once the hub is created, you'll be charged for the hub, even if you don't attach any sites.

[!INCLUDE [Create a hub](../../includes/virtual-wan-hub-basics.md)]

Once you have the settings configured, click **Review + Create** to validate, then click **Create**. The hub will begin provisioning. After the hub is created, go to the hub's **Overview** page. When provisioning is completed, the **Routing status** is **Provisioned**.

## Connect the VNet to the hub

After your hub router status is provisioned, create a connection between your hub and VNet.

[!INCLUDE [Connect a VNet to a hub](../../includes/virtual-wan-connect-vnet-hub-include.md)]

## Configure a BGP peer

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. On the portal page for your virtual WAN, in the left pane, select **Hubs** to view the list of hubs. Click a hub to configure a BGP peer.

1. On the **Virtual Hub** page, in the left pane, select **BGP Peers**. On the **BGP Peers** page, click **+ Add** to add a BGP peer.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/create-bgp-peering-hub-portal/bgp-peers.png" alt-text="Screenshot of BGP Peers page.":::

1. On the **Add BGP Peer** page, complete the following fields.

    * **Name** – Resource name to identify a specific BGP peer.
    * **ASN** – The ASN for the BGP peer.
    * **IPv4 address** – The IPv4 address of the BGP peer.
    * **Virtual Network connection** – Choose the connection identifier that corresponds to the Virtual network that hosts the BGP peer.

1. Click **Add** to complete the BGP peer configuration. You can view the peer on the **BGP Peers** page.

1. On the virtual hub resource, you'll see two IP addresses under "virtualRouterIps". It is required to peer with both these addresses and advertise the same routes to both these addresses. This ensures that the routes are successfully advertised to your virtual hub.  

### Modify a BGP peer

1. On the **Virtual Hub** resource, go to the **BGP Peers** page.
1. Select the BGP peer.
1. Click **…** at the end of the line for the peer, then select **Edit** from the dropdown.
1. On the **Edit BGP Peer** page, make any necessary changes, then click **Add**.

### Delete a BGP peer

1. On the **Virtual Hub** resource, go to the **BGP Peers** page.
1. Select the BGP peer.
1. Click **…** at the end of the line for the peer, then select **Delete** from the dropdown.
1. Click **Confirm** to confirm that you want to delete this resource.
