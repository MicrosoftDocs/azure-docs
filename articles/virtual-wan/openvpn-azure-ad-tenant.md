# Configure a Microsoft Entra tenant for P2S User VPN OpenVPN protocol connections

When you connect to your VNet using Virtual WAN User VPN (point-to-site), you have a choice of which protocol to use. The protocol you use determines the authentication options that are available to you. If you're using the OpenVPN protocol, Microsoft Entra authentication is one of the authentication options available for you to use. This article helps you configure a Microsoft Entra tenant for Virtual WAN User VPN (point-to-site) using OpenVPN authentication.

## <a name="tenant"></a>1. Create the Microsoft Entra tenant

Verify that you have a Microsoft Entra tenant. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra tenant, you can create one using the steps in the [Create a new tenant](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant.md) article:

* Organization name
* Initial domain name

<a name='a-nameusersa2-create-azure-ad-tenant-users'></a>

## <a name="users"></a>2. Create Microsoft Entra tenant users

1. Create two accounts in the newly created Microsoft Entra tenant. For steps, see [Add or delete a new user](../active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory.md).

   * [Cloud Application Administrator role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator)
   * User account

   The Cloud Application Administrator role is used to grant consent to the Azure VPN app registration. The user account can be used to test OpenVPN authentication.
1. Assign one of the accounts the **Cloud Application Administrator** role. For steps, see  [Assign administrator and non-administrator roles to users with Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name).

## <a name="enable-authentication"></a>3. Grant consent to the Azure VPN app registration

## Next steps

In order to connect to your virtual networks using Microsoft Entra authentication, you must create a User VPN configuration and associate it to a Virtual Hub. See [Configure Microsoft Entra authentication for point-to-site connection to Azure](virtual-wan-point-to-site-azure-ad.md).
