# Azure Monitor Insights for Virtual WAN

[Azure Monitor Insights](../network-watcher/network-insights-overview.md) for Azure Virtual WAN gives users and operators the ability to view the state and status of a Virtual WAN, presented via an autodiscovered topological map. Resource state and status overlays on the map give you a snapshot view of the overall health of the Virtual WAN. You can navigate resources on the map via one-click access to the resource configuration pages of the Virtual WAN portal.

Virtual WAN resource-level metrics are collected and presented via a pre-packaged Virtual WAN metrics workbook. The workbook shows the metrics at Virtual WAN, hub, gateway, and connection levels. This article walks you through the steps to use Azure Monitor Insights for Virtual WAN to view your Virtual WAN topology and metrics all in a single place.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Insights** menu option is in the Virtual WAN portal under **Monitoring**. You can also access the Virtual WAN Topology and Metrics Workbook by using Azure Monitor for Networks. For more information, see [Azure Monitor for Networks](../network-watcher/network-insights-overview.md).

## Before you begin

To complete the steps in this article, you need to have a Virtual WAN with one or more hubs. To create a Virtual WAN and a hub, follow the steps in these articles:

* [Create a Virtual WAN](virtual-wan-site-to-site-portal.md#openvwan)
* [Create a hub](virtual-wan-site-to-site-portal.md#hub)

## <a name="topology"></a>View VWAN topology

Go to **Azure portal** > **Virtual WAN**. In the **Monitor** menu in the left pane, select **Insights (preview)**. The **Insights** view appears. It shows the Virtual WAN Dependency map and high-level **Metrics** mini workbook.

In the **Insights** view, you can view the autodiscovered Virtual WAN resources. These resources include hubs, gateways, firewalls, connections and spoke virtual networks, third-party NVAs, and branches in an end-to-end Virtual WAN. For an example, see **Figure 2**.

The resource state and status are color-coded and overlaid on the resource icons in the map. High-level Virtual WAN metrics, like hub capacities and gateway utilization, appear on the right side of the window in a mini workbook.

## <a name="dependency"></a>Dependency view

The **Dependency** view for Virtual WAN helps you visualize the interconnected view of all the Virtual WAN resources broadly organized into a hub-and-spoke architecture.

**Figure 3: VWAN Dependency view**

:::image type="content" source="./media/azure-monitor-insights/dependency-map.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Dependency view." lightbox="./media/azure-monitor-insights/dependency-map.png":::

The **Dependency** view map displays the following resources as a connected graph:

* Virtual WAN hubs across the various Azure regions.
* Spoke virtual networks that are directly connected to the hub.
* VPN and Azure ExpressRoute branch sites and P2S users that are connected to each hub via their respective ExpressRoute, S2S, and P2S connections, and virtual network gateways.
* Azure firewalls (including third-party firewall proxies) deployed in a hub (secured hub).
* Third-party NVAs (network virtual appliances) that are deployed in spoke virtual networks.

The dependency map also displays indirectly connected virtual networks (virtual networks that are peered with Virtual WAN spoke virtual networks).

The dependency map enables easy navigation to the configuration settings of each resource. For example, you can hover over the hub resource to view the basic resource configuration, like hub region and hub prefix. Right-click to access the Azure portal page of the hub resource.

The search and filter bar in the **Dependency** view provides an easy way to search through the graph. Various filters provide help to narrow your search down to a specific path and state.

## <a name="detailed"></a>Detailed metrics

You can select **View detailed metrics** to access the detailed **Metrics** page. The **Metrics** page is a dashboard that's preconfigured with separate tabs. These tabs provide insights into your Virtual WAN resource capacity, performance, and utilization at the Virtual-WAN level and hub level, and at the level of individual connections.
