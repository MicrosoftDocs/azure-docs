# Scenario: Custom isolation for VNets

When working with Virtual WAN virtual hub routing, there are quite a few available scenarios. In a custom isolation scenario for VNets, the goal is to prevent a specific set of VNets from being able to reach other specific set of VNets. However, the VNets are required to reach all branches (VPN/ER/User VPN). For more information about virtual hub routing, see [About virtual hub routing](about-virtual-hub-routing.md).

## <a name="design"></a>Design

In order to figure out how many route tables are needed, you can build a connectivity matrix. For this scenario it looks like the following, where each cell represents whether a source (row) can communicate to a destination (column):

| From | To:| *Blue VNets* | *Red VNets* | *Branches*|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Blue VNets** |   &#8594;|   Direct     |           |  Direct |
| **Red VNets**  |   &#8594;|              |   Direct  |  Direct |
| **Branches**   |   &#8594;|   Direct     |   Direct  |  Direct |

Each of the cells in the previous table describes whether a Virtual WAN connection (the "From" side of the flow, the row headers) communicates with a destination (the "To" side of the flow, the column headers in italics). In this scenario, there are no firewalls or Network Virtual Appliances, so communications flows directly over Virtual WAN (hence the word "Direct" in the table).

The number of different row patterns are the number of route tables we need in this scenario. In this case, three route tables that we call are **RT_BLUE** and **RT_RED** for the virtual networks, and **Default** for the branches. Remember, the branches always have to be associated to the Default routing table.

The branches need to learn the prefixes from both Red and Blue VNets, so all VNets needs to propagate to Default (additionally to either **RT_BLUE** or **RT_RED**). Blue and Red VNets need to learn the branches' prefixes, so branches propagate to both route tables **RT_BLUE** and **RT_RED** too. As a result, this is the final design:

* Blue virtual networks:
  * Associated route table: **RT_BLUE**
  * Propagating to route tables: **RT_BLUE** and **Default**
* Red virtual networks:
  * Associated route table: **RT_RED**
  * Propagating to route tables: **RT_RED** and **Default**
* Branches:
  * Associated route table: **Default**
  * Propagating to route tables: **RT_BLUE**, **RT_RED** and **Default**

> [!NOTE]
> Since all branches need to be associated to the Default route table, as well as to propagate to the same set of routing tables, all branches will have the same connectivity profile. In other words, the Red/Blue concept for VNets cannot be applied to branches.

> [!NOTE]
> If your Virtual WAN is deployed over multiple hubs, you need to create the **RT_BLUE** and **RT_RED** route tables in every hub, and routes from each VNet connection need to be propagated to the route tables in every virtual hub using propagation labels.

## <a name="architecture"></a>Workflow

In **Figure 1**, there are Blue and Red VNet connections.

* Blue-connected VNets can reach each other and reach all branches (VPN/ER/P2S) connections.
* Red VNets can reach each other and reach all branches (VPN/ER/P2S) connections.

Consider the following steps when setting up routing.

1. Create two custom route tables in the Azure portal, **RT_BLUE** and **RT_RED**.
2. For route table **RT_BLUE**, for the following settings:
   * **Association**: Select all Blue VNets.
   * **Propagation**: For Branches, select the option for branches, implying branch(VPN/ER/P2S) connections propagate routes to this route table.
3. Repeat the same steps for **RT_RED** route table for Red VNets and branches (VPN/ER/P2S).

This results in the routing configuration change as seen in the following figure.
