# Configure Azure Firewall in a Virtual WAN hub

A **secured hub** is an Azure Virtual WAN hub with Azure Firewall. This article walks you through the steps to convert a virtual WAN hub to a secured hub by installing Azure Firewall directly from the Azure Virtual WAN portal pages.

## Before you begin

The steps in this article assume that you've already deployed a virtual WAN with one or more hubs.

To create a new virtual WAN and a new hub, use the steps in the following articles:

* [Create a virtual WAN](virtual-wan-site-to-site-portal.md#openvwan)
* [Create a hub](virtual-wan-site-to-site-portal.md#hub)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Virtual WAN is a collection of hubs and services made available inside the hub. The user can deploy as many Virtual WANs as they need. In a Virtual WAN hub, there are multiple services like VPN, ExpressRoute etc. Each of these services is automatically deployed across **Availability Zones** (*except* Azure Firewall) if the region supports Availability Zones. To deploy an Azure Firewall with Availability Zones (recommended) in a Secure vWAN Hub, [this article](../firewall-manager/secure-cloud-network.md) must be used. 

## Convert to secured hub

To view virtual hubs, go to your Virtual WAN **Overview** page. The **Overview** page for your virtual WAN shows a list of virtual hubs and secured hubs.

1. On the **Overview** page for your virtual WAN, select the hub that you want to convert to a secured hub.

2. On the virtual hub page, select **Azure Firewall and Firewall Manager** under the "Security" section on the left.

3. Select **Next: Azure Firewall** button at the bottom of screen to advance to the next page.

4. Select the Azure Firewall properties and status desired, then complete the wizard up to the **Review + confirm** tab:

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure doesn't permit the use of Availability Zones for Azure Firewall.

5. After the hub has been converted to a secured hub, you can view the status for the **Azure Firewall** on the virtual hub **Overview** page. The status shows **Secured**.

## View hub resources

From the virtual WAN **Overview** page, select the secured hub. On the hub page, you can view all the virtual hub resources, including Azure Firewall.

To view Azure Firewall settings from the secured hub, select on **Azure Firewall and Firewall Manager** under the "Security" section on the left:

:::image type="content" source="./media/howto-firewall/vwan-secured-hub-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Azure Virtual WAN status view in Firewall Manager." lightbox="./media/howto-firewall/vwan-secured-hub-status.png":::

Usage of Availability Zones for Azure Firewall in the Azure Virtual WAN Hub, can be checked accessing the security properties of the hub.

## Configure additional settings

To configure additional Azure Firewall settings for the virtual hub, select the link to **Azure Firewall Manager**. For information about firewall policies, see [Azure Firewall Manager](../firewall-manager/secure-cloud-network.md#create-a-firewall-policy-and-secure-your-hub).

:::image type="content" source="./media/howto-firewall/additional-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Secured Hub overview with Manage Security Provider." lightbox="./media/howto-firewall/additional-settings.png":::

To return to the hub **Overview** page, you can navigate back by clicking the path, as shown by the arrow in the following figure.

## Upgrade to Azure Firewall Premium
At any time, it's possible to upgrade from Azure Firewall Standard to Premium following these [instructions](../firewall/premium-migrate.md#migrate-a-secure-hub-firewall). This operation will require a maintenance window since some minimal downtime will be generated.
