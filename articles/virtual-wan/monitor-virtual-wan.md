# Monitoring Azure Virtual WAN

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability and performance.

This article describes the monitoring data generated by Azure Virtual WAN. Virtual WAN uses [Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/overview.md). If you're unfamiliar with the features of Azure Monitor common to all Azure services that use it, read [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md).


## Prerequisites 
You have created a Virtual WAN setup. For help in deploying a Virtual WAN:
* [Creating a site-to-site connection](virtual-wan-site-to-site-portal.md)
* [Creating a User VPN (point-to-site) connection](virtual-wan-point-to-site-portal.md)
* [Creating an ExpressRoute connection](virtual-wan-expressroute-portal.md)
* [Creating an NVA in a virtual hub](how-to-nva-hub.md)
* [Installing Azure Firewall in a Virtual hub](howto-firewall.md)

## Analyzing metrics 

Metrics in Azure Monitor are numerical values that describe some aspect of a system at a particular time. Metrics are collected every minute, and are useful for alerting because they can be sampled frequently. An alert can be fired quickly with relatively simple logic.

For a list of the platform metrics collected for Virtual WAN, see [Monitoring Virtual WAN data reference metrics](monitor-virtual-wan-reference.md#metrics).

### <a name="metrics-steps"></a>View metrics for Virtual WAN

The following steps help you locate and view metrics:

1. In the portal, navigate to the virtual hub.

1. Select **VPN (Site to site)** to locate a site-to-site gateway, **ExpressRoute** to locate an ExpressRoute gateway, or **User VPN (Point to site)** to locate a point-to-site gateway.

1. Select **Metrics**.

1. On the **Metrics** page, you can view the metrics that you're interested in.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-virtual-wan-reference/metrics-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the 'Metrics' page with the categories highlighted." lightbox="./media/monitor-virtual-wan-reference/metrics-page.png":::

1. To see metrics for the virtual hub router, you can select **Metrics** from the virtual hub **Overview** blade. 


## Analyzing logs

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.  Resource Logs aren't collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations. 

For a list of supported logs in Virtual WAN, see [Monitoring Virtual WAN data reference logs](monitor-virtual-wan-reference.md#diagnostic). All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema.md).

### <a name="create-diagnostic"></a>Create diagnostic setting to view logs

The following steps help you create, edit, and view diagnostic settings:

1. In the portal, navigate to your Virtual WAN resource, then select **Hubs** in the **Connectivity** group.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-virtual-wan-reference/select-hub.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Hub selection in the vWAN Portal." lightbox="./media/monitor-virtual-wan-reference/select-hub.png":::

1. Under the **Connectivity** group on the left, select the gateway for which you want to examine diagnostics:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-virtual-wan-reference/select-hub-gateway.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Connectivity section for the hub." lightbox="./media/monitor-virtual-wan-reference/select-hub-gateway.png":::

1. On the right part of the page, click on the **View in Azure Monitor** link to the right of **Logs**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-virtual-wan-reference/view-hub-gateway-logs.png" alt-text="Screenshot for Select View in Azure Monitor for Logs." lightbox="./media/monitor-virtual-wan-reference/view-hub-gateway-logs.png":::

1. In this page, you can create a new diagnostic setting (**+Add diagnostic setting**) or edit an existing one (**Edit setting**). You can choose to send the diagnostic logs to Log Analytics (as shown in the example below), stream to an event hub, send to a 3rd-party solution, or archive to a storage account.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-virtual-wan-reference/select-gateway-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot for Select Diagnostic Log settings." lightbox="./media/monitor-virtual-wan-reference/select-gateway-settings.png":::
1. After clicking **Save**, you should start seeing logs appear in this log analytics workspace within a few hours. 
1. To monitor a **secured hub (with Azure Firewall)**, then diagnostics and logging configuration must be done from accessing the **Diagnostic Setting** tab:

      :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-virtual-wan-reference/firewall-diagnostic-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Firewall diagnostic settings." lightbox="./media/monitor-virtual-wan-reference/firewall-diagnostic-settings.png" :::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enabling these settings requires additional Azure services (storage account, event hub, or Log Analytics), which may increase your cost. To calculate an estimated cost, visit the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator).

## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts on [metrics](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types.md#metric-alerts), [logs](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types.md#log-alerts), and the [activity log](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types.md#activity-log-alerts). Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks.

To see a list of monitoring best practices when configuring alerts, see [Monitoring - best practices](monitoring-best-practices.md).

## Virtual WAN Insights

Some services in Azure have a special focused pre-built monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These special dashboards are called "Insights".

Virtual WAN uses Network Insights to provide users and operators with the ability to view the state and status of a Virtual WAN, presented via an autodiscovered topological map. Resource state and status overlays on the map give you a snapshot view of the overall health of the Virtual WAN. You can navigate resources on the map via one-click access to the resource configuration pages of the Virtual WAN portal. For more information, see [Azure Monitor Network Insights for Virtual WAN](azure-monitor-insights.md).
