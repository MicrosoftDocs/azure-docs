# How to configure Route-maps to tag routes

This article helps you use the Route-maps feature to tag routes using the Azure portal. For more information about Virtual WAN Route-maps, see [About Route-maps](route-maps-about.md).

## Prerequisites

Verify that you have met the following criteria before beginning your configuration:

* You have virtual WAN (VWAN) with a connection (S2S, P2S, or ExpressRoute) already configured.

  * For steps to create a VWAN with a S2S connection, see [Tutorial - Create a S2S connection with Virtual WAN](virtual-wan-site-to-site-portal.md).
  * For steps to create a virtual WAN with a P2S User VPN connection, see [Tutorial - Create a User VPN P2S connection with Virtual WAN](virtual-wan-point-to-site-portal.md).
* Be sure to view [About Route-maps](route-maps-about.md#considerations-and-limitations) for considerations and limitations before proceeding with configuration steps.

## Design
In this situation, we have two hubs. Hub 1 has 2 VNets and a VPN branch office. One of the VNets has an  (network virtual appliance) peered with the hub. Hub 2 also has 2 VNets and a VPN branch office.

Here's the addressing for this environment:  

| Resource |Address Space |
| --- |---| 
|Hub 1 |192.168.1.0/24 | 
|Hub 2 |192.168.2.0/24  |
|Virtual network 1 |10.1.0.0/24  |
|Virtual network 2 |10.2.0.0/24 |
|Virtual network 3 |10.3.0.0/24  |
|Virtual network 4 |10.4.0.0/24  |
|VPN Branch 1 |10.122.1.0/24, 10.122.2.0/24, 10.122.3.0/24, 10.100.0.0/16|
|VPN Branch 2 |10.200.0.0/16 |
|NVA 1 | 10.150.1.0/24, 10.150.2.0/24, 10.150.3.0/24, 10.150.4.0/24 |  

## Scenario: Using BGP communities to Tag routes

In this scenario, the goal is to tag route 10.5.0.192/26 form virtual network 3 on Hub 2 with BGP community 3356:70   

   :::image type="content" source="./media/route-maps-tag-routes/tag.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Scenario." lightbox="./media/route-maps-tag-routes/tag.png":::

## Workflow

1. Use the Route-Map dashboard in hub 2 to verify the BGP community on the route 10.5.0.192/26 being advertised from the virtual network connection.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/route-maps-tag-routes/db-before.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows routes before Route-map." lightbox="./media/route-maps-tag-routes/db-before.png"::: 

   Look at the Route-Map dashboard for the VPN Branch to verify the BGP community on the route for 10.5.0.192/26. The goal is to vary what routes are being sent on-premises.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/route-maps-tag-routes/db-before-two.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows routes for VPN branch." lightbox="./media/route-maps-tag-routes/db-before-two.png":::   

2. Create a Route-Map to tag the route. If this is your first time creating a Route-Map, see [How to configure Route-maps](route-maps-how-to.md) for more information. 

   The Route-Map will have a match rule for route 10.5.0.192/26. The action **modify** will be selected. Route Modification has an **add** for **community** 3356:70.  

   :::image type="content" source="./media/route-maps-tag-routes/rm.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Route-map." lightbox="./media/route-maps-tag-routes/rm.png":::

3. Apply the Route-Map on the virtual network 3 connection. The Route-Map will be applied in the inbound direction. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/route-maps-tag-routes/apply.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Route-map being applied." lightbox="./media/route-maps-tag-routes/apply.png":::

4. Using the Route-Map dashboard in Hub 2, Verify that route 10.5.0.192/26 has the BGP community of 3356:70 added on the virtual network 3 connection.    

   :::image type="content" source="./media/route-maps-tag-routes/db-after.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows routes after Route-map being applied." lightbox="./media/route-maps-tag-routes/db-after.png":::

   look at the Route-Map dashboard for the VPN branch connection to verify route 10.5.0.192/26 has the BGP community 3356:70 being advertised to the VPN branch office 2.  

   :::image type="content" source="./media/route-maps-tag-routes/rm-after-two.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows routes after the Route-map has been applied for the VPN branch." lightbox="./media/route-maps-tag-routes/rm-after-two.png":::

## Next steps

* Use the [Route-maps dashboard](route-maps-dashboard.md) to monitor routes, AS Path, and BGP communities.
* To learn more about Route-maps, see [About Route-maps](route-maps-about.md).
