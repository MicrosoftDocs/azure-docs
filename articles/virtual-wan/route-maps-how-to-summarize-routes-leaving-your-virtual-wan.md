# How to configure Route-maps to summarize routes leaving your virtual WAN

This article helps you use the Route-maps feature to summarize routes using the Azure portal. For more information about Virtual WAN Route-maps, see [About Route-maps](route-maps-about.md).

## Prerequisites

Verify that you have met the following criteria before beginning your configuration:

* You have a virtual WAN (VWAN) with a connection (S2S, P2S, or ExpressRoute) already configured.

  * You have followed the steps to create a VWAN with a S2S connection, see [Tutorial - Create a S2S connection with Virtual WAN](virtual-wan-site-to-site-portal.md).
  * You have followed the steps to create a virtual WAN with a P2S User VPN connection, see [Tutorial - Create a User VPN P2S connection with Virtual WAN](virtual-wan-point-to-site-portal.md).
* Be sure to view [About Route-maps](route-maps-about.md#considerations-and-limitations) for considerations and limitations before proceeding with configuration steps.

## Design

In this situation, there are two hubs. Hub 1 has 2 VNets and a VPN branch office. One of the VNets has an NVA (Network Virtual Appliance) peered with the hub. Hub 2 also has 2 VNets and a VPN branch office.

Here's the addressing for this environment:  

| Resource |Address Space |
| --- |---| 
|Hub 1 |192.168.1.0/24 | 
|Hub 2 |192.168.2.0/24  |
|Virtual network 1 |10.1.0.0/24  |
|Virtual network 2 |10.2.0.0/24 |
|Virtual network 3 |10.3.0.0/24  |
|Virtual network 4 |10.4.0.0/24  |
|VPN Branch 1 |10.122.1.0/24, 10.122.2.0/24, 10.122.3.0/24, 10.100.0.0/16|
|VPN Branch 2 |10.200.0.0/16 |
|NVA 1 | 10.150.1.0/24, 10.150.2.0/24, 10.150.3.0/24, 10.150.4.0/24 |  

## Scenario: Summarize routes leaving your virtual WAN 

In this scenario, a Route-map will summarize the routes being advertised to the VPN branch 2 site. In this example we'll be taking the routes 10.122.1.0/24, 10.122.2.0/24, 10.122.3.0/24 from VPN Branch 1 and summarizing them to 10.122.0.0/16.

## Workflow

1. Use the Route-map dashboard in hub 2 to verify the correct routes are currently being advertised to VPN branch 2 site.

2. Create a Route-map to summarize the routes. Before you create your first time Route-map, see [How to configure Route-maps](route-maps-how-to.md) for more information.

   The Route-map has a match rule for contains 10.122.0.0/16. The action **Modify** is selected. Route Modification has a **Replace** for the **RoutePrefix** 10.122.0.0/16.

3. Apply the Route-map on the VPN branch 2 site connection. The Route-map will be applied in the outbound direction.

4. Using the Route-map dashboard in Hub 2, Verify that route 10.122.0.0/16 is being summarized.

## Next steps

* Use the [Route-maps dashboard](route-maps-dashboard.md) to monitor routes, AS Path, and BGP communities.
* To learn more about Route-maps, see [About Route-maps](route-maps-about.md).
