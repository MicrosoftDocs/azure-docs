# Create a Microsoft Entra tenant for P2S OpenVPN protocol connections

When connecting to your VNet, you can use certificate-based authentication or RADIUS authentication. However, when you use the Open VPN protocol, you can also use Microsoft Entra authentication. If you want different set of users to be able to connect to different gateways, you can register multiple apps in AD and link them to different gateways.

This article helps you set up a Microsoft Entra tenant for P2S OpenVPN authentication, and create and register multiple apps in Microsoft Entra ID to allow different access for different users and groups.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Entra authentication is supported only for OpenVPN&reg; protocol connections.

[!INCLUDE [create](../../includes/openvpn-azure-ad-tenant-multi-app.md)]

## <a name="site"></a>6. Create a new P2S configuration

A P2S configuration defines the parameters for connecting remote clients.

1. Set the following variables, replacing values as needed for your environment.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $aadAudience = "00000000-abcd-abcd-abcd-999999999999"
   $aadIssuer = "https://sts.windows.net/00000000-abcd-abcd-abcd-999999999999/"
   $aadTenant = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/00000000-abcd-abcd-abcd-999999999999"    
   ```

2. Run the following commands to create the configuration:

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $aadConfig = New-AzVpnServerConfiguration -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroup> -Name newAADConfig -VpnProtocol OpenVPN -VpnAuthenticationType AAD -AadTenant $aadTenant -AadIssuer $aadIssuer -AadAudience $aadAudience -Location westcentralus
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Do not use the Azure VPN client's application ID in the commands above: It will grant all users access to the gateway. Use the ID of the application(s) you registered.

## <a name="hub"></a>7. Edit hub assignment

1. Navigate to the **Hubs** blade under the virtual WAN.

2. Select the hub that you want to associate the vpn server configuration to and click the ellipsis (...).

    ![Screenshot shows Edit virtual hub selected from the menu.](media/openvpn-azure-ad-tenant-multi-app/p2s4.jpg)

3. Click **Edit virtual hub**.

4. Check the **Include point-to-site gateway** check box and pick the **Gateway scale unit** that you want.

    ![Screenshot shows the Edit virtual hub dialog box where you can select your Gateway scale unit.](media/openvpn-azure-ad-tenant-multi-app/p2s2.jpg)

5. Enter the **Address pool** from which the VPN clients will be assigned IP addresses.

6. Click **Confirm**.

7. The operation can take up to 30 minutes to complete.

## <a name="device"></a>8. Download VPN profile

Use the VPN profile to configure your clients.

1. On the page for your virtual WAN, click **User VPN configurations**.

2. At the top of the  page, click **Download user VPN config**.

3. Once the file has finished creating, you can click the link to download it.

4. Use the profile file to configure the VPN clients.

5. Extract the downloaded zip file.

6. Browse to the unzipped "AzureVPN" folder.

7. Make a note of the location of the "azurevpnconfig.xml" file. The azurevpnconfig.xml contains the setting for the VPN connection and can be imported directly into the Azure VPN Client application. You can also distribute this file to all the users that need to connect via e-mail or other means. The user will need valid Microsoft Entra credentials to connect successfully.

## 9. Configure User VPN clients

To connect, you need to download the Azure VPN Client and import the VPN client profile that was downloaded in the previous steps on every computer that wants to connect to the VNet.
