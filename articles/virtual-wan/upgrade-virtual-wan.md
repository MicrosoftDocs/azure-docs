# Upgrade a virtual WAN from Basic to Standard

This article helps you upgrade a virtual WAN that was created using the Basic type (SKU), to Standard. When a virtual WAN type is Basic, all hubs within the virtual WAN are configured as Basic hubs. A Basic hub is limited to site-to-site VPN functionality only.

When you upgrade from Basic to Standard, all the hubs within the virtual WAN are upgraded to Standard hubs. Standard hubs support ExpressRoute, point-to-site (User VPN), a full mesh hub, and VNet-to-VNet transit through the Azure hubs.

The following table shows the configurations available for each WAN type:
