# Virtual WAN Branch IPsec connectivity automation 

This article provides information on Virtual WAN partners for connectivity into a Virtual WAN hub.

There are two types of offerings that make connecting to Azure easier:

* **Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs) deployed in a Virtual WAN hub**: Customers can deploy Network Virtual Appliances directly into a Virtual WAN hub. This solution is jointly managed by Microsoft Azure and third-party Network Virtual Appliance solution providers. To learn more about NVAs deployed in a Virtual WAN hub, see [About NVAs in a Virtual WAN hub](about-nva-hub.md).
* **Branch IPsec connectivity automation**: Customers can automatically configure and connect their branch devices to the Azure Virtual WAN Site-to-site VPN gateway using IPsec tunnels. These configurations are typically set up in the device-management UI (or equivalent).

## Partners with integrated virtual hub offerings

Some partners offer Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs) that can be deployed directly into the Azure Virtual WAN hub through a solution that is jointly managed by Microsoft Azure and third-party Network Virtual Appliance solution providers.

When a Network Virtual Appliance is deployed into a Virtual WAN hub, it can serve as a third-party gateway with various functionalities. It could serve as an SD-WAN gateway, Firewall or a combination of both. For more information about  deploying an NVA into a Virtual WAN hub and available partners, see [About NVAs in a Virtual WAN hub](about-nva-hub.md).



## <a name="automation"></a>Branch IPsec connectivity automation from partners

Devices that connect to Azure Virtual WAN have built-in automation to connect. This is typically set up in the device-management UI (or equivalent), which sets up the connectivity and configuration management between the VPN branch device to an Azure Virtual hub VPN endpoint (VPN gateway).

The following high-level automation is set up in the device console/management center:

* Appropriate permissions for the device to access Azure Virtual WAN Resource Group.
* Uploading of Branch Device into Azure Virtual WAN.
* Automatic download of Azure connectivity information.
* Configuration of on-premises branch device.

Some connectivity partners may extend the automation to include creating the Azure Virtual hub VNet and VPN gateway. If you want to know more about automation, see [Automation guidelines for Virtual WAN partners](virtual-wan-configure-automation-providers.md).

[!INCLUDE [partners](../../includes/virtual-wan-partners-include.md)]

The following partners are slated on our roadmap based on a terms sheet signed between the companies indicating the scope of work to automate IPsec connectivity between the partner device and Azure Virtual WAN VPN gateways: 128 Technologies, Arista, F5 Networks, Oracle SD-WAN (Talari), and SharpLink.
