# Configure Palo Alto Networks Cloud NGFW in Virtual WAN 


[Palo Alto Networks Cloud Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)](https://aka.ms/pancloudngfwdocs) is a cloud-native software-as-a-service (SaaS) security offering that can be deployed into the Virtual WAN hub as a bump-in-the-wire solution to inspect network traffic. The following document describes some of the key features, critical use cases and how-to associated with using Palo Alto Networks Cloud NGFW in Virtual WAN.

## Background

Palo Alto Networks Cloud NGFW integration with Virtual WAN provides the following benefits to customers:

* **Protect critical workloads** using a highly scalable SaaS security offering that can be injected as a bump-in-the-wire solution in Virtual WAN.
* **Fully managed infrastructure and software lifecycle** under software-as-a-service model.
* **Consumption-based pay-as-you-go** billing. Note that if you use Palo Alto Networks Cloud NGFW, you are not billed for Virtual WAN NVA infrastructure units. Instead, you are billed for pay-as-you-go SaaS consumption through Azure Marketplace as documented in [Palo Alto Networks Cloud NGFW pricing](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cloud-ngfw/azure/cloud-ngfw-for-azure/getting-started-with-cngfw-for-azure/pricing).
* **Cloud-native experience** that has a tight integration with Azure to provide end-to-end Firewall management using Azure portal or Azure APIs. Rule and policy management is also optionally configurable through Palo Alto Network management solution Panorama.
* **Dedicated and streamlined support channel** between Azure and Palo Alto Networks to troubleshoot issues.
* **One-click routing** to configure Virtual WAN to inspect on-premises, Virtual Network and Internet-outbound traffic using Palo Alto Networks Cloud NGFW.

## Use cases

The following section describes the common security use cases for Palo Alto Networks Cloud NGFW in Virtual WAN. 

### Private (on-premises and virtual network) traffic 

#### East-west traffic inspection

Virtual WAN routes traffic from  Virtual Networks to Virtual Network or from  on-premises (Site-to-site VPN, ExpressRoute, Point-to-site VPN) to on-premises to Cloud NGFW deployed in the hub for inspection.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-palo-alto-cloudngfw/east-west-cloud-ngfw.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing east-west traffic flows with Cloud NGFW." lightbox="./media/how-to-palo-alto-cloudngfw/east-west-cloud-ngfw.png":::

#### North-south traffic inspection

Virtual WAN also routes traffic between  Virtual Networks and on-premises (Site-to-site VPN, ExpressRoute, Point-to-site VPN) to on-premises to Cloud NGFW deployed in the hub for inspection.

### Internet edge

>[!NOTE]
> The 0.0.0.0/0 default route does not propagate across hubs. On-premises and Virtual Networks can only use local Cloud NGFW resources to access the Internet. Additionally, for Destination NAT use cases, Cloud NGFW can only forward incoming traffic to local Virtual Networks and on-premises.

#### Internet egress

Virtual WAN can be configured to route internet-bound traffic from Virtual Networks or on-premises to Cloud NGFW for inspection and internet breakout. You can selectively choose which Virtual Network(s) or on-premise(s) learn the default route (0.0.0.0/0) and use Palo Alto Cloud NGFW for internet egress. In this use case, Azure automatically NATs the source IP of your internet-bound packet to the public IPs associated with the Cloud NGFW.

For more information on internet-outbound capabilities and available settings, see [Palo Alto Networks documentation](https://aka.ms/pancloudngfwdocs). 

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-palo-alto-cloudngfw/internet-outbound-cloud-ngfw.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing internet-outbound traffic flows with Cloud NGFW." lightbox="./media/how-to-palo-alto-cloudngfw/internet-outbound-cloud-ngfw.png":::

#### Internet ingress (DNAT)

You can also configure Palo Alto Networks for Destination-NAT (DNAT). Destination NAT allows a user to access and communicate with an application hosted on-premises or in an Azure Virtual Network via the public IPs associated with the Cloud NGFW.  

For more information on internet-inbound (DNAT) capabilities and available settings, see [Palo Alto Networks documentation](https://aka.ms/pancloudngfwdocs).

## Troubleshooting

The following section describes common issues seen when using Palo Alto Networks Cloud NGFW in Virtual WAN.

### Troubleshooting Cloud NGFW creation

* Ensure your Virtual Hubs are deployed in one of the following regions listed in [Palo Alto Networks documentation](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cloud-ngfw/azure/cloud-ngfw-for-azure/getting-started-with-cngfw-for-azure/supported-regions-and-zones).
* Ensure the Routing status of the Virtual Hub is "Provisioned." Attempts to create Cloud NGFW prior to routing being provisioned will fail.
* Ensure registration to the **PaloAltoNetworks.Cloudngfw** resource provider is successful.

### Troubleshooting deletion

* A SaaS solution can't be deleted until the linked Cloud NGFW resource is deleted. Therefore, delete the Cloud NGFW resource before deleting the SaaS solution resource.
* A SaaS solution resource that is currently the next hop resource for routing intent can't be deleted. Routing intent must be deleted before the SaaS solution resource can be deleted.
* Similarly, a Virtual Hub resource that has a SaaS solution can't be deleted. The SaaS solution must be deleted before the Virtual Hub is deleted.

### Troubleshooting Routing intent and policies

* Ensure Cloud NGFW deployment is completed successfully before attempting to configure Routing Intent.
* Ensure all your on-premises and Azure Virtual Networks are in RFC1918 (subnets within 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12). If there are networks that are not in RFC1918, make sure those prefixes are listed in the Private Traffic prefixes text box.
* For more information about troubleshooting routing intent, see [Routing Intent documentation](how-to-routing-policies.md). This document describes pre-requisites,  common errors associated with configuring routing intent and troubleshooting tips.
