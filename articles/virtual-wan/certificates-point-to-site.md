# Generate and export certificates for User VPN connections using PowerShell

This article shows you how to create a self-signed root certificate and generate client certificates using PowerShell on Windows 10 or later, or Windows Server 2016 or later. The steps in this article help you create **.pfx** and **.cer** files. For **.pem** files, see the Linux [OpenSSL](../vpn-gateway/point-to-site-certificates-linux-openssl.md) or [strongSwan](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site-linux.md) article.

The PowerShell cmdlets that you use to generate certificates are part of the operating system and don't work on other versions of Windows. The host operating system is only used to generate the certificates. Once the certificates are generated, you can upload them or install them on any supported client operating system.

If you don't have a computer that meets the operating system requirement for these instructions, you can either use a small Windows virtual machine as a workaround, or use [MakeCert](certificates-point-to-site-makecert.md) to generate certificates. The certificates that you generate using either method can be installed on any supported client operating system.

## Install an exported client certificate

Each client that connects over a P2S connection requires a client certificate to be installed locally. For steps to install a certificate, see [Install client certificates](install-client-certificates.md).

## Next steps

To continue with your point-to-site configuration, see [Virtual WAN steps for user VPN connections](virtual-wan-point-to-site-portal.md#p2sconfig).
