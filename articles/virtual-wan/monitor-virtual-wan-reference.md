### <a name="hub-router-metrics"></a>Supported metrics for Microsoft.Network/virtualhubs

The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.Network/virtualhubs resource type.

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Network/virtualhubs](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/reference/metrics/microsoft-network-virtualhubs-metrics-include.md)]

This table contains more information about some of the metrics in the preceding table.

| Metric | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| **Routing Infrastructure Units** | The virtual hub's routing infrastructure units (RIU). The virtual hub's RIU determines how much bandwidth the virtual hub router can process for flows traversing the virtual hub router. The hub's RIU also determines how many VMs in spoke VNets the virtual hub router can support. For more information on routing infrastructure units, see [Virtual Hub Capacity](hub-settings.md#capacity).
| **Spoke VM Utilization** | The approximate number of deployed spoke VMs as a percentage of the total number of spoke VMs that the hub's routing infrastructure units can support. For example, if the hub's RIU is set to 2, which supports 2,000 spoke VMs, and 1,000 VMs are deployed across spoke virtual networks, this metric's value is approximately 50%.  |
| **Count Of Routes Advertised To Peer** | The Virtual WAN hub router exchanges routes with all active instances of ExpressRoute gateways, VPN  gateways and NVAs deployed in the Virtual WAN hub or in a connected Virtual Network spoke. When the Virtual WAN hub router learns a  prefix with the same AS-PATH length from multiple peers, the router internally selects a peer to prefer for that specific route and re-advertises that route to all **other** peers (including the other gateway or NVA instance). This  internal route selection process occurs for every route processed and the selected instance can change due to various factors such as network changes or maintenance events. As a result the number of routes advertised to an individual peer may fluctuate. When this metric is viewed with the maximum aggregation, Azure Monitor displays the data associated with a **single** BGP session between the Virtual WAN hub router and gateway or NVA. To effectively monitor changes or potential issues in your network, apply a split in Azure Monitor on the Count of Routes Advertised to Peer metric on a per peer IP address and ensure that the total number of routes advertised to your ExpressRoute, VPN or NVA is stable or in-line with any network changes. The total count of routes advertised must be calculated manually as the Azure Monitor **sum**  aggregation type sums up data-points over the aggregation window, which  does not accurately reflect routes advertised count.   |

[!INCLUDE [microsoft.network/vpngateways](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/reference/logs/microsoft-network-vpngateways-logs-include.md)]

This table contains more information about the preceding table.

| Metric | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| **Gateway Diagnostic Logs** | Gateway-specific diagnostics such as health, configuration, service updates, and other diagnostics. |
| **Tunnel Diagnostic Logs** | IPsec tunnel-related logs such as connect and disconnect events for a site-to-site IPsec tunnel, negotiated SAs, disconnect reasons, and other diagnostics.

| **IKE Diagnostic Logs** | IKE-specific diagnostics for IPsec connections. |

### Log Analytics sample query

If you selected to send diagnostic data to a Log Analytics Workspace, then you can use SQL-like queries, such as the following example, to examine the data. For more information, see [Log Analytics Query Language](/services-hub/health/log-analytics-query-language).

The following example contains a query to obtain site-to-site route diagnostics.

`AzureDiagnostics | where Category == "RouteDiagnosticLog"`

Replace the following values, after the `==`, as needed based on the tables in this article.

- GatewayDiagnosticLog
- IKEDiagnosticLog
- P2SDiagnosticLog
- TunnelDiagnosticLog
- RouteDiagnosticLog

In order to run the query, you have to open the Log Analytics resource you configured to receive the diagnostic logs, and then select **Logs** under the **General** tab on the left side of the pane:

For Azure Firewall, a [workbook](../firewall/firewall-workbook.md) is provided to make log analysis easier. Using its graphical interface, you can investigate the diagnostic data without manually writing any Log Analytics query.
