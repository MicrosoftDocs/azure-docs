# How to configure Route-maps (Preview)

This article helps you create or edit a route-map in an Azure Virtual WAN hub using the Azure portal. For more information about Virtual WAN Route-maps, see [About Route-maps](route-maps-about.md).

## Prerequisites

> [!Important]
> [!INCLUDE [Preview text](../../includes/virtual-wan-route-maps-preview.md)]

Verify that you've met the following criteria before beginning your configuration:

* You have virtual WAN (VWAN) with a connection (S2S, P2S, or ExpressRoute) already configured.
  * For steps to create a VWAN with a S2S connection, see [Tutorial - Create a S2S connection with Virtual WAN](virtual-wan-site-to-site-portal.md).
  * For steps to create a virtual WAN with a P2S User VPN connection, see [Tutorial - Create a User VPN P2S connection with Virtual WAN](virtual-wan-point-to-site-portal.md).
* Be sure to view [About Route-maps](route-maps-about.md#considerations-and-limitations) for considerations and limitations before proceeding with configuration steps.

## Configuration workflow

1. Create a virtual WAN.
1. Create all Virtual WAN virtual hubs needed for testing.
1. Deploy any site-to-site VPN, point-to-site VPN, ExpressRoute gateways, and NVAs needed for testing.
1. Verify that incoming and outgoing routes are working as expected.
1. Configure a route-map and route-map rules, then save. For more information about route-map rules, see [About Route-maps](route-maps-about.md).
1. Once a route-map is configured, the virtual hub router and gateways begin an upgrade needed to support the Route-maps feature.

   * The upgrade process takes around 30 minutes.
   * The upgrade process only happens the first time a route-map is created on a hub.
   * If the route-map is deleted, the virtual hub router remains on the new version of software.
   * Using Route-maps incurs an additional charge. For more information, see the [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-wan/) page.
1. The process is complete when the **Provisioning state** is **Succeeded**. Open a support case if the process failed.
1. The route-map can now be applied to connections (ER, S2S VPN, P2S VPN, VNet).
1. Once the route-map is applied in the correct direction, use the [Route-map dashboard](route-maps-dashboard.md) to verify that the route-map is working as expected.

## Create a route-map

The following steps walk you through how to configure a route-map.

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Virtual WAN resource. Select **Hubs** to view the list of hubs.
1. Select the hub that you want to configure to open the **Virtual Hub** page.
1. On the Virtual Hub page, in the Routing section, select **Route-maps** to open the Route-maps page. On the Route-maps page, select **+ Add Route-map** to create a new route-map.
1. On the **Create Route-map** page, provide a Name for the route-map.
1. Then, select **+ Add Route-map** to create rules in the route-map.
1. On the **Create Route-map rule** page, complete the necessary configuration.

   * **Name** – Provide a name for the route-map rule.
   * **Next step** – From the dropdown, select **Continue** if routes matching this rule must be processed by subsequent rules in the route-map. If not, select **Terminate**.
   * **Match conditions** – Each **Match Condition** requires a Property, Criterion, and a Value. There can be 0 or more match conditions.
     * To add a new match condition, select the empty row in the table.
     * To delete a row, select delete icon at the end of the row.
     * To add multiple values under Value, use comma (,) as the delimiter. Refer to [About Route-maps](route-maps-about.md) for list of supported match conditions.
   * **Actions > Action on match routes** – Select **Drop** to deny the matched routes, or **Modify** to permit and modify the matched routes.
   * **Actions > Route modifications** – Each **Action** statement requires a Property, an Action, and a Value. There can be 0 or more route modification statements.
     * To add a new statement, select the empty row in the table.
     * To delete a row, select delete icon at the end of the row.
     * To add multiple values under Value, use comma (,) as the delimiter. Refer to [About Route-maps](route-maps-about.md) for list of supported actions.

1. Select **Add** to complete rule configuration. When you select **Add**, this  stores the rule temporarily on the Azure portal, but isn't saved to the route-map yet. Select **Okay** on the **Reminder** dialog box to acknowledge that the rule isn't completely saved yet and proceed to the next-step.

1. Repeat steps 6 and 7 to add additional rules, if necessary.

1. On the **Create Route-map** page, after all the rules are added, ensure that the order of the rules is as desired. Adjust the rules as necessary by hovering your mouse on a row, then clicking and holding the 3 dots and dragging the row up or down. When you finish adjusting the rule order, select **Save** to save all the rules to the route-map.

1. It takes a few minutes to save the route-map and the route-map rules. Once saved, the **Provisioning state** shows **Succeeded**.


## Apply a route-map to connections

Once the route-map is saved, you can apply the route-map to the desired connections in the virtual hub.

1. On the **Route-maps** page, select **Apply Route-maps to connections**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/route-maps-how-to/apply-to-connections.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Apply Route-maps to connections." lightbox="./media/route-maps-how-to/apply-to-connections.png":::

1. On the **Apply Route-maps to connections** page, configure the following settings.

   * Select the drop-down box under **Inbound Route-map** and select the route-map you want to apply in the ingress direction.
   * Select the drop-down box under **Outbound Route-map** and select the route-map you want to apply in the egress direction.
   * The table at the bottom lists all the connections to the virtual hub. Select one or more connections you want to apply the route-maps to.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/route-maps-how-to/save.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows configuring and saving settings." lightbox="./media/route-maps-how-to/save.png":::

1. When you finish configuring these settings, select **Save**.

1. Verify the changes by opening **Apply Route-maps to connections** again from the **Route-maps** page.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/route-maps-how-to/verify.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Apply Route-maps to connections page to verify changes." lightbox="./media/route-maps-how-to/verify.png":::

1. Once the route-map is applied in the correct direction, use the [Route-map dashboard](route-maps-dashboard.md) to verify that the route-map is working as expected.

## Modify or remove a route-map or route-map rules

1. To modify or remove an existing Route-map, go to the **Route-maps** page.

1. On the line for the route-map that you want to work with, select **… > Edit** or **… > Delete**, respectively.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/route-maps-how-to/edit.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to modify or remove a route-map or rules." lightbox="./media/route-maps-how-to/edit.png":::

## Modify or remove a route-map from a connection

To modify or remove an existing Route-map rule, use the following steps.

1. On the **Route-maps page**, on the line for the route-map that you want to edit, select **… > Edit**.

1. On **Edit Route-map** page, select **… > Edit** to edit the route-map rule.

1. Modify the rule as required. On the **Edit Route-map rule** page, select **Add**, and on Reminder dialog box, select **Okay** to store the rule changes temporarily and proceed to next step.

1. On the **Edit Route-map** page, select **Save**.
