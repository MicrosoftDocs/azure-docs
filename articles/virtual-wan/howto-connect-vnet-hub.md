# Connect a virtual network to a Virtual WAN hub - portal

This article helps you connect your virtual network to your virtual hub using the Azure portal. You can also use [PowerShell](howto-connect-vnet-hub-powershell.md) to complete this task. Repeat these steps for each VNet that you want to connect.

Before you create a connection, be aware of the following:

* A virtual network can only be connected to one virtual hub at a time.
* In order to connect it to a virtual hub, the remote virtual network can't have a gateway (ExpressRoute or VPN) or RouteServer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If VPN gateways are present in the virtual hub, this operation as well as any other write operation on the connected VNet can cause disconnection to Point-to-site clients as well as reconnection of site-to-site tunnels and BGP sessions.

## Add a connection

[!INCLUDE [Connect](../../includes/virtual-wan-connect-vnet-hub-include.md)]

> [!NOTE]
>
> * To delete a virtual network connected to the virtual hub, you must delete both the virtual network connection and virtual network resource.
