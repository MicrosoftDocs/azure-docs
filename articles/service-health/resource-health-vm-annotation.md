# Resource Health virtual machine Health Annotations

When the health of your virtual machine is impacted by availability impacting disruptions (see [Resource types and health checks](resource-health-checks-resource-types.md)), the platform emits context as to why the disruption has occurred to assist you in responding appropriately. 

The below table summarizes all the annotations that the platform emits today:

| Annotation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| VirtualMachineRestarted	| The Virtual Machine is undergoing a reboot as requested by a restart action triggered by an authorized user or process from within the Virtual Machine. No other action is required at this time. For more information, see [understanding Virtual Machine reboots in Azure](/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/understand-vm-reboot). |
| VirtualMachineCrashed | The Virtual Machine is undergoing a reboot due to a guest OS crash. The local data remains unaffected during this process. No other action is required at this time. For more information, see [understanding Virtual Machine crashes in Azure](/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/understand-vm-reboot#vm-crashes). |
| VirtualMachineStorageOffline | The Virtual Machine is either currently undergoing a reboot or experiencing an application freeze due to a temporary loss of access to disk. |
| VirtualMachineFailedToSecureBoot | Applicable to Azure Confidential Compute Virtual Machines when guest activity such as unsigned booting components leads to a guest OS issue preventing the Virtual Machine from booting securely. You can attempt to retry deployment after ensuring OS boot components are signed by trusted publishers. For more information, see [Secure Boot](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-secure-boot). |
| LiveMigrationSucceeded | The Virtual Machine was briefly paused as a Live Migration operation was successfully performed on your Virtual Machine. This operation was carried out either as a repair action, for allocation optimization or as part of routine maintenance workflows. No other action is required at this time. For more information, see [Live Migration](../virtual-machines/maintenance-and-updates.md#live-migration). |
| LiveMigrationFailure | A Live Migration operation was attempted on your Virtual Machine as either a repair action, for allocation optimization or as part of routine maintenance workflows. This operation, however, could not be successfully completed and may have resulted in a brief pause of your Virtual Machine. No other action is required at this time. <br/> Also note that [M Series](../virtual-machines/m-series.md), [L Series](../virtual-machines/lasv3-series.md) VM SKUs are not applicable for Live Migration. For more information, see [Live Migration](../virtual-machines/maintenance-and-updates.md#live-migration). |
| VirtualMachineAllocated | The Virtual Machine is in the process of being set up as requested by an authorized user or process. No other action is required at this time. |
| VirtualMachineDeallocationInitiated | The Virtual Machine is in the process of being stopped and deallocated as requested by an authorized user or process. No other action is required at this time. |
| VirtualMachineHostCrashed | The Virtual Machine has unexpectedly crashed due to the underlying host server experiencing a software failure or due to a failed hardware component. While the Virtual Machine is rebooting, the local data remains unaffected. You may attempt to redeploy the Virtual Machine to a different host server if you continue to experience issues. |
| VirtualMachineMigrationInitiatedForPlannedMaintenance | The Virtual Machine is being migrated to a different host server as part of routine maintenance workflows orchestrated by the platform. No other action is required at this time. For more information, see [Planned Maintenance](../virtual-machines/maintenance-and-updates.md). |
| VirtualMachineRebootInitiatedForPlannedMaintenance |	The Virtual Machine is undergoing a reboot as part of routine maintenance workflows orchestrated by the platform. No other action is required at this time. For more information, see [Maintenance and updates](../virtual-machines/maintenance-and-updates.md). |
| VirtualMachineHostRebootedForRepair |	The Virtual Machine is undergoing a reboot due to the underlying host server experiencing unexpected failures. While the Virtual Machine is rebooting, the local data remains unaffected. For more information, see [understanding Virtual Machine reboots in Azure](/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/understand-vm-reboot). |
| VirtualMachineMigrationInitiatedForRepair |	The Virtual Machine is being migrated to a different host server due to the underlying host server experiencing unexpected failures. Since the Virtual Machine is being migrated to a new host server, the local data will not persist. For more information, see [Service Healing](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/service-healing-auto-recovery-of-virtual-machines/). |
| VirtualMachineRedeployInitiatedByControlPlaneDueToPlannedMaintenance |	The Virtual Machine is being migrated to a different host server as part of routine maintenance workflows triggered by an authorized user or process. Since the Virtual Machine is being migrated to a new host server, the local data will not persist. For more information, see [Maintenance and updates](../virtual-machines/maintenance-and-updates.md). |
| VirtualMachineMigrationScheduledForDegradedHardware |	The Virtual Machine is experiencing degraded availability as it is running on a host server with a degraded hardware component which is predicted to fail soon. Live Migration will be attempted to safely migrate your Virtual Machine to a healthy host server; however, the operation may fail depending on the degradation of the underlying hardware. <br/> We strongly advise you to redeploy your Virtual Machine to avoid unexpected failures by the redeploy deadline specified. For more information, see [Advancing failure prediction and mitigation](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/advancing-failure-prediction-and-mitigation-introducing-narya/). |
| VirtualMachinePossiblyDegradedDueToHardwareFailure | The Virtual Machine is experiencing an imminent risk to its availability as it is running on a host server with a degraded hardware component that will fail soon. Live Migration will be attempted to safely migrate your Virtual Machine to a healthy host server; however, the operation may fail. <br/> We strongly advise you to redeploy your Virtual Machine to avoid unexpected failures by the redeploy deadline specified. For more information, see [Advancing failure prediction and mitigation](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/advancing-failure-prediction-and-mitigation-introducing-narya/). |
| VirtualMachineScheduledForServiceHealing |	The Virtual Machine is experiencing an imminent risk to its availability as it is running on a host server that is experiencing fatal errors. Live Migration will be attempted to safely migrate your Virtual Machine to a healthy host server; however, the operation may fail depending on the failure signature encountered by the host server. <br/> We strongly advise you to redeploy your Virtual Machine to avoid unexpected failures by the redeploy deadline specified. For more information, see [Advancing failure prediction and mitigation](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/advancing-failure-prediction-and-mitigation-introducing-narya/). |
| VirtualMachinePreempted |	If you are running a Spot/Low Priority Virtual Machine, it has been preempted either due to capacity recall by the platform or due to billing-based eviction where cost exceeded user defined thresholds. No other action is required at this time. For more information, see [Spot Virtual Machines](../virtual-machines/spot-vms.md). |
| VirtualMachineRebootInitiatedByControlPlane | The Virtual Machine is undergoing a reboot as requested by an authorized user or process from within the Virtual machine. No other action is required at this time. |
| VirtualMachineRedeployInitiatedByControlPlane |	The Virtual Machine is being migrated to a different host server as requested by an authorized user or process from within the Virtual machine. No other action is required at this time. Since the Virtual Machine is being migrated to a new host server, the local data will not persist. |
| VirtualMachineSizeChanged |	The Virtual Machine is being resized as requested by an authorized user or process. No other action is required at this time. |
|VirtualMachineConfigurationUpdated |	The Virtual Machine configuration is being updated as requested by an authorized user or process. No other action is required at this time. |
| VirtualMachineStartInitiatedByControlPlane |The Virtual Machine is starting as requested by an authorized user or process. No other action is required at this time. |
| VirtualMachineStopInitiatedByControlPlane |	The Virtual Machine is stopping as requested by an authorized user or process. No other action is required at this time. |
| VirtualMachineStoppedInternally |	The Virtual Machine is stopping as requested by an authorized user or process, or due to a guest activity from within the Virtual Machine. No other action is required at this time. |
| VirtualMachineProvisioningTimedOut |	The Virtual Machine provisioning has failed due to Guest OS issues or incorrect user run scripts. You can attempt to either re-create this Virtual Machine. If this Virtual Machine is part of a virtual machine scale set, you can try reimaging it. |

| AccelnetUnhealthy |	Applicable if Accelerated Networking is enabled for your Virtual Machine – We have detected that the Accelerated Networking feature is not functioning as expected. You can attempt to redeploy your Virtual Machine to potentially mitigate the issue. |
