# Resource Health virtual machine Health Annotations

Virtual Machine (VM) health annotations inform you of any ongoing activity that influences the availability of your VMs (see [Resource types and health checks](resource-health-checks-resource-types.md)). Annotations carry metadata that help you rationalize the exact impact to availability. 

Here are more details on important attributes we recently added,  to help you understand below annotations you may observe in [Resource Health](resource-health-overview.md), [Azure Resource Graph](/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview) and [Event Grid System](/azure/event-grid/event-schema-health-resources?tabs=event-grid-event-schema) topics:

- **Context**: Informs whether VM availability was influenced due to Azure or user orchestrated activity. This can assume values of _Platform Initiated | Customer Initiated | VM Initiated | Unknown_
- **Category**: Informs whether VM availability was influenced due to planned or unplanned activity. This is only applicable to ‘Platform-Initiated’ events. This can assume values of _Planned | Unplanned | Not Applicable | Unknown_
- **ImpactType**: Informs the type of impact to VM availability. This can assume values of:

    - *Downtime Reboot or Downtime Freeze*:  Informs when VM is Unavailable due to Azure orchestrated activity (e.g., VirtualMachineStorageOffline, LiveMigrationSucceeded etc.). The reboot or freeze distinction can help you discern the type of downtime impact faced.

    - *Degraded*: Informs when Azure predicts a HW failure on the host server or detects potential degradation in performance. (e.g., VirtualMachinePossiblyDegradedDueToHardwareFailure)
    - *Informational*: Informs when an authorized user or process triggers a control plane operation (e.g., VirtualMachineDeallocationInitiated, VirtualMachineRestarted). This category also captures cases of platform actions due to customer defined thresholds or conditions. (E.g., VirtualMachinePreempted)

The below table summarizes all the annotations that the platform emits today:


| Annotation | Description | Attributes |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| VirtualMachineRestarted	| The Virtual Machine is undergoing a reboot as requested by a restart action triggered by an authorized user or process from within the Virtual Machine. No other action is required at this time.
