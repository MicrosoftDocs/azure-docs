# Azure Migrate appliance

This article summarizes the prerequisites and support requirements for the Azure Migrate appliance.

## Deployment scenarios

The Azure Migrate appliance is used in the following scenarios.

**Scenario** | **Tool** | **Used to**
--- | --- | ---
**Discovery and assessment of servers running in VMware environment** | Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment | Discover servers running in your VMware environment<br/><br/> Perform discovery of installed software inventory, ASP.NET web apps, SQL Server instances and databases, and agentless dependency analysis.<br/><br/> Collect server configuration and performance metadata for assessments.
**Agentless migration of servers running in VMware environment** | Migration and modernization | Discover servers running in your VMware environment. <br/><br/> Replicate servers without installing any agents on them.
**Discovery and assessment of servers running in Hyper-V environment** | Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment | Discover servers running in your Hyper-V environment.<br/><br/> Perform discovery of installed software inventory, SQL Server instances and databases, and agentless dependency analysis.<br/><br/> Collect server configuration and performance metadata for assessments.
**Discovery and assessment of physical or virtualized servers on-premises** |  Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment |  Discover physical or virtualized servers on-premises.<br/><br/> Perform discovery of installed software inventory, ASP.NET web apps, SQL Server instances and databases, and agentless dependency analysis.<br/><br/> Collect server configuration and performance metadata for assessments.


## Deployment methods

The appliance can be deployed using a couple of methods:

- The appliance can be deployed using a template for servers running in VMware or Hyper-V environment ([OVA template for VMware](how-to-set-up-appliance-vmware.md) or [VHD for Hyper-V](how-to-set-up-appliance-hyper-v.md)).
- If you don't want to use a template, you can deploy the appliance for VMware or Hyper-V environment using a [PowerShell installer script](deploy-appliance-script.md).
- In Azure Government, you should deploy the appliance using a PowerShell installer script. Refer to the steps of deployment [here](deploy-appliance-script-government.md).
- For physical or virtualized servers on-premises or any other cloud, you always deploy the appliance using a PowerShell installer script.Refer to the steps of deployment [here](how-to-set-up-appliance-physical.md).
- Download links are available in the tables below.

    > [!Note]
    > - Don't install any other components, such as the **Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA)** or **Replication appliance**, on the same server hosting the Azure Migrate appliance. If you install the MMA agent, you can face problems like **"Multiple custom attributes of the same type found"**. It's recommended to have a dedicated server to deploy the appliance.
    > - Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) mode is not supported for appliance deployment. 

## Appliance services

The appliance has the following services:

- **Appliance configuration manager**: This is a web application, which can be configured with source details to start the discovery and assessment of servers.
- **Discovery agent**: The agent collects server configuration metadata, which can be used to create as on-premises assessments.
- **Assessment agent**: The agent collects server performance metadata, which can be used to create performance-based assessments.
- **Auto update service**: The service keeps all the agents running on the appliance up-to-date. It automatically runs once every 24 hours.
- **SQL discovery and assessment agent**: sends the configuration and performance metadata of SQL Server instances and databases to Azure.
- **DRA agent**: Orchestrates server replication, and coordinates communication between replicated servers and Azure. Used only when replicating servers to Azure using agentless migration.
- **Gateway**: Sends replicated data to Azure. Used only when replicating servers to Azure using agentless migration.
- **Web apps discovery and assessment agent**: sends the web apps configuration data to Azure.

## Appliance upgrades

The appliance is upgraded as the Azure Migrate services running on the appliance are updated. This happens automatically, because auto-update is enabled on the appliance by default. You can change this default setting, to update the appliance services manually.

### Turn off auto-update

1. On the server running the appliance, open the Registry Editor.
2. Navigate to **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AzureAppliance**.
3. To turn off auto-update, create a registry key **AutoUpdate** key with DWORD value of 0.

    ![Screenshot of process to set the registry key.](./media/migrate-appliance/registry-key.png)


### Turn on auto-update

You can turn on auto-update using either of these methods:

- By deleting the AutoUpdate registry key from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AzureAppliance.
- Select **View appliance services** from the latest update checks in the **Set up prerequisites** panel to turn on auto-update.

To delete the registry key:

1. On the server running the appliance, open the Registry Editor.
2. Navigate to **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AzureAppliance**.
3. Delete the registry key **AutoUpdate**, that was previously created to turn off auto-update.

To turn on from Appliance Configuration Manager, after discovery is complete:

1. On the appliance configuration manager, go to **Set up prerequisites** panel
2. In the latest updates check, select **View appliance services** and select the link to turn on auto-update.

    ![Image of turn on auto updates screen.](./media/migrate-appliance/autoupdate-off.png)

### Check the appliance services version

You can check the appliance services version using either of these methods:

- In Appliance configuration manager, go to **Set up prerequisites** panel.
- On the appliance, in the **Control Panel** > **Programs and Features**.

To check in the Appliance configuration manager:

1. On the appliance configuration manager, go to **Set up prerequisites** panel
2. In the latest updates check, select **View appliance services**.

    ![Screenshot of screen to check the version.](./media/migrate-appliance/versions.png)

    ![Screenshot of process to check version in Control Panel.](./media/migrate-appliance/programs-features.png)

### Manually update an older version

If you are running an older version for any of the services, you must uninstall the service, and manually update to the latest version.

1. To check for the latest appliance service versions, [download](https://aka.ms/latestapplianceservices) the LatestComponents.json file.

2. After downloading, open the LatestComponents.json file in Notepad.

3. Find the latest service version in the file, and the download link for it. For example:

   `"Name": "ASRMigrationWebApp", "DownloadLink": "https://download.microsoft.com/download/f/3/4/f34b2eb9-cc8d-4978-9ffb-17321ad9b7ed/MicrosoftAzureApplianceConfigurationManager.msi", "Version": "6.0.211.2", "Md5Hash": "e00a742acc35e78a64a6a81e75469b84"`

4. Download the latest version of an outdated service, using the download link in the file.

5. After downloading, run the following command in an administrator command window, to verify the integrity of the downloaded MSI.

   `C:\> Get-FileHash -Path <file_location> -Algorithm [Hashing Algorithm]`

    For example:

    `C:\> CertUtil -HashFile C:\Users\public\downloads\MicrosoftAzureApplianceConfigurationManager.MSI MD5`

5. Check that the command output matches the hash value entry for the service in the file (for example, the MD5 hash value above).

6. Now, run the MSI to install the service. It's a silent install, and the installation window closes after it's done.

7. After installation is complete, check the version of the service in **Control panel** > **Programs and Features**. The service version should now be upgraded to the latest shown in the json file.
