# Interpret the AppCAT 7 report

This article guides you through the AppCAT report to help you understand it for assessing the readiness of your Java application for migration to Azure. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the application and its components. You can use this report to gain insights into the structure and dependencies of the application and to determine its suitability for replatforming and modernization.

## Application list view

The landing page of the report presents an overall view of all analyzed applications. From here, you can navigate to individual application reports to explore detailed findings.

## Application view

The application report consists of the following three sections:

- **Application Information**: reveals the basic information of your application including Java version, framework, build tool, and so on.
- **Issue Summary**: shows the issue overview for three domains with percentages for issue criticality.
- The detail report is organized into the following four subsections:
  - **Issues**: Provides a concise summary of all issues that require attention.
  - **Dependencies**: Displays all Java-packaged dependencies found within the application.
  - **Technologies**: Displays all embedded libraries grouped by functionality, enabling you to quickly view the technologies used in the application.
  - **Insights**: Displays file details and information to help you understand the detected technologies.

### Issues

Access this part by selecting the **Issues** tab. This tab provides a categorized issues list of various aspects of Azure readiness, cloud native, and Java modernization that you need to address to successfully migrate the application to Azure. The following tables describe the **Domain** and **Criticality** values:

| Domain             | Description                                                                                     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Azure readiness    | Identifies app dependencies and suggests equivalent Azure solutions.                            |
| cloud native       | Assesses how well the app follows cloud-native practices like scalability and containerization. |
| Java modernization | Identifies JDK and framework issues for version upgrade.                                        |

| Criticality | Description                                                 |
