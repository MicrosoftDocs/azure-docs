## Azure Migrate application and code assessment

Azure Migrate is a central hub for carrying out at-scale migrations. It helps decide, plan, and execute server infrastructure migrations to Azure. It can also discover data and webapp workloads' config files running on the discovered servers and generate business case and high level assessments. Azure Migrate is the recommended tool for performing end-to-end server discovery, assessment, and migrations. It also performs assessments of data and webapps at a configuration level without requiring access to application code, making it suitable for high level analysis.

Azure Migrate offers the following benefits:

- No source code is required.
- Performs high-level virtual machine (VM) portfolio scanning.
- Performs agent-based at-scale portfolio scanning for VMs and applications via VM configuration files for VM and app discovery.
- Good for portfolio scanning, discovery, and assessment, and point and migrate capabilities for VMs.
- Includes a wide array of different tools for specific migration scenarios.

For scenarios that require deeper analysis of the application and migration guidance, several other dimensions such as source code, application configuration and dependency analysis become necessary. Azure Migrate application and code assessment are the tools of choice for you to assess applications. You can get the recommended fixes and a comprehensive report that helps you apply changes for the replatforming exercise.

Azure Migrate application and code assessment for Java and .NET offers the following benefits:

- Assess applications and code for replatform recommendation reports.
- Automatically catch dependencies and linkage that requires attention before migration to Azure.
- Customize your rulesets for specific use cases.
- Produce a comprehensive report for all applications across Java and .NET.
- Have an intelligent experience that assesses your source code with GUI or CLI.
