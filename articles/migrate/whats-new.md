- **Data Box**: Import large amounts of offline data into Azure using Azure Data Box in Azure Migrate.

## Azure Migrate previous version

If you're using the previous version of Azure Migrate (only assessment of on-premises VMware VMs was supported), you should now use the current version. In the previous version, you can no longer create new Azure Migrate projects, or perform new discoveries. You can still access existing projects. To do this in the Azure portal, go to **All services**, search for **Azure Migrate**. In the Azure Migrate notifications, there's a link to access old Azure Migrate projects.
