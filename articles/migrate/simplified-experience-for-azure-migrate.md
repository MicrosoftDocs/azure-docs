# Overview of simplified experience for Azure Migrate

The enhanced agent-based migration stack designed for physical and VMware environments. The upgraded stack offers several significant benefits, such as:

- It enables the migration of newer Linux distributions to Azure, expanding the range of supported operating systems and ensuring that customers can leverage the latest advancements in Linux technology. 
- It utilizes Windows Server 2019 (WS2019) for the replication appliance.
- It offers a unified OS support matrix and implies that customers can benefit from a consistent and streamlined approach to operating system support across their migration processes.

The upgraded agent-based migration stack provides customers with the tools and capabilities to efficiently migrate newer Linux distributions. It also allows them to utilize WS2019 for replication and benefit from a unified OS support matrix. These features enhance the overall migration process to Azure.
