# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to securely configure the Azure Migrate appliance with least privileged access by setting up read-only VMware roles with guest operations and scoped permissions to enable efficient workload discovery, software inventory, and agentless migration.

---

# Set up least privileged accounts in Azure Migrate

The Azure Migrate appliance is a lightweight tool that discovers on-premises servers and sends their configuration and performance data to Azure. It also performs software inventory, performs agentless dependency analysis, and detects workloads like web apps and instances of SQL Server or MySQL Server.

To use these features, you add server and guest credentials in the appliance configuration manager. Following the principle of least privilege helps keep the setup secure and efficient.

## Discovery of the VMware estate

To discover the basic settings of servers running in the VMware estate, you need the following permissions.

### vCenter account permissions

#### Discovery of server metadata

- To discover basic server configurations in a VMware environment, you need these permissions:
  - **Read-only**: Use the built-in read-only role or create a copy of it.
- To discover server metadata and enable software inventory, dependency analysis, and performance assessments, you need these permissions:
  - **Read-only**: Use the built-in read-only role or create a copy of it.
  - **Guest operations**: Add guest operations privileges to the read-only role.

#### Scoped discovery of VMware servers

- To discover specific virtual machines (VMs), assign read permissions at the individual VMs.
- To discover all VMs in a folder, assign read permissions at the folder level and turn on the **Propagate to children** option.
- To enable software inventory, dependency analysis, and performance assessments, assign guest operations permissions to the vCenter account along with read permissions.
- Give read-only access to all parent objects that host the virtual machines, such as the host, cluster, host folder, cluster folder, and datacenter. You don't need to apply these permissions to all child objects.
- In the vSphere client, check that read permissions are set on parent objects in both the **Hosts and Clusters** view and the **VMs & Templates** view.

#### Agentless migration

To perform agentless migration, ensure that the vCenter account that the Azure Migrate appliance uses has permissions at all required levels: datacenter, cluster, host, VM, and datastore. Apply permissions at each level to avoid replication errors.

| vSphere privilege name| Privilege purpose| Required | API privilege name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Browse datastore  | Allow users to browse VM log files to troubleshoot snapshot creation and deletion  | Datastores  | `Datastore.Browse`  |
| Low level file operations  | Allow read, write, delete, and rename actions in the datastore browser to troubleshoot snapshot creation and deletion |Datastores  | `Datastore.FileManagement`  |
| Change Configuration - Toggle disk change tracking  | Allow users to enable or disable change tracking of VM disks to pull changed blocks of data between snapshots  | Virtual machines  | `VirtualMachine.Config.ChangeTracking`  |
| Change Configuration - Acquire disk lease  | Allow disk lease operations on a VM to read the disk by using the VMware vSphere Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK)  | Virtual machines  | `VirtualMachine.Config.DiskLease` |
| Provisioning - Allow read-only disk access  | Allow read-only disk access: opening a disk on a VM to read the disk by using the VDDK | Virtual machines  | `VirtualMachine.Provisioning.DiskRandomRead`  |
| Provisioning - Allow disk access  | Allow opening a disk on a VM to read the disk by using the VDDK  | Virtual machines  | `VirtualMachine.Provisioning.DiskRandomAccess`  |
| Provisioning - Allow virtual machine download  | Allow virtual machine download to read VM files, get logs, and troubleshoot failures | Root host or vCenter Server  | `VirtualMachine.Provisioning.GetVmFiles`  |
| Snapshot management  | Allow discovery, software inventory, and dependency mapping on VMs  | Virtual machines  | `VirtualMachine.State.*`  |
| Guest operations  | Allow creation and management of VM snapshots for replication | Virtual machines | `VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.*`  |
| Interaction Power Off | Allow the VM to be turned off during migration to Azure  | Virtual machines | `VirtualMachine.Interact.PowerOff`  |

### Guest discovery of installed software, dependencies, and workloads

To effectively discover software, application dependencies, and workloads on target servers, the Azure Migrate appliance requires guest operating system (OS) credentials. These credentials enable the appliance to securely connect to the servers and collect detailed inventory and performance data.

#### Quick guest discovery

For quick discovery of software inventory, server dependencies, and database instances, you need the following permissions:

| Use case  | Discovered metadata  | Credential type |Secure permissions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Quick guest discovery  | Software inventory <br /><br /> Server dependencies (limited data) <br /><br />Inventory of database instances  | Windows <br /><br /> Linux | Local guest user account <br /><br /> Any non-Sudo guest user account |

> [!NOTE]
> You can use a Windows guest or a Linux non-Sudo user account to get dependency mapping data. But with least privileged accounts, you might not collect process information (like process name or app name) for some processes that run with higher privileges. These processes appear as **Unknown** under the machine in the single-server view.

#### In-depth guest discovery

For in-depth discovery of software inventory, server dependencies, and web apps such as .NET and Java Tomcat, you need the following permissions:

| Use case  | Discovered metadata  | Credential type| Required permissions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In-depth guest discovery  | Software inventory <br /><br /> Server dependencies (full data)<br /><br /> Inventory of database instances <br /><br /> Web apps like .NET and Java Tomcat  | Windows | Administrator  |
|In-depth guest discovery | Software inventory <br /><br /> Server dependencies (full data)<br /><br /> Inventory of database instances <br /><br /> Web apps like .NET and Java Tomcat  | Linux  | The following Sudo permissions are required to identify server dependencies: `/usr/bin/netstat` and `/usr/bin/ls`. <br /><br /> If `netstat` is not available, Sudo permissions on `ss` are required. <br /><br /> For Java web app discovery (Tomcat servers), the user should have read and execute (`r-x`) permissions on all Catalina homes. <br /><br /> Use the following command to find all Catalina homes: `ps -ef \| grep catalina.home`. <br /><br /> Here's a sample command to set up a least privileged user: `setfacl -m u:<username>:rx <catalina/home/path>`.  |

## Discovery of the Hyper-V estate

To find the basic settings of servers running in the Hyper-V estate, you need certain permissions. On all the Hyper-V hosts, create a local user that's part of these three groups:

- Hyper-V administrators  
- Performance monitor users  
- Remote management users

Use the [script](tutorial-discover-hyper-v.md#prepare-hyper-v-hosts) to prepare Hyper-V hosts.

For deep discovery of the Hyper-V estate and to perform software inventory and dependency analysis, guest account [credentials](#guest-discovery-of-installed-software-dependencies-and-workloads) are required.

## Discovery of physical and cloud servers

To discover and assess physical servers or servers hosted in other public clouds, the Azure Migrate appliance requires credentials with least privileged access. These credentials allow the appliance to connect and gather necessary data without overexposing sensitive system permissions.

### Quick server discovery

For quick discovery of software inventory, server dependencies, and database instances, you need the following permissions:

| Use case  | Discovered metadata  | Credential type | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Quick server discovery | Software inventory <br /><br /> Agentless dependency analysis (limited data) <br /><br /> Workload inventory of databases and web apps| Windows   |[Follow these steps](#windows-servers)|
| Quick server discovery |Software inventory <br /><br /> Agentless dependency analysis (full data) <br /><br /> Workload inventory of databases and web apps   | Linux  | [Follow these steps](#linux-servers) |

#### Windows servers

For quick discovery of Windows servers, create a Windows user account that belongs to the following user groups:

- Remote management users
- Performance monitor users
- Performance log users

The guest user account needs permission to access the **CIMV2** namespace and its sub-namespaces in the **WMI Control** item in Control Panel. To set the access, use the following steps:

1. On the target Windows server, open the **Start** menu, search for **Run**, and then select it.

1. In the **Run** dialog, type `wmimgmt.msc` and then press the Enter key.
  
1. In the **wmimgmt** console, right-click **WMI Control (Local)**, and then select **Properties**.

1. In the **WMI Control (Local) Properties** dialog, select the **Security** tab.

1. Expand the **Root** folder in the namespace tree, and then select the **CIMV2** namespace.

1. Select **Security** to open the **Security for ROOT\CIMV2** dialog.

1. In the **Group or user names** section, select **Add** to open the **Select Users or Groups** dialog.

1. Search for the user account, select it, and then select **OK** to return to the **Security for ROOT\CIMV2** dialog.

1. In the **Group or user names** section, select the guest user account. Validate that the following permissions are allowed:

   - **Enable Account**
   - **Remote Enable**

1. Select **Apply** to enable the permissions that you set on the user account.

1. Restart the WinRM service after you add the new guest user.  

#### Linux servers

For quick discovery of Linux servers:

1. Create a user account; for example, `AzMigrateLeastprivuser`.

1. Grant Sudo privileges to the user for only the required commands by adding the following line in the `/etc/sudoers` file:

   ```
   AzMigrateLeastprivuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/dmidecode, /usr/sbin/fdisk -l, /usr/sbin/fdisk -l *, /usr/bin/ls -l /proc/*/exe, /usr/bin/netstat -atnp, /usr/sbin/lvdisplay ""
   Defaults:AzMigrateLeastprivuser !requiretty

   ```

### In-depth server discovery

For in-depth discovery of software inventory, server dependencies, and web apps such as .NET and Java Tomcat, you need the following permissions:

| Use case | Discovered metadata   | Credential type | Commands to configure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In-depth server discovery | In-depth discovery of web apps such as .NET and Java Tomcat <br /><br />Agentless dependency analysis (full data) |Windows <br /><br /> Linux | Administrator permissions are required. <br /><br /> To discover Java web apps on Tomcat servers, the user account needs read and execute (`r-x`) permissions on all Catalina home directories.<br /><br />Use the following command to find all Catalina homes: `ps -ef \| grep catalina.home`.<br /><br />Here's a sample command to set up a least privileged user: `setfacl -m u:<username>:rx <catalina/home/path>`.  |

## Database discovery

Software inventory is required for initiating workload discovery. To enable it, ensure that guest credentials are added. The permissions to discover SQL and MySQL databases are the same for all appliance types: VMware, Hyper-V, and physical servers.

### Discover SQL Server instances and databases

Create least privileged accounts on individual SQL Server instances. Use Windows authentication and assign only the required permissions.

#### Windows authentication

## Discovery of MySQL Server instances and databases

To discover MySQL databases, add MySQL database credentials to the appliance.  

Ensure that the user who corresponds to the added MySQL credentials has the following privileges:

- Select permission on `information_schema` tables
- Select permission on `mysql.users` tables

For MySQL discovery, ensure the appliance's IP or domain is allowed by configuring the necessary firewall rules and MySQL user privileges. The bind-address in my.cnf should also be set to allow external connections if needed.

Use the following commands to grant the necessary privileges to the MySQL user:

```Mysql
GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'username'@'ip';
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO 'username'@'ip';
GRANT SELECT (User, Host, Super_priv, File_priv, Create_tablespace_priv, Shutdown_priv) ON mysql.user TO 'username'@'ip';
GRANT SELECT ON information_schema.* TO 'username'@'ip';
GRANT SELECT ON performance_schema.* TO 'username'@'ip';  

```
