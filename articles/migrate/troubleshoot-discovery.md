# Troubleshoot ongoing server discovery, software inventory, and SQL and web apps discovery

This article helps you troubleshoot issues with ongoing server discovery, software inventory, and discovery of SQL Server instances and databases.

## Discovered servers not showing in the portal

You get this error when you don't yet see the servers in the portal, and the discovery state is **Discovery in progress**.

### Remediation

If the servers don't appear in the portal, wait for a few minutes because it takes around 15 minutes for discovery of servers running on a vCenter server. It takes 2 minutes for each Hyper-V host added on the appliance for discovery of servers running on the host and 1 minute for discovery of each server added on the physical appliance.

If the state still doesn't change:

- Select **Refresh** on the **Servers, databases and web apps** tab to see the count of the discovered servers in Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment and Migration and modernization.

If the preceding step doesn't work and you're discovering VMware servers:

1. Verify that the vCenter account you specified has the permissions set correctly with access to at least one server.
1. Check on VMware if the vCenter account has access granted at the vCenter VM folder level. Azure Migrate can't discover servers on VMware. [Learn more](set-discovery-scope.md) about scoping discovery.

## Server data not updating in the portal

You get this error if the discovered servers don't appear in the portal or if the server data is outdated.

### Remediation

Wait for a few minutes because it takes up to 30 minutes for changes in discovered server configuration data to appear in the portal and a few hours for changes in software inventory data to appear. If there's no data after this time, refresh and follow these steps:

1. In **Windows, Linux, and SQL Servers** > **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment**, select **Overview**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Appliances**.
1. Select **Refresh services**.
Wait for the refresh operation to finish. You should now see up-to-date information.

## Deleted servers appear in the portal

You get this error when the deleted servers continue to appear in the portal.

### Remediation

If the data continues to appear, wait for 30 minutes and follow these steps:

1. In **Windows, Linux, and SQL Servers** > **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment**, select **Overview**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Appliances**.
1. Select **Refresh services**.
Wait for the refresh operation to finish. You should now see up-to-date information.

## You imported a CSV but see "Discovery is in progress"

This status appears if your CSV upload failed because of a validation failure.

### Remediation

Import the CSV again. Download the previous upload error report, and follow the file's remediation guidance to fix the errors. Download the error report from the **Import Details** section on the **Discover servers** page.

## You don't see software inventory details after you update guest credentials

You get this error when inventory details don't appear even after you update guest credentials.

### Remediation

The software inventory discovery runs once every 24 hours. This process might take a few minutes depending on the number of servers discovered. If you want to see the details immediately, refresh as follows:

1. In **Windows, Linux, and SQL Servers** > **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment**, select **Overview**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Appliances**.
1. Select **Refresh services**.
Wait for the refresh operation to finish. You should now see up-to-date information.

## Unable to export software inventory data

You get this error when you don't have Contributor privileges.

### Remediation

Ensure the user downloading the inventory from the portal has Contributor privileges on the subscription.

## Export the software inventory errors

You can export all the errors and remediations for software inventory from portal by selecting **Export notifications**. The exported CSV file also contains additional information like the timestamp at which the error was encountered.

## Common software inventory errors

Azure Migrate supports software inventory by using Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment. [Learn more](how-to-discover-applications.md) about how software inventory is performed.

For VMware VMs, software inventory is performed by connecting to the servers via the vCenter Server using the VMware APIs. For Hyper-V VMs and physical servers, software inventory is performed by directly connecting to Windows servers using PowerShell remoting on port 5985 (HTTP) and to Linux servers using SSH connectivity on port 22 (TCP).

The table below summarizes all errors encountered when gathering software inventory data through VMware APIs or by directly connecting to servers:

> [!Note]
> The same errors can also be encountered with agentless dependency analysis because it follows the same methodology as software inventory to collect the required data.

| **Error** | **Cause** | **Action** |
|--|--|--|
| **60001**:UnableToConnectToPhysicalServer | Either the [prerequisites](./migrate-support-matrix-physical.md) to connect to the server have not been met or there are network issues in connecting to the server, for instance some proxy settings.| - Ensure that the server meets the prerequisites and [port access requirements](./migrate-support-matrix-physical.md). <br/> - Add the IP addresses of the remote machines (discovered servers) to the WinRM TrustedHosts list on the Azure Migrate appliance, and retry the operation. This is to allow remote inbound connections on servers - _Windows:_ WinRM port 5985 (HTTP) and _Linux:_ SSH port 22 (TCP). <br/>- Ensure that you have chosen the correct authentication method on the appliance to connect to the server. <br/> - If the issue persists, submit a Microsoft support case, providing the appliance machine ID (available in the footer of the appliance configuration manager).|
| **60002**:InvalidServerCredentials| Unable to connect to server. Either you have provided incorrect credentials on the appliance or the credentials previously provided have expired.| - Ensure that you have provided the correct credentials for the server on the appliance. You can check that by trying to connect to the server using those credentials.<br/> - If the credentials added are incorrect or have expired, edit the credentials on the appliance and revalidate the added servers. If the validation succeeds, the issue is resolved.<br/> - If the issue persists, submit a Microsoft support case, providing the appliance machine ID (available in the footer of the appliance configuration manager).|
| **60005**:SSHOperationTimeout | The operation took longer than expected either due to network latency issues or due to the lack of latest updates on the server.| - Ensure that the impacted server has the latest kernel and OS updates installed.<br/>- Ensure that there is no network latency between the appliance and the server. It is recommended to have the appliance and source server on the same domain to avoid latency issues.<br/> - Connect to the impacted server from the appliance and run the commands [documented here](./troubleshoot-appliance.md) to check if they return null or empty data.<br/>- If the issue persists, submit a Microsoft support case providing the appliance machine ID (available in the footer of the appliance configuration manager). |

## Error 9014: HTTPGetRequestToRetrieveFileFailed

### Cause
The issue happens when the VMware discovery agent in the appliance tries to download the output file containing dependency data from the server file system through the ESXi host on which the server is hosted.

### Remediation
- You can test TCP connectivity to the ESXi host _(name provided in the error message)_ on port 443 (required to be open on ESXi hosts to pull dependency data) from the appliance by opening PowerShell on the appliance server and running the following command:

   ````
   Test -NetConnection -ComputeName <Ip address of the ESXi host> -Port 443
   ````

- If the command returns successful connectivity, go to the **Azure Migrate project** > **Discovery and assessment** > **Overview** > **Manage** > **Appliances**, select the appliance name, and select **Refresh services**.

## Error 9018: PowerShellNotFound

### Cause
The error usually appears for servers running Windows Server 2008 or lower.

### Remediation
Install Windows PowerShell 5.1 at this location on the server. Follow the instructions in [Install and Configure WMF 5.1](/previous-versions/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/install/installing-windows-powershell) to install PowerShell in Windows Server.

After you install the required PowerShell version, verify if the error was resolved by following the steps [here](troubleshoot-discovery.md#mitigation-verification).

## Error 9022: GetWMIObjectAccessDenied

### Remediation
Make sure that the user account provided in the appliance has access to WMI namespace and subnamespaces. To set the access:

1.    Go to the server that's reporting this error.
1. Search and select **Run** from the **Start** menu. In the **Run** dialog, enter **wmimgmt.msc** in the **Open** text box and select **Enter**.
1. The wmimgmt console opens where you can find **WMI Control (Local)** in the left pane. Right-click it, and select **Properties** from the menu.
1. In the **WMI Control (Local) Properties** dialog, select the **Securities** tab.
1. Select **Security** to open the **Security for ROOT** dialog.
1. Select **Advanced** to open the **Advanced Security Settings for Root** dialog.
1. Select **Add** to open the **Permission Entry for Root** dialog.
1. Select **Select a principal** to open the **Select Users, Computers, Service Accounts or Groups** dialog.
1. Select the usernames or groups you want to grant access to the WMI, and select **OK**.
1. Ensure you grant execute permissions, and select **This namespace and subnamespaces** in the **Applies to** dropdown list.
1. Select **Apply** to save the settings and close all dialogs.

After you get the required access, verify if the error was resolved by following the steps on [this website](troubleshoot-discovery.md#mitigation-verification).

## Error 9032: InvalidRequest

### Cause
There can be multiple reasons for this issue. One reason is when the username provided (server credentials) on the appliance configuration manager has invalid XML characters. Invalid characters cause an error in parsing the SOAP request.

### Remediation
- Make sure the username of the server credentials doesn't have invalid XML characters and is in the username@domain.com format. This format is popularly known as the UPN format.
- After you edit the credentials on the appliance, verify if the error was resolved by following the steps on [this website](troubleshoot-discovery.md#mitigation-verification).


## Error 10002: ScriptExecutionTimedOutOnVm

### Cause
- This error occurs when the server is slow or unresponsive and the script executed to pull the dependency data starts timing out.
- After the discovery agent encounters this error on the server, the appliance doesn't attempt agentless dependency analysis on the server thereafter to avoid overloading the unresponsive server.
- You'll continue to see the error until you check the issue with the server and restart the discovery service.

### Remediation

1. Sign in to the server encountering this error.
1. Run the following commands on PowerShell:

   ````
   Get-WMIObject win32_operatingsystem;
   Get-WindowsFeature  | Where-Object {$_.InstallState -eq 'Installed' -or ($_.InstallState -eq $null -and $_.Installed -eq 'True')};
   Get-WmiObject Win32_Process;
   netstat -ano -p tcp | select -Skip 4;
   ````
1. If the commands output the result in a few seconds, go to the **Azure Migrate project** > **Discovery and assessment** > **Overview** > **Manage** > **Appliances**, select the appliance name, and select **Refresh services** to restart the discovery service.
1. If the commands are timing out without giving any output, you need to:

   - Figure out which process is consuming high CPU or memory on the server.
   - Try to provide more cores or memory to that server and run the commands again.

## Error 10005: GuestCredentialNotValid

### Remediation
- Ensure the validity of credentials _(friendly name provided in the error)_ by selecting **Revalidate credentials** on the appliance configuration manager.
- Ensure that you can sign in to the affected server by using the same credential provided in the appliance.
- You can try by using another user account (for the same domain, in case the server is domain joined) for that server instead of an administrator account.
- The issue can happen when Global Catalog <-> Domain Controller communication is broken. Check for this problem by creating a new user account in the domain controller and providing the same in the appliance. You might also need to restart the domain controller.
- After you take the remediation steps, verify if the error was resolved by following the steps on [this website](troubleshoot-discovery.md#mitigation-verification).

## Error 10012: CredentialNotProvided

### Cause
This error occurs when you've provided a domain credential with the wrong domain name on the appliance configuration manager. For example, if you provided a domain credential with the username user@abc.com but provided the domain name as def.com, those credentials won't be attempted if the server is connected to def.com and you'll get this error message.

### Remediation
- Go to the appliance configuration manager to add a server credential or edit an existing one as explained in the cause.
- After you take the remediation steps, verify if the error was resolved by following the steps on [this website](troubleshoot-discovery.md#mitigation-verification).

## Mitigation verification
After you use the mitigation steps for the preceding errors, verify if the mitigation worked by running a few PowerCLI commands from the appliance server. If the commands succeed, it means that the issue is resolved. Otherwise, check and follow the remediation steps again.

### For VMware VMs _(using VMware pipe)_
1. Run the following commands to set up PowerCLI on the appliance server:
   ````
   Install-Module -Name VMware.PowerCLI -AllowClobber
   Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -InvalidCertificateAction Ignore
   ````
1. Connect to vCenter Server from the appliance by providing the vCenter Server IP address in the command and credentials in the prompt:
   ````
   Connect-VIServer -Server <IPAddress of vCenter Server>
   ````
1. Connect to the target server from the appliance by providing the server name and server credentials (as provided on the appliance):
   ````
   $vm = get-VM <VMName>
   $credential = Get-Credential
   ````
1. For software inventory, run the following commands to see if you get a successful output:

   - For Windows servers:

      ````
        Invoke-VMScript -VM $vm -ScriptText "powershell.exe 'Get-WMIObject win32_operatingsystem'" -GuestCredential $credential

        Invoke-VMScript -VM $vm -ScriptText "powershell.exe Get-WindowsFeature" -GuestCredential $credential
      ````
   - For Linux servers:

After you verify that the mitigation worked, go to the **Azure Migrate project** > **Discovery and assessment** > **Overview** > **Manage** > **Appliances**, select the appliance name, and select **Refresh services** to start a fresh discovery cycle.
## Discovered SQL Server instances and databases not in the portal

After you've initiated discovery on the appliance, it might take up to 24 hours to start showing the inventory data in the portal.

If you haven't provided Windows authentication or SQL Server authentication credentials on the appliance configuration manager, add the credentials so that the appliance can use them to connect to the respective SQL Server instances.

After the appliance is connected, it gathers configuration and performance data of SQL Server instances and databases. The SQL Server configuration data is updated once every 24 hours, and the performance data is captured every 30 seconds. Any change to the properties of the SQL Server instance and databases, such as database status and compatibility level, can take up to 24 hours to update on the portal.

## SQL Server instance is showing up in a "Not connected" state on the portal

To view the issues encountered during discovery of SQL Server instances and databases, select the **Not connected** status in the connection status column on the **Discovered servers** page in your project.

Creating assessment on top of servers containing SQL instances that weren't discovered completely or are in a not-connected state might lead to readiness being marked as **Unknown**.

## Common SQL Server instances and database discovery errors

Azure Migrate supports discovery of SQL Server instances and databases running on on-premises machines by using Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment. See the [Discovery](tutorial-discover-vmware.md) tutorial to get started.
