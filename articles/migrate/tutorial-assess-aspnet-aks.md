# Assess web apps for migration to Azure Kubernetes Service (preview)

::: zone pivot="asp-net"

This article shows you how to assess ASP.NET web apps for migration to [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) using Azure Migrate. Creating an assessment for your ASP.NET web app provides key insights such as **app-readiness**, **target right-sizing**, and **cost** to host and run these apps month over month.

### Assessment overview

::: zone pivot="asp-net"

:::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-assess-aspnet-aks/assessment-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the assessment overview.":::
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="java"
:::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-assess-aspnet-aks/assessment-overview-java.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the assessment overview for Java.":::
::: zone-end

On the **Overview** page, you're provided with the following details:

1. **Assessed entities**: This section provides the count of servers, web servers, and web apps that are part of this assessment.

2. **Migration readiness**: The assessed web apps have one of the following statuses:

    | Status | Definition |
    | --- | --- |
    | *Ready* | The web app is ready to be migrated |
    | *Ready with conditions* | The web app needs minor changes to be ready for migration |
    | *Not ready* | The web app needs major/breaking changes to be ready for migration |
    | *Unknown* | The web app discovery data was either incomplete or corrupt to calculate readiness |

> [!NOTE]
> Web apps that are either *Ready* or *Ready with conditions* are recommended for migration.

3. **Monthly cost estimate**: This section provides the month over month cost projection of running your migration-ready web apps on AKS.

You can update the **Settings** of the assessment after it's created. This triggers a recalculation.

Selecting the **Export assessment** option exports the entire assessment to an Excel spreadsheet.

### Assessment details

#### Readiness

On the **Readiness** tab, you see the list of web apps assessed. For each web app, you see the readiness status, the cluster, and the recommended AKS Node SKU.

:::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-assess-aspnet-aks/assessment-readiness-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the readiness tab in the assessment details page.":::

Select the readiness condition of an app to see the migration warnings or issues. For apps that are *Ready with conditions*, you'll only see warnings. For apps that are *Not ready*, you see errors and potentially warnings.

For each issue or warning, you're provided the description, cause, and mitigation steps along with useful documentation/blogs for reference.

:::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-assess-aspnet-aks/assessment-readiness-errors.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the readiness errors and warnings for a web app.":::

Selecting the recommended cluster for the app opens the **Cluster details** page. This page surfaces details such as the number of system and user node pools, the SKU for each node pool and the web apps recommended for this cluster. Typically, an assessment will only generate a single cluster. The number of clusters increases when the web apps in the assessment start hitting AKS cluster limits.

:::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-assess-aspnet-aks/assessment-cluster.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the recommended cluster page.":::

#### Cost details

On the **Cost details** tab, you see the breakdown of the monthly cost estimate distributed across AKS node pools. AKS pricing is intrinsically dependent on the node pool costs.

For each node pool, you see the associated node SKU, node count, and the number of web apps recommended to be scheduled, along with the cost. By default, there will be at least two node pools:

1. *System*: Used to host critical system pods such as `CoreDNS`.
2. *User*: As ASP.NET framework apps need a Windows node to run, the assessment recommends at least one additional Windows-based node pool.

## Next steps

- [Modernize](./tutorial-modernize-asp-net-aks.md) your ASP.NET web apps at-scale to Azure Kubernetes Service.
- Optimize [Windows Dockerfiles](/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-docker/optimize-windows-dockerfile?context=/azure/aks/context/aks-context).
- [Review and implement best practices](/azure/aks/best-practices) to build and manage apps on AKS.
