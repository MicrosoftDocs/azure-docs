# Support matrix for web apps migration

This article summarizes support settings and limitations for agentless migration of web apps to Azure App Service [Azure Migrate: Migration and modernization](migrate-services-overview.md) . If you're looking for information about assessing web apps for migration to Azure App Service, review the [assessment support matrix](concepts-azure-webapps-assessment-calculation.md).

## Migration options

You can perform agentless migration of ASP.NET web apps at-scale to [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/) using Azure Migrate. However, agent based migration isn't supported.

## Limitations

- Currently, At-Scale Discovery, Assessment and Migration are supported for ASP.NET web apps deployed to on-premises IIS servers hosted on VMware Environment.
- You can select up to five App Service Plans as part of single migration.
- Currently, we don't support selecting existing App service plans during the migration flow.
- You can migrate web apps up to max 2 GB in size including content stored in mapped virtual directory.
- Currently, we don't support migrating UNC directory content.
- You need Windows PowerShell 4.0 installed on VMs hosting the IIS web servers from which you plan to migrate ASP.NET web apps to Azure App Services.
- Currently, the migration flow doesn't support VNet integrated scenarios.

## ASP.NET web apps migration requirements

Azure Migrate now supports agentless at-scale migration of ASP.NET web apps to [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/). Performing [web apps assessment](./tutorial-assess-webapps.md) is mandatory for migration web apps using the integrated flow in Azure Migrate.
