# Tutorial: Discover SAP systems with Azure Migrate (preview)

As part of your migration journey to Azure, discover your on-premises SAP inventory and workloads.

This tutorial explains how to prepare an import file with server inventory details and to discover the SAP systems within Azure Migrate.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up an Azure Migrate project
> * Prepare the import file
> * Import the SAP systems inventory
> * View discovered SAP systems

> [!NOTE]
> Tutorials show the quickest path for trying out a scenario and using default options. 

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) before you begin.

## Set up an Azure Migrate project

To set up a migration project, follow these steps:

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home) and search for **Azure Migrate**.
1. On the **Get started** page, select **Discover, assess and migrate**.
1. On the **Servers, databases and web apps** page, select **Create project**.
1. On the **Create project** page, do the following:
    1. **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription.
    1. **Resource group**: Select your resource group. If you don't have a resource group, select **Create new** to create one.
    2. **PROJECT DETAILS**:
        1. **Project**: Enter the project name.
        2. **Region**: Select the region in which you want to create the project.
        1. **Advanced**: Expand this option and select a desired **Connectivity method**. <br/>By default, the **Public endpoint** is selected. If you want to create an Azure Migrate project with the private endpoint connectivity, select **Private endpoint**.

    Wait for a few minutes for the project deployment.

## Prepare the import file

To prepare the import file, do the following:

1. Download the template file.
1. Add on-premises SAP infrastructure details.

### Download the template file

To download the template, follow these steps:

1. On the **Azure Migrate** page, select **Servers, databases and web apps**.
1. On the **Servers, databases and web apps** page, under **Assessments tools**, select **Using import** from the **Discover** dropdown menu.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-discover-sap-systems/using-import.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to download a template using import option." lightbox="./media/tutorial-discover-sap-systems/using-import.png":::

1. On the **Discover** page, for **File type**, select **SAP® inventory (XLS)**.
1. Select **Download** to download the template.

> [!Note]
   > To avoid any duplication or inadvertent errors affecting from one discovery file to another discovery file, we recommend you use a new file for every discovery that you plan to run.

### Add on-premises SAP infrastructure details

Collect on-premises SAP system inventory and add it into the template file.
- To collect data, export it from the SAP system and fill in the template with the relevant on-premises SAP system inventory.


The following table summarizes the file fields to fill in:
    
| **Template Column** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Server Name <sup>*</sup> | Unique server name or host name of the SAP system to identify each server. Include all the virtual machines attached to a SAP system that you intend to migrate to Azure. |
| Environment <sup>*</sup> | Environment that the server belongs to. |
| SAP Instance Type <sup>*</sup> | The type of SAP instance running on this machine. <br/>For example, App, ASCS, DB, and so on. Single-server and distributed architectures are only supported. |
| Instance SID <sup>*</sup> | Instance System ID (SID) for the ASCS/AP/DB instance. |
| System SID <sup>*</sup> | SID of SAP System. |
| Landscape SID <sup>*</sup> | SID of the customer's production system in each landscape. |

| RAM Size (GB) | RAM size of the on-premises server. |
| CPU Type | CPU type of the on-premises server.<br/> For example, Xeon Platinum 8171M, and Xeon E5-2673 v3. |
| HW Manufacturer | The manufacturer company of the on-premises server. |
| Model | The on-premises hardware is either a physical server or virtual machine. |
| CPU Mhz | The CPU clock speed of the on-premises server. |
| Total Disk Size(GB) <sup>*</sup> | Total disk volume capacity of the on-premises server. Include the disk volume for each individual disk and provide the total sum. |
| Total Disk IOPS <sup>*</sup> | Total disk Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS) of all the disks on the on-premises server. |
| Source DB Size(GB) <sup>*</sup> | The size of on-premises database. |

## Import SAP systems inventory

After you add information to the import file, import the file from your machine to Azure Migrate.

To import SAP systems inventory, follow these steps:

1. On the **Azure Migrate** page, select **Servers, databases and web apps**.
1. On the **Servers, databases and web apps** page, under **Assessments tools**, from the **Discover** dropdown menu, select **Using import**.
1. On the **Discover** page, under **Import the file**, upload the XLS file.
1. Select **Import**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-discover-sap-systems/import-excel.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to import SAP inventory." lightbox="./media/tutorial-discover-sap-systems/import-excel.png":::

    Review the import details to check for any errors or validation failures. After a successful import, you can view the discovered SAP systems.
    > [!Note]
    > After you complete a discovery import, we recommend you to wait for 15 minutes before you start a new assessment. This ensures that all Excel data is accurately used during the assessment calculation.

## View discovered SAP systems

To view the discovered SAP systems, follow these steps:

1. On the **Azure Migrate** page, select **Servers, databases and web apps**.
1. On the **Servers, databases and web apps** page, under **Assessments tools**, select the number associated with **Discovered SAP® systems**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-discover-sap-systems/discovered-systems.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows discovered SAP inventory." lightbox="./media/tutorial-discover-sap-systems/discovered-systems.png":::

1. On the **Discovered SAP® systems** page, select a desired system SID.<br> The **Server instance details** blade displays all the attributes of servers that make up the SID.

> [!Note]
> Wait for 10 minutes and ensure that the imported information is fully reflected in the **Server instance details** blade.
