# Tutorial: Assess MySQL databases for migration to Azure Database for MySQL (preview)


As part of your migration journey to Azure, you assess the workloads to measure cloud readiness, identify risks, and estimate costs and complexity. This tutorial describes how to assess discovered MySQL database instances before migrating to Azure Database for MySQL, using the Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment tool.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> - [Run an assessment based on MySQL performance and configuration data](#run-an-assessment).
> - [View a MySQL assessment](#view-an-assessment).
> - [Review confidence ratings](#review-confidence-ratings)


## Prerequisites

 - An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/). 
 - Before you assess your MySQL database instance migration to Azure Database for MySQL, ensure you've [discovered the MySQL instances](tutorial-discover-mysql-database-instances.md) that you want to assess using the Azure Migrate appliances.


## Run an assessment

To create and run a MySQL assessment, follow these steps:

1. In **Servers, databases and web apps**, select **Discover, assess and migrate**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/create-mysql-assessment/assess-migrate.png" alt-text="Screenshot on how to get started with assessment.":::
   
1. On **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment**, select **Assess**, and choose the assessment type as **MySQL database**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="./media/create-mysql-assessment/assess-mysql-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot on how to get started with assessment of mysql database.":::
   
1. In **Create assessment**, you can see the **Assessment type** as *MySQL assessment* and the **Discovery source** as *Servers discovered from Azure Migrate appliance* selected by default.

1. Select **Edit** to review the assessment settings. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/create-mysql-assessment/edit-mysql-assessment-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot on how to edit mysql assessment settings.":::

1. In **Assessment properties**, you can retain the default values or set the necessary values:

   **Target and pricing settings**

   | **Setting** | **Details** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Target location**  | The Azure region to which you want to migrate. Azure Database for MySQL configuration and cost recommendations are based on the location that you specify.
   | **Environment type** | The environment for the MySQL deployments to apply Azure Database for MySQL configuration and cost recommendations applicable to Production or Dev/Test.
   | **Licensing program**  | The Azure offer if you're enrolled. Currently, the field is Pay-as-you-go by default, which gives you retail Azure prices.
   | **Currency** | The billing currency for your account.
   | **Savings options**  | Specify the reserved capacity savings option that you want the assessment to consider and optimize your Azure compute cost. <br/><br> [Azure reservations](/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations) (one year or three years reserved) are a good option for the most consistently running resources. <br/><br> When you select **None**, the Azure compute cost is based on the Pay-as-you-go rate or based on actual usage. <br/><br> You need to select pay-as-you-go in the offer/licensing program to be able to use Reserved Instances. When you select any savings option other than 'None', the 'Discount (%)' setting isn’t applicable. The monthly cost estimates are calculated by multiplying 744 hours with the hourly price of the recommended SKU.
   | **Discount (%)** | Any subscription-specific discounts you receive on top of the Azure offer. The default setting is 0%.

   **Assessment criteria**

   | **Setting** | **Details** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Sizing criteria**  | Set to *Performance-based* by default, which means Azure Migrate collects performance metrics pertaining to MySQL instances to recommend an optimal-sized Azure Database for MySQL instance configuration.
   | **Performance history** | Indicate the data duration on which you want to base the assessment. (Default is one day)
   | **Percentile utilization** | Indicate the percentile value you want to use for the performance sample. (Default is 95th percentile)
   | **Comfort factor** | Indicate the buffer you want to use during assessment. This accounts for issues such as seasonal usage, short performance history, and likely increases in future usage.

   **Azure DB for MySQL – Flexible Server sizing**

   | **Setting** | **Details** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Service Tier** | Choose the most appropriate service tier option to accommodate your business needs for migration to Azure Database for MySQL. <br/><br> By default, all three service tiers are selected. As per the assessment report,  we recommend the best suited service tier for your servers based on your Environment Type and the collected performance data. <br/><br> - Select only *General Purpose* if you want an Azure Database for MySQL configuration designed for business workloads that require balanced computing and memory with scalable I/O throughput. <br/><br> - Select only *Business Critical* if you want an Azure Database for MySQL configuration designed for high-performance database workloads that require in-memory performance for faster transaction processing and higher concurrency.

1. Select **OK**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/create-mysql-assessment/save-mysql-assessment-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot on how to save mysql assessment settings.":::

    :::image type="content" source="./media/create-mysql-assessment/mysql-assessment-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot on how to recalculate the assessment.":::
   

> [!NOTE]
> As MySQL assessments are performance-based assessments, we recommend that you wait at least a day after starting discovery before you create an assessment. This provides time to collect performance data with higher confidence. If your discovery is still in progress, the readiness of your MySQL instances is marked as **Unknown**. Ideally, after you start discovery, **wait for the performance duration you specify (day/week/month)** to create or recalculate the assessment for a high-confidence rating.
 
 
### Assessment overview

The assessment overview page provides the following information:

 - **Assessed workloads:** This section indicates the number of MySQL servers, instances, and databases assessed. It also highlights the number of instances running on MySQL versions that are past their End of Life (EOL), and the discovery success percentage, which represents the percentage of MySQL performance data points collected out of the total expected data points.
 
 - **Migration scenarios:** This section summarizes the readiness and cost estimates for migrating all the assessed MySQL database instances to Azure Database for MySQL. Selecting **View Details** takes you to the **Instances to Azure Database for MySQL** tab, where you can select the **Instances to Azure Database for MySQL** recommended strategy to view the detailed assessment report.


### View MySQL version and End of life details

Select **View version and End of life** to see a graphical distribution of the MySQL versions of all the instances and their EOL status.
