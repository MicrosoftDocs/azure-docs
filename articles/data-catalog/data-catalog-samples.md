# Data Catalog developer samples
Get started developing Data Catalog apps using the Data Catalog REST API. The Data Catalog REST API is a REST-based API that provides programmatic access to Data Catalog resources to register, annotate and search data assets programmatically.

Here are the samples we have on GitHub:

- [Get started with Azure Data Catalog](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/samples/data-catalog-dotnet-get-started/)

  A sample that shows you how to authenticate with Azure AD to Register, Search, and Delete a data asset using the Data Catalog REST API.

- [Bulk register and annotate](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/samples/data-catalog-dotnet-excel-register-data-assets/)

  A sample that shows you how to bulk register data assets from an Excel workbook using Data Catalog REST API and Open XML.

- [Import/Export tool](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/samples/data-catalog-dotnet-import-export/)

  A sample that shows how to use the Data Catalog REST API to fetch assets from the Azure Data Catalog and serialize them into a file. It also demonstrates how to take a set of assets serialized as JSON and push them into the catalog. It supports exporting a subset of the catalog using a search query.
