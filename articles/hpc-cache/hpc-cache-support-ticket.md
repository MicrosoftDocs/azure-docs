# Contact support for help with Azure HPC Cache

The best way to get help with Azure HPC Cache is to use the Azure portal to open a support ticket.

Navigate to your cache instance, then click the **New support request** link that appears at the bottom of the sidebar.

To open a ticket when you do not have an active cache, use the main Help + support page from the Azure portal. Open the portal menu from the control at the top left of the screen, then scroll to the bottom and click **Help + support**.

Support requests are also used to make quota requests. Follow the instructions in [Request an HPC Cache quota increase](increase-quota.md).

After you choose either **New support request** from your cache or **Create a support request** from the main Help + support page, a form appears.
