# Data management: Understanding NoSQL technologies on Azure

**Summary:** Azure offers a broad array of options for your NoSQL workloads, but it can be challenging to determine the differences between all of the options available. This document explains NoSQL technologies on Azure and how they differ in managing from relational models of managing your data.

Relational technology has long been the dominant approach for working with data. However, when you work with large amounts of different types of data, as is increasingly the case today, you are faced with new challenges for managing this data. Relational technology is sometimes the best fit and sometimes not the best fit for managing this data. This guide walks through the options, explaining what each one provides and why you might want to use it.
