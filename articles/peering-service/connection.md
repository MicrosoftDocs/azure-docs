# Peering Service connection

A connection typically refers to a logical information set, identifying a Peering Service. It's defined by specifying the following attributes:

- Logical name
- Connectivity partner
- Connectivity partner Primary service location
- Connectivity partner Backup service location
- IP prefixes

Customer can establish a single connection or multiple connections as per the requirement. A connection is also used as a unit of telemetry collection. For instance, to opt for telemetry alerts, you must define the connection that you want to monitor.

> [!NOTE]
> When you sign up for Peering Service, we analyze your Windows and Microsoft 365 telemetry in order to provide you with latency measurements for your selected prefixes.
> For more information about connection telemetry, see [Access Peering Service connection telemetry](connection-telemetry.md).

## How to create a peering service connection?

**Scenario** - Let's say a branch office is spread across different geographic locations as shown in the figure. Here, the customer is required to provide a logical name, Service Provider (SP) name, customer's physical location, and IP prefixes that are (owned by the customer or allocated by the Service Provider) associated with a single connection. The primary and backup service locations with partner help defining the preferred service location for customer. This process must be repeated to create Peering Service for other locations.
