# Azure Peering Service customer walkthrough

This article explains the steps to optimize your prefixes with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or Internet Exchange Provider (IXP) that is a Peering Service partner.

See [Peering Service partners](location-partners.md) for a complete list of Peering Service providers. 

## Activate the prefix

If you already received a Peering Service prefix key from your Peering Service provider, then you can activate your prefixes for optimized routing with Peering Service. Prefix activation, alignment to the right OC partner, and appropriate interconnect location are requirements for optimized routing (to ensure cold potato routing).

To activate the prefix, follow these steps:

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter *peering service*. Select **Peering Services** in the search results.

1. Select **+ Create** to create a new Peering Service connection.

1. In the **Basics** tab, enter or select your subscription, resource group, and Peering Service connection name.

1. In the **Configuration** tab, provide details on the location, provider, and primary and backup interconnect locations. If the backup location is set to **None**, the traffic fails over to the internet.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The prefix key should be the same as the one obtained from your Peering Service provider.
