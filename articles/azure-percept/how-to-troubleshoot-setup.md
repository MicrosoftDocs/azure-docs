|The connection to the Azure Percept DK Wi-Fi access point frequently disconnects.|It's usually because of a poor connection between the device and the host computer. It can also be caused by interference from other Wi-Fi connections on the host computer.|Make sure that the antennas are properly attached to the dev kit. If the dev kit is far away from the host computer, try moving it closer. Turn off any other internet connections such as LTE/5G if they're running on the host computer.|
|The host computer shows a security warning about the connection to the Azure Percept DK access point.|It's a known issue that will be fixed in a later update.|It's safe to continue through the setup experience.|
|The Azure Percept DK Wi-Fi access point (scz-xxxx or apd-xxxx) appears in the network list but fails to connect.|It could be because of a temporary corruption of the dev kit's Wi-Fi access point.|Reboot the dev kit and try again.|
|Unable to connect to a Wi-Fi network during the setup experience.|The Wi-Fi network must currently have internet connectivity to communicate with Azure. EAP[PEAP/MSCHAP], captive portals, and enterprise EAP-TLS connectivity is currently not supported.|Ensure your Wi-Fi network type is supported and has internet connectivity.|
