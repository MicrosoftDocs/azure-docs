# Advanced development with Azure Percept

With Azure Percept, software developers and data scientists can use advanced code workflows for AI lifecycle management. Through a growing open source library, they can use samples to get started with their AI development journey and build production-ready solutions.

## Get started with advanced development

See the [Azure Percept DK advanced development GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-percept-advanced-development) for
up-to-date guidance, tutorials, and examples for things like:

- Deploying a custom AI model to your Azure Percept DK
- Updating a supported model with transfer learning
- And more

## Next steps

Learn more about the available [Azure Percept AI models](./overview-ai-models.md). If none of these models suit your needs, use the advanced code journey to bring your own model or computer vision pipeline to the Percept DK. If you have a contribution that you think would help others, feel free open a pull request too.
