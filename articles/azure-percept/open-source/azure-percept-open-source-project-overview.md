# Azure Percept Open-Source Project overview

Azure Percept Open-Source Project is a framework for creating, deploying, and operating Edge artificial intelligence (AI) solutions at scale with the control and flexibility of open-source natively on your environment. It's fully open-sourced and leverages the open-source software (OSS) community to deliver enhanced experiences. And, as a self-managed solution, you can host the experience on your own Kubernetes clusters.

Azure Percept Open-Source Project has a no- to low-code portal experience as well as APIs that can be used to build custom Edge AI applications. It supports running Edge AI apps by utilizing cameras and Edge devices with different Edge runtimes and accelerators across multiple locations at scale. Since it's designed with machine learning operations (MLOps) in mind, it provides support for active learning, continuous training, and data gathering using your machine learning (ML) models running at the edge.

## Azure Percept Open-Source Project offers

- **An integrated developer experience** 

  You can easily build camera-based Edge AI apps using first- and third-party ML models. In one seamless flow, you can leverage pre-built models from our partner’s Model Zoo and create your own ML models with Azure Custom Vision.

- **Solution deployment and management experience at scale**

  Azure Percept Open-Source Project is Kubernetes native, so you can run the experience wherever Kubernetes runs; on-premises, hybrid, cloud, or multicloud environments. You can manage your experience using Kubernetes native tools such as Kubectl, our unique command line interface (CLI), and/or our no- to low-code native web portal. Edge AI apps and assets you create are projected and managed as Kubernetes objects, which allows you to rely on the Kubernetes control plane to manage the state of your Edge AI assets across many environments at scale.

- **Standard-based**

  Azure Percept Open-Source Project is built on and supports popular industrial standards, protocols, and frameworks like Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC-UA), Open Network Video Interface Forum (ONVIF), OpenTelemetry, CloudEvents, Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr), Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), Akri, Kubectl, Helm, and many others. 

- **Zero-friction adoption**

  Even without any Edge hardware, you can get started with a few commands, then seamlessly transit from prototype/pilot to production at scale. Azure Percept Open-Source Project has an easy-to-use no- to low-code portal experience that allows developers to create and manage Edge AI solutions in minutes instead of days or months. 

- **Azure powered and platform agnostic**

  Azure Percept Open-Source Project natively uses and supports Azure Edge and AI Services like Azure IoT Hub, Azure IoT Edge, Azure Cognitive Services, Azure Storage Server, Azure ML, and so on. At the same time, it also allows you to modify the experience for use cases that require the use of other services (Azure or non-Azure) or other Open-Source Software (OSS) tools.
