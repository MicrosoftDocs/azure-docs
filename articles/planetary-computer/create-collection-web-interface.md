# Quickstart: Create a collection with the Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro web interface

This quickstart explains how to create a collection in Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro via the web interface.

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you need:

- An Azure account with an active subscription. Use the link [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An active GeoCatalog instance. Use the link to [Create a GeoCatalog](./deploy-geocatalog-resource.md).

## Navigating the Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro web interface

The Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro web interface is a web-based platform that allows you to manage your geospatial data. **You can access the web interface by using the URI provided in your GeoCatalog resource in Azure portal:**

[ ![Screenshot of URI in geocatalog resource in Azure portal.](media/geocatalog-uri-example.jpeg) ](media/geocatalog-uri-example.jpeg#lightbox) 

Upon entering the web interface, you land on the Planetary Computer Pro page, showing your recent collections (if any) and a button to create a new one.

[ ![Screenshot of Planetary Computer Pro landing page.](./media/landing-page.jpeg) ](./media/landing-page.jpeg#lightbox)

The **Collections** page provides you with a full list of your collections, including their names, descriptions, date created, and a collection thumbnail. You can also search for collections by name or description keywords, and create a new collection from this page.

The **Settings** page allows you to create and manage ingestion sources, which is a critical first step in data ingestion. You can learn more about ingestion in [Ingestion overview](./ingestion-overview.md).

The **Explorer** page is where you can visualize your data on a map. Here, you can search for collections, filter by STAC metadata, and visualize assets. Learn how to use the Explorer in [Quickstart: Use the Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro Explorer](./use-explorer.md).

## Create a collection

1. Whether you are on the Planetary Computer Pro landing page or the Collections page, you can select the **Create Collection** button. This takes you to the **Create Collection** panel, where you enter the details of your collection in JSON format adhering to the [STAC specification](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/collection-spec/collection-spec.md).

[ ![Screenshot of Create Collection panel.](./media/create-collection-panel.jpeg) ](./media/create-collection-panel.jpeg#lightbox)

2. In the **Create Collection** panel's JSON editor, the options are:
    * Write your own collection JSON
    * Use a template collection JSON 
    OR
    * Upload a collection JSON from your local machine 

> [!NOTE] 
> Whichever method you use to create your STAC collection, your JSON file must include the following fields:
> 
> | Field           | Required             | Description                                                                 |
> |-----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
> | `type`          | **Required**         | The type of the STAC object, which should be set to `Collection`.           |
> | `stac_version`  | **Required**         | The version of the STAC specification that your collection adheres to.      |
> | `stac_extensions`|                      | A list of STAC extensions that your collection uses.                        |
> | `id`            | **Required**         | A unique identifier for your collection.                                    |
> | `title`         |                      | A one-line title for your collection.                                       |
> | `description`   | **Required**         | A description of your collection.                                           |
> | `keywords`      |                      | A list of keywords that describe your collection.                           |
> | `license`       | **Required**         | The license under which your collection is published.                       |
> | `providers`     |                      | A list of providers capturing or processing the data for your collection.   |
> | `extent`        | **Required**         | The spatial and temporal extent of your collection.                         |
> | `summaries`     | **Strongly recommended** | A map of property summaries, either a set or range of values.             |
> | `links`         | **Required**         | A list of links for your collection.                                        |
> | `assets`        |                      | A dictionary of asset objects for your collection, each with unique keys. |
> | `item_assets`   | [**Required for Visualization**](./render-configuration.md#step-1-define-item_assets-in-your-collection-json)                     | A dictionary of assets that can be found in member items.                   |

3. Once the JSON is complete, select the **Create** button to create your collection. This selection takes you to the **Overview** tab of your collection, where you can view and edit your collection's metadata, manage your data ingestions, and [configure your collection for visualization in the Explorer](./collection-configuration-concept.md).

## Next steps
Now that you have a collection, you can now ingest data into it.
