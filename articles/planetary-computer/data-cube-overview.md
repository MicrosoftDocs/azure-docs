# Data cubes in Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro

As mentioned in [Supported Data Types](./supported-data-types.md), Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro supports ingestion, cloud optimization, and visualization of data cube files in NetCDF, HDF5, and GRIB2 formats. Though complex and historically cumbersome on local storage, these assets are optimized for cloud environments with Planetary Computer Pro, further empowering them as efficient tools to structure and store multidimensional data like satellite imagery and climate models.

## Handling data cubes in Planetary Computer Pro

Data cube files can be ingested into Planetary Computer Pro in the same way as other raster data types. As with other date formats, assets and associated Spatio Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC) Items must first be stored in Azure Blob Storage. Unlike other two-dimensional raster assets, however, additional processing will occur upon ingestion of certain data cube formats (NetCDF and HDF5).

> [!NOTE]
> GRIB2 data will be ingested in the same way as other two-dimensional raster data (with no additional enrichment), as they are essentially a collection of 2D rasters with an associated index file that references the data efficiently in cloud environments.

## Enabling data cube enrichment of STAC assets

When a STAC Item containing NetCDF or HDF5 assets is ingested, those assets can be enriched with data cube functionality. When data cube functionality is enabled, a Kerchunk manifest is generated and stored in blob storage alongside the asset, enabling more efficient data access.

### Data cube enrichment and Kerchunk manifests  

For STAC assets in **NetCDF** or **HDF5** formats, Planetary Computer can apply **Data cube enrichment** during ingestion. This process generates a **Kerchunk manifest**, which is stored in blob storage alongside the asset. The Kerchunk manifest enables efficient access to chunked dataset formats.

### Enabling data cube enrichment  

Data cube enrichment is **enabled** for applicable assets in the STAC item JSON. For each asset, enrichment is triggered if both of the following conditions are met:  

* The asset format is one of the following types:
    - `application/netcdf`
    - `application/x-netcdf`
    - `application/x-hdf5`
* The asset has a `roles` field that includes either `data` or `visual` within its list of roles. 

If these conditions are met, a **Kerchunk manifest** (`assetid-kerchunk.json`) is generated in blob storage alongside the asset. 

> [!NOTE]
> The asset format type`application/x-hdf` often corresponds to HDF4 assets. GeoCatalog ingestion doesn't currently support creating virtual kerchunk manifests for HDF4 due to its added complexity and multiple variants.

### Data cube enrichment modifies the STAC item JSON  

For each enriched asset within the **STAC item JSON**, the following fields are added:  

- `msft:datacube_converted: true` – Indicates that enrichment was applied. 
- `cube:dimensions` – A dictionary listing dataset dimensions and their properties. 
- `cube:variables` – A dictionary describing dataset variables and their properties. 


### Disabling data cube enrichment  

To **disable enrichment** for an asset, remove `data` and `visual` from the asset’s `roles` list in the STAC item JSON before ingestion.

### Handling enrichment failures  

If Data cube enrichment fails, the asset can be **re-ingested** with enrichment disabled by updating the STAC item JSON to exclude the `data` or `visual` role before retrying ingestion.

### Why enable data cube enrichment?  

Enabling Data cube enrichment improves **data access performance**, especially for visualization workflows. When a Kerchunk manifest is present, it allows **faster access** compared to loading the entire dataset file. 

### Faster dataset access for data APIs and visualization with Kerchunk  

The Data Explorer and tiling APIs preferentially use the **Kerchunk manifest (`.json`)** for data read operations if one exists in the same blob storage directory as the original asset. Instead of opening the full `.nc` file, we use a **Zarr with reference files** to access only the necessary data. 

Reading data using a chunked, reference-based approach is faster because it avoids reading the entire file into memory.
