# How to provide feedback

The Azure Purview public preview is a great opportunity for you to let us know what is and isn't working well for you. By providing direct feedback to Microsoft, you help us understand what Azure Purview functionality you value and what we need to change.

You can provide feedback in any of these ways:

* Send email to BabylonDiscussion@Microsoft.com. Your message goes directly to the entire Azure Purview team.

* Use the feedback feature in the Azure Purview user interface.

* Participate in Microsoft-sponsored research studies, scheduled webinars, and other feedback opportunities.

## Use the smiley face icon in the feedback feature

The two smiley face options suggest the type of feedback you might want to provide:

* Ask questions about how a feature or certain functionality works or is planned to work. Be sure to prefix your feedback with *QUESTION:* .
* Provide specific feedback on what works well for you.

* Provide specific feedback on something that isn’t working well.
* Provide additional details about any changes you might suggest. Be sure to prefix your feedback with *SUGGESTION:* .
* If you’re reporting a bug, it’s helpful to include your email address. You can also email us at BabylonDiscussion@Microsoft.com. You can attach any screenshots, provide steps for reproducing the issue, and detail any conditions that might apply. Be sure to prefix your feedback with *BUG:* .
