# Create a business process to add business context about Azure resources using Azure Business Process Tracking (Preview)

> [!NOTE]
>
> This capability is in preview and is subject to the 
> [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

To add business context around the Azure resources in an integration solution, you can visualize business processes flows for the tasks implemented by these resources. In Azure Business Process Tracking, a business process is a series of stages that represent the tasks that flow through a real-world business scenario. This business process also specifies a single business identifier or *transaction ID*, such as a ticket number, order number, case number, and so on, to identify a transaction that exists across all the stages in the business process and to correlate those stages together.

When you add a stage to your business process, you can also define other business property values to capture as data moves through each stage. You can then later map the transaction ID and other properties to specific operations and data outputs in Standard logic app workflows. For more information, see [What is Azure Business Process Tracking](overview.md)?

For example, suppose you're a developer or business analyst at a power company. Your company's customer service team has the following business process to resolve a customer ticket for a power outage:

After you create a **Business Process** resource in Azure, you can use the process editor to create a flow chart that visually describes this business process, for example:

:::image type="content" source="media/create-business-process/business-process-stages-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows process editor for Azure Business Process Tracking." lightbox="media/create-business-process/business-process-stages-complete.png":::

> [!NOTE]
>
> Although this example shows a sequential business process, your process can have parallel branches to represent decision paths.

After you define a business process, you can then map each stage to actual Azure resources.

> [!NOTE]
>
> In this release, you can only map business process stages to Standard logic app resources and their workflows in Azure Logic Apps.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > If you're using an [Azure integration environment and application groups](../integration-environments/overview.md) 
  > to organize your Azure resources, and you want to map your business process to Azure resources in your 
  > integration environment, all your Azure resources must use the same subscription, including your business 
  > processes and integration environment. If you're not using an Azure integration environment, you can map 
  > your business process to Azure resources where you have access.

- An existing or new [Azure Data Explorer cluster and database](/azure/data-explorer/create-cluster-and-database)

  This Azure resource is required to create, deploy, and store specified data in a business process. Your business process uses this database to store the transactions and business property values that you want to capture as real-time data moves through your workflows at run time. When you create a business process, you specify the cluster, database, and table to use for storing the data that you want.

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > Although Azure Business Process Tracking doesn't incur charges during preview, Azure Data 
  > Explorer incurs charges, based on the selected pricing option. For more information, see 
  > [Azure Data Explorer pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/data-explorer/#pricing).

## Create a business process

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) search box, enter and select **Business Process Tracking**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-business-process/select-business-process-tracking.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Azure portal search box with business process tracking entered." lightbox="media/create-business-process/select-business-process-tracking.png":::

1. On the **Business Process Tracking** toolbar, select **Create**.

1. On the **Create business process** page, on the **Basics** tab, provide the following information:

   | Property | Required | Value | Description |
   |----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Subscription** | Yes | <*Azure-subscription*> | The Azure subscription to use for your business process. |
   | **Resource group** | Yes | <*Azure-resource-group-name*> | A new or existing Azure resource group. <br><br>This example uses **City-Power-and-Light-RG**. |
   | **Business process name** | Yes | <*process-name*> | A name for your business process. Use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, parentheses, or periods. <br><br>This example uses **Resolve-Power-Outage**. |
   | **Description** | No | <*process-description*> | The purpose for your business process. |
   | **Region** | Yes | <*Azure-region*> | The Azure region for your business process. |

   The following example shows the information for the sample business process:

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-business-process/business-process-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows page for Create business process with Basics tab selected." lightbox="media/create-business-process/business-process-details.png":::

1. When you're done, select **Next: Transaction ID**. On the **Transaction ID** tab, provide the following information:

   | Property | Required | Value | Description |
   |----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Transaction ID** | Yes | <*transaction-ID*> | This important and unique ID identifies a transaction, such as an order number, ticket number, case number, or another similar business identifier that's available across all stages in your business process. <br><br>This example uses the transaction ID named **TicketNumber** to correlate events across the different systems in the example business process, which include CRM, Work Order Management, and Marketing. <br><br>**Note**: Azure Business Process Tracking automatically includes and records the transaction timestamp so that you don't have to separately add this value. Although you can define only a single transaction ID when you create a business process, you can later define other business properties in each stage that you want to record. |
   | **Data type** | Yes | <*transaction-ID-data-type*> | The data type for your transaction ID: **String** or **Integer**. <br><br>This example uses the **Integer** data type. |

   The following example shows the sample transaction ID:

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-business-process/define-transaction-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows page for Create business process page with Transaction ID tab selected." lightbox="media/create-business-process/define-transaction-id.png":::

1. When you're done, select **Next: Data storage**. On the **Data storage** tab, provide the following information:

   | Property | Required | Value | Description |
   |----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Subscription** | Yes | <*Azure-subscription*> | The Azure subscription for your Data Explorer instance. |
   | **Cluster** | Yes | <*cluster-name*> | The name for the cluster in your Data Explorer instance. |
   | **Database** | Yes | <*database-name*> | The name for the database in your Data Explorer instance. |
   | **Table** | Yes | <*table-name*> | The name for the table to create or use. To update an existing table, select the option to **Use an existing table**. <br><br>**Note**: Although you can use the same name as an existing table, which updates that table, for security purposes, create a unique and separate table for each business process. This practice helps you avoid mixing sensitive data with non-sensitive data and is useful for redeployment scenarios. |
   | **Use an existing table** | No | Enabled or disabled | To update an existing table, select this option. |

1. When you're done, select **Create**.

   After the Azure portal completes deployment for your new **Business Process** resource, the portal automatically opens the resource's **Overview** page.

1. Now, continue on to add the stages for your business process.

## Add a business process stage

After you create your business process, add the stages for that process. For example, suppose you're an integration developer at a power company. You manage a solution for a customer work order processor service that's implemented by multiple Standard logic app resources and their workflows. Your customer service team follows the following business process to resolve a customer ticket for a power outage:

:::image type="content" source="media/create-business-process/business-process-stages-example.png" alt-text="Conceptual diagram shows example power outage business process stages for customer service at a power company." lightbox="media/create-business-process/business-process-stages-example.png":::

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your business process resource, if not already open.

1. On the resource menu, under **Business process tracking**, select **Editor**.

1. In the editor, select **Add stage**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-business-process/add-stage.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows business process editor with Add stage selected." lightbox="media/create-business-process/add-stage.png":::

1. On the **Add stage** pane, provide the following information:

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > To quickly draft the stages in your business process, just provide the stage 
   > name, select **Add**, and then return later to provide the remaining values 
   > when you [map the business process to a Standard logic app workflow](map-business-process-workflow.md).

   | Property | Required | Value | Description |
   |----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Stage name** | Yes | <*stage-name*> | The name for this process stage. Use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, parentheses, or periods. |
   | **Description** | No | <*stage-description*> | The purpose for this stage. |

   This example creates a stage named **Create_ticket**:

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-business-process/add-stage-quick.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows pane named Add stage with stage name, description, and properties to track." lightbox="media/create-business-process/add-stage.png":::

   In the **Properties to track** table, on the **Success** tab, your previously defined transaction ID is automatically included. This value is required for correlation across stages and workflows. 

   On the **Success** and **Failure** tabs, you can optionally define and map other business property values that you want to record. You can use these property values to correspondingly identify a successful or failed stage, which is left entirely to your interpretation, business scenarios, or needs.

   - **Success** tab: Define and map other business property values to identify and record from a successful stage.

   - **Failure** tab: Define and map other business property values to identify and record from a failed stage.

   To define other business property values to use for this stage, follow these steps:

   1. Under **Properties to track**, select **Success** or **Failure** as appropriate.

   1. Under the **Properties to track** table, select **Add property**.

   1. Enter the property name and type, which is either a **String** or **Integer**.

   For example, this stage specifies a few more properties, such as **CustomerName**, **CustomerEmail**, and **CustomerPhone**, to record from a successfully completed stage:

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-business-process/add-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows pane named Add stage with stage name, description, and more properties to track." lightbox="media/create-business-process/add-properties.png":::

1. When you're done, select **Add stage**.

   Now, you can continue adding more stages or [map each business property in your stage to the respective operation and outputs in a Standard logic app workflow](map-business-process-workflow.md).

1. To add another stage, choose one of the following options on the process editor:

   - Under the last stage, select the plus sign (**+**) for **Add a stage**.
 
   - Between stages, select the plus sign (**+**), and then select either **Add a stage** or **Add a parallel stage**, which creates a branch in your business process.

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > To delete a stage, open the stage's shortcut menu, and select **Delete**.

1. Repeat the preceding steps to add another stage as needed.

   The following example shows a completed business process:

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-business-process/business-process-stages-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows process editor with completed business process stages." lightbox="media/create-business-process/business-process-stages-complete.png":::

1. When you're done, on the process editor toolbar, select **Save**.

1. Now, continue on to [map each business property to the respective operation and outputs in a Standard logic app workflow](map-business-process-workflow.md) so that you can get insights about your deployed resource.
