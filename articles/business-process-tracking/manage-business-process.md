# Manage a business process in an application group

After you create or deploy a business process that shows the flow through a real-world business scenario and tracks real-world data that moves through that flow, you can manage various aspects of that business process.

This guide shows how to perform the following tasks:

- [Edit a business process or stage](#edit-process-or-stage).
- [Discard any unsaved changes that you made to a deployed business process](#discard-pending-changes).
- [Undeploy a business process, which removes the deployment artifacts but preserves the business process](#undeploy-process).

## Prerequisites

- The deployed or undeployed **Business process** resource that you want to manage.

- Access to the Azure account and subscription associated with the **Business process** resource.

## Business process states

A business process exists in one of the following states:

| State | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Draft | An unsaved or saved business process before deployment. |
| Deployed | A business process that records specified data during workflow run time. |
| Deployed with pending changes | A business process that has both a deployed version and version with pending changes. |

## Undeploy a business process

1. On the resource menu, select **Overview**.

1. On the **Overview** page toolbar, select **Undeploy**.
