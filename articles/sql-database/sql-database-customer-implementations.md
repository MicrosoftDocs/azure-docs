# Azure SQL Database customer implementation technical studies

- [Daxko](sql-database-implementation-daxko.md): Daxko/CSI Software faced a challenge: its customer base of fitness and recreation centers was growing rapidly, thanks to the success of its comprehensive enterprise-software solution, but keeping up with the IT-infrastructure needs for that growing customer base was testing the company’s IT staff. The company was increasingly constrained by rising operations overhead, particularly for managing its growing databases. Worse, that operations overhead was cutting into development resources for new initiatives, like new mobility features for the company’s software.

- [GEP](sql-database-implementation-gep.md): GEP delivers software and services that enable procurement leaders around the world to maximize their impact on their businesses’ operations, strategies, and financial performances. In addition to consulting and managed services, the company offers SMART by GEP®, a cloud-based, comprehensive procurement-software platform. However, GEP ran into limitations trying to support solutions like SMART by GEP with its own on-premises datacenters: the investments needed were steep and regulatory requirements in other countries would have made the necessary investments more daunting still. By moving to the cloud, GEP has freed up IT resources, allowing it to worry less about IT operations and to focus more on developing new sources of value for its customers across the globe.

- [SnelStart](sql-database-implementation-snelstart.md): SnelStart makes popular financial- and business-management software for small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in the Netherlands. Its 55,000 customers are serviced by a staff of 110 employees, including an IT staff of 35. By moving from desktop software to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering built on Azure, SnelStart made the most of built-in services, automating management using familiar environment in C#, and optimizing performance and scalability by neither over- or under-provisioning businesses using elastic pools. Using Azure provides SnelStart the fluidity of moving customers between on-premises and the cloud.

- [Umbraco](sql-database-implementation-umbraco.md): To simplify customer deployments, Umbraco added Umbraco-as-a-Service (UaaS): a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering that eliminates the need for on-premises deployments, provides built-in scaling, and removes management overhead by enabling developers to focus on product innovation rather than solution management. Umbraco is able to provide all those benefits by relying on the flexible platform-as-a-service (PaaS) model offered by Microsoft Azure.

- [Quorum](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/quorum-doubles-key-databases-workload-while-lowering-dtu-with-sql-database): Quorum doubles key database’s workload while lowering DTU by 70% with SQL Database.

- [Quest](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-US/story/quest): Quest offers its Spotlight on SQL Server Enterprise service with one goal in mind: to give database professionals the best tools available for securing data, moving that data around, and monitoring database operations. With Spotlight, using Microsoft Azure and Azure SQL Database, SQL Server database administrators can monitor, detect, diagnose, and provide a way to resolve performance issues in SQL Server, whether they're sitting at their desks or are working from home.
