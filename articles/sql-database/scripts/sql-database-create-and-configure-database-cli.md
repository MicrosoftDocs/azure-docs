# Use CLI to create a single Azure SQL database and configure a firewall rule

This Azure CLI script example creates an Azure SQL database and configure a server-level firewall rule. Once the script has been successfully run, the SQL Database can be accessed from all Azure services and the configured IP address. 

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/sql-database/create-and-configure-database/create-and-configure-database.sh?highlight=9-10 "Create SQL Database")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az sql server create](/cli/azure/sql/server#create) | Creates a logical server that hosts the SQL Database. |
| [az sql server firewall create](/cli/azure/sql/server/firewall-rule#create) | Creates a firewall rule to allow access to all SQL Databases on the server from the entered IP address range. |
| [az sql db create](/cli/azure/sql/db#create) | Creates the SQL Database in the logical server. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/resource#delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
