# Scale an elastic pool in Azure SQL Database using the Azure CLI

This sample CLI script creates elastic pools, moves pooled databases, and changes performance levels. 

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/sql-database/scale-pool/scale-pool.sh "Move database between pools")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, logical server, SQL Database, and firewall rules. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az sql server create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/server#create) | Creates a logical server that hosts the SQL Database. |
| [az sql elastic-pools create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/elastic-pools#create) | Creates an elastic database pool within the logical server. |
| [az sql db create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/db#create) | Creates the SQL Database in the logical server. |
| [az sql elastic-pools update](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/elastic-pools#update) | Updates an elastic database pool, in this example changes the assigned eDTU. |
| [az group delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/extension#set) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
