# Use CLI to move an Azure SQL database in a SQL elastic pool

This Azure CLI script example creates two elastic pools and moves an Azure SQL database from one SQL elastic pool into another SQL elastic pool, and then moves the database out of elastic pool to a single Azure database performance level. 

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/sql-database/move-database-between-pools/move-database-between-pools.sh "Move database between pools")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az sql server create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/server#create) | Creates a logical server that hosts a database or elastic pool. |
| [az sql elastic-pools create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/elastic-pools#create) | Creates an elastic pool within the logical server. |
| [az sql db create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/db#create) | Creates a database in a logical server as a single or a pooled database. |
| [az sql db update](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/db#update) | Updates database properties or moves a database into, out of, or between elastic pools. |
| [az group delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/extension#set) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
