   > [WACOM.NOTE] This tutorial demonstrates a simplified way of sending push notifications by attaching a push notification device token to the inserted record. Be sure to follow along with the next tutorial to get a better idea of how to incorporate push notifications into your real-world apps.

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable push notifications:

1. [Generate the certificate signing request] 
2. [Register your app and enable push notifications]
3. [Create a provisioning profile for the app]
3. [Configure Mobile Services]
4. [Add push notifications to the app]
5. [Update scripts to send push notifications]
6. [Insert data to receive notifications]

This tutorial requires the following:

+ [Mobile Services iOS SDK]
+ [XCode 4.5][Install Xcode] 
+ An iOS 5.0 (or later version) capable device
+ iOS Developer Program membership

   > [WACOM.NOTE] Because of push notification configuration requirements, you must deploy and test push notifications on an iOS capable device (iPhone or iPad) instead of in the emulator.

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete [Get started with Mobile Services]. 

The Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) uses certificates to authenticate your mobile service. Follow these instructions to create the necessary certificates and upload it to your Mobile Service. For the official APNS feature documentation, see [Apple Push Notification Service].

## Generate the Certificate Signing Request file

First you must generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file, which is used by Apple to generate a signed certificate.

1. From the Utilities folder, run the Keychain Access tool.

2. Click **Keychain Access**, expand **Certificate Assistant**, then click **Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority...**.

  	![][5]

3. Select your **User Email Address**, type **Common Name** and **CA Email Address** values, make sure that **Saved to disk** is selected, and then click **Continue**.

  	![][6]

4. Type a name for the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file in **Save As**, select the location in **Where**, then click **Save**.

  	![][7]
  
  	This saves the CSR file in the selected location; the default location is in the Desktop. Remember the location chosen for this file.

Next, you will register your app with Apple, enable push notifications, and upload this exported CSR to create a push certificate.

## Register your app for push notifications

To be able to send push notifications to an iOS app from mobile services, you must register your application with Apple and also register for push notifications.  

1. If you have not already registered your app, navigate to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=272456" target="_blank">iOS Provisioning Portal</a> at the Apple Developer Center, log on with your Apple ID, click **Identifiers**, then click **App IDs**, and finally click on the **+** sign to .

   	![][102] 

2. Type a name for your app in **Description**, enter the value _MobileServices.Quickstart_ in **Bundle Identifier**, check the "Push Notifications" option in the "App Services" section, and then click **Continue**. This example uses the ID **MobileServices.Quickstart** but you may not reuse this same ID, as app IDs must be unique across all users. As such, it is recommended that you append your full name or initials after the app name. 

   	![][103]
   
   	This generates your app ID and requests you to **Submit** the information. Click **Submit**
   
   	![][104] 
   
   	Once you click **Submit**, you will see the **Registration complete** screen, as shown below. Click **Done**.
   
   	![][105]

    > [WACOM.NOTE] If you choose to supply a <strong>Bundle Identifier</strong> value other than <i>MobileServices.Quickstart</i>, you must also update the bundle identifier value in your Xcode project.

3. Locate the app ID that you just created, and click on its row. 

   	![][106]
   
   	Clicking on the app ID will display details on the app and app ID. Click the **Settings** button.
   
   	![][107] 
   
4. Scroll to the bottom of the screen, and click the **Create Certificate...** button under the section **Development Push SSL Certificate**.

   	![][108] 

   	This displays the "Add iOS Certificate" assistant.
   
   	![][108] 


    > [WACOM.NOTE] This tutorial uses a development certificate. The same process is used when registering a production certificate. Just make sure that you set the same certificate type when you upload the certificate to Mobile Services.

5. Click **Choose File**, browse to the location where you saved the CSR file that you created in the first task, then click **Generate**. 

  	![][110]
  
6. After the certificate is created by the portal, click the **Download** button, and click **Done**.
 
  	![][111]  

   	This downloads the signing certificate and saves it to your computer in your Downloads folder. 

  	![][9] 

    > [WACOM.NOTE] By default, the downloaded file a development certificate is named **aps_development.cer**.

7. Double-click the downloaded push certificate **aps_development.cer**.

   	This installs the new certificate in the Keychain, as shown below:

   	![][10]

    > [WACOM.NOTE] The name in your certificate might be different, but it will be prefixed with **Apple Development iOS Push Notification Services:**.

Later, you will use this certificate to generate a .p12 file and upload it to Mobile Services to enable authentication with APNS.

## Create a provisioning profile for the app
 
1. Back in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=272456" target="_blank">iOS Provisioning Portal</a>, select **Provisioning Profiles**, select **All**, and then click the **+** button to create a new profile. This launches the **Add iOS Provisiong Profile** Wizard

   	![][112]

2. Select **iOS App Development** under **Development** as the provisiong profile type, and click **Continue**

   	![][113]

3. Next, select the app ID for the Mobile Services Quickstart app from the **App ID** drop-down list, and click **Continue**

   	![][114]

4. In the **Select certificates** screen, select the certificate created earlier, and click **Continue**
  
   	![][115]

5. Next, select the **Devices** to use for testing, and click **Continue**

   	![][116]

6. Finally, pick a name for the profile in **Profile Name**, click **Generate**, and click **Done**

   	![][117]
	
  	This creates a new provisioning profile.

7. In Xcode, open the Organizer select the Devices view, select **Provisioning Profiles** in the **Library** section in the left pane, and then click the **Refresh** button at the bottom of the middle pane. 

   	![][101]

8. Under **Targets**, click **Quickstart**, expand **Code Signing Identity**, then under **Debug** select the new profile.

   	![][17]

This ensures that the Xcode project uses the new profile for code signing. Next, you must upload the certificate to Mobile Services.

## Configure Mobile Services to send push requests

After you have registered your app with APNS and configured your project, you must next configure your mobile service to integrate with APNS.

1. In Keychain Access, right-click the new certificate, click **Export**, name your file QuickstartPusher, select the **.p12** format, then click **Save**.

   	![][28]

  Make a note of the file name and location of the exported certificate.

	> [WACOM.NOTE] This tutorial creates a QuickstartPusher.p12 file. Your file name and location might be different.

2. Log on to the [Windows Azure Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your app.

   	![][18]

3. Click the **Push** tab and click **Upload**.

   	![][19]

	This displays the Upload Certificate dialog.

4. Click **File**, select the exported certificate QuickstartPusher.p12 file, enter the **Password**, make sure that the correct **Mode** is selected, click the check icon, then click **Save**.

   	![][20] 

    > [WACOM.NOTE] This tutorial uses developement certificates.

Both your mobile service is now configured to work with APNS.

## Add push notifications to your app

1. In Xcode, open the QSAppDelegate.h file and add the following property below the ***window** property:

        @property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *deviceToken;

    > [WACOM.NOTE] When dynamic schema is enabled on your mobile service, a new 'deviceToken' column is automatically added to the **TodoItem** table when a new item that contains this property is inserted.

2. In QSAppDelegate.m, replace the following handler method inside the implementation: 

        - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:
        (NSDictionary *)launchOptions
        {
            // Register for remote notifications
            [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:
            UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert | UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound];
            return YES;
        }

3. In QSAppDelegate.m, add the following handler method inside the implementation: 

        // We are registered, so now store the device token (as a string) on the AppDelegate instance
        // taking care to remove the angle brackets first.
        - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:
        (NSData *)deviceToken {
            NSCharacterSet *angleBrackets = [NSCharacterSet characterSetWithCharactersInString:@"<>"];
            self.deviceToken = [[deviceToken description] stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet:angleBrackets];
        }

4. In QSAppDelegate.m, add the following handler method inside the implementation: 

        // Handle any failure to register. In this case we set the deviceToken to an empty
        // string to prevent the insert from failing.
        - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:
        (NSError *)error {
            NSLog(@"Failed to register for remote notifications: %@", error);
            self.deviceToken = @"";
        }

5. In QSAppDelegate.m, add the following handler method inside the implementation:  

        // Because toast alerts don't work when the app is running, the app handles them.
        // This uses the userInfo in the payload to display a UIAlertView.
        - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:
        (NSDictionary *)userInfo {
            NSLog(@"%@", userInfo);
            UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Notification" message:
            [userInfo objectForKey:@"inAppMessage"] delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:
            @"OK" otherButtonTitles:nil, nil];
            [alert show];
        }

5. In QSTodoListViewController.m, import the QSAppDelegate.h file so that you can use the delegate to obtain the device token: 

        #import "QSAppDelegate.h"

6. In QSTodoListViewController.m, modify the **(IBAction)onAdd** action by locating the following line: 

        NSDictionary *item = @{ @"text" : itemText.text, @"complete" : @(NO) }; 
 
   Replace this with the following code:

		// Get a reference to the AppDelegate to easily retrieve the deviceToken
		QSAppDelegate *delegate = [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
		
		NSDictionary *item = @{
		    @"text" : itemText.text,
		    @"complete" : @(NO),
		    // add the device token property to our todo item payload
		    @"deviceToken" : delegate.deviceToken
		};
		
   	This adds a reference to the **QSAppDelegate** to obtain the device token and then modifies the request payload to include that device token.


   >[WACOM.NOTE]You must add this code before to the call to the <strong>addItem</strong> method.

Your app is now updated to support push notifications.

## Update the registered insert script in the Management Portal

1. In the Management Portal, click the **Data** tab and then click the **TodoItem** table. 

   	![][21]

2. In **todoitem**, click the **Script** tab and select **Insert**.
   
  	![][22]

   	This displays the function that is invoked when an insert occurs in the **TodoItem** table.

3. Replace the insert function with the following code, and then click **Save**:

        function insert(item, user, request) {
            request.execute();
            // Set timeout to delay the notification, to provide time for the 
            // app to be closed on the device to demonstrate toast notifications
            setTimeout(function() {
                push.apns.send(item.deviceToken, {
                    alert: "Toast: " + item.text,
                    payload: {
                        inAppMessage: "Hey, a new item arrived: '" + item.text + "'"
                    }
                });
            }, 2500);
        }

   	This registers a new insert script, which uses the [apns object] to send a push notification (the inserted text) to the device provided in the insert request. 


   	> [WACOM.NOTE] This script delays sending the notification to give you time to close the app to receive a toast notification.

## Test push notifications in your app

1. Press the **Run** button to build the project and start the app in an iOS capable device, then click **OK** to accept push notifications

  	![][23]

    > [WACOM.NOTE] You must explicitly accept push notifications from your app. This request only occurs the first time that the app runs.

2. In the app, type meaningful text, such as _A new Mobile Services task_ and then click the plus (**+**) icon.

  	![][24]

3. Verify that a notification is received, then click **OK** to dismiss the notification.

  	![][25]

4. Repeat step 2 and immediately close the app, then verify that the following toast is shown.

  	![][26]

You have successfully completed this tutorial.

## Next steps

In this simple example a user receives a push notification with the data that was just inserted. The device token used by APNS is supplied to the mobile service by the client in the request. In the next tutorial, [Push notifications to app users], you will create a separate Devices table in which to store device tokens and send a push notification out to all stored channels when an insert occurs.
