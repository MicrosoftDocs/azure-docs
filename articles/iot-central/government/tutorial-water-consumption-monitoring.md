# Tutorial:  Deploy and walk through the water consumption monitoring application

Traditional water consumption tracking relies on water operators manually reading water consumption meters at the meter sites. More cities are replacing traditional meters with advanced smart meters enabling remote monitoring of consumption and remote control of valves that control water flow. Water consumption monitoring coupled with digital feedback messages to citizens can increase awareness and reduce water consumption.

The _water consumption monitoring_ application template helps you kickstart your IoT solution development to enable water utilities to remotely monitor and control water flow.

### Devices and connectivity (1,2)

Water management solutions use smart water devices such as flow meters, water quality monitors, smart valves, leak detectors.

Devices in smart water solutions may connect through low-power wide area networks or through a third-party network operator. For these types of devices, use the [Azure IoT Central Device Bridge](../core/howto-build-iotc-device-bridge.md) to send your device data to your IoT application in Azure IoT Central. You can also use an IP capable device gateway that connects directly to your IoT Central application.

### IoT Central

When you build an IoT solution, Azure IoT Central simplifies the build process and helps to reduce the burden and costs of IoT management, operations, and development. You can brand, customize, and integrate your solution with third-party services.

When you connect your smart water devices to IoT Central, the application provides:

- Device command and control.
- Monitoring and alerting.
- A user interface with built-in role-based access controls.
- Configurable dashboards.
- Extensibility options.

### Extensibility and integrations (3)

You can extend your IoT application in IoT Central and optionally:

- Transform and integrate your IoT data for advanced analytics through data export from your IoT Central application.
- Automate workflows in other systems by triggering actions using Power Automate or webhooks from IoT Central application.
- Programmatically access your IoT Central application by using the IoT Central REST APIs.

### Business applications (4)

You can use IoT data to power various business applications within a water utility. In your IoT Central water consumption monitoring application you can configure rules and actions, and set them to create alerts in [Connected Field Service](/dynamics365/field-service/connected-field-service). Configure Power Automate in IoT Central rules to automate workflows across applications and services. Additionally, based on service activities in Connected Field Service, information can be sent back to Azure IoT Central.

## Walk through the application

The following sections walk you through the key features of the application:

### Dashboard

After you create the application, the sample **Wide World water consumption dashboard** opens.
  
:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-waterconsumptionmonitoring/water-consumption-monitoring-dashboard-full.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the water consumption monitoring application dashboard." lightbox="media/tutorial-waterconsumptionmonitoring/water-consumption-monitoring-dashboard-full.png":::

You can create and customize views on the dashboard for operators.

> [!NOTE]
> All data displayed on the dashboard is based on simulated device data, which you explore in the next section.
  
The dashboard consists of different kinds of tiles:

- **Wide World Water Utility image tile**: The first tile in the dashboard is an image tile of the fictitious water utility Wide World Water. You can customize the tile by inserting your own image or removing it.
- **Average water flow KPI tile**: The KPI tile is configured to display as an example *the average in the last 30 minutes*. You can customize the KPI tile and set it to a different type and time range.
- **Device command tiles**: These tiles include the **Close valve**, **Open valve**, and **Set valve position** tiles. Selecting the commands takes you to the simulated device command page. In Azure IoT Central, a *command* is a *device capability* type. You explore this concept later in the [Device template](../government/tutorial-water-consumption-monitoring.md#explore-the-device-template) section of this tutorial.

- **Water distribution area map**: The map uses Azure Maps, which you can configure directly in Azure IoT Central. The map tile displays the device location. Hover over the map and try the controls over the map, like *zoom in*, *zoom out*, or *expand*.

- **Average water flow line chart** and **Environmental condition line chart**: You can visualize one or multiple device telemetries plotted as a line chart over a desired time range.
- **Average valve pressure heatmap chart**: You can choose the heatmap visualization type of device telemetry data you want to see distributed over a time range with a color index.
- **Reset alert thresholds content tile**: You can include call-to-action content tiles and embed a link to an action page. In this case, the reset alert threshold takes you to the application **Jobs**, where you can run updates to device properties. You explore this option later in the [Configure jobs](../government/tutorial-water-consumption-monitoring.md#configure-jobs) section of this tutorial.
- **Property tiles**: The dashboard displays **Valve operational info**, **Flow alert thresholds**, and **Maintenance info** tiles.

### Customize the dashboard

To customize views in the dashboard for operators, select **Edit** on the **Wide World water consumption dashboard**. You can customize the dashboard by selecting the **Edit** menu. After the dashboard is in **edit** mode, you can add new tiles or you can configure it.

To learn more, see [Create and customize dashboards](../core/howto-manage-dashboards.md).

## Explore the device template

In Azure IoT Central, a device template defines the capabilities of a device. Device capabilities include telemetry sent by device sensors, device properties, and commands the device can execute. You can define one or more device templates in Azure IoT Central that represent the capability of the devices that you connect.

The water consumption monitoring application comes with two sample device templates that represent a *flow meter* and a *smart valve* device.

To view the device template:

1. Select **Device templates** on the left pane of your application in Azure IoT Central. In the **Device templates** list, you see two device templates, **Smart Valve** and **Flow meter**.

1. Select the **Flow meter** device template, and familiarize yourself with the device capabilities.

### Add a cloud property

1. Navigate to the **Flow Meter** device template, and select **+ Add capability**.
1. Add a new cloud property by selecting **Cloud Property** as **Capability type**.In Azure IoT Central, you can add a property that is relevant to a device but that doesn't come from the device. For` example, a cloud property could be an alerting threshold specific to an installation area, asset information, or other maintenance information.
1. Select **Save** to save any changes.

To learn more, see [Cloud properties](../core/concepts-device-templates.md#cloud-properties).

### Views

The water consumption monitor device template comes with predefined views. The views define how operators see the device data and set the values of cloud properties.

To learn more, see [Views](../core/concepts-device-templates.md#views).

### Publish the device template

Navigate to device templates page and select **Publish** to save any changes made to the device template.

To learn more, see [How to publish templates](../core/howto-set-up-template.md#publish-a-device-template).

### Create a new device template

Select **+ New** to create a new device template and follow the creation process. You can create a custom device template from scratch or you can choose a device template from the list of featured device templates.

### Add new devices

Add new devices by selecting **+ New** on the **Devices** tab.

To learn more, see [Manage devices](../core/howto-manage-devices-individually.md).

## Explore rules

In Azure IoT Central, you can create rules to automatically monitor device telemetry and trigger actions when one or more conditions are met. The actions might include sending email notifications or triggering a Microsoft Power Automate action or a webhook action to send data to other services.

The water consumption monitoring application you created has three preconfigured rules.

### View rules

1. Select **Rules** on the left pane.

1. Select **High water flow alert**, which is one of the preconfigured rules in the application.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-waterconsumptionmonitoring/water-consumption-monitoring-high-flow-alert.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the water consumption monitoring application rule." lightbox="media/tutorial-waterconsumptionmonitoring/water-consumption-monitoring-high-flow-alert.png":::

    The `High water flow alert` rule is configured to check against the condition `Flow` is `greater than` the `Max flow threshold`. Flow threshold is a cloud property defined in the **Smart Valve** device template. The value of `Max flow threshold` is set per device instance.

Next, you can create an email action.

To add an action to the rule:

1. Select **+ Email**.
1. Enter **High flow alert** as the friendly **Display name** for the action.
1. Enter the email address associated with your Azure IoT Central account in **To**.
1. Optionally, enter a note to include in the text of the email.
1. Select **Done** to complete the action.
1. Select **Save** to save the new rule.
1. Enable the rule.

Within a few minutes, you'll receive an email after the configured condition is met.

> [!NOTE]
> The application sends an email each time a condition is met. Select **Disable** to disable the rule to stop receiving email from the automated rule.
  
To create a new rule:

To create a new rule, select **+ New** on the **Rules** tab on the left pane.

## Configure jobs
