### Devices and connectivity (1,2)

Devices such as waste bins that are used in open environments may connect through low-power wide area networks or through a third-party network operator. For these types of devices, use the [Azure IoT Central Device Bridge](../core/howto-build-iotc-device-bridge.md) to send your device data to your IoT Central application. You can also use an IP capable device gateway that connects directly to your IoT Central application.

### IoT Central

Azure IoT Central is an IoT App platform that helps you quickly build and deploy an IoT solution. You can brand, customize, and integrate your solution with third-party services.

When you connect your smart waste devices to IoT Central, the application provides:

- Device command and control.
- Monitoring and alerting.
- A user interface with built-in role-based access controls.
- Configurable dashboards.
- Extensibility options.

### Extensibility and integrations (3)

You can extend your IoT application in IoT Central and optionally:

- Transform and integrate your IoT data for advanced analytics through data export from your IoT Central application.
- Automate workflows in other systems by triggering actions using Power Automate or webhooks from IoT Central application.
- Programmatically access your IoT Central application by using the IoT Central REST APIs.

### Business applications (4)

You can use IoT data to power various business applications within a waste utility. For example, in a connected waste management solution you can optimize the dispatch of trash collections trucks. The optimization can be done based on IoT sensors data from connected waste bins. In your IoT Central connected waste management application, you can configure rules and actions and set them to create alerts in [Connected Field Service](/dynamics365/field-service/connected-field-service). Configure Power Automate in IoT Central rules to automate workflows across applications and services. Additionally, based on service activities in Connected Field Service, information can be sent back to Azure IoT Central.

You can easily configure the following integration processes with IoT Central and Connected Field Service:

- Azure IoT Central can send information about device anomalies to Connected Field Service for diagnosis.
- Connected Field Service can create cases or work orders triggered from device anomalies.
- Connected Field Service can schedule technicians for inspection to prevent the downtime incidents.
- Azure IoT Central device dashboard can be updated with relevant service and scheduling information.

## Walk through the application

The following sections walk you through the key features of the application:

### Dashboard

After you deploy the application template, your default dashboard is **Wide World waste management dashboard**.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-connected-waste-management/connected-waste-management-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the connected waste management application dashboard." lightbox="media/tutorial-connected-waste-management/connected-waste-management-dashboard.png":::

As a builder, you can create and customize views on the dashboard for operators.

>[!NOTE]
>All data shown in the dashboard is based on simulated device data, which you see more of in the next section.

The dashboard consists of different tiles:

- **Wide World Waste utility image tile**: The first tile in the dashboard is an image tile of a fictitious waste utility, "Wide World Waste." You can customize the tile and put in your own image, or you can remove it.

- **Waste bin image tile**: You can use image and content tiles to create a visual representation of the device that's being monitored, along with a description.

- **Fill level KPI tile**: This tile displays a value reported by a *fill level* sensor in a waste bin. Fill level and other sensors, like *odor meter* or *weight* in a waste bin, can be remotely monitored. An operator can take an action such as dispatching a trash collection truck.

- **Waste monitoring area map**: This tile uses Azure Maps, which you can configure directly in Azure IoT Central. The map tile displays device location. Try to hover over the map and try the controls over the map, like zoom-in, zoom-out, or expand.

- **Fill, odor, weight level bar chart**: You can visualize one or multiple kinds of device telemetry data in a bar chart. You can also expand the bar chart.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-connected-waste-management/connected-waste-management-dashboard-bar-chart.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the expanded bar chart on the connected waste management application dashboard." lightbox="media/tutorial-connected-waste-management/connected-waste-management-dashboard-bar-chart.png":::
