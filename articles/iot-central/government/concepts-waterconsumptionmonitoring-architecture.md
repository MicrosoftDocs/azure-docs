# Water consumption monitoring reference architecture 
<!---Required:
Starts with "Tutorial: "
Make the first word following "Tutorial:" a verb.
--->

A water consumption monitoring solution can be built using the **IoT Central Water consumption monitoring app template** as a kickstarter application. Note that the reference architecture is a high level guidance to help you understand architecture concepts and how to build a solution with IoT Central.
