# Building government solutions with Azure IoT Central



Get started with building smart city solutions using Azure IoT Central application templates. Start now with **water quality monitoring**, **water consumption monitoring**, and **connected waste management**.

## What is Water Quality Monitoring application template?   

Traditional water quality monitoring relies on manual sampling techniques and field laboratory analysis, which is time consuming and costly. By remotely monitoring water quality in real-time, water quality issues can be managed before citizens are affected. Moreover, with advanced analytics, water utilities, and environmental agencies can act on early warnings on potential water quality issues and plan on water treatment in advance.  

Water Quality Monitoring app is an IoT Central app template to help you kickstart your IoT solution development and enable water utilities to digitally monitor water quality in smart cities.

The App template consists of:
* Sample operator dashboards
* Sample water quality monitor device templates
* Simulated water quality monitor devices
* Pre-configured rules and jobs
* Branding using white labeling 

Get started with the [Water Quality Monitoring application tutorial](./tutorial-water-quality-monitoring.md).


## What is Water Consumption Monitoring application template? 

Traditional water consumption tracking relies on water operators manually reading water consumption meters at the meter sites. More and more cities are replacing traditional meters with advanced smart meters enabling remote monitoring of consumption and remotely controlling valves to control water flow. Water consumption monitoring coupled with digital feedback message to the citizen can increase awareness and reduce water consumption. 


Water Consumption Monitoring app is an IoT Central app template to help you kickstart your IoT solution development to enable water utilities and cities to remotely monitor and control water flow to reduce consumption.

The Water Consumption Monitoring app template consists of pre-configured:
* Sample operator dashboards
* Sample water quality monitor device templates
* Simulated water quality monitor devices
* Pre-configured rules and jobs
* Branding using white labeling 

 Get started with the [Water Consumption Monitoring application tutorial](./tutorial-water-consumption-monitoring.md).

## What is Connected Waste Management application template? 

Connected Waste Management app is an IoT Central app template to help you kickstart your IoT solution development to enable smart cities to remotely monitor to maximize efficient waste collection.

The Connected Waste Management app template consist of pre-configured:
* Sample operator dashboards
* Sample connected waste bin device templates
* Simulated connected waste bin devices
* Pre-configured rules and jobs
* Branding using white labeling 

Get started with the [Connected Waste Management application tutorial](./tutorial-connected-waste-management.md).
