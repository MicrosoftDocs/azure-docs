Learn to build smart city solutions with Azure IoT Central using application templates. 

# What is Water quality monitoring application template? 

Water Quality Monitoring app is an IoT Central app template to help you kickstart your IoT solution development to enable water utilities and cities to digitally monitor water quality. 

Traditional water quality monitoring relies on manual sampling techniques and field laboratory analysis, which is time consuming and costly. By remotely monitoring water quality in real-time, water quality issues can be managed before citizens are impacted. Moreover, with advanced analytics, water utilities, and environmental agencies can act on early warnings on potential water quality issues and plan on water treatment in advance.

The App template consists of:
* Sample operator dashboards
* Sample water quality monitor device templates
* Simulated water quality monitor devices
* Pre-configured rules and jobs
* Branding using white labeling 

Get started with the [Water Quality Monitoring application tutorial](tba) that walks you through how to build a solution leveraging one of the government application templates in IoT Central. 


# What is Water consumption monitoring application template? 


Water Consumption Monitoring app is an IoT Central app template to help you kickstart your IoT solution development to enable water utilities and cities to remotely monitor and control water flow to reduce consumption. 
Traditional water consumption tracking relies on water operators manually reading water consumption meters at the meter sites. More and more cities are replacing traditional meters with advanced smart meters enabling remote monitoring of consumption as well as remotely controlling valves to control water flow. Water consumption monitoring coupled with digital feedback message to the citizen can increase awareness and reduce water consumption.

The Water Consumption Monitoring app template consist of pre-configured:
* Sample operator dashboards
* Sample water quality monitor device templates
* Simulated water quality monitor devices
* Pre-configured rules and jobs
* Branding using white labeling 

 Get started with the [Water Consumption Monitoring application tutorial](tba) that walks you through how to build a solution leveraging one of the government application templates in IoT Central. 

# What is Connected waste management application template? 

Connected Waste Management app is an IoT Central app template to help you kickstart your IoT solution development to enable smart cities to remotely monitor to maximize efficient waste collection.
