# Overview - What is Digital Distribution Center solution?

As more manufacturers and retailers establish worldwide presences, their supply chains have branched out to become more complex than ever before. Distribution centers are becoming a primary challenge. Distribution Center/Warehouses are feeling the brunt of the pressure from e-commerce. Consumers now expect vast selections of products to be available, and for those goods to arrive within one to two days of purchase. Distribution centers must adapt to these trends while overcoming existing inefficiencies. 

Today, an overreliance on manual labor means picking and packing accounts for 55-65% of distribution center costs. While it is bad that manual labor slows down distribution center, rapidly fluctuating staffing needs (holiday staffing go up by 10X) make it even harder to meet shipping volumes. This seasonal fluctuation results in high turnover and the likelihood of errors and the need for costly rework increases as well.
Solutions based on IoT enabled cameras can deliver transformational benefits by enabling a digital feedback loop. This influx of data from across the distribution center leads to actionable insights that, in turn, result in better data.

Benefits are, 
* Cameras monitor goods as they arrive and move through the conveyor system
* Identify faulty goods and send them for repair
* Efficiently keep track of orders
* Reduce cost, improved productivity & Maximize utilization

Partners can leverage this application template to build Digital Distribution Center to gain actionable insights & above outlined benefits. The published template is focused on device connectivity configuration & management of camera and edge devices in IoT Central.
