# Stay connected with Azure IoT Central (preview features)

[!INCLUDE [iot-central-pnp-original](../../../includes/iot-central-pnp-original-note.md)]

This article provides an overview of the how Azure IoT Central helps keep your devices connected and healthy.

With any IoT solution designed to operate at scale, a well-structured approach to device management is important. It's not enough just to get devices "connected" to the cloud, you need an approach to keep devices connected and healthy as your solution evolves, grows, and ages. Azure IoT Central provides the needed capabilities to ensure that devices in your IoT solution are well cared for throughout the application life cycle.

## Dashboards 
Built-in [dashboards](howto-manage-devices.md#import-devices) provide a customizable surface area to monitor device health and telemetry. Start with a pre-built dashboard from an [application template](howto-use-app-templates.md) or create your own dashboards tailored to the needs of your application. Dashboards can be shared with all users in your application, or kept private.

## Rules and actions 
Quickly identify devices needing attention by building [custom rules](tutorial-create-telemetry-rules.md) based on device state and telemetry. Configure actions to notify the right people ensuring corrective measures happen in a timely fashion.

## Jobs 
[Jobs](../core/howto-run-a-job.md?toc=/azure/iot-central/preview/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central/preview/breadcrumb/toc.json) let you perform single or bulk updates to device properties, settings, and commands. 

## User roles and permissions
[Roles and permissions](howto-manage-users-roles.md) give you the ability to tailor each user's experience. Create roles directly through the UI and easily assign the appropriate permissions.
