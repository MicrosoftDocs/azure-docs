# Manage your application preferences

*This article applies to operators, builders, and administrators.*

IoT Central provides the flexibility to customize your applications to fit your need. We also provide some flexibility on a per-user basis to customize your own view. This article describes the various customization options that a user can apply to their profile.

IoT Central is supported in multiple languages. You can switch your preferred language by using the **language picker** on the settings icon on the top navigation bar.
