# Tutorial: Create and connect a client application to your Azure IoT Central application

[!INCLUDE [iot-authentication-device-connection-string](../../../includes/iot-authentication-device-connection-string.md)]

This tutorial shows you how to connect a client application to your Azure IoT Central application. The application simulates the behavior of a temperature controller device. When the application connects to IoT Central, it sends the model ID of the temperature controller device model. IoT Central uses the model ID to retrieve the device model and create a device template for you. You add  views to the device template to enable an operator to interact with a device.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create and run the device code and see it connect to your IoT Central application.
> * View the simulated telemetry sent from the device.
> * Add custom views to a device template.
> * Publish the device template.
> * Use a view to manage device properties.
> * Call a command to control the device.

## View raw data

You can use the **Raw data** view to examine the raw data your device is sending to IoT Central:

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-connect-device/raw-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the raw data view." lightbox="media/tutorial-connect-device/raw-data.png":::

On this view, you can select the columns to display and set a time range to view. The **Unmodeled data** column shows device data that doesn't match any property or telemetry definitions in the device template.
