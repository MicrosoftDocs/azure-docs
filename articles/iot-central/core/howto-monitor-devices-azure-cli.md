# Monitor device connectivity using Azure CLI

Use the Azure CLI IoT extension to:

- See the messages your devices are sending to IoT Central.
- Observe changes in the device twin.
- Diagnose issues where device messages don't reach the cloud.
- Diagnose issues where devices don't respond to twin changes.

[Visit the Azure CLI extensions reference for more details](/cli/azure/iot/central)

## Prerequisites

A work or school account in Azure, added as a user in an IoT Central application.

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-h3](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-h3.md)]

## Install the IoT Central extension

Run the following command from your command line to install:

```azurecli
az extension add --name azure-iot
```

Check the version of the extension by running:

```azurecli
az --version
```

You should see the azure-iot extension is 0.14.1 or higher. If it isn't, run:

```azurecli
az extension update --name azure-iot
```

## Using the extension

The following sections describe common commands and options that you can use when you run
`az iot central`. To view the full set of commands and options, pass
`--help` to `az iot central` or any of its subcommands.

### Sign in

Start by signing into the Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az login
```

### Get the Application ID of your IoT Central app

In **Application > Management**, copy the **Application ID**. You use this value in later steps.

### Monitor messages

Monitor the messages that are being sent to your IoT Central app from your devices. The output includes all headers and annotations.

```azurecli
az iot central diagnostics monitor-events --app-id <app-id> --properties all
```

### View device properties

View the current read and read/write device properties for a given device.

```azurecli
az iot central device twin show --app-id <app-id> --device-id <device-id>
```
