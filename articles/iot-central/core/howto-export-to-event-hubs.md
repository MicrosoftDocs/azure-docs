# Export IoT data to Event Hubs

This article describes how to configure data export to send data to the Event Hubs.

[!INCLUDE [iot-central-data-export](../../../includes/iot-central-data-export.md)]

## Set up an Event Hubs export destination

IoT Central exports data in near real time. The data is in the message body and is in JSON format encoded as UTF-8.

The annotations or system properties bag of the message contains the `iotcentral-device-id`, `iotcentral-application-id`, `iotcentral-message-source`, and `iotcentral-message-type` fields that have the same values as the corresponding fields in the message body.

## Connection options

Event Hubs destinations let you configure the connection with a *connection string* or a [managed identity](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).

[!INCLUDE [iot-central-managed-identities](../../../includes/iot-central-managed-identities.md)]

### Create an Event Hubs destination

# [Managed identity](#tab/managed-identity)

This article shows how to create a managed identity using the Azure CLI. You can also use the Azure portal to create a manged identity.

If you don't have an existing Event Hubs namespace to export to, run the following script in the Azure Cloud Shell bash environment. The script creates a resource group, Event Hubs namespace, and event hub. The script then enables the managed identity for your IoT Central application and assigns the role it needs to access your event hub:

```azurecli-interactive
# Replace the Event Hubs namespace name with your own unique value
EHNS=your-event-hubs-namespace-$RANDOM

# Replace the IoT Central app name with the name of your
# IoT Central application.
CA=your-iot-central-app

EH=exportdata
RG=centralexportresources
LOCATION=eastus

RGID=$(az group create -n $RG --location $LOCATION --query "id" --output tsv)
az eventhubs namespace create --name $EHNS --resource-group $RG -l $LOCATION
az eventhubs eventhub create --name $EH --resource-group $RG --namespace-name $EHNS

# This assumes your IoT Central application is in the 
# default `IOTC` resource group.
az iot central app identity assign --name $CA --resource-group IOTC --system-assigned
PI=$(az iot central app identity show --name $CA --resource-group IOTC --query "principalId" --output tsv)

az role assignment create --assignee $PI --role "Azure Event Hubs Data Sender" --scope $RGID

az role assignment list --assignee $PI --all -o table

echo "Host name: $EHNS.servicebus.windows.net"
echo "Event Hub: $EH"
```

To further secure your event hub and only allow access from trusted services with managed identities, see [Export data to a secure destination on an Azure Virtual Network](howto-connect-secure-vnet.md).

To create the Event Hubs destination in IoT Central on the **Data export** page:

1. Select **+ New destination**.

1. Select **Azure Event Hubs** as the destination type.

1. Select **System-assigned managed identity** as the authorization type.

1. Enter the host name of your Event Hubs resource. Then enter the case-sensitive event hub name. A host name looks like: `contoso-waste.servicebus.windows.net`.

1. Select **Save**.

If you don't see data arriving in your destination service, see [Troubleshoot issues with data exports from your Azure IoT Central application](troubleshooting.md).

# [Connection string](#tab/connection-string)

If you don't have an existing Event Hubs namespace to export to, run the following script in the Azure Cloud Shell bash environment. The script creates a resource group, Event Hubs namespace, and event hub. It then prints the connection string to use when you configure the data export in IoT Central:

```azurecli-interactive
# Replace the Event Hubs namespace name with your own unique value
EHNS=your-event-hubs-namespace-$RANDOM
EH=exportdata
RG=centralexportresources
LOCATION=eastus

az group create -n $RG --location $LOCATION
az eventhubs namespace create --name $EHNS --resource-group $RG -l $LOCATION
az eventhubs eventhub create --name $EH --resource-group $RG --namespace-name $EHNS
az eventhubs eventhub authorization-rule create --eventhub-name $EH --resource-group $RG --namespace-name $EHNS --name SendRule --rights Send

CS=$(az eventhubs eventhub authorization-rule keys list --eventhub-name $EH --resource-group $RG --namespace-name $EHNS --name SendRule --query "primaryConnectionString" -o tsv)

echo "Event hub connection string: $CS"
```

To create the Event Hubs destination in IoT Central on the **Data export** page:

1. Select **+ New destination**.

1. Select **Azure Event Hubs** as the destination type.

1. Select **Connection string** as the authorization type.

1. Paste in the connection string for your Event Hubs resource, and enter the case-sensitive event hub name if necessary.

1. Select **Save**.

For Event Hubs, IoT Central exports new messages data to your event hub in near real time. In the user properties (also referred to as application properties) of each message, the `iotcentral-device-id`, `iotcentral-application-id`, `iotcentral-message-source`, and `iotcentral-message-type` are included automatically.
