#customer intent: As a developer, I want to learn how to use the REST API to manage IoT Central applications so that I can automate application management tasks.

# Use the REST API to create and manage IoT Central applications

You can use the [control plane REST API](/rest/api/iotcentral/2021-06-01controlplane/apps) to create and manage IoT Central applications. You can also use the REST API to:

* Add a managed identity to your application.
* Manage dashboards in your application

To use this API, you need a bearer token for the `management.azure.com` resource. To get a bearer token, you can use the Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az account get-access-token --resource https://management.azure.com
```

To learn how to manage IoT Central application by using the IoT Central UI, see [Create an IoT Central application.](../core/howto-create-iot-central-application.md)

## List your applications

To get a list of the IoT Central applications in a subscription:

```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.IoTCentral/iotApps?api-version=2021-06-01
```

To get a list of the IoT Central applications in a resource group:

```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.IoTCentral/iotApps?api-version=2021-06-01
```

You can retrieve the details of an individual application:

```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.IoTCentral/iotApps/{applicationName}?api-version=2021-06-01
```

## Create an IoT Central application

To create an IoT Central application with a system assigned [managed identity](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md):

```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<your subscription id>/resourceGroups/<your resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.IoTCentral/iotApps/<your application name>?api-version=2021-06-01
```

The following payload shows the configuration for the new application, including the managed identity:

```json
{
  "location": "eastus",
  "sku": {
    "name": "ST2"
  },
  "properties": {
    "displayName": "Contoso IoT Central App",
    "subdomain": "my-iot-central-app",
    "template": "iotc-pnp-preview@1.0.0"
  },
  "identity": {
    "type": "SystemAssigned"
  }
}
```

## Modify an IoT Central application

You can modify an existing IoT Central application. The following example shows how to change the display name and enable the system assigned managed identity:

```http
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<your subscription id>/resourceGroups/<your resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.IoTCentral/iotApps/<your application name>?api-version=2021-06-01
```

Use the following payload to change the display name and enable the system assigned managed identity:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "displayName": "Contoso IoT Central App"
  },
  "identity": {
    "type": "SystemAssigned"
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can only add a managed identity to an IoT Central application that was created in a region. All new applications are created in a region.

## Delete an IoT Central application

To delete an IoT Central application, use:

```http
DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<your subscription id>/resourceGroups/<your resource group name>/providers/Microsoft.IoTCentral/iotApps/<your application name>?api-version=2021-06-01
```

## Dashboards

You can create dashboards that are associated with a specific organization. An organization dashboard is only visible to users who have access to the organization the dashboard is associated with. Only users in a role that has [organization dashboard permissions](howto-manage-users-roles.md#customizing-the-app) can create, edit, and delete organization dashboards.

All users can create *personal dashboards*, visible only to themselves. Users can switch between organization and personal dashboards.

> [!NOTE]
> Creating personal dashboards using API is currently not supported.

To learn how to manage dashboards by using the IoT Central UI, see [How to manage dashboards.](../core/howto-manage-dashboards.md)

### Dashboards REST API

The IoT Central REST API lets you:

* Add a dashboard to your application
* Update a dashboard in your application
* Get a list of the dashboard in the application
* Get a dashboard by ID
* Delete a dashboard in your application

## Add a dashboard

Use the following request to create a dashboard.

```http
PUT https://{your app subdomain}.azureiotcentral.com/api/dashboards/{dashboardId}?api-version=2022-10-31-preview
```

`dashboardId` - A unique [DTMI](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/DTDL.v2.md#digital-twin-model-identifier) identifier for the dashboard.

The request body has some required fields:

* `@displayName`: Display name of the dashboard.
* `@favorite`: Is the dashboard in the favorites list?
* `group`: Device group ID.
* `Tile` : Configuration specifying a tile object, including the layout, display name, and configuration.

Tile has some required fields:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `displayName` | Display name of the tile |
| `height` | Height of the tile |
| `width` | Width of the tile |
| `x` | Horizontal position of the tile |
| `y` | Vertical position of the tile |

The dimensions and location of a tile both use integer units. The smallest possible tile has a height and width of one.

You can configure a tile object to display multiple types of data. This article includes examples of tiles that show line charts, markdown, and last known value. To learn more about the different tile types you can add to a dashboard, see [Tile types](howto-manage-dashboards.md#tile-types).

### Line chart tile

Plot one or more aggregate telemetry values for one or more devices over a time period. For example, you can display a line chart to plot the average temperature and pressure of one or more devices during the past hour.

The line chart tile has the following configuration:

| Name | Description |
|--|--|
| `capabilities` | Specifies the aggregate value of the telemetry to display. |
| `devices` | The list of devices to display. |
| `format` | The format configuration of the chart such as the axes to use. |
| `group` | The ID of the device group to display. |
| `queryRange` | The time range and resolution to display.|
| `type` | `lineChart` |

### Markdown tile

Clickable tiles that display a heading and description text formatted in Markdown. The URL can be a relative link to another page in the application or an absolute link to an external site.
The markdown tile has the following configuration:

| Name | Description |
|--|--|
| `description` | The markdown string to render inside the tile. |
| `href` | The link to visit when the tile is selected. |
| `image` | A base64 encoded image to display. |
| `type` | `markdown` |

### Last known value tile

Display the latest telemetry values for one or more devices. For example, you can use this tile to display the most recent temperature, pressure, and humidity values for one or more devices.

The last known value (LKV) tile has the following configuration:

| Name | Description |
|--|--|
| `capabilities` | Specifies the telemetry to display. |
| `devices` | The list of devices to display. |
| `format` | The format configuration of the LKV tile such as text size of word wrapping. |
| `group` | The ID of the device group to display. |
| `showTrend` | Show the difference between the last known value and the previous value. |
| `type` | `lkv` |

The following example shows a request body that adds a new dashboard with line chart, markdown, and last known value tiles. The LKV and line chart tiles are `2x2` tiles. The markdown tile is a `1x1` tile. The tiles are arranged on the top row of the dashboard:

```json

    "displayName": "My Dashboard ",
    "tiles": [
