# What are application templates?

Application templates in Azure IoT Central are a tool to help solution builders kickstart their IoT solution development. You can use app templates for everything from getting a feel for what is possible, to fully customizing and your application for resale to your customers.

Application templates consist of:

- Sample operator dashboards
- Sample device templates
- Simulated devices producing real-time data
- Pre-configured rules and jobs
- Rich documentation including tutorials and how-tos

## Preview templates

Your choice of application template determines whether your application uses IoT Central preview features such as Plug and Play for devices.

Currently, the application template that use _generally available_ features is:

- Custom app > Legacy application


Currently, the application templates that use _public preview_ features are:

- Custom app > Preview application
- Retail > Connected logistics
- Retail > Digital distribution center
- Retail > In-store analytics – condition monitoring
- Retail > In-store analytics – checkout
- Retail > Micro-fulfillment center
- Retail > Smart inventory management
- Energy > Smart meter monitoring
- Energy > Solar panel monitoring
- Government > Connected waste management
- Government > Water consumption monitoring
- Government > Water quality monitoring
- Healthcare > Continuous patient monitoring

> [!NOTE]
> The **legacy application** templates are currently  available in the **United States**, **Australia**, **Asia Pacific**, or in the **Europe** locations, while other templates are currently available only in **Europe** and **US** locations.

## Industry focused templates
