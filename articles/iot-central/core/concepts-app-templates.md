# What are application templates?

Application templates in Azure IoT Central are a tool to help solution builders kickstart their IoT solution development. You can use app templates for everything from getting a feel for what is possible, to fully customizing and your application for resale to your customers.

Application templates consist of:

- Sample operator dashboards
- Sample device templates
- Simulated devices producing real-time data
- Pre-configured rules and jobs
- Rich documentation including tutorials and how-tos

You choose the application template when you create your application. You can't change the template after the application is created.

## Custom templates

If you want to create your application from scratch, choose one of the two custom application templates:

- Custom application
- Custom application (legacy)

Choose the **Custom application** template unless you have a specific reason to use the legacy template.

## Industry focused templates

Azure IoT Central is an industry agnostic application platform. Application templates are industry focused examples available for these industries today, with more to come in the future:

- [Retail](../retail/overview-iot-central-retail.md)
  - Connected logistics
  - Digital distribution center
  - In-store analytics - condition monitoring
  - In-store analytics - checkout
  - Smart Inventory Management
- [Energy](../energy/overview-iot-central-energy.md)
  - Smart meter monitoring
  - Solar panel monitoring
- [Government](../government/overview-iot-central-government.md)
  - Connected waste management
  - Water consumption monitoring
  - Water quality monitoring
- [Healthcare](../healthcare/overview-iot-central-healthcare.md).
  - Continuous patient monitoring
