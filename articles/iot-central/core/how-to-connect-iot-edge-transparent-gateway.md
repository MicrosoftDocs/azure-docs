# How to connect devices through an IoT Edge transparent gateway

An IoT Edge device can act as a gateway that provides a connection between other devices on a local network and your IoT Central application. You use a gateway when the device can't access your IoT Central application directly.

IoT Edge supports the [*transparent* and *translation* gateway patterns](../../iot-edge/iot-edge-as-gateway.md). This article summarizes how to implement the transparent gateway pattern. In this pattern, the gateway passes messages from the downstream device through to the IoT Hub endpoint in your IoT Central application. The gateway doesn't manipulate the messages as they pass through. In IoT Central, each downstream device appears as child to the gateway device:

[!INCLUDE [iot-authentication-device-connection-string](../../../includes/iot-authentication-device-connection-string.md)]

For simplicity, this article uses virtual machines to host the downstream and gateway devices. In a real scenario, the downstream device and gateway would run on physical devices on your local network.

This article shows how to implement the scenario by using the IoT Edge 1.4 runtime.

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this article, you need:

- An active Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

- An [IoT Central application created](howto-create-iot-central-application.md) from the **Custom application** template. To learn more, see [Create an IoT Central application](howto-create-iot-central-application.md).

To follow the steps in this article, download the following files to your computer:

- [Thermostat device model (thermostat-1.json)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models/main/dtmi/com/example/thermostat-1.json) - this file is the device model for the downstream devices.
- [Transparent gateway manifest (EdgeTransparentGatewayManifest.json)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/iot-central-docs-samples/main/transparent-gateway-1-4/EdgeTransparentGatewayManifest.json) - this file is the IoT Edge deployment manifest for the gateway device.

## Import deployment manifest

Every IoT Edge device needs a deployment manifest to configure the IoT Edge runtime. To import a deployment manifest for the IoT Edge transparent gateway:

1. Navigate to **Edge manifests**.

1. Select **+ New**, enter a name for the deployment manifest such as *Transparent gateway* and then upload the *EdgeTransparentGatewayManifest.json* file you downloaded previously.

1. Select **Create** to save the deployment manifest in your application.

## Add device templates

Both the downstream devices and the gateway device can use device templates in IoT Central. IoT Central lets you model the relationship between your downstream devices and your gateway so you can view and manage them after they're connected. A device template isn't required to attach a downstream device to a gateway.

To create a device template for a downstream device, create a standard device template that models the capabilities of your device. The example shown in this article uses the thermostat device model you downloaded.

To create a device template for a downstream device:

1. Create a device template and choose **IoT device** as the template type.

1. On the **Customize** page of the wizard, enter a name such as *Thermostat* for the device template.

1. After you create the device template, select **Import a model**. Select a model such as the *thermostat-1.json* file you downloaded previously.

1. To generate some default views for the thermostat, select views and then choose **Generate default views**.

1. Publish the device template.

To create a device template for an IoT Edge transparent gateway device:

1. Create a device template and choose **Azure IoT Edge** as the template type.

1. On the **Customize** page of the wizard, enter a name such as *Edge Gateway* for the device template.

1. On the **Customize** page of the wizard, check **This is a gateway device**.

1. On the **Review** page, select **Create**.

1. On the **Create a model** page, select **Custom model**.

1. Add an entry in **Relationships** to the downstream device template.

The following screenshot shows the **Relationships** page for an IoT Edge gateway device with downstream devices that use the **Thermostat** device template:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-connect-iot-edge-transparent-gateway/device-template-relationship.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing IoT Edge gateway device template relationship with a thermostat downstream device template." lightbox="media/how-to-connect-iot-edge-transparent-gateway/device-template-relationship.png":::

The previous screenshot shows an IoT Edge gateway device template with no modules defined. A transparent gateway doesn't require any modules because the IoT Edge runtime forwards messages from the downstream devices directly to IoT Central. If the gateway itself needs to send telemetry, synchronize properties, or handle commands, you can define these capabilities in the root component or in a module.

Add any required cloud properties and views before you publish the gateway and downstream device templates.

## Add the devices

When you add the devices to your IoT Central application, you can define the relationship between the downstream devices and the transparent gateway.

To add the devices:

1. Navigate to the devices page in your IoT Central application.

1. Add an instance of the transparent gateway IoT Edge device. When you add the device, make sure that you select the **Transparent gateway** deployment manifest. In this article, the gateway device ID is `edgegateway`.

1. Add one or more instances of the downstream device. In this article, the downstream devices are thermostats with IDs `thermostat1` and `thermostat2`.

1. In the device list, select each downstream device and select **Attach to gateway**.

The following screenshot shows you can view the list of devices attached to a gateway on the **Downstream Devices** page:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-connect-iot-edge-transparent-gateway/downstream-devices.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the list of downstream devices connected to a transparent gateway." lightbox="media/how-to-connect-iot-edge-transparent-gateway/downstream-devices.png":::

In a transparent gateway, the downstream devices connect to the gateway itself, not to a custom module hosted by the gateway.

Before you deploy the devices, you need the:

- **ID Scope** of your IoT Central application.
- **Device ID** values for the gateway and downstream devices.
- **Primary key** values for the gateway and downstream devices.

To find these values, navigate to each device in the device list and select **Connect**. Make a note of these values before you continue.

> [!TIP]
> You can connect the devices and establish relationships without first creating device templates for the devices. You can attach an unassigned downstream device to an unassigned gateway device.

## Deploy the gateway and devices

To let you try out this scenario, the following steps show you how to deploy the gateway and downstream devices to Azure virtual machines.

> [!TIP]
> To learn how to deploy the IoT Edge runtime to a physical device, see [Create an IoT Edge device](../../iot-edge/how-to-create-iot-edge-device.md) in the IoT Edge documentation.

To try out the transparent gateway scenario, select the following button to deploy two Linux virtual machines. One virtual machine has the IoT Edge 1.4 runtime installed and is the transparent IoT Edge gateway. The other virtual machine is a downstream device where you run code to send simulated thermostat telemetry:

[![Deploy to Azure Button](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure-Samples%2Fiot-central-docs-samples%2Fmain%2Ftransparent-gateway-1-4%2FDeployGatewayVMs.json)

When the two virtual machines are deployed and running, verify the IoT Edge gateway device is running on the `edgegateway` virtual machine:

1. Go to the **Devices** page in your IoT Central application. If the IoT Edge gateway device is connected to IoT Central, its status is **Provisioned**.

1. Open the IoT Edge gateway device and verify the status of the modules on the **Modules** page. If the IoT Edge runtime started successfully, the status of the **$edgeAgent** and **$edgeHub** modules is **Running**:

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-connect-iot-edge-transparent-gateway/iot-edge-runtime-1-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the $edgeAgent and $edgeHub version 1.4 modules running on the IoT Edge gateway." lightbox="media/how-to-connect-iot-edge-transparent-gateway/iot-edge-runtime-1-4.png":::

    > [!TIP]
    > You may have to wait for several minutes while the virtual machine starts up and the device is provisioned in your IoT Central application.

## Configure the gateway

For your IoT Edge device to function as a transparent gateway, it needs some certificates to prove its identity to any downstream devices. This article uses demo certificates. In a production environment, use certificates from your certificate authority.

To generate the demo certificates and install them on your gateway device:

1. Use SSH to connect to and sign in on your gateway device virtual machine.

1. Run the following commands to clone the IoT Edge repository and generate your demo certificates:

    ```bash
    # Clone the repo
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/iotedge.git
  
    # Generate the demo certificates
    mkdir certs
    cd certs
    cp ~/iotedge/tools/CACertificates/*.cnf .
    cp ~/iotedge/tools/CACertificates/certGen.sh .
    ./certGen.sh create_root_and_intermediate
    ./certGen.sh create_edge_device_ca_certificate "mycacert"
    ```

    After you run the previous commands, the following files are ready to use in the next steps:

    - *~/certs/certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem* - The root CA certificate used to make all the other demo certificates for testing an IoT Edge scenario.
    - *~/certs/certs/iot-edge-device-mycacert-full-chain.cert.pem* - A device CA certificate referenced from the IoT Edge configuration file. In a gateway scenario, this CA certificate is how the IoT Edge device verifies its identity to downstream devices.
    - *~/certs/private/iot-edge-device-mycacert.key.pem* - The private key associated with the device CA certificate.

    To learn more about these demo certificates, see [Create demo certificates to test IoT Edge device features](../../iot-edge/how-to-create-test-certificates.md).

1. Open the *config.toml* file in a text editor. For example:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/aziot/config.toml
    ```

1. Locate the following settings in the configuration file. Add the certificate settings as follows:

    ```text
    trust_bundle_cert = "file:///home/AzureUser/certs/certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem"

    [edge_ca]
    cert = "file:///home/AzureUser/certs/certs/iot-edge-device-ca-mycacert-full-chain.cert.pem"
    pk = "file:///home/AzureUser/certs/private/iot-edge-device-ca-mycacert.key.pem"
    ```

    The previous example assumes you're signed in as **AzureUser** and created a device CA certificate called "mycacert".

1. Save the changes and restart the IoT Edge runtime:

    ```bash
    sudo iotedge config apply
    ```

If the IoT Edge runtime starts successfully after your changes, the status of the **$edgeAgent** and **$edgeHub** modules changes to **Running** on the **Modules** page for your gateway device in IoT Central.

If the runtime doesn't start, check the changes you made in the IoT Edge configuration file and see [Troubleshoot your IoT Edge device](../../iot-edge/troubleshoot.md).

Your transparent gateway is now configured and ready to start forwarding telemetry from downstream devices.

## Provision a downstream device

IoT Central relies on the Device Provisioning Service (DPS) to provision devices in IoT Central. Currently, IoT Edge can't use DPS provision a downstream device to your IoT Central application. The following steps show you how to provision the `thermostat1` device manually. To complete these steps, you need an environment with Python installed and internet connectivity. Check the [Azure IoT Python SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/blob/main/README.md) for current Python version requirements. The [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) has Python preinstalled:

1. Run the following command to install the `azure.iot.device` module:

    ```bash
    pip install azure.iot.device
    ```

1. Run the following command to download the Python script that does the device provisioning:

    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/iot-central-docs-samples/main/transparent-gateway-1-4/provision_device.py
    ```

1. To provision the `thermostat1` downstream device in your IoT Central application, run the following commands, replacing `{your application id scope}` and `{your device primary key}`. You made a note of these values when you added the devices to your IoT Central application:

    ```bash
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_ID=thermostat1
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ID_SCOPE={your application id scope}
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_KEY={your device primary key}
    python provision_device.py
    ```

In your IoT Central application, verify that the **Device status** for the `thermostat1` device is now **Provisioned**.

## Configure a downstream device

> [!NOTE]
> IoT Central does not support X.509 certificate authentication for downstream devices connected to an IoT Edge transparent gateway.

In the previous section, you configured the `edgegateway` virtual machine with the demo certificates to enable it to run as gateway. The `leafdevice` virtual machine is ready for you to install a thermostat simulator that uses the gateway to connect to IoT Central.

The `leafdevice` virtual machine needs a copy of the root CA certificate you created on the `edgegateway` virtual machine. Copy the */home/AzureUser/certs/certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem* file from the `edgegateway` virtual machine to your home directory on the `leafdevice` virtual machine. You can use the **scp** command to copy files between Linux virtual machines. For example, from the `leafdevice` machine:

```bash
scp AzureUser@edgegateway:/home/AzureUser/certs/certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem .
```

To learn how to check the connection from the downstream device to the gateway, see [Test the gateway connection](../../iot-edge/how-to-connect-downstream-device.md#test-the-gateway-connection).

To run the thermostat simulator on the `leafdevice` virtual machine:

1. Use SSH to connect to and sign in on your `leafdevice` virtual machine.

1. Download the Python sample to your home directory:

    ```bash
    cd ~
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/iot-central-docs-samples/main/transparent-gateway-1-4/simple_thermostat.py
    ```

1. Install the Azure IoT device Python module:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    pip3 install azure.iot.device
    ```

1. Set the environment variables to configure the sample. Replace `{your device shared key}` with the primary key of the `thermostat1` you made a note of previously. These variables assume the name of the gateway virtual machine is `edgegateway` and the ID of the thermostat device is `thermostat1`:

    ```bash
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_SECURITY_TYPE=connectionString
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING="HostName=edgegateway;DeviceId=thermostat1;SharedAccessKey={your device shared key}"
    export IOTEDGE_ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH=~/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem
    ```

    Notice how the connection string uses the name of the gateway device and not the name of an IoT hub.

1. To run the code, use the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 simple_thermostat.py
    ```

    The output from this command looks like:

    ```output
    Connecting using Connection String HostName=edgegateway;DeviceId=thermostat1;SharedAccessKey={your device shared key}
    Listening for command requests and property updates
    Press Q to quit
    Sending telemetry for temperature
    Sent message
    Sent message
    Sent message
    ...
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > If you see an error when the downstream device tries to connect. Try re-running the device provisioning steps.

1. To see the telemetry in IoT Central, navigate to the **Overview** page for the **thermostat1** device:

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-connect-iot-edge-transparent-gateway/downstream-device-telemetry.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing telemetry from the downstream device." lightbox="media/how-to-connect-iot-edge-transparent-gateway/downstream-device-telemetry.png":::

    On the **About** page you can view property values sent from the downstream device, and on the **Command** page you can call commands on the downstream device.
