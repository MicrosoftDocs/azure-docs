# Take a tour of the Azure IoT Central UI

This article introduces you to Azure IoT Central UI. You can use the UI to create, administer, and use an IoT Central application and its connected devices.

## IoT Central homepage

The [IoT Central homepage](https://apps.azureiotcentral.com/) page is the place to learn more about the latest news and features available on IoT Central and see and launch your existing applications.

### Launch your application

You launch your IoT Central application by navigating to the URL you chose during app creation. You can see a list of all the applications you have access to in the [IoT Central app manager](https://apps.azureiotcentral.com/myapps).

## Navigate your application

Once you're inside your IoT application, use the left pane to access various features. You can expand or collapse the left pane by selecting the three-lined icon on top of the pane:

> [!NOTE]
> The items you see in the left pane depend on your user role. Learn more about [managing users and roles](howto-manage-users-roles.md).

  :::column-end:::
  :::column span="2":::

    **Devices** lets you manage all your devices.

    **Device groups** lets you view and create collections of devices specified by a query. Device groups are used through the application to perform bulk operations.

    **Device templates** lets you create and manage the characteristics of devices that connect to your application.

    **Edge manifests** lets you import and manage deployment manifests for the IoT Edge devices that connect to your application.

    **Data explorer** exposes rich capabilities to analyze historical trends and correlate various telemetry types from your devices.

    **Dashboards** displays all application and personal dashboards. 

    **Jobs** lets you manage your devices at scale by running bulk operations.

    **Rules** lets you create and edit rules to monitor your devices. Rules are evaluated based on device data and trigger customizable actions.

    **Data export** lets you configure a continuous export to external services such as storage and queues.

    **Audit logs** lets you view changes made to entities in your application.

    **Permissions** lets you manage an organization's users, devices and data.

    **Application** lets you manage your application's settings, billing, users, and roles.
    
    **Customization** lets you customize your application appearance.

    **IoT Central Home** lets you jump back to the IoT Central app manager.

### Search, help, theme, and support

The top menu appears on every page:

:::image type="content" source="media/overview-iot-central-tour/toolbar.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the IoT Central Toolbar with access to utilities such as search.":::

* To search for devices, enter a **Search** value.
* To change the UI language or theme, choose the **Settings** icon. Learn more about [managing your application preferences](howto-manage-preferences.md)
* To get help and support, choose the **Help** drop-down for a list of resources. You can [get information about your application](howto-faq.yml#how-do-i-get-information-about-my-application-) from the **About your app** link.
* To sign out of the application, choose the **Account** icon.

You can choose between a light theme or a dark theme for the UI:

> [!NOTE]
> The option to choose between light and dark themes isn't available if your administrator has configured a custom theme for the application.

### Devices

:::image type="content" source="Media/overview-iot-central-tour/devices.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Devices page that list your devices.":::

This page shows the devices in your IoT Central application grouped by _device template_.

* A device template defines a type of device that can connect to your application.
* A device represents either a real or simulated device in your application.

### Device groups

:::image type="content" source="Media/overview-iot-central-tour/device-groups.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Device Group page that shows device groupings.":::

This page lets you create and view device groups in your IoT Central application. You can use device groups to do bulk operations in your application or to analyze data. To learn more, see the [Use device groups in your Azure IoT Central application](tutorial-use-device-groups.md) article.

### Device templates

:::image type="content" source="Media/overview-iot-central-tour/templates.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Device templates page where you can manage device templates.":::

The device templates page is where you can view and create device templates in the application. To learn more, see [Connect Azure IoT Edge devices to an Azure IoT Central application](concepts-iot-edge.md).

### Edge manifests

:::image type="content" source="Media/overview-iot-central-tour/manifests.png" alt-text="Screenshot of IoT Edge manifests page where you can manage IoT Edge deployment manifests.":::

The edge manifests page is where you can import and manage IoT Edge deployment manifests in the application. To learn more, see the [Define a new device type in your Azure IoT Central application](howto-set-up-template.md) tutorial.

### Data Explorer

:::image type="content" source="Media/overview-iot-central-tour/analytics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of data analytics page where you can build custom queries and charts.":::
