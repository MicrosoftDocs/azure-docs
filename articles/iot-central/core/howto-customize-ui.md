# Customize the Azure IoT Central UI

This article describes how you can customize the UI of your application by applying custom themes, changing the text, and modifying the help links to point to your own custom help resources.

The following screenshot shows a page using the standard theme:

The following screenshot shows a page using a custom screenshot with the customized UI elements highlighted:

> [!TIP]
> You can also customize the image shown in browser's address bar and list of favorites.

## Create theme

To create a custom theme, navigate to the **Appearance** section in the **Customization** page.

:::image type="content" source="media/howto-customize-ui/themes.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the appearance customization page." lightbox="media/howto-customize-ui/themes.png":::

On this page, you can customize the following aspects of your application:

### Application logo

A PNG image, no larger than 1 MB, with a transparent background. This logo displays on the IoT Central application title bar.

If your logo image includes the name of your application, you can hide the application name text. For more information, see [Manage your application](howto-administer.md#change-application-name-and-url).

### Browser icon (favicon)

A PNG image, no larger than 32 x 32 pixels, with a transparent background. A web browser can use this image in the address bar, history, bookmarks, and browser tab.

### Browser colors

You can change the color of the page header and the color used for accenting buttons and other highlights. Use a six character hex color value in the format `##ff6347`. For more information about **HEX Value** color notation, see [HTML Colors](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp).

> [!NOTE]
> You can always revert back to the default options on the **Appearance** section.

### Changes for operators

If an administrator creates a custom theme, then operators and other users of your application can no longer choose a theme in **Appearance**.

## Replace help links

To provide custom help information to your operators and other users, you can modify the links on the application **Help** menu.

To modify the help links, navigate to the **Help links** section in the **Customization** page.

:::image type="content" source="media/howto-customize-ui/help-links.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to customize the help links." lightbox="media/howto-customize-ui/help-links.png":::

You can also add new entries to the help menu and remove default entries:

:::image type="content" source="media/howto-customize-ui/custom-help.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the list of help links." lightbox="media/howto-customize-ui/custom-help.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> You can always revert back to the default help links on the **Customization** page.

## Change application text

To change text labels in the application, navigate to the **Text** section in the **Customization** page.

On this page, you can customize the text of your application for all supported languages. After you upload the custom text file, the application text automatically appears with the updated text. You can make further customizations by editing and overwriting the customization file. You can repeat the process for any language that the IoT Central UI supports.

Following example shows how to change the word `Device` to `Asset` when you view the application in English:

1. Select **Add application text** and select the English language in the dropdown.
1. Download the default text file. The file contains a JSON definition of the text strings you can change.
1. To replace the word `device` with `asset`, open the file in a text editor and edit the value strings as shown in the following example:

      ```json
      {
        "Device": {
          "AllEntities": "All assets",
          "Approve": {

1. Upload your edited customization file and select **Save** to see your new text in the application:

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-customize-ui/upload-custom-text.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to upload a custom text file." lightbox="media/howto-customize-ui/upload-custom-text.png":::

    The UI now uses the new text values:

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-customize-ui/updated-ui-text.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows updated text in the UI." lightbox="media/howto-customize-ui/updated-ui-text.png":::

You can reupload the customization file with further changes by selecting the relevant language from the list on the **Text** section in the **Customization** page.
