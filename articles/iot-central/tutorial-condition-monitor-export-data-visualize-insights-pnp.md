# Tutorial: Export data from Azure IoT Central and visualize insights in Power BI

In this tutorial, you configure your IoT Central retail monitoring application to export telemetry collected from the devices. You then create a custom dashboard for the store manager to visualize the insights derived from the telemetry.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Configure an IoT Central application to export telemetry to an event hub.
> * Use Logic Apps to send data from an event hub to a Power BI streaming dataset.
> * Create a Power BI dashboard to visualize data in the streaming dataset.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

* To complete the previous two tutorials, [Create a condition monitoring retail application in Azure IoT Central](./tutorial-condition-monitor-create-app-pnp.md?toc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/breadcrumb/toc.json) and [Customize the operator dashboard and manage devices in Azure IoT Central](./tutorial-condition-monitor-customize-dashboard-pnp.md?toc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/toc.json&bc=/azure/iot-central-pnp/breadcrumb/toc.json).
* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
* A Power BI account. If you don't have a Power BI account, sign up for a [free Power BI Pro trial](https://app.powerbi.com/signupredirect?pbi_source=web) before you begin.

## Create an event hub

Before you can configure the retail monitoring application to export telemetry, you need to create the event hub that receives the exported data. The following steps show you how to create your event hub:

## Configure data export

Now you have an event hub, you can configure the retail monitoring application to export telemetry from the connected devices. The following steps show you how to configure the export:

## Create a Power BI dataset

Your Power BI dashboard will display data from your retail monitoring application. In this solution, you use a Power BI streaming dataset as the data source for the dashboard. In this section, you define the schema of the streaming dataset so that the Logic app can forward data from the event hub. The following steps show you how to create the streaming dataset:

## Create a Logic app

In this so

## Create a Power BI dashboard

## Sign in to the application

Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

Don’t number H2 and H3 headings. Tutorials are procedure based and customers understand that the sections follow in sequence.

Tutorials should always have a Next steps H2 that points to the next logical tutorial in a series (one link only here), or, if there are no other tutorials, to some other cool thing the customer can do with the service. Use the blue box format for tutorials and note that you can shorten the H1 in the boxes if the original one doesn’t fit.
