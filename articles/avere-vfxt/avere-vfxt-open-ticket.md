## Open a support ticket for your Avere vFXT

If you encounter issues while deploying or using Avere vFXT, request help through the Azure portal.

Follow these steps to make sure that your support ticket is tagged with a resource from your cluster. Tagging the ticket helps us route it to the correct support resource.

1. From [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource Groups**. Browse to the resource group that contains the vFXT cluster where the issue occurred, and click on one of the Avere cluster virtual machines.

   Under **Service**, click **All Services** and look under **Storage** to choose **Avere vFXT**.

   Add a short summary, and select the problem type.
