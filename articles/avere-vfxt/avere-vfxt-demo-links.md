# Avere vFXT demo projects

Sample tutorials are provided on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Avere). These small projects demonstrate key features and use cases for Avere vFXT for Azure.

## Video rendering

* [Rendering using Azure Batch and Avere vFXT](https://github.com/Azure/Avere/blob/master/docs/maya_azure_batch_avere_vfxt_demo.md) - A 60-minute project that demonstrates how to use Autodesk Maya with Azure Batch and an Avere vFXT cluster to generate an animated movie

* [Why use the Avere vFXT for rendering?](https://github.com/Azure/Avere/blob/master/docs/why_avere_for_rendering.md) - A demonstration that compares rendering times from network-attached storage with and without an Avere vFXT cluster

## High-performance computing

* [Best practices for improving Azure Virtual Machine (VM) boot time](https://github.com/Azure/Avere/blob/master/docs/azure_vm_provision_best_practices.md) - A reproducible test that uses Avere vFXT for Azure to improve boot times when spinning up thousands of compute clients quickly

## vFXT performance

* [Measure vFXT performance with vdbench](https://github.com/Azure/Avere/blob/master/docs/vdbench.md) - A basic test setup to generate small and midsize workloads to test the vFXT memory and disk subsystems

## Client setup

* [Windows 10 workstation for Avere vFXT](https://github.com/Azure/Avere/blob/master/docs/windows_10_avere_vfxt_mounted_workstation.md) - Demonstrates how to set up a Windows workstation and mount it to an Avere vFXT cluster
