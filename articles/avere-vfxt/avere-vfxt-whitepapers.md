# Azure vFXT for Azure whitepapers and other resources

This article lists case studies, technology whitepapers, infographics, and other resources that can help you understand how Avere vFXT for Azure fits into your workflow.

## Deploy Agisoft PhotoScan on Azure

**Link:** [Deploy Agisoft PhotoScan on Azure with Avere vFXT for Azure or BeeGFS](https://azure.microsoft.com/mediahandler/files/resourcefiles/deploy-agisoft-photoscan-on-azure-with-azere-vfxt-for-azure-or-beegfs/AgiSoft%20PhotoScan%20on%20Azure%20using%20Avere%20vFXT%20or%20BeeGFS.pdf)

This guide provides step-by-step guidance for installing Agisoft PhotoScan photogrammetry software backed by either Avere vFXT storage or BeeGFS parallel file system. The author, Paulo Marques da Costa of AzureCAT, shows how to set up PhotoScan on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). High-performance storage accelerates processing time, and the results of his benchmark tests are included. This environment can be scaled up and down as needed and supports terabytes of storage without sacrificing performance.
