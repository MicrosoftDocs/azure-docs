abstract:
  description: Avere vFXT for Azure provides a cloud-based cache layer for data-intensive high-performance computing (HPC) tasks. By caching files close to your compute nodes, Avere vFXT speeds read times and lets you work more smoothly, even at peak load. Avere vFXT works best with systems that have between 1,000 and 40,000 client cores. <p>Avere vFXT works with your existing data storage to bring files close to Azure-based computing resources. Active files are still stored for the long term in your data center.
