# Overview: An Introduction to Azure Location Based Services
### Azure Location Based Services (LBS) is a reemergence of location capabilities within the Azure cloud. Azure LBS provides developers from all industries powerful geospatial capabilities packed with fresh mapping data imperative to providing geographic context to web and mobile applications. Azure LBS is an Azure One API compliant set of REST APIs accompanied with a web-based JavaScript control to make development super easy, flexible and portable across multiple mediums. 

### Version 1 of Azure LBS consists of five primary services to bolster Azure applications requiring geographic context. Each of the services is explained in detail below.

### **Render Service** – The Render Service is designed for developers to create web and mobile applications around mapping. The service uses either high quality raster graphic images, available in 19 zoom levels, or fully customizable vector format map images.

### **Route Service** – The Route Service is built with robust real-world infrastructure geometry calculations and multiple transportation mode directions. The service allows for developers to calculate directions across a number of travel modes such as car, truck, bicycle or walking; as well as, a number of inputs such as traffic conditions, weight restrictions or hazardous material transport.

### **Search Service** – The Search Service is designed for developers to search for addresses, places, business listings by name or category and other geographic information. The Search Service can also reverse geocode addresses and cross streets based on a latitude/longitude. 

### **Time Zone Service** – The Time Zone Service allows you to query current, historical, and future time zone information using either latitude-longitude pairs or a IANA ID. The Time Zone service also allows for converting Windows time zones to IANA time zones, fetching a time zone offset to UTC and getting the actual time in a respective time zone. 

### **Traffic Service** – The Traffic Service is a suite of web services designed for developers to create web and mobile applications around real-time traffic. The offering is split into Traffic Flow, providing real time observed speeds and travel times for all key roads in the network, and Traffic Incidents, providing an accurate view about the traffic jams and incidents around the road network.
