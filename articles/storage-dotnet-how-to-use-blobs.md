# How to use Blob Storage from .NET

This guide will demonstrate how to perform common scenarios using the
Azure Blob storage service. The samples are written in C\# and
use the Azure Storage Client Library for .NET. The scenarios covered include
**uploading**, **listing**, **downloading**, and **deleting** blobs. For
more information on blobs, see the [Next steps][] section.

> [WACOM.NOTE] This guide targets the Azure .NET Storage Client Library 2.x and above. The recommended version is Storage Client Library 4.x, which is available via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage/) or as part of the [Azure SDK for .NET](/en-us/downloads/). See [How to: Programmatically access Blob storage][] below for more details on obtaining the Storage Client Library.

###Obtaining the assembly
We recommend that you use NuGet to obtain the `Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.dll` assembly. Right-click your project in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Manage NuGet Packages**.  Search online for "WindowsAzure.Storage" and click **Install** to install the Azure Storage package and dependencies.

`Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.dll` is also included in the Azure SDK for .NET, which can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/net/#">.NET Developer Center</a>. The assembly is installed to the `%Program Files%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows Azure\.NET SDK\<sdk-version>\ref\` directory.

###Namespace declarations
Add the following namespace declarations to the top of any C\# file
in which you wish to programmatically access Azure Storage:

    using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;
    using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Auth;
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob;

Make sure you reference the `Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.dll` assembly.

###Retrieving your connection string
You can use the **CloudStorageAccount** type to represent 
your Storage Account information. If you are using an 
Azure project template and/or have a reference to 
Microsoft.WindowsAzure.CloudConfigurationManager, you 
can you use the **CloudConfigurationManager** type
to retrieve your storage connection string and storage account
information from the Azure service configuration:

    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

If you are creating an application with no reference to Microsoft.WindowsAzure.CloudConfigurationManager, and your connection string is located in the `web.config` or `app.config` as show above, then you can use **ConfigurationManager** to retrieve the connection string.  You will need to add a reference to System.Configuration.dll to your project, and add another namespace declaration for it:

	using System.Configuration;
	...
	CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
		ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["StorageConnectionString"].ConnectionString);

A **CloudBlobClient** type allows you to retrieve objects that represent
containers and blobs stored within the Blob Storage Service. The
following code creates a **CloudBlobClient** object using the storage
account object we retrieved above:

    CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();

###ODataLib dependencies
ODataLib dependencies in the Storage Client Library for .NET are resolved through the ODataLib (version 5.0.2) packages available through NuGet and not WCF Data Services.  The ODataLib libraries can be downloaded directly or referenced by your code project through NuGet.  The specific ODataLib packages are [OData], [Edm], and [Spatial].

## <a name="create-container"> </a><span  class="short-header">How to: Create a container</span>

Every blob in Azure storage must reside in a container. This example shows how to create a container if it does not already exist:

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the blob client.
    CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();

    // Retrieve a reference to a container. 
    CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("mycontainer");

    // Create the container if it doesn't already exist.
    container.CreateIfNotExists();

By default, the new container is private and you must specify your
storage access key to download blobs from this
container. If you want to make the files within the container available
to everyone, you can set the container to be public using the following
code:

    container.SetPermissions(
        new BlobContainerPermissions { PublicAccess = 
 	    BlobContainerPublicAccessType.Blob }); 

Anyone on the Internet can see blobs in a public container, but you can
modify or delete them only if you have the appropriate access key.

## <a name="upload-blob"> </a><span  class="short-header">How to: Upload a blob into a container</span>

Azure Blob Storage supports block blobs and page blobs.  In the majority of cases, block blob is the recommended type to use.

To upload a file to a block blob, get a container reference and use it to get
a block blob reference. Once you have a blob reference, you can upload any
stream of data to it by calling the **UploadFromStream** method. This operation will create the blob if it didn't previously exist,
or overwrite it if it does exist. The following example shows how to upload a blob into a container and assumes that the container was already created.

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the blob client.
    CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();

    // Retrieve reference to a previously created container.
    CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("mycontainer");

    // Retrieve reference to a blob named "myblob".
    CloudBlockBlob blockBlob = container.GetBlockBlobReference("myblob");

    // Create or overwrite the "myblob" blob with contents from a local file.
    using (var fileStream = System.IO.File.OpenRead(@"path\myfile"))
    {
        blockBlob.UploadFromStream(fileStream);
    } 

##<a name="list-blob"> </a><span  class="short-header">How to: List the blobs in a container</span>

To list the blobs in a container, first get a container reference. You
can then use the container's **ListBlobs** method to retrieve the blobs and/or directories
within it. To access the rich set of properties and methods for a 
returned **IListBlobItem**, you must cast it to a **CloudBlockBlob**, 
**CloudPageBlob**, or **CloudBlobDirectory** object.  If the type is unknown, you can use a 
type check to determine which to cast it to.  The following code 
demonstrates how to retrieve and output the URI of each item in 
the `photos` container:

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the blob client. 
	CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();

	// Retrieve reference to a previously created container.
	CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("photos");

	// Loop over items within the container and output the length and URI.
	foreach (IListBlobItem item in container.ListBlobs(null, false))
	{
		if (item.GetType() == typeof(CloudBlockBlob))
		{
			CloudBlockBlob blob = (CloudBlockBlob)item;

			Console.WriteLine("Block blob of length {0}: {1}", blob.Properties.Length, blob.Uri);
                                        
		}
		else if (item.GetType() == typeof(CloudPageBlob))
		{
			CloudPageBlob pageBlob = (CloudPageBlob)item;

			Console.WriteLine("Page blob of length {0}: {1}", pageBlob.Properties.Length, pageBlob.Uri);

		}
		else if (item.GetType() == typeof(CloudBlobDirectory))
		{
			CloudBlobDirectory directory = (CloudBlobDirectory)item;
			
			Console.WriteLine("Directory: {0}", directory.Uri);
		}
	}

As shown above, the blob service has the concept of directories within containers, as
well. This is so that you can organize your blobs in a more folder-like
structure. For example, consider the following set of block blobs in a container
named `photos`:

	photo1.jpg
	2010/architecture/description.txt
	2010/architecture/photo3.jpg
	2010/architecture/photo4.jpg
	2011/architecture/photo5.jpg
	2011/architecture/photo6.jpg
	2011/architecture/description.txt
	2011/photo7.jpg

When you call **ListBlobs** on the 'photos' container (as in the above sample), the collection returned
will contain **CloudBlobDirectory** and **CloudBlockBlob** objects
representing the directories and blobs contained at the top level. Here would be the resulting output:

	Directory: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2010/
	Directory: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2011/
	Block blob of length 505623: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/photo1.jpg


Optionally, you can set the **UseFlatBlobListing** parameter of of the **ListBlobs** method to 
**true**. This would result in every blob being returned as a **CloudBlockBlob**
, regardless of directory.  Here would be the call to **ListBlobs**:

    // Loop over items within the container and output the length and URI.
	foreach (IListBlobItem item in container.ListBlobs(null, true))
	{
	   ...
	}

and here would be the results:

	Block blob of length 4: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2010/architecture/description.txt
	Block blob of length 314618: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2010/architecture/photo3.jpg
	Block blob of length 522713: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2010/architecture/photo4.jpg
	Block blob of length 4: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2011/architecture/description.txt
	Block blob of length 419048: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2011/architecture/photo5.jpg
	Block blob of length 506388: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2011/architecture/photo6.jpg
	Block blob of length 399751: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2011/photo7.jpg
	Block blob of length 505623: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/photo1.jpg

## <a name="download-blobs"> </a><span  class="short-header">How to: Download blobs</span>

To download blobs, first retrieve a blob reference and then call the **DownloadToStream** method. The following
example uses the **DownloadToStream** method to transfer the blob
contents to a stream object that you can then persist to a local file.

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the blob client.
    CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();

    // Retrieve reference to a previously created container.
    CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("mycontainer");

    // Retrieve reference to a blob named "photo1.jpg".
    CloudBlockBlob blockBlob = container.GetBlockBlobReference("photo1.jpg");

    // Save blob contents to a file.
    using (var fileStream = System.IO.File.OpenWrite(@"path\myfile"))
    {
        blockBlob.DownloadToStream(fileStream);
    } 

You can also use the **DownloadToStream** method to download the contents of a blob as a text string.

	// Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the blob client.
    CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();

    // Retrieve reference to a previously created container.
    CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("mycontainer");

	// Retrieve reference to a blob named "myblob.txt"
	CloudBlockBlob blockBlob2 = container.GetBlockBlobReference("myblob.txt");

	string text;
	using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
	{
		blockBlob2.DownloadToStream(memoryStream);
		text = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(memoryStream.ToArray());
	}

##<a name="delete-blobs"> </a><span  class="short-header">How to: Delete blobs</span>

To delete a blob, first get a blob reference and then call the
**Delete** method on it.

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the blob client.
    CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();

    // Retrieve reference to a previously created container.
    CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("mycontainer");

    // Retrieve reference to a blob named "myblob.txt".
    CloudBlockBlob blockBlob = container.GetBlockBlobReference("myblob.txt");

    // Delete the blob.
    blockBlob.Delete(); 


##<a name="list-blobs-async"> </a><span  class="short-header">How to: List blobs in pages asynchronously</span> 

If you are listing a large number of blobs, or you want to control the number of results you return in one listing operation, you can list blobs in pages of results. This example shows how to return results in pages asynchronously, so that execution is not blocked while waiting to return a large set of results.

This example shows a flat blob listing, but you can also perform a hierarchical listing, by setting the `useFlatBlobListing` parameter of the **ListBlobsSegmentedAsync** method to `false`.

Because the sample method calls an asynchronous method, it must be prefaced with the `async` keyword, and it must return a **Task** object. The await keyword specified for the **ListBlobsSegmentedAsync** method suspends execution of the sample method until the listing task completes.

    async public static Task ListBlobsSegmentedInFlatListing()
    {
        // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
        CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
            CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

        // Create the blob client.
        CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();

        // Retrieve reference to a previously created container.
        CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("myblobs");

        //List blobs in pages.
        Console.WriteLine("List blobs in pages:");

        //List blobs with a paging size of 10, for the purposes of the example. 
		//The first call does not include the continuation token.
        BlobResultSegment resultSegment = await container.ListBlobsSegmentedAsync(
                "", true, BlobListingDetails.All, 10, null, null, null);

        //Enumerate the result segment returned.
        int i = 0;
        if (resultSegment.Results.Count<IListBlobItem>() > 0) { Console.WriteLine("Page {0}:", ++i); }
        foreach (var blobItem in resultSegment.Results)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("\t{0}", blobItem.StorageUri.PrimaryUri);
        }
        Console.WriteLine();

        //Get the continuation token, if there are additional pages of results.
        BlobContinuationToken continuationToken = resultSegment.ContinuationToken;

        //Check whether there are more results and list them in pages of 10 while a continuation token is returned.
        while (continuationToken != null)
        {
            //This overload allows control of the page size. 
			//You can return all remaining results by passing null for the maxResults parameter, 
            //or by calling a different overload.
            resultSegment = await container.ListBlobsSegmentedAsync(
					"", true, BlobListingDetails.All, 10, continuationToken, null, null);
            if (resultSegment.Results.Count<IListBlobItem>() > 0) { Console.WriteLine("Page {0}:", ++i); }
            foreach (var blobItem in resultSegment.Results)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("\t{0}", blobItem.StorageUri.PrimaryUri);
            }
            Console.WriteLine();

            //Get the next continuation token.
            continuationToken = resultSegment.ContinuationToken;
        }
    }
