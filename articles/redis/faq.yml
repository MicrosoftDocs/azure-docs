          What are the Redis licensing changes?
        answer: |
          The Redis open-source project changed to a dual-license model, with support for the Redis Source Available License version 2 (RSALv2) or Server-Side Public License version 1 (SSPLv1). For more information, see the [Redis press release](https://aka.ms/redis/licensingchangepressrelease). Also see the [Microsoft blog post](https://aka.ms/redis/licensechangeblog) on the Redis licensing change.

        answer: |
          No, Azure Cache for Redis and Azure Managed Redis are offered to customers under the Microsoft terms of service. The RSALv2 and SSPLv1 licenses don't apply to Azure Cache for Redis or Azure Managed Redis. 

      - question: |
          Do I need to do anything in response to the Redis licensing change?
        answer: |
          No. No action is required for Azure Managed Redis or Azure Cache for Redis customers as a result of this change.

      - question: |
          Will Azure Redis instances continue to receive patches and bug fixes?
        answer: |
          Yes. All Azure Managed Redis and Azure Cache for Redis tiers will continue to receive Redis patches and bug fixes.
