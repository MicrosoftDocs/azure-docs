Azure Cache for Redis limits and sizes are different for each pricing tier. To see the pricing tiers and their associated sizes, see [Azure Cache for Redis pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cache/).

For more information on Azure Cache for Redis configuration limits, see [Default Redis server configuration](../cache-configure.md#default-redis-server-configuration).

Because configuration and management of Azure Cache for Redis instances is done by Microsoft, not all Redis commands are supported in Azure Cache for Redis. For more information, see [Redis commands not supported in Azure Cache for Redis](../cache-configure.md#redis-commands-not-supported-in-azure-cache-for-redis).
