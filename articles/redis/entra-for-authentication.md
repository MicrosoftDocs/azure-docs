# Use Microsoft Entra for cache authentication with Azure Managed Redis

Azure Managed Redis offers two methods to [authenticate](configure.md#authentication) to your cache instance: access keys and Microsoft Entra. Azure Managed Redis cache use managed identity by default. When you create a new cache, managed identity is enabled.

Although access key authentication is simple, it comes with a set of challenges around security and password management. For contrast, in this article, you learn how to use a Microsoft Entra token for cache authentication.

Azure Managed Redis offers a password-free authentication mechanism by integrating with [Microsoft Entra](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). The Entra ID configured to connect with Azure Managed Redis is assigned the same permissions as when using Access Keys.

In this article, you learn how to use your service principal or managed identity to connect to your Redis instance.

## Prerequisites and limitations

- Microsoft Entra authentication is supported for SSL connections only.
- Some Redis commands are blocked. For a full list of blocked commands, see [Redis commands not supported in Azure Managed Redis](best-practices-client-libraries.md#blocked-commands).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After a connection is established by using a Microsoft Entra token, client applications must periodically refresh the Microsoft Entra token before expiry. Then the apps must send an `AUTH` command to the Redis server to avoid disrupting connections. For more information, see [Configure your Redis client to use Microsoft Entra](#configure-your-redis-client-to-use-microsoft-entra).

## Disable access key authentication on your cache

Using Microsoft Entra is the secure way to connect your cache. We recommend that you use Microsoft Entra and disable access keys.

When you disable access key authentication for a Redis instance, all existing client connections are terminated, whether they use access keys or Microsoft Entra authentication. Follow the recommended Redis client best practices to implement proper retry mechanisms for reconnecting Microsoft Entra-based connections, if any.

Before you disable access keys:

- Microsoft Entra authentication must be enabled.

- For geo-replicated caches, you must:
   1. Unlink the caches.
   1. Disable access keys.
   1. Relink the caches.

If you have a cache where you want to disable access keys, follow this procedure:

1. In the Azure portal, select the Azure Managed Redis instance where you want to disable access keys.

1. On the **Resource** menu, select **Authentication**.

1. On the working pane, select **Access keys**.

1. Select the **Access Keys Authentication** control to disable access keys.

1. Confirm that you want to update your configuration by selecting **Yes**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When the **Disable Access Keys Authentication** setting is changed for a cache, all existing client connections, using access keys or Microsoft Entra, are terminated. Follow the best practices to implement proper retry mechanisms for reconnecting Microsoft Entra-based connections. For more information, see [Connection resilience](best-practices-connection.md).

## Configure your Redis client to use Microsoft Entra

Because most Azure Managed Redis clients assume that a password and access key are used for authentication, you likely need to update your client workflow to support authentication by using Microsoft Entra. In this section, you learn how to configure your client applications to connect to Azure Managed Redis by using a Microsoft Entra token.

### Add users or System principal to your cache

1. Connect to your cache in the Azure portal

1. On the Resource menu, select **Authentication**.

1. On the **Microsoft Entra Authentication** tab, select **User or service principal** and then **+ Select member**.

1. Type the name of the user who you want to run the program. Select the user to add in the list and **Select**. The user is added to the list of Redis users.

### Microsoft Entra client workflow

1. Configure your client application to acquire a Microsoft Entra token for scope, `https://redis.azure.com/.default`, or `acca5fbb-b7e4-4009-81f1-37e38fd66d78/.default`, by using the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview).

1. Update your Redis connection logic to use the following `User` and `Password`:

   - `User` = Object ID of your managed identity or service principal
   - `Password` = Microsoft Entra token that you acquired by using MSAL

1. Ensure that your client executes a Redis [AUTH command](https://redis.io/commands/auth/) automatically before your Microsoft Entra token expires by using:

   - `User` = Object ID of your managed identity or service principal
   - `Password` = Microsoft Entra token refreshed periodically

### Client library support

The library [`Microsoft.Azure.StackExchangeRedis`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.StackExchangeRedis) is an extension of `StackExchange.Redis` that enables you to use Microsoft Entra to authenticate connections from a Redis client application to an Azure Managed Redis. The extension manages the authentication token, including proactively refreshing tokens before they expire to maintain persistent Redis connections over multiple days.

[This code sample](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft.Azure.StackExchangeRedis) demonstrates how to use the `Microsoft.Azure.StackExchangeRedis` NuGet package to connect to your Azure Managed Redis instance by using Microsoft Entra.

The following table includes links to code samples. They demonstrate how to connect to your Azure Managed Redis instance by using a Microsoft Entra token. Various client libraries are included in multiple languages.

### Best practices for Microsoft Entra authentication

- Configure private links or firewall rules to protect your cache from a denial of service attack.
- Ensure that your client application sends a new Microsoft Entra token at least three minutes before token expiry to avoid connection disruption.
- When you call the Redis server `AUTH` command periodically, consider adding a jitter so that the `AUTH` commands are staggered. In this way, your Redis server doesn't receive too many `AUTH` commands at the same time.
