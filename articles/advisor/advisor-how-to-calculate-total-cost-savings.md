# Calculate total cost savings

To calculate aggregated potential yearly savings, follow these steps: 

1. Sign in to the [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Search for and select [**Advisor**](https://aka.ms/azureadvisordashboard) from any page./
The Advisor **Overview** page opens.

1. Export cost recommendations by navigating to the **Cost** tab on the left navigation menu and choosing **Download as CSV**.

1. Use the cost savings amount for each recommendation to calculate aggregated potential yearly savings.

> [!NOTE]
> Recommendations show savings individually, and may overlap with the savings shown in other recommendations, for example – you can only benefit from savings plans or reservations for virtual machines, but not from both.
