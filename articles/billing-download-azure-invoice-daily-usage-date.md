# How to download your Azure billing invoice and daily usage data

As the Azure Account Administrator, you can view the current bill at the Azure Account Center and download statements for the previous six billing periods as well. Here’s how:

1. Sign into the [Usage and Billing Portal](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions) using your Microsoft Account ID, Work Account ID or School Account ID.
2. Select the subscription for which you want the invoice and usage information.
3. Select **BILLING HISTORY**. </br>![billinghistory](./Media/Billinghisotry.png)

5. Select **View Current Statement** to see an estimate of your charges at the time the estimate was generated. This information is only updated daily and may not include all of your usage. Your monthly bill may differ from this estimate.</br>![billingsum2](./Media/billingSum2.png)</br>![billingsum3](./Media/billingSum3.png)</br>
