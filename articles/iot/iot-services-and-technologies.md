# Choose an Azure IoT service

Azure IoT services and technologies provide you with options to create a wide variety of IoT solutions that enable digital transformation for your organization. This article describes Azure IoT services and technologies such as:

- Azure IoT Operations
- Azure Device Registry
- Azure IoT Operations SDKs
- Azure IoT Hub
- Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service
- Azure Device Update for IoT Hub
- Azure IoT Edge
- Azure Digital Twins
- Azure IoT Central
- Azure Event Grid
- Azure IoT device and service SDKs
- Azure IoT Plug and Play
- Microsoft Defender for IoT

## Choose a solution type

The [What is Azure IoT?](iot-introduction.md) article describes two broad categories of IoT solutions:

- In a *cloud-based IoT solution*, your IoT devices connect directly to the cloud where their messages are processed and analyzed.
- In an *edge-based IoT solution*, your IoT assets connect to an edge environment that processes their messages before forwarding them to the cloud for storage and analysis.

*Hybrid IoT solutions* are also possible that combine both cloud and edge components.

Your choice of solution type determines which Azure IoT services and technologies you can use. For example, to build an edge-based solution you typically use Azure IoT Operations, for a cloud-based solution you typically use Azure IoT Hub.

The later sections describe the role of the various Azure IoT services and technologies in cloud-based, edge-based, and hybrid solutions.

## Adaptive cloud approach

Another way to categorize IoT solutions is by whether they adopt the [adaptive cloud](/azure/adaptive-cloud/) approach. The adaptive cloud approach unifies siloed teams, distributed sites, and disparate systems into a single operations, security, application, and data model. This approach enables you to use the same cloud and AI technologies to manage and monitor edge-based, cloud-based, and hybrid IoT solutions.

An example of how Azure IoT Operations uses the adaptive cloud approach is its use of [Azure Arc-enabled services](/azure/azure-arc/) to manage and monitor edge-based resources such as assets and data flows. These edge-based resources are exposed in your Azure portal as individual cloud-based resources that you can manage and monitor with standard Azure tools.

In contrast, the devices and routing definitions in IoT Hub aren't exposed as individual resources in your Azure portal but are part of the IoT Hub resource. The only way to manage and monitor these resources is through IoT Hub.

## Azure IoT Operations

> Use Azure IoT Operations to build an **edge-based IoT solution** that follows the adaptive cloud approach.

Azure IoT Operations is a unified data plane for the edge. It's a collection of modular, scalable, and highly available data services that run on Azure Arc-enabled edge Kubernetes clusters such as AKS Edge Essentials. It enables data capture from various different systems and integrates with data modeling applications such as Microsoft Fabric to help organizations deploy the industrial metaverse.

To learn more, see [What is Azure IoT Operations?](../iot-operations/overview-iot-operations.md).

### Azure Device Registry

> Currently, Azure Device Registry is typically part of an **edge-based IoT solution** that uses Azure IoT Operations and follows the adaptive cloud approach.

Azure Device Registry is a backend service that enables the management of assets and devices in your solution using Azure Resource Manager. Azure Device Registry:

 - Projects assets and devices, such as OPC servers and video cameras defined in your edge environment, as Azure resources in the cloud.
 - Manages the synchronization of asset and device definitions between the cloud and the edge.
 - Provides a single unified registry for any apps and services that need to interact with your assets and devices. 
 - Stores schemas for asset and device messages.

To learn more, see [What is asset management in Azure IoT Operations](../iot-operations/discover-manage-assets/overview-manage-assets.md).

### Azure IoT Operations SDKs (preview)

> The Azure IoT Operations SDKs enable you to build a custom **edge-based IoT solution** that uses Azure IoT Operations.

The Azure IoT Operations SDKs are a suite of tools and libraries across multiple languages designed to aid the development of applications for Azure IoT Operations. The SDKs can be used to build secure, highly available applications at the edge, that interact with Azure IoT Operations to perform operations such as asset discovery, protocol translation and data transformation.

## Azure IoT Hub

> Use Azure IoT Hub to build a **cloud-based IoT solution**. IoT Hub does not follow the adaptive cloud approach.

Azure IoT Hub is a managed service hosted in the cloud that acts as a central message hub for communication between an IoT application and its attached devices. Several messaging patterns are supported, including device-to-cloud messages, uploading files from devices, and request-reply methods to control your devices from the cloud. IoT Hub can route messages from devices to other cloud services for storage, analysis, or processing. IoT Hub also supports monitoring to help you track device creation, device connections, and device failures.

To learn more, see [What is Azure IoT Hub?](../iot-hub/iot-concepts-and-iot-hub.md).

### Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS)

> DPS is typically part of a **cloud-based IoT solution** that uses IoT Hub or IoT Central.

DPS is a helper service for IoT Hub that enables zero-touch, just-in-time provisioning of IoT devices to an IoT hub without requiring human intervention. Many of the manual steps traditionally involved in provisioning are automated with DPS to reduce the time to deploy IoT devices and lower the risk of manual error. DPS can provision devices that use X.509 certificates and trusted platform modules. IoT Central applications use an internal DPS instance to manage device connections.

To learn more, see [What is Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service?](../iot-dps/about-iot-dps.md).

### Azure Device Update for IoT Hub

> Device Update for IoT Hub is typically part of a **cloud-based IoT solution** that uses IoT Hub.

Azure Device Update for IoT Hub is a service that enables you to deploy over-the-air updates for your IoT devices, including Azure IoT Edge devices. Device Update offers optimized update deployment and streamlined operations through integration with Azure IoT Hub, making it easy to adopt on any existing IoT Hub-based solution.
