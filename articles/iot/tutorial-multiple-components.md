#Customer intent: As a device builder, I want to see a working IoT Plug and Play device sample connecting to IoT Hub and using multiple components to send properties and telemetry, and responding to commands. As a solution builder, I want to use a tool to view the properties, commands, and telemetry an IoT Plug and Play device reports to the IoT hub it connects to.
