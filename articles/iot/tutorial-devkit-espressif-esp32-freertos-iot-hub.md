# Tutorial: Connect an ESPRESSIF ESP32-Azure IoT Kit to IoT Hub

In this tutorial, you use the Azure IoT middleware for FreeRTOS to connect the ESPRESSIF ESP32-Azure IoT Kit (from now on, the ESP32 DevKit) to Azure IoT.

You complete the following tasks:

* Install a set of embedded development tools for programming an ESP32 DevKit
* Build an image and flash it onto the ESP32 DevKit
* Use Azure CLI to create and manage an Azure IoT hub that the ESP32 DevKit connects to
* Use Azure IoT Explorer to register a device with your IoT hub, view device properties, view device telemetry, and call direct commands on the device

## Prerequisites

* A PC running Windows 10 or Windows 11
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning the repository
* Hardware
    * ESPRESSIF [ESP32-Azure IoT Kit](https://www.espressif.com/products/devkits/esp32-azure-kit/overview)

1. Select <kbd>Q</kbd> to quit the configuration menu.


### Build and flash the image
In this section, you use the ESP-IDF tools to build, flash, and monitor the ESP32 DevKit as it connects to Azure IoT.  

> [!NOTE]
> In the following commands in this section, use a short build output path near your root directory. Specify the build path after the `-B` parameter in each command that requires it. The short path helps to avoid a current issue in the ESPRESSIF ESP-IDF tools that can cause errors with long build path names.  The following commands use a local path *C:\espbuild* as an example.

To build the image:
1. In **ESP-IDF 5.0 CMD**, from the *iot-middleware-freertos-samples\demos\projects\ESPRESSIF\aziotkit* directory, run the following command to build the image.

    ```shell
    idf.py --no-ccache -B "C:\espbuild" build 
    ```

1. After the build completes, confirm that the binary image file was created in the build path that you specified previously.

    *C:\espbuild\azure_iot_freertos_esp32.bin*

To flash the image:
1. On the ESP32 DevKit, locate the Micro USB port, which is highlighted in the following image:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-devkit-espressif-esp32-iot-hub/esp-azure-iot-kit.png" alt-text="Photo of the ESP32-Azure IoT Kit board.":::

1. Connect the Micro USB cable to the Micro USB port on the ESP32 DevKit, and then connect it to your computer.
1. Open Windows **Device Manager**, and view **Ports** to find out which COM port the ESP32 DevKit is connected to.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-devkit-espressif-esp32-iot-hub/esp-device-manager.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Windows Device Manager displaying COM port for a connected device.":::

1. In **ESP-IDF 5.0 CMD**, run the following command, replacing the *\<Your-COM-port\>* placeholder and brackets with the correct COM port from the previous step. For example, replace the placeholder with `COM3`. 

    ```shell
    idf.py --no-ccache -B "C:\espbuild" -p <Your-COM-port> flash
    ```

1. Confirm that the output completes with the following text for a successful flash:

    ```output
    Hash of data verified
    
    Leaving...
    Hard resetting via RTS pin...
    Done
    ```

To confirm that the device connects to Azure IoT Central:
1. In **ESP-IDF 5.0 CMD**, run the following command to start the monitoring tool. As you did in a previous command, replace the \<Your-COM-port\> placeholder, and brackets with the COM port that the device is connected to.

    ```shell
    idf.py -B "C:\espbuild" -p <Your-COM-port> monitor
    ```

1. Check for repeating blocks of output similar to the following example. This output confirms that the device connects to Azure IoT and sends telemetry.

    ```output
    I (50807) AZ IOT: Successfully sent telemetry message
    I (50807) AZ IOT: Attempt to receive publish message from IoT Hub.
    
    I (51057) MQTT: Packet received. ReceivedBytes=2.
    I (51057) MQTT: Ack packet deserialized with result: MQTTSuccess.
    I (51057) MQTT: State record updated. New state=MQTTPublishDone.
    I (51067) AZ IOT: Puback received for packet id: 0x00000008
    I (53067) AZ IOT: Keeping Connection Idle...
    ```

## View device properties

You can use Azure IoT Explorer to view and manage the properties of your devices. In the following sections, you use the Plug and Play capabilities that are visible in IoT Explorer to manage and interact with the ESP32 DevKit. These capabilities rely on the device model published for the ESP32 DevKit in the public model repository. You configured IoT Explorer to search this repository for device models earlier in this tutorial. In many cases, you can perform the same action without using plug and play by selecting IoT Explorer menu options. However, using plug and play often provides an enhanced experience. IoT Explorer can read the device model specified by a plug and play device and present information specific to that device.  

To access IoT Plug and Play components for the device in IoT Explorer:

1. From the home view in IoT Explorer, select **IoT hubs**, then select **View devices in this hub**.
1. Select your device.
1. Select **IoT Plug and Play components**.
1. Select **Default component**. IoT Explorer displays the IoT Plug and Play components that are implemented on your device.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-devkit-espressif-esp32-iot-hub/iot-explorer-default-component-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the device's default component in IoT Explorer.":::

1. On the **Interface** tab, view the JSON content in the device model **Description**. The JSON contains configuration details for each of the IoT Plug and Play components in the device model.

    Each tab in IoT Explorer corresponds to one of the IoT Plug and Play components in the device model.

    | Tab | Type | Name | Description |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | **Interface** | Interface | `Espressif ESP32 Azure IoT Kit` | Example device model for the ESP32 DevKit |
    | **Properties (writable)** | Property | `telemetryFrequencySecs` | The interval that the device sends telemetry |
    | **Commands** | Command | `ToggleLed1` | Turn the LED on or off |
    | **Commands** | Command | `ToggleLed2` | Turn the LED on or off |
    | **Commands** | Command | `DisplayText` | Displays sent text on the device screen |

To view and edit device properties using Azure IoT Explorer:

1. Select the **Properties (writable)** tab. It displays the interval that telemetry is sent.
1. Change the `telemetryFrequencySecs` value to *5*, and then select **Update desired value**. Your device now uses this interval to send telemetry.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-devkit-espressif-esp32-iot-hub/iot-explorer-set-telemetry-interval.png" alt-text="Screenshot of setting telemetry interval on the device in IoT Explorer.":::

1. IoT Explorer responds with a notification. 
 
To use Azure CLI to view device properties:

1. Run the [az iot hub device-twin show](/cli/azure/iot/hub/device-twin#az-iot-hub-device-twin-show) command.

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub device-twin show --device-id mydevice --hub-name {YourIoTHubName}
    ```

1. Inspect the properties for your device in the console output.

> [!TIP]
> You can also use Azure IoT Explorer to view device properties. In the left navigation select **Device twin**. 

## View telemetry

With Azure IoT Explorer, you can view the flow of telemetry from your device to the cloud. Optionally, you can do the same task using Azure CLI.

To view telemetry in Azure IoT Explorer:

1. From the **IoT Plug and Play components** (Default Component) pane for your device in IoT Explorer, select the **Telemetry** tab. Confirm that **Use built-in event hub** is set to *Yes*.
1. Select **Start**.
1. View the telemetry as the device sends messages to the cloud.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-devkit-espressif-esp32-iot-hub/iot-explorer-device-telemetry.png" alt-text="Screenshot of device telemetry in IoT Explorer.":::

1. Select the **Show modeled events** checkbox to view the events in the data format specified by the device model.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-devkit-espressif-esp32-iot-hub/iot-explorer-show-modeled-events.png" alt-text="Screenshot of modeled telemetry events in IoT Explorer.":::

1. Select **Stop** to end receiving events.

To use Azure CLI to view device telemetry:

1. Run the [az iot hub monitor-events](/cli/azure/iot/hub#az-iot-hub-monitor-events) command. Use the names that you created previously in Azure IoT for your device and IoT hub.

    ```azurecli
    az iot hub monitor-events --device-id mydevice --hub-name {YourIoTHubName}
    ```

1. View the JSON output in the console.

    ```json
    {
        "event": {
            "origin": "mydevice",
            "module": "",
            "interface": "dtmi:azureiot:devkit:freertos:Esp32AzureIotKit;1",
            "component": "",
            "payload": "{\"temperature\":28.6,\"humidity\":25.1,\"light\":116.66,\"pressure\":-33.69,\"altitude\":8764.9,\"magnetometerX\":1627,\"magnetometerY\":28373,\"magnetometerZ\":4232,\"pitch\":6,\"roll\":0,\"accelerometerX\":-1,\"accelerometerY\":0,\"accelerometerZ\":9}"
        }
    }
    ```

1. Select CTRL+C to end monitoring.


## Call a direct method on the device

You can also use Azure IoT Explorer to call a direct method that you implemented on your device. Direct methods have a name, and can optionally have a JSON payload, configurable connection, and method timeout. In this section, you call a method that turns an LED on or off. Optionally, you can do the same task using Azure CLI.

To call a method in Azure IoT Explorer:

1. From the **IoT Plug and Play components** (Default Component) pane for your device in IoT Explorer, select the **Commands** tab.
1. For the **ToggleLed1** command, select **Send command**. The LED on the ESP32 DevKit toggles on or off. You should also see a notification in IoT Explorer. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-devkit-espressif-esp32-iot-hub/iot-explorer-invoke-method.png" alt-text="Screenshot of calling a method in IoT Explorer.":::

1. For the **DisplayText** command, enter some text in the **content** field. 
1. Select **Send command**. The text displays on the ESP32 DevKit screen. 


To use Azure CLI to call a method:

1. Run the [az iot hub invoke-device-method](/cli/azure/iot/hub#az-iot-hub-invoke-device-method) command, and specify the method name and payload. For this method, setting `method-payload` to `true` means the LED toggles to the opposite of its current state. 


    ```azurecli
    az iot hub invoke-device-method --device-id mydevice --method-name ToggleLed2 --method-payload true --hub-name {YourIoTHubName}
    ```

    The CLI console shows the status of your method call on the device, where `200` indicates success.

    ```json
    {
      "payload": {},
      "status": 200
    } 
    ```

1. Check your device to confirm the LED state.
