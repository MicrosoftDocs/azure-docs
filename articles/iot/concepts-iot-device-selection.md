# IoT device selection list

This IoT device selection list aims to give partners a starting point with IoT hardware to build prototypes and proof-of-concepts quickly and easily.[^1]

All boards listed support users of all experience levels.

>[!NOTE]
>This table is not intended to be an exhaustive list or for bringing solutions to production. [^2] [^3]

**Security advisory:** Except for the Azure Sphere, it's recommended to keep these devices behind a router and/or firewall.

[^1]: *If you're new to hardware programming, for MCU dev work we recommend using VS Code Arduino Extension or VS Code Platform IO Extension. For SBC dev work, you program the device like you would a laptop, that is, on the device itself. The Raspberry Pi supports VS Code development.*

[^2]: *Devices in the availability of support resources, common boards used for prototyping and PoCs, and boards that support beginner-friendly IDEs like Arduino IDE and VS Code extensions; for example, Arduino Extension and Platform IO extension. For simplicity, we aimed to keep the total device list <6. Other teams and individuals may have chosen to feature different boards based on their interpretation of the criteria.*

[^3]: *For bringing devices to production, you likely want to test a PoC with a specific chipset, ST's STM32 or Microchip's Pic-IoT breakout board series, design a custom board that can be manufactured for lower cost than the MCUs and SBCs listed here, or even explore FPGA-based dev kits. You may also want to use a development environment for professional electrical engineering like STM32CubeMX or ARM mBed browser-based programmer.*

### How to use this document

Use this document to better understand IoT terminology, device selection considerations, and to choose an IoT device for prototyping or building a proof-of-concept. We recommend the following procedure:

1. Read through the 'what to consider when choosing a board' section to identify needs and constraints.

2. Use the Application Selection Visual to identify possible options for your IoT scenario.

3. Using the MCU or SBC Device Lists, check device specifications and compare against your needs/constraints.

### What to consider when choosing a board

To choose a device for your IoT prototype, see the following criteria:

- **Microcontroller unit (MCU) or single board computer (SBC)**
  - An MCU is preferred for single tasks, like gathering and uploading sensor data or machine learning at the edge. MCUs also tend to be lower cost.
  - An SBC is preferred when you need multiple different tasks, like gathering sensor data and controlling another device. It may also be preferred in the early stages when there are many options for possible solutions - an SBC enables you to try lots of different approaches.

- **Processing power**

  - **Memory**: Consider how much memory storage (in bytes), file storage, and memory to run programs your project needs.

  - **Clock speed**: Consider how quickly your programs need to run or how quickly you need the device to communicate with the IoT server.

  - **End-of-life**: Consider if you need a device with the most up-to-date features and documentation or if you can use a discontinued device as a prototype.

- **Power consumption**

  - **Power**: Consider how much voltage and current the board consumes. Determine if wall power is readily available or if you need a battery for your application.

  - **Connection**: Consider the physical connection to the power source. If you need battery power, check if there's a battery connection port available on the board. If there's no battery connector, seek another comparable board, or consider other ways to add battery power to your device.

- **Inputs and outputs**
  - **Ports and pins**: Consider how many and of what types of ports and I/O pins your project may require.
        * Other considerations include if your device will be communicating with other sensors or devices. If so, identify how many ports those signals require.

  - **Protocols**: If you're working with other sensors or devices, consider what hardware communication protocols are required.
        * For example, you may need CAN, UART, SPI, I2C, or other communication protocols.
  - **Power**: Consider if your device will be powering other components like sensors. If your device is powering other components, identify the voltage, and current output of the device's available power pins and determine what voltage/current your other components need.

  - **Types**: Determine if you need to communicate with analog components. If you are in need of analog components, identify how many analog I/O pins your project needs.

  - **Peripherals**: Consider if you prefer a device with onboard sensors or other features like a screen, microphone, etc.

- **Development**

  - **Programming language**: Consider if your project requires higher-level languages beyond C/C++. If so, identify the common programming languages for the application you need (for example, Machine Learning is often done in Python). Think about what SDKs, APIs, and/or libraries are helpful or necessary for your project. Identify what programming language(s) these are supported in.

  - **IDE**: Consider the development environments that the device supports and if this meets the needs, skill set, and/or preferences of your developers.

  - **Community**: Consider how much assistance you want/need in building a solution. For example, consider if you prefer to start with sample code, if you want troubleshooting advice or assistance, or if you would benefit from an active community that generates new samples and updates documentation.
  
  - **Documentation**: Take a look at the device documentation. Identify if it's complete and easy to follow. Consider if you need schematics, samples, datasheets, or other types of documentation. If so, do some searching to see if those items are available for your project. Consider the software SDKs/APIs/libraries that are written for the board and if these items would make your prototyping process easier. Identify if this documentation is maintained and who the maintainers are.

- **Security**

  - **Networking**: Consider if your device is connected to an external  network or if it can be kept behind a router and/or firewall. If your prototype needs to be connected to an externally facing network, we  recommend using the Azure Sphere as it is the only reliably secure device.

  - **Peripherals**: Consider if any of the peripherals your device connects to have wireless protocols (for example, WiFi, BLE).

  - **Physical location**: Consider if your device or any of the peripherals it's connected to will be accessible to the public. If so, we recommend making the device physically inaccessible. For example, in a closed, locked box.

| MPU | Microprocessor unit; a computer processor that incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. |
| ML | Machine learning; special computer programs that do complex pattern recognition |

### Machine learning hardware requirements

#### Vision ML

- Speed: 200 MHz
