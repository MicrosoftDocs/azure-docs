# What are the Azure IoT support and help options?

## Create an Azure support request

Explore the range of [Azure support options and choose the plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans) that best fits, whether you're a developer just starting your cloud journey or a large organization deploying business-critical, strategic applications. Azure customers can create and manage support requests in the Azure portal.

* [Azure portal for the United States government](https://portal.azure.us)
