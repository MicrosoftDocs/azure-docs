# Tutorial: Use Eclipse ThreadX to connect an MXCHIP AZ3166 devkit to IoT Hub

[![Browse code](media/common/browse-code.svg)](https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/getting-started/tree/master/MXChip/AZ3166)

In this tutorial, you use Eclipse ThreadX to connect an MXCHIP AZ3166 IoT DevKit (from now on, MXCHIP DevKit) to Azure IoT.

You complete the following tasks:

* Install a set of embedded development tools for programming the MXChip DevKit in C
* Build an image and flash it onto the MXCHIP DevKit
* Use Azure CLI to create and manage an Azure IoT hub that the MXCHIP DevKit securely connects to
* Use Azure IoT Explorer to register a device with your IoT hub, view device properties, view device telemetry, and call direct commands on the device

## Prerequisites

* A PC running Windows 10 or Windows 11
* An active Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning the repository
* Azure CLI. You have two options for running Azure CLI commands in this tutorial:
    * Use the Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive shell that runs CLI commands in your browser. This option is recommended because you don't need to install anything. If you're using Cloud Shell for the first time, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Follow the steps in [Cloud Shell quickstart](../cloud-shell/quickstart.md) to **Start Cloud Shell** and **Select the Bash environment**.
    * Optionally, run Azure CLI on your local machine. If Azure CLI is already installed, run `az upgrade` to upgrade the CLI and extensions to the current version. To install Azure CLI, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
* Hardware

    * The [MXCHIP AZ3166 IoT DevKit](https://www.seeedstudio.com/AZ3166-IOT-Developer-Kit.html) (MXCHIP DevKit)
    * Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz
    * USB 2.0 A male to Micro USB male cable

## Prepare the development environment

To set up your development environment, first you clone a GitHub repo that contains all the assets you need for the tutorial. Then you install a set of programming tools.

### Clone the repo

Clone the following repo to download all sample device code, setup scripts, and offline versions of the documentation. If you previously cloned this repo in another tutorial, you don't need to do it again.

To clone the repo, run the following command:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/getting-started.git
```

### Install the tools

The cloned repo contains a setup script that installs and configures the required tools. If you installed these tools in another embedded device tutorial, you don't need to do it again.

> [!NOTE]
> The setup script installs the following tools:
> * [CMake](https://cmake.org): Build
> * [ARM GCC](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm): Compile
> * [Termite](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm): Monitor serial port output for connected devices
resources

To install the tools:

1. Navigate to the following path in the repo and run the setup script named *get-toolchain.bat*:

    *getting-started\tools\get-toolchain.bat*

1. Open a new console window to recognize the configuration changes made by the setup script. Use this console to complete the remaining programming tasks in the tutorial. You can use Windows CMD, PowerShell, or Git Bash for Windows.
1. Run the following code to confirm that CMake version 3.14 or later is installed.

   ```shell
   cmake --version
   ```

[!INCLUDE [iot-develop-create-cloud-components](../../includes/iot-develop-create-cloud-components.md)]

## Prepare the device

To connect the MXCHIP DevKit to Azure, you modify a configuration file for Wi-Fi and Azure IoT settings, rebuild the image, and flash the image to the device.

### Add configuration

1. Open the following file in a text editor:

    *getting-started\MXChip\AZ3166\app\azure_config.h*

1. Comment out the following line near the top of the file as shown:

   ```c
   // #define ENABLE_DPS
   ```

1. Set the Wi-Fi constants to the following values from your local environment.

    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    |`WIFI_SSID` |{*Your Wi-Fi SSID*}|
    |`WIFI_PASSWORD` |{*Your Wi-Fi password*}|
    |`WIFI_MODE` |{*One of the enumerated Wi-Fi mode values in the file*}|

1. Set the Azure IoT device information constants to the values that you saved after you created Azure resources.

    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    | `IOT_HUB_HOSTNAME` | {*Your host name value*} |
    | `IOT_HUB_DEVICE_ID` | {*Your Device ID value*} |
    | `IOT_DEVICE_SAS_KEY` | {*Your Primary key value*} |

1. Save and close the file.

### Build the image

1. In your console or in File Explorer, run the script *rebuild.bat* at the following path to build the image:

    *getting-started\MXChip\AZ3166\tools\rebuild.bat*

2. After the build completes, confirm that the binary file was created in the following path:

    *getting-started\MXChip\AZ3166\build\app\mxchip_azure_iot.bin*

### Flash the image

1. On the MXCHIP DevKit, locate the **Reset** button, and the Micro USB port. You use these components in the following steps. Both are highlighted in the following picture:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/mxchip-iot-devkit.png" alt-text="Locate key components on the MXChip devkit board":::

1. Connect the Micro USB cable to the Micro USB port on the MXCHIP DevKit, and then connect it to your computer.
1. In File Explorer, find the binary file that you created in the previous section.
1. Copy the binary file *mxchip_azure_iot.bin*.
1. In File Explorer, find the MXCHIP DevKit device connected to your computer. The device appears as a drive on your system with the drive label **AZ3166**.
1. Paste the binary file into the root folder of the MXCHIP Devkit. Flashing starts automatically and completes in a few seconds.

    > [!NOTE]
    > During the flashing process, a green LED toggles on MXCHIP DevKit.

### Confirm device connection details

You can use the **Termite** app to monitor communication and confirm that your device is set up correctly.

1. Start **Termite**.
    > [!TIP]
    > If you are unable to connect Termite to your devkit, install the [ST-LINK driver](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html) and try again. See  [Troubleshooting](./troubleshoot-embedded-device-tutorials.md) for additional steps.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. In the **Serial port settings** dialog, check the following settings and update if needed:
    * **Baud rate**: 115,200
    * **Port**: The port that your MXCHIP DevKit is connected to. If there are multiple port options in the dropdown, you can find the correct port to use. Open Windows **Device Manager**, and view **Ports** to identify which port to use.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/termite-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of serial port settings in the Termite app":::

1. Select OK.
1. Press the **Reset** button on the device. The button is labeled on the device and located near the Micro USB connector.

Keep Termite open to monitor device output in the following steps.

## View device properties

You can use Azure IoT Explorer to view and manage the properties of your devices. In this section and the following sections, you use the Plug and Play capabilities that surfaced in IoT Explorer to manage and interact with the MXCHIP DevKit. These capabilities rely on the device model published for the MXCHIP DevKit in the public model repository. You configured IoT Explorer to search this repository for device models earlier in this tutorial. You can perform many actions without using plug and play by selecting the action from the left side menu of your device pane in IoT Explorer. However, using plug and play often provides an enhanced experience. IoT Explorer can read the device model specified by a plug and play device and present information specific to that device.

To access IoT Plug and Play components for the device in IoT Explorer:

1. From the home view in IoT Explorer, select **IoT hubs**, then select **View devices in this hub**.
1. Select your device.
1. Select **IoT Plug and Play components**.
1. Select **Default component**. IoT Explorer displays the IoT Plug and Play components that are implemented on your device.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/iot-explorer-default-component-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of MXCHIP DevKit default component in IoT Explorer":::

1. On the **Interface** tab, view the JSON content in the device model **Description**. The JSON contains configuration details for each of the IoT Plug and Play components in the device model.

    Each tab in IoT Explorer corresponds to one of the IoT Plug and Play components in the device model.

    | Tab | Type | Name | Description |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | **Interface** | Interface | `MXCHIP Getting Started Guide` | Example model for the MXCHIP DevKit |
    | **Properties (read-only)** | Property | `ledState` | The current state of the LED |
    | **Properties (writable)** | Property | `telemetryInterval` | The interval that the device sends telemetry |
    | **Commands** | Command | `setLedState` | Turn the LED on or off |

To view device properties using Azure IoT Explorer:

1. Select the **Properties (writable)** tab. It displays the interval that telemetry is sent.
1. Change the `telemetryInterval` to *5*, and then select **Update desired value**. Your device now uses this interval to send telemetry.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/iot-explorer-set-telemetry-interval.png" alt-text="Screenshot of setting telemetry interval on MXCHIP DevKit in IoT Explorer":::

1. IoT Explorer responds with a notification. You can also observe the update in Termite.
1. Set the telemetry interval back to 10.

To use Azure CLI to view device properties:

1. Run the [az iot hub device-twin show](/cli/azure/iot/hub/device-twin#az-iot-hub-device-twin-show) command.

   ```azurecli
   az iot hub device-twin show --device-id mydevice --hub-name {YourIoTHubName}
   ```

1. Inspect the properties for your device in the console output.

## View telemetry

With Azure IoT Explorer, you can view the flow of telemetry from your device to the cloud. Optionally, you can do the same task using Azure CLI.

To view telemetry in Azure IoT Explorer:

1. From the **IoT Plug and Play components** (Default Component) pane for your device in IoT Explorer, select the **Telemetry** tab. Confirm that **Use built-in event hub** is set to *Yes*.
1. Select **Start**.
1. View the telemetry as the device sends messages to the cloud.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/iot-explorer-device-telemetry.png" alt-text="Screenshot of device telemetry in IoT Explorer":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also monitor telemetry from the device by using the Termite app.

1. Select the **Show modeled events** checkbox to view the events in the data format specified by the device model.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/iot-explorer-show-modeled-events.png" alt-text="Screenshot of modeled telemetry events in IoT Explorer":::

1. Select **Stop** to end receiving events.

To use Azure CLI to view device telemetry:

1. Run the [az iot hub monitor-events](/cli/azure/iot/hub#az-iot-hub-monitor-events) command. Use the names that you created previously in Azure IoT for your device and IoT hub.

   ```azurecli
    az iot hub monitor-events --device-id mydevice --hub-name {YourIoTHubName}
   ```

1. View the JSON output in the console.

   ```json
    {
        "event": {
            "origin": "mydevice",
            "module": "",
            "interface": "dtmi:eclipsethreadx:devkit:gsgmxchip;1",
            "component": "",
            "payload": "{\"humidity\":41.21,\"temperature\":31.37,\"pressure\":1005.18}"
        }
    }
   ```

1. Select CTRL+C to end monitoring.

## Call a direct method on the device

You can also use Azure IoT Explorer to call a direct method that you implemented on your device. Direct methods have a name, and can optionally have a JSON payload, configurable connection, and method timeout. In this section, you call a method that turns an LED on or off. Optionally, you can do the same task using Azure CLI.

To call a method in Azure IoT Explorer:

1. From the **IoT Plug and Play components** (Default Component) pane for your device in IoT Explorer, select the **Commands** tab.
1. For the **setLedState** command, set the **state** to **true**.
1. Select **Send command**. You should see a notification in IoT Explorer, and the yellow User LED light on the device should turn on.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-devkit-mxchip-az3166-iot-hub/iot-explorer-invoke-method.png" alt-text="Screenshot of calling the setLedState method in IoT Explorer":::

1. Set the **state** to  **false**, and then select **Send command**. The yellow User LED should turn off.
1. Optionally, you can view the output in Termite to monitor the status of the methods.

To use Azure CLI to call a method:

1. Run the [az iot hub invoke-device-method](/cli/azure/iot/hub#az-iot-hub-invoke-device-method) command, and specify the method name and payload. For this method, setting `method-payload` to `true` turns on the LED, and setting it to `false` turns it off.

   ```azurecli
   az iot hub invoke-device-method --device-id mydevice --method-name setLedState --method-payload true --hub-name {YourIoTHubName}
   ```

   The CLI console shows the status of your method call on the device, where `204` indicates success.

   ```json
   {
     "payload": {},
     "status": 200
   }
   ```

1. Check your device to confirm the LED state.

1. View the Termite terminal to confirm the output messages:

   ```output
    Receive direct method: setLedState
        Payload: true
    LED is turned ON
    Device twin property sent: {"ledState":true}
   ```

## Troubleshoot and debug
