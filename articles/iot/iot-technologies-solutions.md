# The collection of PaaS/SaaS technologies and solutions available for building an Azure IoT solution

Article provides an overview of the available PaaS/SaaS technologies and solutions, then provides detail on the two paths available for building your own solution:
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): build your own application using IoT Suite, PCS, and all Technologies
- Software as a Service (SaaS): leverage another application to build a solution, for instance, IoT Central solutions

## Solutions

Microsoft has built a portfolio that supports the needs of all customers, enabling everyone to access the benefits of digital transformation.

### Microsoft IoT Central (SaaS)

Microsoft IoT Central is a fully managed SaaS solution, which allows you to get started quickly with minimal IoT experience. If your business is pursuing speed over customization, SaaS models could be the perfect fit for your IoT implementation needs. 

Organizations with fewer device models, more predictable scenarios, and limited IoT/IT capabilities can now reap the benefits of IoT through a SaaS approach. Businesses that previously lacked the time, money, and expertise to develop connected products, can now get started quickly with Microsoft IoT Central. Microsoft is leading the industry in providing a mature SaaS solution that addresses common IoT implementation requirements. 

- Fully managed IoT SaaS
- No cloud solution development expertise required
- Configurable to your needs
- Ideal for straightforward IoT needs

### Azure IoT Suite (PaaS)

Azure IoT Suite is a customizable PaaS solution, providing a high level of control over your IoT solution. If your business is implementing IoT for connected operations, or has specific customization requirements for connected products, Azure IoT Suite provides the control you need. 

Organizations with a large number of devices or device models, and manufacturers seeking connected factory solutions, are examples of companies that can benefit from IoT Suite. Creating highly customizable solutions tailored to complex needs, IoT Suite solutions provide:

- Preconfigured solutions
    - Remote monitoring
    - Connected factory
    - Predictive maintenance
    - Device simulation
- Ability to deploy in minutes
- Accelerated time to value
- Solutions that give ultimate control

## Technologies (PaaS)

PaaS technologies that span the Azure platform.
