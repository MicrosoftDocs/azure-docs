title: Send device telemetry to Azure IoT Hub tutorial
description: This tutorial shows device developers how to connect a device securely to Azure IoT Hub. You use an Azure IoT device SDK for C, C#, Python, Node.js, or Java, to build a device client for Windows, Linux, or Raspberry Pi (Raspbian). Then you connect and send telemetry.

#Customer intent: As a device application developer, I want to learn the basic workflow of using an Azure IoT device SDK to build a client app on a device, connect the device securely to Azure IoT Hub, and send telemetry.

## Clean up resources
If you no longer need the Azure resources created in this tutorial, you can use the Azure CLI to delete them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deleting a resource group is irreversible. The resource group and all the resources contained in it are permanently deleted. Make sure that you do not accidentally delete the wrong resource group or resources.

To delete a resource group by name:
1. Run the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command. This command removes the resource group, the IoT Hub, and the device registration you created.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group delete --name MyResourceGroup
    ```
1. Run the [az group list](/cli/azure/group#az-group-list) command to confirm the resource group is deleted.  

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group list
    ```

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned a basic Azure IoT application workflow for securely connecting a device to the cloud and sending device-to-cloud telemetry. You used Azure CLI to create an Azure IoT hub and a device instance. Then you used an Azure IoT device SDK to create a temperature controller, connect it to the hub, and send telemetry. You also used Azure CLI to monitor telemetry.

As a next step, explore the following articles to learn more about building device solutions with Azure IoT.
