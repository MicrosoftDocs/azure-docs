# Comparison between Azure Front Door and Azure CDN services

Azure Front Door and Azure CDN are both Azure services that offer global content delivery with intelligent routing and caching capabilities at the application layer. Both services can be used to optimize and accelerate your applications by providing a globally distributed network of points of presence (POP) close to your users. Both services also offer various features to help you secure your applications from malicious attacks and to help you monitor your application's health and performance.

> - Starting August 15, 2025, Azure Front Door (classic) and Azure CDN from Microsoft (classic) will no longer support new domain onboarding or profile creation. Migrate to [AFD Standard and Premium](/azure/frontdoor/tier-migration) to create new domains or profiles and avoid service disruption. [Learn more](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=498522)
> - Starting August 15, 2025, Azure Front Door (classic) and Azure CDN from Microsoft (classic) will [no longer support Managed certificates](/azure/security/fundamentals/managed-tls-changes). To avoid service disruption, either switch to Bring Your Own Certificate (BYOC) or migrate to [AFD Standard and Premium](/azure/frontdoor/tier-migration) by August 15, 2025. Existing managed certificates will be auto renewed before August 15, 2025, and remain valid until April 14, 2026.  [Learn more](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=498522)

> [!NOTE]
> To switch between tiers:
> - From Azure Front Door (classic) to the Standard or Premium tier: use the [**migration capability**](migrate-tier.md).
> - From CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic) to the Standard or Premium tier: use the [**migration capability**](../cdn/migrate-tier.md).
> - From Azure Front Door Standard to Premium: use the [**upgrade capability**](tier-upgrade.md).
> - From Azure Front Door Premium to Standard: No seamless downgrade tool exists. You can recreate the profile instead.
