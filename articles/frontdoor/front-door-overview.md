# What is Azure Front Door?

Whether you're delivering content and files or developing global applications and APIs, Azure Front Door enhances your user experience by providing higher availability, reduced latency, increased scalability, and improved security, no matter where your users are located. 

Azure Front Door is Microsoft's advanced cloud Content Delivery Network (CDN) designed to provide fast, reliable, and secure access to your applications' static and dynamic web content globally. By using Microsoft's extensive global edge network, Azure Front Door ensures efficient content delivery through numerous [global and local points of presence (PoPs)](edge-locations-by-region.md) strategically positioned close to both enterprise and consumer end users.

## Key Benefits

### Global delivery scale using Microsoft’s network

Scale out and improve performance of your applications and content using Microsoft’s global Cloud CDN and WAN.

* Uses over [118 edge locations](edge-locations-by-region.md) across 100 metro cities connected to Azure using a private enterprise-grade WAN and improve latency for apps by up to three times.

* Accelerate application performance by using Front Door’s [anycast](front-door-traffic-acceleration.md#select-the-front-door-edge-location-for-the-request-anycast) network and [split TCP](front-door-traffic-acceleration.md#connect-to-the-front-door-edge-location-split-tcp) connections.

* Terminate SSL offload at the edge and use integrated [certificate management](standard-premium/how-to-configure-https-custom-domain.md).

* Natively support end-to-end IPv6 connectivity and the HTTP/2 protocol.

### Deliver modern apps and architectures

Modernize your internet first applications on Azure with Cloud Native experiences

* Integrate with DevOps friendly command line tools across SDKs of different languages, Bicep, ARM templates, CLI, and PowerShell.

* Define your own [custom domain](standard-premium/how-to-add-custom-domain.md) with flexible domain validation.

* Load balance and route traffic across [origins](origin.md) and use intelligent [health probe](health-probes.md) monitoring across apps or content hosted in Azure or anywhere.

* Integrate with other Azure services such as DNS, Web Apps, Storage, and many more for domain and origin management.

* Move your routing business logic to the edge with [enhanced rules engine](front-door-rules-engine.md) capabilities including regular expressions and server variables.

* Analyze [built-in reports](standard-premium/how-to-reports.md) with an all-in-one dashboard for both Front Door and security patterns.

### Simple and cost-effective

* Unified static and dynamic delivery offered in a single tier to accelerate and scale your application through caching, SSL offload, and layer 3-4 DDoS protection.
