# Tutorial: Add Security Headers with Rules Engine

[!INCLUDE [Azure Front Door (classic) retirement notice](../../includes/front-door-classic-retirement.md)]

This tutorial demonstrates how to implement security headers to prevent browser-based vulnerabilities such as HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy, and X-Frame-Options. Security attributes can also be defined with cookies.

The example below shows how to add a Content-Security-Policy header to all incoming requests that match the path defined in the route associated with your Rules Engine configuration. In this scenario, only scripts from the trusted site **https://apiphany.portal.azure-api.net** are allowed to run on the application.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription.
* An Azure Front Door. To complete this tutorial, you must have an Azure Front Door configured with Rules Engine. For more information, see [Quickstart: Create an Azure Front Door](quickstart-create-front-door.md) and [Configure your Rules Engine](front-door-tutorial-rules-engine.md).

## Add a Content-Security-Policy header in Azure portal

1. In your Azure Front Door resource, go to **Settings** and select **Rules engine configuration**. Choose the rules engine where you want to add the security header.

2. Click **Add rule** to create a new rule. Name the rule and then select **Add an Action** > **Response Header**.

3. Set the Operator to **Append** to add this header to all incoming requests for this route.

4. Enter the header name: *Content-Security-Policy* and specify the values for this header. In this example, use *`script-src 'self' https://apiphany.portal.azure-api.net`*. Click **Save**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Header values are limited to 640 characters.

5. After adding the rules, associate your Rules engine configuration with the Route Rule of your chosen route. This step is necessary for the rule to take effect.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In this example, no [match conditions](front-door-rules-engine-match-conditions.md) were added to the rule. The rule will apply to all incoming requests that match the path defined in the Route Rule. To apply it to a subset of requests, add specific **match conditions** to the rule.

## Clean up resources

If you no longer need the security header rule configured in the previous steps, you can remove it. To do this, go to the rules engine in your Azure Front Door resource and select **Delete rule**.
