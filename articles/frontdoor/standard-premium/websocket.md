# Azure Front Door WebSocket (preview)

Azure Front Door supports WebSocket on both Standard and Premium tiers without requiring any extra configurations. WebSocket, standardized in [RFC6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455), is a TCP-based protocol that facilitates full-duplex communication between a server and a client over a long-running TCP connection. It eliminates the need for polling as required in HTTP and avoids some of the overhead of HTTP. It can reuse the same TCP connection for multiple requests or responses, resulting in a more efficient utilization of resources. This enables more interactive and real-time scenarios.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Front Door websocket is currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

WebSocket is ideal for applications needing real-time updates or continuous data streams, such as chat apps, dashboards, financial updates, GPS, online education, live streaming, and gaming. For instance, a trading website can use WebSocket to push and update pricing data in real-time.

## Use WebSocket on Azure Front Door

When using WebSocket on Azure Front Door, consider the following:

- Once a connection is upgraded to WebSocket, Azure Front Door transmits data between clients and the origin server without performing any inspections or manipulations during the established connection.
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) inspections are applied during the WebSocket establishment phase. After the connection is established, the WAF doesn't perform further inspections.
- Health probes to origins are conducted using the HTTP protocol.
- Disable caching for WebSocket routes. For routes with caching enabled, Azure Front Door doesn't forward the WebSocket Upgrade header to the origin and treats it as an HTTP request, disregarding cache rules. This results in a failed WebSocket upgrade request.
- The idle timeout is 5 minutes. If Azure Front Door doesn't detect any data transmission from the origin or the client within the past 5 minutes, the connection is considered idle and is closed.
- Currently, WebSocket connections on Azure Front Door remain open for no longer than 4 hours. The WebSocket connection can be dropped due to underlying server upgrades or other maintenance activities. We highly recommend you implement retry logic in your application.

## How the WebSocket protocol works

WebSocket protocols use port 80 for standard WebSocket connections and port 443 for WebSocket connections over TLS/SSL. As a stateful protocol, the connection between clients and the server remains active until terminated by either party. WebSocket connections begin as an HTTP Upgrade request with the `ws:` or `wss:` scheme. These connections are established by upgrading an HTTP request/response using the `Connection: Upgrade`, `Upgrade: websocket`, `Sec-WebSocket-Key`, and `Sec-WebSocket-Version` headers, as shown in the request header examples.

The handshake from the client looks as follows:

```
    GET /chat HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    Upgrade: websocket
    Connection: Upgrade
    Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
    Origin: http://example.com
    Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat
    Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
```

The server responds with a `101 Switching Protocols` status code to indicate that it's switching to the WebSocket protocol as requested by the client. The response includes the `Connection: Upgrade` and `Upgrade: websocket` headers, confirming the protocol switch. The `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` header is returned to validate that the connection was successfully upgraded.

The handshake from the server looks as follows:

```
    HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
    Upgrade: websocket
    Connection: Upgrade
    Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
    Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat
```

After the client receives the server response, the WebSocket connection is open to start transmitting data. If the WebSocket connection gets disconnected by the client or server, or by a network disruption, the client application is expected to reinitiate the connection with the server.
