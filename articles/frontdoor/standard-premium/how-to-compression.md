# Improve performance by compressing files in Azure Front Door

File compression is an effective method to improve file transfer speed and increase page-load performance. The server compresses the file to reduce its size before sending it. File compression can reduce bandwidth costs and provide a better experience for your users.

There are two ways to enable file compression:

- Enabling compression on your origin server. Azure Front Door passes along the compressed files and delivers them to clients that request them.
- Enabling compression directly on the Azure Front Door POP servers (*compression on the fly*). In this case, Azure Front Door compresses the files and sends them to the end users.

> [!NOTE]
> Range requests may be compressed into different sizes. Azure Front Door requires the `Content-Length` response header values to be the same for any GET HTTP request. If clients send byte range requests with the `Accept-Encoding` header that leads to the origin responding with different content lengths, then Azure Front Door returns a 503 error. You can either disable compression on the origin/Azure Front Door, or create a Rules Engine rule to remove the `Accept-Encoding` header from byte range requests.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Front Door configuration changes takes up to 10 mins to propagate throughout the network. If you're setting up compression for the first time for your CDN endpoint, consider waiting 1-2 hours before you troubleshoot to ensure the compression settings have propagated to all the POPs.

## Enabling compression

> [!NOTE]
> In Azure Front Door, compression is part of **Enable Caching** in Route. Only when you **Enable Caching**, can you take advantage of compression in Azure Front Door.

You can enable compression in the following ways:
* During quick create - When you enable caching, you can enable compression.
* During custom, create - Enable caching and compression when you're adding a route. 
* In Front Door manager.
* On the Optimization page.

### Enable compression in Front Door manager

1. From the Azure Front Door Standard/Premium profile page, go to **Front Door manager** and select the endpoint you want to enable compression.

1. Within the endpoint, select the **route** you want to enable compression on.
  

1. Ensure **Enable caching** is checked, then select the checkbox for **Enable compression**.

1. Select **Update** to save the configuration.

### Enable compression in Optimizations

1. From the Azure Front Door Standard/Premium profile page, go to **Optimizations** under Settings. Expand the endpoint to see the list of routes. 

1. Select the three dots next to the **route** that has compression *Disabled*. Then select **Configure route**.

1. Ensure **Enable caching** is checked, then select the checkbox for **Enable compression**.

1. Select **Update**.

## Modify compression content type

You can modify the default list of MIME types on Optimizations page.

1. From the Azure Front Door Standard/Premium profile page, go to **Optimizations** under Settings. Then select the **route** that has compression *Enabled*.

1. Select the three dots next to the **route** that has compression *Enabled*. Then select **View Compressed file types**.


1. Delete default formats or select **Add** to add new content types.

1. Select **Save** to update the compression configuration.

## Disabling compression

You can disable compression in the following ways:
* Disable compression in Azure Front Door manager route.
* Disable compression in Optimizations page.

### Disable compression in Azure Front Door manager

1. From the Azure Front Door Standard/Premium profile page, go to **Front Door manager** under Settings.

1. Select the **route** you want to disable compression on. Uncheck the **Enable compression** box.

1. Select **Update** to save the configuration.

### Disable compression in Optimizations

1. From the Azure Front Door Standard/Premium profile page, go to **Optimizations** under Settings. Then select the **route** that has compression *Enabled*.

1. Select the three dots next to the **route** that has compression *Enabled*, then select *Configure route*.

1. Uncheck the **Enable compression** box.

1. Select **Update** to save the configuration.

## Compression rules

In Azure Front Door, only eligible files are compressed. To be eligible for compression, a file must:
* Be of a MIME type 
* Be larger than 1 KB
* Be smaller than 8 MB

These profiles support the following compression encodings:
* gzip (GNU zip)
* brotli 

If the request supports more than one compression type, brotli compression takes precedence.

When a request for an asset specifies gzip compression and the request results in a cache miss, Azure Front Door does gzip compression of the asset directly on the POP server. Afterward, the compressed file is served  from the cache.

If the origin uses Chunked Transfer Encoding (CTE) to send data to the Azure Front Door POP, then compression isn't supported.
