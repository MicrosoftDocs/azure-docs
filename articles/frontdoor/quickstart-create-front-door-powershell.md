# Quickstart: Create an Azure Front Door (classic)  using Azure PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [Azure Front Door (classic) retirement notice](../../includes/front-door-classic-retirement.md)]

Get started with Azure Front Door (classic) by using Azure PowerShell to create a highly available and high-performance global web application.

The Azure Front Door directs web traffic to specific resources in a backend pool. You defined the frontend domain, add resources to a backend pool, and create a routing rule. This article uses a simple configuration of one backend pool with two web app resources and a single routing rule using default path matching "/*".

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Azure PowerShell installed locally or Azure Cloud Shell

## Create resource group

In Azure, you allocate related resources to a resource group. You can either use an existing resource group or create a new one.

Create a resource group with [New-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup):

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroupFD -Location centralus
```

## Create two instances of a web app

This quickstart requires two instances of a web application that run in different Azure regions. Both the web application instances run in Active/Active mode, so either one can take traffic. This configuration differs from an Active/Stand-By configuration, where one acts as a failover.

If you don't already have a web app, use the following script to set up two example web apps.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Create first web app in Central US region.
$webapp1 = New-AzWebApp `
-Name "WebAppContoso-1" `
-Location centralus `
-ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupFD `
-AppServicePlan myAppServicePlanCentralUS

# Create second web app in South Central US region.
$webapp2 = New-AzWebApp `
-Name "WebAppContoso-2" `
-Location southcentralus `
-ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupFD `
-AppServicePlan myAppServicePlanEastUS
```

## Create a Front Door

This section details how you can create and configure the following components of the Front Door:
    
* A frontend object contains the Front Door default domain.
* A backend pool is a set of equivalent backends to which Front Door load balances your client request.
* A routing rule maps your frontend host and matching URL path pattern to a specific backend pool.

### Create a frontend object

The frontend object configures the hostname for the Front Door. By default the hostname will have a suffix of **.azurefd.net*.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Create a unique name
$fdname = "contoso-frontend-$(Get-Random)"

#Create the frontend object
$FrontendEndObject = New-AzFrontDoorFrontendEndpointObject `
-Name "frontendEndpoint1" `
-HostName $fdname".azurefd.net"
```

### Create the backend pool

The backend pool consists of the two web app created at the beginning of this quickstart. The health probe and load balancing settings defined in this step uses default values.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Create backend objects that points to the hostname of the web apps
$backendObject1 = New-AzFrontDoorBackendObject `
-Address $webapp1.DefaultHostName
$backendObject2 = New-AzFrontDoorBackendObject `
-Address $webapp2.DefaultHostName

# Create a health probe object
$HealthProbeObject = New-AzFrontDoorHealthProbeSettingObject `
-Name "HealthProbeSetting"

# Create the load balancing setting object
$LoadBalancingSettingObject = New-AzFrontDoorLoadBalancingSettingObject `
-Name "Loadbalancingsetting" `
-SampleSize "4" `
-SuccessfulSamplesRequired "2" `
-AdditionalLatencyInMilliseconds "0"

# Create a backend pool using the backend objects, health probe, and load balancing settings
$BackendPoolObject = New-AzFrontDoorBackendPoolObject `
-Name "myBackendPool" `
-FrontDoorName $fdname `
-ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupFD `
-Backend $backendObject1,$backendObject2 `
-HealthProbeSettingsName "HealthProbeSetting" `
-LoadBalancingSettingsName "Loadbalancingsetting"
```

### Create a routing rule

The routing rule maps the backend pool to the frontend domain and sets the default path matching value to "/*".

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Create a routing rule mapping the frontend host to the backend pool
$RoutingRuleObject = New-AzFrontDoorRoutingRuleObject `
-Name LocationRule `
-FrontDoorName $fdname `
-ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupFD `
-FrontendEndpointName "frontendEndpoint1" `
-BackendPoolName "myBackendPool" `
-PatternToMatch "/*"
```
### Create the Front Door

Now that you've created the necessary objects, create the Front Door:

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Creates the Front Door
New-AzFrontDoor `
-Name $fdname `
-ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupFD `
-RoutingRule $RoutingRuleObject `
-BackendPool $BackendPoolObject `
-FrontendEndpoint $FrontendEndObject `
-LoadBalancingSetting $LoadBalancingSettingObject `
-HealthProbeSetting $HealthProbeObject
```

Once the deployment is successful, you can test it by following the steps in the next section.

## Test the Front Door

Run the following commands to obtain the hostname for the Front Door.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Gets Front Door in resource group and output the hostname of the frontend domain.
$fd = Get-AzFrontDoor -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupFD
$fd.FrontendEndpoints[0].Hostname
```

Open a web browser and enter the hostname obtain from the commands. Azure Front Door directs your request to one of the backend resources.

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the resources that you created with the Front Door, delete the resource group. When you delete the resource group, you also delete the Front Door and all its related resources. 

To delete the resource group, call the `Remove-AzResourceGroup` cmdlet:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroupFD
```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a:
* Front Door
* Two web apps

To learn how to add a custom domain to your Front Door, continue to the Front Door tutorials.
