# Edit your CloudSimple portal profile

In the [CloudSimple portal](access-cloudsimple-portal), select **My profile** from the user menu in the upper right corner of the portal, and click **Edit Profile**.

You can change any of the profile settings except your email address (which identifies your account) and your user role. Contact your CloudSimple administrator if you have any questions about these. 

Click the **Email Alerts** toggle to enable or disable receiving alert notifications by email. This action disables the alerts only for this user. This setting does not affect the global email notification settings configured by the Global Admin.

Click **Submit** after making changes.
