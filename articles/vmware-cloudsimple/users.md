# View the list of CloudSimple portal users

Users are added to the user list when they first access the CloudSimple portal. To view the list of users who have access to the CloudSimple portal through Azure, [access the CloudSimple portal](access-cloudsimple-portal.md), select **Account** on the side menu, and then select **Users** in the CloudSimple portal.

* To display the user details, including the Azure subscription, tenant, and user IDs, click an entry on the **Users** page.

* To view an audit log of activity for a user, select the **Audit log** tab.
* To lock or unlock a user account, click the **Locked** toggle when displaying the user details. When the account is unlocked, the user can access the CloudSimple portal. When the account is locked, access to the portal is blocked.
