      - question: |
          What is Azure VMware Solution by CloudSimple?
        answer: |
          Azure VMware Solution by CloudSimple transforms and extends VMware workloads to private, dedicated clouds on Azure in minutes. CloudSimple takes care of provisioning, managing the infrastructure, and orchestrating workloads between on-premises and Azure. Because your apps run exactly the same on-premises and in Azure, you benefit from the elasticity and services of the cloud without the complexity of rearchitecting your apps. CloudSimple lowers your total cost of ownership with a cloud consumption model that provides on-demand provisioning, pay-as-you-grow, and capacity optimization.  See [What is VMware Solution on Azure by CloudSimple](cloudsimple-vmware-solutions-overview.md) for features, benefits and scenarios.
          
      - question: |
          What is a CloudSimple Private Cloud?
        answer: |
          A CloudSimple Private Cloud is a private, dedicated cloud that consists of a high-performance compute, storage, and networking environment deployed on Microsoft Azure infrastructure (hardware and datacenter space) in Azure locations.  A Private Cloud provides a native VMware 'platform as a service'. In VMware terms, each Private Cloud contains exactly one instance of the vCenter Server. The vCenter Server manages multiple ESXi nodes contained in one or more vSphere Clusters, along with the corresponding Virtual SAN (vSAN) storage. A CloudSimple service can contain multiple Private Clouds in your Azure subscription.  For more details, see [Private Cloud overview](cloudsimple-private-cloud.md).
