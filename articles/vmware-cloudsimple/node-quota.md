# CloudSimple node quota limits

Four nodes is the default quantity available for purchase when your subscription is enabled for the CloudSimple service.  You can purchase any [node type](cloudsimple-node.md) from the Azure portal.  At least three nodes of the same SKU are required to create a Private Cloud.  If you've purchased the nodes, you may see an error when you try to purchase additional nodes.

## Quota increase

You can increase the node quota by submitting a support request. The service operations team will evaluate the request, and work with you to increase node quota.  Select the following options when you open a new ticket:

* Issue type: **Technical**
* Subscription: **Your subscription ID**
* Service type: **VMware Solution by CloudSimple**
* Problem type: **Dedicated Nodes quota**
* Problem subtype: **Increase quota of dedicated nodes**
* Subject: **Quota increase**

In the details of the support ticket, provide the required number of nodes and node SKU.

* Node SKU
* Number of additional nodes for which you're requesting the quota increase
