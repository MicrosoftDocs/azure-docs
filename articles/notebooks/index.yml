title: Azure Notebooks Preview Documentation
summary: Azure Notebooks Preview is a free hosted service to develop and run Jupyter notebooks in the cloud with no installation. Jupyter (formerly IPython) is an open-source project that lets you easily combine markdown text, executable code (Python, R, and F#), persistent data, graphics, and visualizations onto a single, sharable canvas called a notebook.
