  description: Azure Notebooks is a free hosted service to develop and run Jupyter notebooks in the cloud with no installation. Jupyter (formerly IPython) is an open source project that lets you easily combine markdown text, executable code (Python, R, and F#), persistent data, graphics, and visualizations onto a single, sharable canvas called a notebook.
