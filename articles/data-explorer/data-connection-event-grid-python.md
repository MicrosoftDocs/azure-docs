# Create an Event Grid data connection for Azure Data Explorer by using Python

Azure Data Explorer is a fast and highly scalable data exploration service for log and telemetry data. Azure Data Explorer offers ingestion (data loading) from Event Hubs, IoT Hubs, and blobs written to blob containers. In this article, you create an Event Grid data connection for Azure Data Explorer by using Python.

## Prerequisites

1. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

1. [A test cluster and database](create-cluster-database-csharp.md)

1. [A test table and column mapping](python-ingest-data.md#create-a-table-on-your-cluster)

1. [Set database-level/table-level policies](database-table-policies-csharp.md) (Optional)

1. [A storage account with an Event Grid subscription](ingest-data-event-grid.md#create-an-event-grid-subscription-in-your-storage-account) for adding a EventGrid data connection. 

## Install Python package

To install the Python package for Azure Data Explorer (Kusto), open a command prompt that has Python in its path. Run this command:

```
pip install azure-common
pip install azure-mgmt-kusto
```
## Authentication
For running the examples in this article, we need an Azure AD Application and service principal that can access resources. Check [create an Azure AD application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) to create a free Azure AD Application and add role assignment at the subscription scope. It also shows how to get the `Directory (tenant) ID`, `Application ID`, and `Client Secret`.

## Add an Event Grid data connection
The following example shows how to add an Event Grid data connection programmatically. Check [Create an Event Grid data connection in Azure Data Explorer](ingest-data-event-grid.md#create-an-event-grid-data-connection-in-azure-data-explorer) for adding an Event Grid data connection through Azure portal.


```Python
from azure.mgmt.kusto import KustoManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.kusto.models import EventGridDataConnection
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

#Directory (tenant) ID
tenant_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
#Application ID
client_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
#Client Secret
client_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
subscription_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
        client_id=client_id,
        secret=client_secret,
        tenant=tenant_id
    )
kusto_management_client = KustoManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)

resource_group_name = "testrg";
#The cluster and database that are created as part of the Prerequisites
cluster_name = "mykustocluster";
database_name = "mykustodatabase";
data_connection_name = "myeventhubconnect";
#The event hub and storage account that are created as part of the Prerequisites
event_hub_resource_id = "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces/xxxxxx/eventhubs/xxxxxx"
storage_account_resource_id = "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/xxxxxx"
consumer_group = "$Default";
location = "Central US";
#The table and column mapping that are created as part of the Prerequisites
table_name = "StormEvents";
mapping_rule_name = "StormEvents_CSV_Mapping";
data_format = "csv";

#Returns an instance of LROPoller, check https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/msrest/msrest.polling.lropoller?view=azure-python
poller = kusto_management_client.data_connections.create_or_update(resource_group_name=resource_group_name, cluster_name=cluster_name, database_name=database_name, data_connection_name=data_connection_name,
                                            parameters=EventGridDataConnection(storage_account_resource_id=storage_account_resource_id, event_hub_resource_id=event_hub_resource_id, 
                                                                                consumer_group=consumer_group, table_name=table_name, location=location, mapping_rule_name=mapping_rule_name, data_format=data_format))
```
|**Setting** | **Suggested value** | **Field description**|
|---|---|---|
| tenant_id | *xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx* | The ID of your tenant, also known as Directory ID.|
| subscriptionId | *xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx* | The ID of the subscription you create resources with.|
| client_id | *xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx* | The Client ID of the application that can access resources in your tenant.|
| client_secret | *xxxxxxxxxxxxxx* | The Client Secret of the application that can access resources in your tenant. |
| resource_group_name | *testrg* | The name of the resource group containing your cluster.|
| cluster_name | *mykustocluster* | The name of your cluster.|
| database_name | *mykustodatabase* | The name of the target database in your cluster.|
| data_connection_name | *myeventhubconnect* | The desired name of your data connection.|
| table_name | *StormEvents* | The name of the target tableName in the target database.|

## Clean up resources
* To delete the data connection, Use the following command:

    ```python
    kusto_management_client.data_connections.delete(resource_group_name=resource_group_name, cluster_name=kusto_cluster_name, database_name=kusto_database_name, data_connection_name=kusto_data_connection_name)
    ```
