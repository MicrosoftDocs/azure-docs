# Create an IoT Hub data connection for Azure Data Explorer by using Python (Preview)

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [Portal](ingest-data-iot-hub.md)

In this article, you create an IoT Hub data connection for Azure Data Explorer by using Python. Azure Data Explorer is a fast and highly scalable data exploration service for log and telemetry data. Azure Data Explorer offers ingestion, or data loading, from Event Hubs, IoT Hubs, and blobs written to blob containers.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).

* [Python 3.4+](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

* [A cluster and database](create-cluster-database-python.md).

* [Table and column mapping](net-standard-ingest-data.md#create-a-table-on-your-test-cluster).

* [Database and table policies](database-table-policies-python.md) (optional).

* [An IoT Hub with a shared access policy configured](ingest-data-iot-hub.md#create-an-iot-hub).

## Add an IoT Hub data connection 

The following example shows you how to add an IoT Hub data connection programmatically. See [connect Azure Data Explorer table to IoT Hub](ingest-data-iot-hub.md#connect-azure-data-explorer-table-to-iot-hub) for adding an Iot Hub data connection using the Azure portal.

```Python
from azure.mgmt.kusto import KustoManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.kusto.models import IotHubDataConnection
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

#Directory (tenant) ID
tenant_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
#Application ID
client_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
#Client Secret
client_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
subscription_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
        client_id=client_id,
        secret=client_secret,
        tenant=tenant_id
    )
kusto_management_client = KustoManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)

resource_group_name = "testrg"
#The cluster and database that are created as part of the Prerequisites
cluster_name = "mykustocluster"
database_name = "mykustodatabase"
data_connection_name = "myeventhubconnect"
#The IoT hub that is created as part of the Prerequisites
iot_hub_resource_id = "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs/xxxxxx";
shared_access_policy_name = "iothubforread"
consumer_group = "$Default"
location = "Central US"
#The table and column mapping that are created as part of the Prerequisites
table_name = "StormEvents"
mapping_rule_name = "StormEvents_CSV_Mapping"
data_format = "csv"

#Returns an instance of LROPoller, check https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/msrest/msrest.polling.lropoller?view=azure-python
poller = kusto_management_client.data_connections.create_or_update(resource_group_name=resource_group_name, cluster_name=cluster_name, database_name=database_name, data_connection_name=data_connection_name,
                                            parameters=IotHubDataConnection(iot_hub_resource_id=iot_hub_resource_id, shared_access_policy_name=shared_access_policy_name, 
                                                                                consumer_group=consumer_group, table_name=table_name, location=location, mapping_rule_name=mapping_rule_name, data_format=data_format))
```
