# Network planning for Oracle Database@Azure
In this article, learn about network topologies and constraints in Oracle Database@Azure.
After you purchase an offer through Azure Marketplace and provision the Oracle Exadata infrastructure, the next step is to create your virtual machine cluster to host your instance of Oracle Exadata Database@Azure. The Oracle database clusters are connected to your Azure virtual network via a virtual network interface card (virtual NIC) from your delegated subnet (delegated to `Oracle.Database/networkAttachment`).  

## Network features

There are two types of network features: default and advance.

### Default network features
Default network features enable basic network connectivity for both new and existing Oracle Database@Azure deployments. These features are available across all supported Oracle Database@Azure regions and provide the foundational networking required for your deployment
### Advanced network features 
Advanced network features enhance the virtual networking experience, offering improved security, performance, and control—similar to standard Azure VMs. These features are generally available for new deployments in the following regions:

* Australia East
* Australia Southeast
* Brazil South
* Canada Central
* Central India
* Central US 
* East US 
* East US2
* France Central
* Germany North
* Germany West Central
* Italy North 
* Japan East
* Japan West
* North Europe
* South Central US
* Southeast Asia
* Spain Central
* Sweden Central
* UAE Central
* UAE North
* UK South 
* UK West
* US West
* US West 2
* US West 3 



> [!NOTE]
> Advanced network features are currently supported only for new Oracle Database@Azure deployments. 
> Existing virtual networks with previously created Oracle Database@Azure delegated subnets will not support these features at this time. Support for existing deployments is planned for later this year. 
> ### Registration required for delegated subnets
>To use advanced network features, use the following commands (via AZCLI) to register before creating a new delegated subnet  for the Oracle Database@Azure deployment.
>
> ```Register-AzProviderFeature  -FeatureName "EnableRotterdamSdnApplianceForOracle" -ProviderNamespace "Microsoft.Baremetal" ```
>
> ```Register-AzProviderFeature  -FeatureName "EnableRotterdamSdnApplianceForOracle" -ProviderNamespace "Microsoft.Network" ```

> [!NOTE]
> Registration state can be in the 'Registering' state for up to 60 minutes before changing to 'Registered'. Wait until the status is 'Registered' before continuing with the delegated subnet creation.

|Connectivity from an Oracle database cluster on Oracle Database@Azure nodes to Azure resources|Yes|Yes|

## Constraints

The following table describes required configurations of supported network features.

|Features |Default network features | Advanced network features |
| :------------------- | -------------------: | -------------------: |
|Delegated subnet per virtual network |1| 1|
|[Network security groups](../../virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview.md) on Oracle Database@Azure delegated subnets|No| Yes |
|[User-defined routes (UDRs)](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview.md#user-defined) on Oracle Database@Azure delegated subnets|Yes| Yes|
|Connectivity from an Oracle database cluster to a [private endpoint](../../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md) in the same virtual network on Azure-delegated subnets|No| Yes|
|Connectivity from an Oracle database cluster to a [private endpoint](../../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md) in a different spoke virtual network connected to a virtual WAN|Yes| Yes|
|NSG support on the Private link | No| Yes| 
| Connectivity to serverless Apps like Azure functions via private endpoints | No| Yes|
| Azure SLB and ILB support for Oracle database cluster traffic  | No | No |
|Dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6) virtual network|Only IPv4 is supported| Only IPv4 is supported|
| Service tags support| No | Yes | 
|Virtual network flow logs| No | Yes |

> [!NOTE]
> When using NSGs (Network Security Groups) on the Azure side, ensure that any security rules configured on the Oracle (OCI) side are reviewed to avoid conflicts. While applying security policies on both Azure and OCI can enhance the overall security posture, it also introduces additional complexity in terms of management and requires careful manual synchronization between the two environments. Misalignment between these policies could lead to unintended access issues or operational disruptions. 


 ### UDR requirements for routing traffic to Oracle Database@Azure
When routing traffic to Oracle Database@Azure through a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA)/firewall, the User-Defined Route (UDR) prefix **must be at least as specific as the subnet delegated to the Oracle Database@Azure instance**. Broader prefixes may cause traffic to be dropped.
 
 If the delegated subnet for your instance is x.x.x.x/27, configure the UDR on the Gateway Subnet as:  

 | Route Prefix | Routing Outcome |
 |--------------|-----------------|
 |x.x.x.x/27 | (same as the subnet) ✅ | 
 |x.x.x.x/32 |(more specific) ✅| 
 |x.x.x.x/24 | (too broad) ❌ |

#### Topology-specific guidance
**Hub-and-spoke topology**
- Define the UDR on the gateway subnet.
- Use a route prefix of `x.x.x.x/27` or more specific.
- Set the next hop to your NVA/Firewall.

**Virtual WAN (VWAN)**
- **With Routing Intent**:
  - Add the delegated subnet prefix (`x.x.x.x/27`) to the Routing Intent’s list of prefixes.

- **Without Routing Intent**:
  - Add a route to the VWAN's route table for `x.x.x.x/27` and point the next hop to the NVA/firewall.

> [!Note]
>   When **advanced network features are not enabled**, and for **traffic originating from the Oracle Database@Azure delegated subnet that needs   to traverse a gateway** (for example, to reach on-premises networks, AVS, other clouds, etc.), you must configure specific UDRs on the delegated subnet.  
>These UDRs should define the specific destination IP prefixes and set the next hop to the appropriate NVA/firewall in the hub.  
> Without these routes, outbound traffic may bypass required inspection paths or fail to reach the intended destination.

> [!Note]
> To access an Oracle Database@Azure instance from an on-premises network via a virtual network gateway (ExpressRoute or VPN) and firewall, configure the route table assigned to the virtual network gateway to include the /32 IPv4 address of the Oracle Database@Azure instance listed and point to the firewall as the next hop. Using an aggregate address space that includes the Oracle Database@Azure instance IP address doesn't forward the Oracle Database@Azure traffic to the firewall.

> [!Note]
> If you want to configure a route table (UDR route) to control the routing of packets through a network virtual appliance or firewall destined to an Oracle Database@Azure instance from a source in the same virtual network or a peered virtual network, the UDR prefix must be more specific or equal to the delegated subnet size of the Oracle Database@Azure. If the UDR prefix is less specific than the delegated subnet size, it isn't effective.
> 
> For example, if your delegated subnet is `x.x.x.x/24`, you must configure your UDR to `x.x.x.x/24` (equal) or `x.x.x.x/32` (more specific). If you configure the UDR route to be `x.x.x.x/16`, undefined behaviors such as asymmetric routing can cause a network drop at the firewall.

 

## FAQ 
### What are advanced network features? 
Advanced network features enhance your virtual networking experience by providing better security, performance, and control—similar to standard Azure virtual machines. With this feature, customers can use native VNet integrations like Network Security Groups (NSG), User-Defined Routes (UDR), Private Link, Global VNet Peering, and ExpressRoute FastPath without needing any workarounds. 
### Will advanced network features work for existing deployments? 
Not at the moment. Support for existing deployments is on our roadmap, and we’re actively working to enable it. Stay tuned for updates in the near future. 
### Do I need to self-register to enable advanced network features for new deployments? 
Yes. To take advantage of advanced network features for new deployments, you must complete a registration process. Run the registration commands before creating a new delegated subnet in your existing or new VNet for your Oracle Database@Azure deployments.
### How can I check if my deployment supports advanced network features? 
Currently, there’s no direct way to verify whether a VNet supports advanced network features. We recommend tracking your feature registration timeline and associating it with the VNets created afterward. You can also use the Activity Log blade under the VNet to review creation details—but note, logs are only available for the past 90 days by default.
