# Oracle Exadata Database on dedicated infrastructure logs on Azure for Enhanced Observability


In this article, you learn how to integrate Oracle Exadata Database
Service@ Azure logs with Azure Monitor and Microsoft Sentinel by sending
them to a Log Analytics workspace. Azure Monitor Logs is a centralized
software as a service (SaaS) platform for collecting, analyzing, and
acting on telemetry data generated by Azure and non-Azure resources like
Oracle Exadata Database Service@Azure. You can collect logs, manage log data and costs, and consume different types of data in one [Log
Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-platform-logs#log-analytics-workspace),the primary Azure Monitor Logs resource.

This integration enhances observability by enabling centralized
monitoring, correlation, and analysis of operational and database logs.Additionally, diagnostic settings allow you to archive logs to a storage account, stream them to an event hub, or send them to a partner solution—providing flexible options for retaining, analyzing, and acting on critical system insights.

Following types of logs are supported.

- Exadata VM cluster Life Cycle Management Logs

- Exadata Database logs

- Exadata Infrastructure Logs

- Exadata Data Guard logs

Integrating Oracle Exadata Database and Exadata Infrastructure logs with
the Azure portal provides a broad range of benefits, including:

## 1. Centralized Monitoring and Management

- **Unified view** of logs from various Azure services (for example, VMs, App
  Services, AKS, and Oracle Databases@Azure).

- Simplifies troubleshooting by correlating logs across services in one
  place.

- Selectively deliver different types of logs to different destinations
  for more controlled viewing.

## 2. Real-Time Insights and Alerts

- Use **Azure Monitor** and **Log Analytics** to query logs in real
  time.

- Set up **alerts** based on log queries to proactively detect issues
  (for example, failed deployments, performance bottlenecks).

## 3. Advanced Querying with Kusto Query Language (KQL)

- Powerful querying capabilities to analyze logs deeply.

- Enables custom dashboards and reports tailored to specific operational
  needs.

## 4. Integration with Azure Services

- Seamless integration with services like:

  - **Azure Security Center** for threat detection.

  - **Azure Sentinel** for Security Information Event Management (SIEM)
    and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)

## 5. Automation and Remediation

- Trigger **Azure Logic Apps** or **Functions** based on log events.

- Automate responses to incidents (for example, restart a service when a
  failure is logged).

## 6. Compliance and Auditing

- Retain logs for auditing and compliance purposes.

- Use **Azure Policy** and **Activity Logs** to track changes and
  access.

## 7. Scalability and Cost Management

- Logs stored in **Log Analytics workspace** scale with your needs.

- Control costs with **data retention policies** and **sampling**.

## 8. Custom Dashboards and Visualization

- Create rich visualizations using **Azure Workbooks**.

- Share dashboards with stakeholders for transparency and collaboration.

## Prerequisites

- Oracle Database@Azure provisioned: Deploy an Exadata virtual machine
  (VM) cluster in a delegated subnet in an Azure virtual network. First,
  we need to create an Exadata Infrastructure.

- **[Log Analytics
  workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview):**
  A Log Analytics workspace is a data store into which you can collect
  any type of log data from all of your Azure and non-Azure resources
  like Exadata VM clusters and Exadata Infrastructure. Workspace
  configuration options let you manage all of your log data in one
  workspace to meet the operations, analysis, and auditing needs of
  different personas in your organization.

- **[Microsoft
  Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/overview?tabs=defender-portal):**
  Microsoft Sentinel is a cloud-native SIEM (security information and
  event management) and SOAR (security orchestration automated response)
  solution that helps organizations collect, analyze, and respond to
  security threats across their hybrid cloud environments. Microsoft
  Sentinel applies the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and
  machine learning (ML) to automate Security threat detection and response, reduce false positives, and improve security operations
  efficiency.

- **Azure subscription and permissions**: Ensure that you have
  sufficient Azure permissions:

  - Azure Owner or Contributor role on the subscription or resource
    group to enable Microsoft Sentinel and create Log Analytics
    workspace.

## Step 1: Create and configure a diagnostic setting

1. Navigate to the Azure portal and select either Oracle Exadata VM
  cluster or Oracle Exadata Infrastructure you want to monitor.

1. Go to the **Diagnostic settings** section and select **Add diagnostic setting**.

1. Choose the logs you want to send to Azure destinations using the
  below check box options:

1. **Choose the destinations**:

  Below are the destinations you can send the logs to

  :::image type="content" source="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/diagnostic-settings-destination-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of diagnostic settings destination options." lightbox="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/diagnostic-settings-destination-options.png":::

### A few things to know

- Logs may be delayed. After enabling diagnostic settings, it can take
  up to an hour for logs and events to start showing up in Azure Monitor
  or your selected destination.

- Diagnostic settings are limited to five per resource. You can create
  up to five diagnostic settings per Exadata resource.

- No duplicate destinations. You can’t create two diagnostic settings
  that send the same log categories to the same destination — each
  configuration must be unique.

## Step 2: Set up Log Analytics workspace

1. Set up a LA workspace by creating a new LA workspace resource in
  Azure portal.

1. Select the created LA workspace as destination while setting up the
    diagnostic settings on the Exadata VM cluster or Exadata
  Infrastructure Resource.

1. Ensure the Exadata VM cluster resource and LA workspace are under
  the same subscription.

1. Navigate to above created LA workspace once any events are generated
  and logs are to be verified.

1. Navigate to Logs section under the LA workspace side bar
    menu. Provide them with the option to view "logs" directly from the
    Exadata Resource page itself, with changing scope.

1. Switch to KQL mode from simple mode using the drop-down on the right
    end. A query run window pops up with options to write your own
    query in KQL along with using filters for adjusting the time
    range. Type in **OracleCloudDatabase** in the command prompt window
    and select on **Run** to fetch the results of logs ingested for
  various events in the **OracleCloudDatabase** table.

1. The result set should show the list of events occurred and
  corresponding meta data generated using the above setup.

## Step 3: Archive logs in Storage account

1. Set up a storage account by creating a new Storage account resource
  in Azure portal.
1. Ensure the Exadata Resource and Storage account resource are under
  the same subscription.
1. Select the above created Storage account as destination while
  setting up the diagnostic settings on the Exadata Resource.
1. Navigate to above created Storage account once any events are
    generated and logs are to be verified. You can find it by searching for the Storage account name or by navigating through the resource group where it's located.

1. In the Storage account, navigate to the Containers section. Here you find containers that store the logs. The container names     typically reflect the nature of the operation, such as creation
    events, deletion events, or update events.

1. Open the relevant container to browse the logs. The logs are usually organized by date, making it easier to find the specific logs you're looking for.

    :::image type="content" source="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/storage-account-containers-archived-logs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of storage account containers showing archived logs." lightbox="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/storage-account-containers-archived-logs.png":::

## Step 4: Stream logs to Event Hubs

1. Create Event hub namespace and an Event Hubs instance in Azure portal following the instructions here [Event Hubs - Capture streaming
  events using Azure portal - Azure Event Hubs \| Microsoft
  Learn](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-capture-enable-through-portal)

1. Ensure that you have configured diagnostic settings for the Exadata
    Resource you want to monitor. This involves selecting the logs you
  want to send and specifying the Event Hub as the destination.

1. Use the Azure portal to monitor the Event Hub by navigating to Data
    Explorer section of Event Hub namespace. Navigate to the Event Hub
    namespace and select the specific Event Hub instance as shown below.

1. Ensure to select the right Event hub instance and consumer group and select on View events to retrieve the list of occurrences and their corresponding meta data.

1. The event hub is the category. When event hub isn't provided, then
    the logs are routed to the natural category like creation etc. but
    The customer can select the eventhub while creating the diagnostic
    setting to ensure all the logs are routed to the same eventhub.

    :::image type="content" source="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/event-hubs-data-explorer-events.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Event Hubs Data Explorer showing events." lightbox="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/event-hubs-data-explorer-events.png":::

## Step 5: Send to Partner Solution

1. Create Event hub namespace and an Event Hub instance in Azure portal following the instructions here [Event Hubs - Capture streaming
  events using Azure portal - Azure Event Hubs \| Microsoft
  Learn](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-capture-enable-through-portal)

1. Enable SSO sign in through Azure portal by enabling Single sign On
    through Microsoft Entra ID [Configure predeployment to use Azure
  Native Dynatrace Service - Azure Native ISV Services \| Microsoft
  Learn](/azure/partner-solutions/dynatrace/dynatrace-how-to-configure-prereqs).

1. Ensure that you have configured diagnostic settings for the ExaData
    VM Cluster  you want to monitor. This involves selecting the logs
  you want to send and specifying the Event Hub as the destination.

1. Navigate to above created Dynatrace resource once any events are
    generated and logs are to be verified. You can find it by searching for the Azure Native Dynatrace service or by navigating through the resource group where it's located.

1. Once you are in the Dynatrace instance, navigate to Dynatrace
    environment using the SSO link.

    :::image type="content" source="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/azure-native-dynatrace-service-interface.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Native Dynatrace service interface." lightbox="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/azure-native-dynatrace-service-interface.png":::

1. Navigate to Logs explorer section in Dynatrace environment using the side menu.

    :::image type="content" source="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/dynatrace-logs-explorer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Dynatrace Logs explorer." lightbox="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/dynatrace-logs-explorer.png":::

1. The established integration pipeline should show the ingested logs
  for various events occurred.

1. To filter for specific log events, use the following query to
  evaluate the logs:

1. More columns from the result set can be added by applying
    the Hidden columns on

## Step 6: Setup Alerts and Monitoring

1. Go to **Azure Portal** \> **Monitor** \> **Alerts** \> **+ Create**
    \> **Alert rule**. [Overview of Azure Monitor alerts - Azure Monitor \| Microsoft Learn](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview)

1. Select the target resource in search tab by typing LA workspace name

    :::image type="content" source="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/azure-monitor-alerts-select-log-analytics-workspace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting Log Analytics workspace as target resource in Azure Monitor alerts." lightbox="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/azure-monitor-alerts-select-log-analytics-workspace.png":::

1. Select the condition as **custom log search** and create a query as
    follows:

    :::image type="content" source="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/azure-monitor-custom-log-search-condition.png" alt-text="Screenshot of custom log search condition in alert rule." lightbox="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/azure-monitor-custom-log-search-condition.png":::

1. Set the Action group

    > Create or select an **Action Group**:
    
    - Email
    
    - SMS
    
    - Webhook
    
    - Azure Function

1. Name the alert rule with severity

1. Review and create

## Step 7: Set up Microsoft Sentinel

To get started, add Microsoft Sentinel to an existing workspace or
create a new one.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Search for and select Microsoft Sentinel.

    :::image type="content" source="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/azure-portal-search-microsoft-sentinel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of searching for Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal." lightbox="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/azure-portal-search-microsoft-sentinel.png":::

1. Select **Create**.

1. Select the workspace you want to use or create a new one. You can
    run Microsoft Sentinel on more than one workspace, but data is
    isolated to a single workspace.

    :::image type="content" source="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/microsoft-sentinel-choose-workspace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of choosing a workspace while enabling Microsoft Sentinel." lightbox="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/microsoft-sentinel-choose-workspace.png":::

    - The default workspaces created by Microsoft Defender for Cloud aren't shown in the list. You can't install Microsoft Sentinel on these workspaces.

    - Once deployed on a workspace, Microsoft Sentinel doesn't   support moving that workspace to another resource group or   subscription.

1. Select **Add**.

1. Check the logs in Microsoft Sentinel by switching to KQL mode. Once
    the ***OracleCloudDatabase*** table is created, Microsoft Sentinel treats it
    like any other table, allowing you to run analytics queries and
    configure incident rules based on your specific requirements.

    :::image type="content" source="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/microsoft-sentinel-oracleclouddatabase-logs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Microsoft Sentinel logs showing OracleCloudDatabase data." lightbox="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/microsoft-sentinel-oracleclouddatabase-logs.png":::

    :::image type="content" source="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/microsoft-sentinel-analytics-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Microsoft Sentinel analytics configuration." lightbox="media/oracle-exadata-database-on-dedicated-infrastructure-logs/microsoft-sentinel-analytics-configuration.png":::

7.  Categories of detection rules supported:

    - Microsoft Sentinel provides **pre-defined detection rules** that are Microsoft proprietary.

    - Anomaly detection logic of such predefined rules is **not**
  exposed to customers.

8. Customers can also define their own detection rules called **Custom rules**.

   - Scheduled analytical Rules  & Near real time (NRT) rules are such customizable rules currently supported by Microsoft Sentinel.

   - In the background, these rules are Kusto queries defined as per
  the customer requirements and frequency of runs needed.
