# Get started with Oracle Database@Azure

In this article, learn how to purchase and start using Oracle Database@Azure.

Oracle Database@Azure is an Oracle database service that runs on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and is colocated in Azure datacenters at Microsoft. Colocation ensures that the Oracle Database@Azure service has the fastest possible access to Azure resources and applications.

Oracle Database@Azure runs on infrastructure that's managed by the expert Cloud Infrastructure operations team at Oracle. The operations team manages software patching, infrastructure updates, and other operations through a connection to OCI. Although the service requires that customers have an OCI tenancy, most service activities take place in the Azure environment.

## Purchase Oracle Database@Azure

To purchase Oracle Database@Azure, contact the Oracle sales team or your Oracle sales representative for a sale offer. Oracle Sales creates an Azure private offer in Azure Marketplace for your instance of the service. After an offer is created for your organization, you can accept the offer and complete the purchase in the marketplace in the Azure portal. For more information about Azure private offers, see [Overview of the commercial marketplace and enterprise procurement](/marketplace/what-is-commercial-marketplace).

Billing and payment for the service is processed through Azure. Payment for Oracle Database@Azure counts toward Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC). Existing Oracle Database software customers can use a bring your own license (BYOL) option or an unlimited license agreement (ULA). On your regular invoice for Azure, charges for Oracle Database@Azure appear with charges for your other Azure Marketplace services.

## Oracle Database@Azure interfaces

You can provision Oracle Database@Azure by using the Azure portal and Azure APIs, SDKs, and Terraform. You manage the Oracle database system infrastructure and virtual machine cluster resources in the Azure portal.

For an Oracle container database (CDB) or an Oracle pluggable database (PDB), some management tasks are completed by using the OCI console.

Database and application developers work in the Azure portal or use Azure tools (Azure APIs, SDKs, or Terraform) to manage their databases in Oracle Database@Azure.
