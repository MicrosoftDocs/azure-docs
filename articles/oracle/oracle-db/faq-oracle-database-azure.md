# FAQ for Oracle Database@Azure

In this article, get answers to frequently asked questions about Oracle Database@Azure.

## General

This section answers general questions about Oracle Database@Azure.

### How does Oracle Database@Azure work?

Oracle Database@Azure is enabled by hosting the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in Azure. In Oracle Database@Azure, OCI is natively integrated with Azure to offer low-latency, high-bandwidth connectivity from your mission-critical database tier to your application tier and other services in Azure. Enterprise-critical features like Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC), Oracle Data Guard, Oracle GoldenGate, managed backups, self-managed Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN) backups, Oracle Zero Downtime Migration (Oracle ZDM), on-premises connectivity, and seamless integration with other Azure services are supported. For more information, see the [overview of Oracle Database@Azure](/azure/oracle/oracle-db/database-overview).

### How is Oracle Database@Azure different from OCI Interconnect and Oracle on Azure virtual machines?

- Oracle Database@Azure: Oracle Database@Azure (Oracle Database Service for Azure) is hosted on the OCI infrastructure in Azure datacenters. You can host your mission-critical Oracle databases closer to your application tier hosted in Azure. Azure virtual network integration with subnet delegation enables private IP addresses from customer virtual networks to serve as database endpoints. This solution is Oracle-managed and a supported service in Azure.

- Oracle on Azure virtual machines (VMs): You can also deploy and self-manage your Oracle workloads on Azure VMs. Specifically, workloads that don't require features like Oracle RAC, Exadata Smart Scan, or Exadata performance are best suited for this operation.

- OCI Interconnect: OCI Interconnect is used to connect your Oracle deployments in OCI with applications and services in Azure via OCI FastConnect and Azure ExpressRoute. This configuration typically suits workloads and solutions that can work with the high-latency envelope and which have dependency on services, features, and functionalities that run in both clouds.

### Is Oracle Database@Azure available on a dedicated infrastructure or is it available only as a shared service? What is the isolation level?

Two services are offered as part of Oracle Database@Azure:

- Oracle Exadata Database on a dedicated infrastructure runs on a dedicated Exadata infrastructure in Azure. You get dedicated Oracle CPUs (OCPUs) and storage. Isolation is at the node level.

- Oracle Autonomous Database is the other Oracle Database service offered at Azure. Autonomous Database is on a shared Exadata infrastructure.

### What Oracle database versions are supported on Oracle Database@Azure?

Oracle versions supported on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) are supported on Oracle Database@Azure. These versions include 11g to 19c, similar to Exadata Cloud Service in OCI. Versions earlier than 19c need upgrade support. For more information, see [Oracle Database releases that support direct upgrade](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/upgrd/oracle-database-releases-that-support-direct-upgrade.html).

### Do you have any documented latency benchmark between Azure resources and Oracle Database@Azure?

Latency between Azure resources and Oracle Database@Azure is within the Azure regional latency envelope because the Exadata infrastructure is inside Azure datacenters. Latency can be further fine-tuned dependent on colocation within availability zones. For more information, see [What are availability zones?](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview?tabs=azure-cli).

### Does Oracle Database@Azure support deploying Oracle Base Database, or do I need to migrate to the Autonomous Database service?

No, Base Database isn't currently supported with Oracle Database@Azure. You can deploy single-instance, self-managed databases on Azure VMs. If you need Oracle-managed databases with Oracle RAC, we recommend that you use Autonomous Database via Oracle Database@Azure. For more information, see [Autonomous Database](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/azure/oracle-database-at-azure/) and [Provision Oracle Autonomous Database](provision-autonomous-oracle-databases.md).

### For the Oracle Database@Azure service, does automated disaster recovery use the Azure backbone or the OCI backbone?

Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) are enabled by using the OCI managed offering (Backup and Data Guard). BCDR uses the Azure/OCI backbone.

### How many database servers can be deployed in each rack of Oracle Database@Azure? Is there flexibility in terms of being able to scale up and down as needed from both the consumption and licensing perspective?

Oracle Database@Azure currently runs on Oracle Exadata X9M hardware and provides a configuration of a minimum of 2 database servers and 3 storage servers. This configuration is called *quarter-rack*. This configuration can be increased to a limit of 32 database servers and 64 storage servers. You can scale up and scale down as needed within the Oracle Exadata system depending on your SKU. For more information about configurations, see [Oracle Exadata Database service on a dedicated infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/exadatacloud/doc/exadata-cloud-infrastructure-overview.html#ECSCM-GUID-EC1A62C6-DDA1-4F39-B28C-E5091A205DD3). For details, see the [Oracle Exadata Cloud Infrastructure X9M data sheet](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/engineered-systems/exadata/exadata-cloud-infrastructure-x9m-ds.pdf).

### What Oracle applications can run on Azure?
