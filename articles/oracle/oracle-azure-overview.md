# Oracle on Azure

Customers running Oracle workloads on-premises can accelerate their cloud adoption by migrating their workloads to Azure. You have a choice to either lift and shift your Oracle workloads to Azure virtual machines or to Oracle Database@Azure. Additionally, you can also migrate to our Azure Database services like Azure SQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL based on the requirements of your organization.  

## Oracle on Azure virtual machines 

Microsoft Azure is an [authorized cloud provider](https://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/pricing/authorized-cloud-environments-3493562.pdf) for customers to run Oracle workloads. Customers have been migrating their Oracle databases, and enterprise applications such as Siebel, PeopleSoft, JD Edwards, E-Business Suite, or customized WebLogic server applications to Azure infrastructure as part of their cloud migration journey. 

Use Oracle on Azure virtual machines to run Oracle Database workloads on virtual machines in the cloud. This means you can easily deploy and manage Oracle databases without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Whether you're a developer, a data analyst, or a business owner, Oracle on Azure Virtual Machines provides a flexible and scalable platform for running your Oracle databases. 

Customers have a choice to run their Oracle workloads on Oracle published Oracle Linux image in the Azure Marketplace, RHEL or other endorsed OS with a flexible VM size and storage choice in native disk storage, file storage, block storage and as well as partner driven storage solutions. 

Customers can either self-manage these Oracle workloads or can work with our partners for a managed database offering on Azure virtual machines.
