# Azure Kinect Sensor SDK

The Azure Kinect Sensor SDK provides low-level sensor access for Azure Kinect DK hardware sensors and device configuration.

## Features

The Kinect Sensor SDK provides the following product and service features:

* Depth camera access and mode control. The camera offers both narrow and wide fields-of-view depth mode,and passive infrared (IR) modes.
* RGB camera with access to both exposure and white balance abilities.
* Motion sensor, such as gyroscope and accelerometer access.
* Synchronized depth-RGB camera that streams with configurable delay between cameras.
* External device synchronization control with configurable delay offset between devices.
* Camera-frame metadata that provides access for image resolution, timestamp, and temperature recognition.
* Device calibration data access.

## Tools

* A viewer tool to monitor device data streams and configure different modes.
* A Sensor recording tool and playback reader API that uses the Matroska container format.
* An Azure Kinect DK firmware update tool.

## Sensor SDK

* See Using Sensor SDK to learn more about the Sensor SDK.
* Download Sensor SDK
* The Sensor SDK will be available in open source on GitHub.
