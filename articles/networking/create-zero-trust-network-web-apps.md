# Deploy a zero trust network for web applications

## Introduction

This how-to follows the [Zero Trust Network for Web Applications reference architecture](/azure/architecture/example-scenario/gateway/application-gateway-before-azure-firewall) from the Azure Architecture Center. The reference architecture's intention is to guide you to publish a web application with secure access through a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and a traditional stateful firewall. In this scenario, the WAF is provided by the application gateway to inspect traffic for SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other common Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) rulesets. The stateful packet inspection performed by the Azure Firewall provides extra protection from malicious packets. All communication between services is secured with end-to-end TLS using trusted certificates.

## Prerequisites

To complete the Zero Trust deployment, you'll need:
- A Custom domain name
- A Trusted wildcard certificate for your custom domain
- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Visual Studio Code (optional, to assist with an automated deployment)

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not have a custom domain name, consider purchasing one through [Azure App Service](../app-service/manage-custom-dns-buy-domain.md).

## Deploying the resources

 For simplicity in the walk-through, all resources will be deployed to a single resource group. Review your management and governance strategy for an appropriate deployment model in your subscription. The reference architecture contains the following resources:
 - Two [virtual networks](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md)
    - Hub virtual network
    - Spoke virtual network
 - [Application gateway](../application-gateway/overview.md)
 - [Azure Firewall](../firewall/overview.md)
 - [DNS zones and records](../dns/dns-zones-records.md)
 - [Web application on App Service]()

> [!NOTE]
> The web application in the reference architecture is visualized with a Virtual Machine. This could also be an App Service, Kubernetes cluster or other container environment, or Virtual Machine scale set. In this walk through, we will replace the virtual machine with an App Service.

Other Azure services that will be deployed and configured and not explicitly listed in the reference architecture include:

- [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview)
- [Managed identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md)
- [Public IP addresses](../virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-addresses.md)
- [Network security groups](../virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview.md)
- [Private endpoints](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md)
- [Route tables](../virtual-network/manage-route-table.yml)


### Deploying the resource group

First up, you create a resource group to store all of the created resources. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may use your own resource group name and desired region. For this how-to, we will deploy all resources to the same resource group, **myResourceGroup**, and deploy all resources to the **East US** Azure region. Use these and your Azure subscription as the default settings throughout the article.
>
> Creating all your resources in the same resource group is good practice for keeping track of resources used, and makes it easier to clean up a demonstration or non-production environment. 

1. From the **Azure portal**, search for and select **Resource groups**.
1. On the **Resource groups** page, select **Create**.
1. Use the following settings or your own to create a resource group:
    
    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    |Subscription | Select your subscription. |
    |Resource group | Enter **myResourceGroup**
    | Region | Select **East US**. |

1. Select **Review + Create** and then select **Create**.


### Deploying the Azure Key Vault

In this step, you'll deploy [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to store secrets, keys, and certificates. We'll use a Key Vault to store the public trusted certificate that is used for TLS connections by the application gateway and Azure Firewall in this how-to.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, [soft-delete](/azure/key-vault/general/soft-delete-overview) is enabled on Azure Key Vault. This presents the accidental deletion of stored credentials. To allow you to remove the key vault in a timely manner upon completing this how-to, it's recommend to set the **Days to retain deleted vaults** to 7 days.

1. From the Azure portal menu, or from the **Home** page, select **Create a resource**.
1. In the **Search** box, enter **Key Vault** and select **Key Vault** from the results.
1. In the **Key Vault** creation page, select **Create**.
1. In the **Create key vault** page, enter or select these settings along with default values:
    
    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | Enter a unique name for your key vault. This example will use **myKeyVaultZT**. |
    | Pricing tier | Select **Standard**. |
    | Days to retain deleted vaults | Enter **7**. |
    | Purge Protection | Select **Disable purge protection (allow key vault and objects to be purged during retention period)**. |

1. Select **Review + Create** and then select **Create**.

### Upload a certificate to Key Vault

In this task, you'll upload your trusted wildcard certificate for your public domain.

> [!NOTE]
> This task requires a trusted digital certificate for a public domain which you own. Without the certificate, you will not be able to deploy this architecture example in it's entirety.
> In Azure Key Vault, supported certificate formats are PFX and PEM.
> - .pem file format contains one or more X509 certificate files.
> - .pfx file format is an archive file format for storing several cryptographic objects in a single file i.e. server certificate (issued for your domain), a matching private key, and may optionally include an intermediate CA.  

1. Navigate to the previously created key vault, **myKeyVaultZT**.
1. In the **Key Vault** page, select **Certificates** under **Objects**.
1. On the **Certificates** page, select **+ Generate/Import**
1. On the **Create a certificate** page, enter or select these settings along with default values:
    
    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Method of Certificate Creation | Select **Import**. |
    |Certificate Name | Enter **myTrustedWildCard**. |
    | Upload Certificate File | Select the folder icon and browse to the location of your certificate file. <br/> Select file and select **Open** to upload certificate. </br>  |

1. From the **Route Table** page, select **Routes** under **Settings**.
1. In the Add Route pane, enter or select these settings along with default values:
    
    | Setting            | Value                      |
    |--| - |
    | Route name | Enter **ToAppGW**. |   
    | Address prefix destination | Select **IP addresses**. |
    | Destination IP addresses/CIDR ranges | Enter **172.16.0.0/24**. |
    | Next hop type | Select **Virtual appliance**. |
    | Next hop address | Enter the  private IP address of the Azure Firewall. For example, **192.168.100.4**. |

1. Select **Add**.
1. Select the **Subnets** page under settings, and select **+ Associate**.
1. On the **Associate subnet** pane, select the **spoke-vnet** virtual network, and then select the **App1** subnet.
1. Select **OK**.
1. Repeat this process for another subnet by selecting **+ Associate**.
1. Select the **spoke-vnet** virtual network, and then select the **AppGwSubnet** subnet. Select **OK**.
1. After the association appears, select the link to the **App1** association.
1. In the **Network policy for private endpoints** section, select **Network security groups** and **Route Tables**, and then select **Save**.

### Test again

At this point, you should be able to connect to the App Service through the application gateway. Navigate to the URL of the DNS record that you created to validate that it resolves to the application gateway and that the default App Service page is displayed. If the page loads with an error, check the **Backend Health** page of the gateway for any errors relating to the backend pool, and then check your backend settings. Also verify that you have the routes configured correctly. 

The application gateway should be sending traffic to the private IP address of the firewall. The firewall can communicate with the private endpoint through the virtual network peering connection. The route table on the subnet the private endpoint is connected to points back to the firewall to get back to the application gateway.

If you would like to test that the Firewall is actually inspecting or filtering traffic, modify the network rule that you created in the Firewall Policy from **TCP** to **ICMP**. This will then implicitly block TCP traffic from the application gateway and the website access will be denied.

### Deploy the network security groups - optional

You'll deploy network security groups to prevent other subnets from accessing the private endpoint used by the app service.

> [!NOTE]
> In this deployment, network security groups aren't explicitly required. We have configured Route Tables to force the flow of traffic from the defined subnets through an Azure Firewall. However, in a production environment, most organizations have other subnets that might be in the same virtual network or peered to the network that didn't have user-defined routes defined. Network security groups would be beneficial to ensure that other subnets can't access the Private Endpoint of the App Service. Learn more about [network security groups](../virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview.md).

1. From the Azure portal, search for and select **Network security groups**.
1. In the **Network security groups** page, select **Create**.
1. On the Basics tab, enter **nsg-app1** in **Name**.
1. Select **Review + Create** and then select **Create**.
1. Navigate to the newly deployed network security group.
1. In the **network security group** page, select **Inbound security rules** under **Settings**.
1. From **Inbound security rules** page, select **Add**.
1. On the **Add inbound security rule** pane, enter or select these settings along with default values:
    
    | Setting            | Value                      |
    |--| - |
    | Source | Select **IP addresses**. |   
    | Source IP addresses/CIDR ranges | Enter **192.168.100.0/24**. |
    | Source Port ranges | Enter **\***.
    | Destination | Select **Any**. |
    | Service | Select **HTTPS**. |
    | Action | Select **Allow**. |
    | Priority | Enter **300**. |
    | Name | Enter **Allow_HTTPS_From_Firewall**. |

1. Select **Add**.
1. From **Inbound security rules** page, select **Add**.
1. On the **Add inbound security rule** pane, enter or select these settings along with default values:
        
    | Setting            | Value                      |
    |--| - |
    | Source | Select **Any**. |
    | Source Port ranges | Enter **\***. |
    | Destination | Select **Any**. |
    | Service | Select **Custom**. |
    | Destination port ranges | Enter **\***. |
    | Protocol | Select **Any**. |
    | Action | Select **Deny**. |
    | Priority | Enter **310**. |
    | Name | Enter **Deny_All_Traffic**. |

1. Select **Add**.
1. From the **Network security group** page, select **Subnets** under **Settings**.
1. On the **Subnets** page, select **Associate**.
1. In the **Associate subnet** pane, select the **spoke-vnet** virtual network.
1. In the Subnet drop-down, select the **App1** subnet.
1. Select **OK**.
