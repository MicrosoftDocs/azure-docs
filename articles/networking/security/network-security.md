# What is Azure network security?

Network security is a critical aspect of cloud computing, as it protects the data and applications that run on the cloud from various threats and attacks. Azure provides a comprehensive set of network security solutions that enable you to design, deploy, and manage secure and resilient networks in the cloud.

:::image type="content" source="./media/network-security/security-services.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the icons for Azure Firewall, Azure DDoS Protection, and Azure Web Application Firewall.":::

One of the guiding principles of Azure network security is the [Zero Trust model](/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-overview), which assumes that no network or device is inherently secure or trustworthy. Instead, every request and connection should be verified and validated based on data, identity, and context. The Zero Trust model helps you to prevent unauthorized access, limit lateral movement, and reduce the attack surface of your networks.

## Choosing a solution

Choosing the right network security solution for your Azure workloads depends on your specific needs and requirements. Azure provides a variety of network security services that can be used individually or in combination to protect your workloads. Here are some key factors to consider when choosing a network security solution:

- **Workload type**: Different workloads have different security requirements. For example, web applications may require protection against web attacks, while virtual machines may require protection against network-based attacks.
- **Deployment model**: Azure provides different deployment models for network security services, such as virtual appliances, managed services, and integrated solutions. Choose the model that best fits your needs and requirements.
- **Integration with other Azure services**: Many Azure network security services integrate with other Azure services, such as Azure Monitor, Azure Security Center, and Microsoft Sentinel. Choose a solution that can easily integrate with your existing Azure services for enhanced security and monitoring.
- **Cost**: Different network security services have different pricing models. Choose a solution that fits your budget and provides the level of protection you need.
- **Compliance requirements**: Depending on your industry and location, you may have specific compliance requirements that your network security solution must meet. Choose a solution that can help you meet these requirements.
- **Scalability**: As your workloads grow, your network security solution should be able to scale with them. Choose a solution that can handle increased traffic and workloads without compromising security.
- **Management and monitoring**: Choose a solution that provides easy management and monitoring capabilities, such as dashboards, alerts, and reporting. This will help you to quickly identify and respond to security incidents.
