# Manage update configuration settings

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: On-premises environment :heavy_check_mark: Azure Arc-enabled servers.

This article describes how to configure update settings from Azure Update Manager to control the update settings on your Azure virtual machines (VMs) and Azure Arc-enabled servers for one or more machines.

## Configure settings on a single VM

To configure update settings on your machines on a single VM:

You can schedule updates from **Overview** or **Machines** on the **Update Manager** page or from the selected VM.

>[!NOTE]
> You can schedule updates from the Overview blade or Machines blade in Update Manager page or from the selected VM.

# [From Overview blade](#tab/manage-single-overview)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In **Azure Update Manager**, select **Overview**, select your **Subscription**, and select **Update settings**.
1. In **Change update settings**, select **+Add machine** to select the machine for which you want to change the update settings.
1. In **Select resources**, select the machine and select **Add**.
1. In the **Change update settings** page, you will see the machine classified as per the operating system with the list of following updates that you can select and apply.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-update-settings/update-setting-to-change.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows highlighting the Update settings to change option in the Azure portal.":::
 
    The following update settings are available for configuration for the selected machines:

   - **Periodic assessment**: The periodic assessment is set to run every 24 hours. You can either enable or disable this setting.
    - **Hotpatch**: You can enable [hotpatching](../automanage/automanage-hotpatch.md) for Windows Server Azure Edition VMs. Hotpatching is a new way to install updates on supported Windows Server Azure Edition VMs that doesn't require a reboot after installation. You can use Update Manager to install other patches by scheduling patch installation or triggering immediate patch deployment. You can enable, disable, or reset this setting.
    - **Patch orchestration** option provides:
    
      - **Customer Managed Schedules**—enables schedule patching on your existing VMs. The new patch orchestration option enables the two VM properties - **Patch mode = Azure-orchestrated** and **BypassPlatformSafetyChecksOnUserSchedule = TRUE** on your behalf after receiving your consent.
      - **Azure Managed - Safe Deployment**—for a group of virtual machines undergoing an update, the Azure platform will orchestrate updates. (not applicable for Arc-enabled server). The VM is set to [automatic VM guest patching](/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching).(i.e), the patch mode is **AutomaticByPlatform**. There are different implications depending on whether customer schedule is attached to it or not. For more information, see the [user scenarios](prerequsite-for-schedule-patching.md#user-scenarios).
          - Available *Critical* and *Security* patches are downloaded and applied automatically on the Azure VM using [automatic VM guest patching](/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching). This process kicks off automatically every month when new patches are released. Patch assessment and installation are automatic, and the process includes rebooting the VM as required.
      - **Windows Automatic Updates** (AutomaticByOS) - When the workload running on the VM doesn't have to meet availability targets, the operating system updates are automatically downloaded and installed. Machines are rebooted as needed.
      - **Manual updates** - This mode disables Windows automatic updates on VMs. Patches are installed manually or using a different solution.
      - **Image Default** - Only supported for Linux Virtual Machines, this mode uses the default patching configuration in the image used to create the VM.

1. After you make the selection, select **Save**.
