# Manage multiple machines with Azure Update Manager

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: On-premises environment :heavy_check_mark: Azure Arc-enabled servers.

This article describes the various features that Azure Update Manager offers to manage the system updates on your machines. By using the Update Manager, you can:

- Quickly assess the status of available operating system updates.
- Deploy updates.
- Set up a recurring update deployment schedule.
- Get insights on the number of machines managed.
- Obtain information on how they're managed and other relevant details.

Instead of performing these actions from a selected Azure VM or Azure Arc-enabled server, you can manage all your machines in the Azure subscription.


## View update Manager status 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. To view update assessment across all machines, including Azure Arc-enabled servers  navigate to **Azure Update Manager**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-multiple-machines/overview-page-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Update Manager Overview page in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/manage-multiple-machines/overview-page-expanded.png":::
   
     On the **Overview** page, the summary tiles show the following status:

   - **Filters**: Use filters to focus on a subset of your resources. The selectors above the tiles return **Subscription**, **Resource group**, **Resource type** (Azure VMs and Azure Arc-enabled servers), **Location**, and **OS** type (Windows or Linux) based on the Azure role-based access rights you've been granted. You can combine filters to scope to a specific resource.
   - **Update status of machines**: Shows the update status information for assessed machines that had applicable or needed updates. You can filter the results based on classification types. By default, all [classifications](../automation/update-management/overview.md#update-classifications) are selected. According to the classification selection, the tile is updated.

      The graph provides a snapshot for all your machines in your subscription, regardless of whether you've used Update Manager for that machine. This assessment data comes from Azure Resource Graph, and it stores the most recent assessment data for seven days.

      From the assessment data available, machines are classified into the following categories:

      - **No updates available**: No updates are pending for these machines and these machines are up to date.
      - **Updates available**: Updates are pending for these machines and these machines aren't up to date.
      - **Reboot required**: Pending a reboot for the updates to take effect.
      - **No updates data**: No assessment data is available for these machines.
   
      The following reasons could explain why there's no assessment data:
      - No assessment has been done over the last seven days.
      - The machine has an unsupported OS.
      - The machine is in an unsupported region and you can't perform an assessment.

   - **Patch orchestration configuration of Azure virtual machines**: All the Azure machines inventoried in the subscription are summarized by each update orchestration method. Values are:

      - **Customer Managed Schedules**—enables schedule patching on your existing VMs. 
      - **Azure Managed - Safe Deployment**—this mode enables automatic VM guest patching for the Azure virtual machine. Subsequent patch installation is orchestrated by Azure. 
      - **Image Default**—for Linux machines, it uses the default patching configuration.
      - **OS orchestrated**—the OS automatically updates the machine.
      - **Manual updates**—you control the application of patches to a machine by applying patches manually inside the machine. In this mode, automatic updates are disabled for Windows OS. 
   
    
 
   For more information about each orchestration method see, [automatic VM guest patching for Azure VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching#patch-orchestration-modes). 

   For more information about each orchestration method, see [Automatic VM guest patching for Azure VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching#patch-orchestration-modes).

   - **Update installation status**: By default, the tile shows the status for the last 30 days. By using the **Time** picker, you can choose a different range. The values are:
      - **Failed**: One or more updates in the deployment have failed.
      - **Completed**: The deployment ends successfully by the time range selected.
      - **Completed with warnings**: The deployment is completed successfully but had warnings.
      - **In progress**: The deployment is currently running.

- Select **Update status of machines** or **Patch orchestration configuration of Azure virtual machines** to go to the **Machines** page.
- Select **Update installation status** to go to the **History** page.
- **Pending Windows updates**: Status of pending updates for Windows machines in your subscription.
- **Pending Linux updates**: Status of pending updates for Linux machines in your subscription.

## Summary of machine status

Update Manager in Azure enables you to browse information about your Azure VMs and Arc-enabled servers across your Azure subscriptions relevant to Update Manager. The section shows how you can filter information to understand the update status of your machine resources, and for multiple machines, initiate an update assessment, update deployment, and manage their update settings. 

 In the Azure Update Manager page, select **Machines** from the left menu.

 On the **Update Manager** page, select **Machines** from the left menu.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-multiple-machines/update-center-machines-page-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Update Manager Machines page in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/manage-multiple-machines/update-center-machines-page-expanded.png":::

   The table lists all the machines in the specified subscription, and for each machine it helps you understand the following details that show up based on the latest assessment:

   * **Customer Managed Schedules**—enables schedule patching on your existing VMs. The new patch orchestration option enables the two VM properties - **Patch mode = AutomaticByPlatform** and **BypassPlatformSafetyChecksOnUserSchedule = TRUE** on your behalf after receiving your consent.
   * **Azure Managed - Safe Deployment**—for a group of virtual machines undergoing an update, the Azure platform will orchestrate updates. The VM is set to [automatic VM guest patching](/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching).(i.e), the patch mode is **AutomaticByPlatform**.
   * **Automatic by OS**—the machine is automatically updated by the OS.
   * **Image Default**—for Linux machines, its default patching configuration is used.
   * **Manual**—you control the application of patches to a machine by applying patches manually inside the machine. In this mode automatic updates are disabled for Windows OS.
   

The **Patch orchestration** column in the machine's patch mode has the following values:

   * **Customer Managed Schedules (preview)**: Enables schedule patching on your existing VMs. The new patch orchestration option enables the two VM properties: `Patch mode = AutomaticByPlatform` and `BypassPlatformSafetyChecksOnUserSchedule = TRUE` on your behalf after receiving your consent.
   * **Azure Managed - Safe Deployment**: For a group of virtual machines undergoing an update, the Azure platform orchestrates updates. The VM is set to [automatic VM guest patching](/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching). For example, the patch mode is `AutomaticByPlatform`.
   * **Automatic by OS**: The machine is automatically updated by the OS.
   * **Image default**: For Linux machines, its default patching configuration is used.
   * **Manual**: You control the application of patches to a machine by applying patches manually inside the machine. In this mode, automatic updates are disabled for Windows OS.

**The machine's status**: For an Azure VM, it shows its [power state](/azure/virtual-machines/states-billing#power-states-and-billing). For an Azure Arc-enabled server, it shows if it's connected or not.

Use filters to focus on a subset of your resources. The selectors above the tiles return subscriptions, resource groups, resource types (that is, Azure VMs and Azure Arc-enabled servers), and regions. They're based on the Azure role-based access rights you've been granted. You can combine filters to scope to a specific resource.

The summary tiles at the top of the page summarize the number of machines that have been assessed and their update status.

To manage the machine's update settings, see [Manage update configuration settings](manage-update-settings.md).

### Check for updates

For machines that haven't had a compliance assessment scan for the first time, you can select one or more of them from the list. Then select **Check for updates**. You receive status messages as the configuration is performed.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-multiple-machines/update-center-assess-now-multi-selection-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows initiating a scan assessment for selected machines with the Check for updates option." lightbox="./media/manage-multiple-machines/update-center-assess-now-multi-selection-expanded.png":::

  Otherwise, a compliance scan begins and the results are forwarded and stored in Azure Resource Graph. This process takes several minutes. When the assessment is finished, a confirmation message appears on the page.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-multiple-machines/update-center-assess-now-complete-banner-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an assessment banner on the Manage Machines page." lightbox="./media/manage-multiple-machines/update-center-assess-now-complete-banner-expanded.png":::

Select a machine from the list to open Update Manager scoped to that machine. Here, you can view its detailed assessment status and update history, configure its patch orchestration options, and begin an update deployment.

### Deploy the updates

For assessed machines that are reporting updates available, select one or more of the machines from the list and begin an update deployment that starts immediately. Select the machine and go to **One-time update**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-multiple-machines/update-center-install-updates-now-multi-selection-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows installing one-time updates for machines on the Updates (Preview) page." lightbox="./media/manage-multiple-machines/update-center-install-updates-now-multi-selection-expanded.png":::

 A notification confirms when an activity starts and another tells you when it's finished. After it's successfully finished, the installation operation results are available to view. You can use the **Update history** tab, when you select the machine from the **Machines** page. You can also select the **History** page. You're redirected to this page automatically after you begin the update deployment. You can view the status of the operation at any time from the [Azure activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log).

### Set up a recurring update deployment

You can create a recurring update deployment for your machines. Select your machine and select **Scheduled updates**. A [Create new maintenance configuration](scheduled-patching.md) flow opens.

## Update deployment history

Update Manager enables you to browse information about your Azure VMs and Azure Arc-enabled servers across your Azure subscriptions relevant to Update Manager. You can filter information to understand the update assessment and deployment history for multiple machines. On the **Update Manager** page, select **History** from the left menu.

## Update deployment history by machines

The update deployment history provides a summarized status of update and assessment actions performed against your Azure VMs and Azure Arc-enabled servers. You can also drill into a specific machine to view update-related details and manage it directly. You can review the detailed update or assessment history for the machine and other related details in the table.

:::image type="content" source="./media/manage-multiple-machines/update-center-history-page-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot of update center History page in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/manage-multiple-machines/update-center-history-page-expanded.png":::

Each record shows:

   - **Machine Name**
   - **Status**
   - **Update installed**
   - **Update operation**
   - **Operation type**
   - **Operation start time**
   - **Resource Type**
   - **Tags**
   - **Last assessed time**

## Update deployment history by maintenance run ID

On the **History** page, select **By maintenance run ID** to view the history of the maintenance run schedules.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-multiple-machines/update-center-history-by-maintenance-run-id-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the update center History page By maintenance run ID in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/manage-multiple-machines/update-center-history-by-maintenance-run-id-expanded.png":::

Each record shows:

- **Maintenance run ID**
- **Status**
- **Updated machines**
- **Maintenance Configuration**
- **Operation start time**
- **Operation end time**

When you select any one maintenance run ID record, you can view an expanded status of the maintenance run. It contains information about machines and updates. It includes the number of machines that were updated and updates installed on them. A pie chart shows the status of each of the machines. At the end of the page, a list view shows both machines and updates that were a part of this maintenance run.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-multiple-machines/update-center-maintenance-run-record-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a maintenance run ID record." lightbox="./media/manage-multiple-machines/update-center-maintenance-run-record-expanded.png":::

### Resource Graph

The update assessment and deployment data are available for querying in Azure Resource Graph. You can apply this data to scenarios that include security compliance, security operations, and troubleshooting. Select **Go to resource graph** to go to the Azure Resource Graph Explorer. It enables running Resource Graph queries directly in the Azure portal. Resource Graph supports the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure SDK for Python, and more. For more information, see [First query with Azure Resource Graph Explorer](../governance/resource-graph/first-query-portal.md).

When the Resource Graph Explorer opens, it's automatically populated with the same query used to generate the results presented in the table on the **History** page in Update Manager. Ensure that you review [Overview of query logs in Azure Update Manager](query-logs.md) to learn about the log records and their properties, and the sample queries included.

## Next steps
