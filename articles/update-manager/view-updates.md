## Check updates on a single VM

You can check the updates from the **Overview** or **Machines** pane on the **Update Manager** page or from the selected VM.

> [!NOTE]
> In Update Manager, you can initiate a software updates compliance scan on the machine to get the current list of operating system (guest) updates, including the security and critical updates. On Windows, the Windows Update Agent performs the software update scan. On Linux, the software update scan is performed using the package manager that returns the missing updates as per the configured repositories which are retrieved from a local or remote repository.

## Next steps
