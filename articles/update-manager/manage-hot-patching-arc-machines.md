# Manage hotpatches (preview) on Arc-enabled machines

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: On-premises environment :heavy_check_mark: Azure Arc-enabled servers.

Azure Update Manager enables you to install hotpatches (preview) on Windows Server Azure Editions and Arc-enabled machines. For more information, see [Hotpatch for virtual machines](/windows-server/get-started/hotpatch).

This article explains how to install hotpatches (preview) on compatible Arc-enabled machines. For hotpatches (preview) being non-intrusive on availability, you can create faster schedules and update your services immediately after release, with less planning to maintain reliability of your machines at-scale.  

## Supported operating systems

- Windows Server 2025 Standard Edition 
- Windows Server 2025 Datacenter Edition 


## Prerequisites

- Verify that the machine has a supported OS SKU. [Learn more](#supported-operating-systems).
- Ensure that Virtualization Based Security (VBS) is enabled. [Learn more](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-server-news-and-best/how-to-preview-azure-arc-connected-hotpatching-for-windows/ba-p/4246895).
- Ensure the machine is Arc-enabled.

### Hotpatch (preview) statuses

| Status |  Meaning    |
|------|-----|
| Not enrolled| License is available but not enrolled on this machine. |
| Enabled     | License is enrolled and machine is enabled for receiving hotpatch updates.|
| Canceled | License has been canceled on the machine.   |
| Disabled | License is enrolled but the machine is disabled for receiving hotpatch updates. |
| Pending | Interim status while enrollment is in progress. |

### Check hotpatch (preview) updates

For latest hotpatch updates, enable either [periodic assessment](assessment-options.md#periodic-assessment) or a [one-time update](assessment-options.md#check-for-updates-nowon-demand-assessment).

Periodic assessment automatically assesses for available updates and ensures that available patches are detected. You can view the results of the assessment on the **Recommended updates** tab, including the time of the last assessment. 

You can also choose to trigger an *on-demand patch assessment* for your VM at any time using the **Check for updates** option and review the results after assessment completes. In this assessment result, you can view the reboot status of the given update under **Reboot required** column.

### Install hotpatch (preview) updates

To install, you can create a [user-defined schedule](scheduled-patching.md#schedule-recurring-updates-on-a-single-vm) or [one-time update](quickstart-on-demand.md#install-updates). You can install it immediately after it's available, allowing your machine to get secure faster. 

Using either of these options you can choose to install all available update classifications or only security updates. You can also specify updates to include or exclude by providing the individual hotpatch (preview) knowledge base IDs. You can enter more than one knowledge base ID in this flow.

This ensures that the hotpatch (preview) update which doesn't require reboots is installed in the same schedule or one-time update schedule, making patch installation window predictable. 

### View history

You can view the history of update deployments on your VM through theâ€¯[history](deploy-updates.md#view-update-history-for-a-single-vm) option. 

**Update history** displays the history for the past 30 days, along with patch installation details such as reboot status.
