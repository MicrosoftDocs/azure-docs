# Create alerts (preview)

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: On-premises environment :heavy_check_mark: Azure Arc-enabled servers.

This article provides steps to enable Alerts (preview) with [Azure Update Manager](overview.md) to address events as captured in updates data.

Azure Update Manager is a unified service that allows you to manage and govern updates for all your Windows and Linux virtual machines across your deployments in Azure, on-premises, and on the other cloud platforms from a single dashboard. It's designed as a standalone Azure service to provide SaaS experience to manage hybrid environments in Azure.

Logs created from patching operations such as update assessments and installations are stored by Azure Update Manager in Azure Resource Graph (ARG). You can view up to last seven days of assessment data, and up to last 30 days of update installation results.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature isn't available in Azure US Government and Azure China operated by 21 Vianet.

## Prerequisite

Alert rule based on ARG query requires a managed identity with reader role assigned for the targeted resources.
