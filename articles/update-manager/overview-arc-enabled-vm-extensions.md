## Windows extension

### March 2025

#### Extension name: Microsoft.SoftwareUpdateManagement.WindowsOsUpdateExtension**
#### Extension Version: 1.0.28.0

**Fixed**

- Improvement in error message to make troubleshooting easier
    - Current error message:  *An internal error occurred while processing the operation.*
    - New error message: *Windows update API threw an exception while assessing the machine for available updates. HResult: 0x80004005*
    > [!NOTE]
    > The HResult could be different, based on the issue.

- Fixed an issue where at times the extension status is stuck in  **Creating state**. Then the assessment or install updates job fails with the following error: *Extension failed during enable. Extension Enable command timed out.*

- Fixed an issue where although the updates are installed and reboot is completed within the maintenance window, still the operation is stuck in **InProgress** state and completes the maintenance window end time with the following error message: *Maintenance window exceeded. Could not complete patching process within window specified.*
