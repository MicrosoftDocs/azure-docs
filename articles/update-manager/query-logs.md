# Access Azure Update Manager operations data using Azure Resource Graph

Logs created from operations like update assessments and installations are stored by Azure Update Manager in [Azure Resource Graph](../governance/resource-graph/overview.md). Resource Graph is a service in Azure designed to be the store for Azure service details without any cost or deployment requirements. Update Manager uses Resource Graph to store its results. You can view the most recent update assessment history for the last 7 days and update installations history for the last 30 days from the Resource Graph.

This article describes the structure of the logs from Update Manager and how you can use [Azure Resource Graph Explorer](../governance/resource-graph/first-query-portal.md) to analyze them in support of your reporting, visualizing, and export needs.

## Log structure

Update Manager sends the results of all its operations into Azure Resource Graph as logs, which are available for 30 days. Listed here are the structure of logs being sent to Azure Resource Graph.

### Patch assessment results

The table `patchassessmentresources` includes resources related to machine patch assessment. The following table describes its properties.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ID` | The Azure Resource Manager ID forwarding the result. It's similar to the [REST API](manage-vms-programmatically.md) path for Guest OS assessment. Typically, `<resourcePath>/patchAssessmentResults/latest` or `<resourcePath>/patchAssessmentResults/latest/softwarePatches/<update>`. |
| `NAME` | If the ID is of type `<resourcePath>/patchAssessmentResults/latest`, then the record contains the unique GUID for the assessment operation finished. If `<resourcePath>/patchAssessmentResults/latest/softwarePatches/<update>`, then the record contains the update name or label. |
| `TYPE` |Specifies the type of log for assessment. If the type is `patchassessmentresults`, then the record provides a summary of OS assessment with numerical aggregate statistics. If the type is `patchassessmentresults/softwarepatches`, then the record describes a specific OS update available for the resource. |
| `TENANTID` | Azure tenant ID for the Azure VM or Azure Arc-enabled server resource.|
| `KIND`	| Intentionally left blank for future use. |
