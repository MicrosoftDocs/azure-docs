# Extended Security Updates (ESU) for Windows Server

This article provides information on ESU on Azure VMs and Azure Arc machines.

## What are Extended Security Updates 

Extended Security Updates for Windows Server include security updates and bulletins rated *critical* and *important* for a maximum period from the end of extended support, depending on the version.  

Extended Security Updates doesn't include new features, customer-requested non-security hotfixes, or design change requests.

### Azure virtual machines

ESUs are available free of charge and by default for servers hosted in Azure.
