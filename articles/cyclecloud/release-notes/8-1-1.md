# CycleCloud version 8.1.1

## New Features:
* Slurm is updated to 20.11.4 and supports CentOS 8 and Ubuntu 18.
* Infiniband-based SKUs have accelerated networking disabled by default, to avoid device-ordering issues

## Resolved Issues:
* MPI jobs in Slurm failed due to missing slurm-libmpi
* Setting `webServerContextPath` in cycle_server.properties did not work properly
* Pre-installing Jetpack on an image would incorrectly report an installation failure.
* Default NFS mounting options were incompatible with NFS version 3
* Jetpack PATH was incorrectly ordered on Windows.
* Nodes whose images had embedded data disks could not be restarted once terminated
* CycleCloud 7.x clusters would not run cluster-init if CycleCloud was upgraded to version 8
* When scaling up large clusters, CycleCloud's self-throttling was too strict, keeping it from making progress
* Execute nodes would sometimes get "resource not found" errors that would prevent scaling up
* Healthcheck did not support Python3
* Evicted spot nodes for MPI jobs in Slurm could not be restarted
* In some cases, nodes would not start with the following error: "This node does not match existing scaleset attributes: Configuration.cyclecloud.mounts.additional_nfs.export_path, Configuration.cyclecloud.mounts.additional_nfs.mountpoint"
* In certain cases, execute nodes could not be restarted after editing the cluster through the UI
* Nodes with disks that referenced snapshots could not be started
* Jetpack would incorrectly handle a list of IP addresses for network shares
* The restore.sh script failed because it tried to start the (now-removed) broker service
* Waiting for CloudInit would timeout after 5 minutes (increased to 60 minutes)
* Page rendering was broken in some versions of Safari
* The image picker displayed the incorrect image ID for CentOS 7
* CycleCloud CLI incorrectly used the deprecated `tostring()` method on arrays
* CycleCloud encountered a "Conversion: 2" error when processing insufficient-quota error messages for VMs
* Mitigated CVE issue 2020-25649

## Deprecated:
* Removed legacy SAML support
