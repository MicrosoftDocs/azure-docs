# CycleCloud version 8.6.1

## Resolved Issues:

* An elevation-of-privilege vulnerability existed for a user with access to CycleCloud [(CVE-2024-29993)](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-29993).
* The GPG key for the AlmaLinux 8 package repos in older images was revoked. CycleCloud will now update the gpg keys upon boot for AlmaLinux 8.
* The Slurm Accounting record did not identify Spot VMs as "Spot" in the admin comment.
* Settings whose values were secrets were shown in plain test in the Settings page.
* The GridEngine cluster type sometimes failed initial converge due to a transient SELinux restorecon failure, leading to slow scheduler converges showing transient errors.
* Unauthenticated users would be redirected to the login page with no error message.
* Inline form labels were misaligned.
* Users with no permission to view or create clusters would only see a blank page.
