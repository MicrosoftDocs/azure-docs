# Release Notes

Azure CycleCloud patch release v7.5.5 gives greater control over hostnames and fixes issues.

## New Features:
 * New node and nodearray attributes, `ComputerName` and `ComputerNamePrefix`, for additional control over hostnames

## Resolved Issues:
 * Certain Azure subscriptions caused an error while collecting subscription-level information
 * The web UI would fail to load in some non-US locales
 * Terminated nodes would sometimes fail to restart with a boot disk error
 * `cycle_server keystore import` could not import some encrypted private RSA keys
 * Node detail dialog sometimes displayed the wrong attribute labels
 * PBS MPI jobs would sometimes land on the incorrect autoscaled machines
