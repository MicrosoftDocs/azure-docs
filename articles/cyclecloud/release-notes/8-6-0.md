# CycleCloud version 8.6.0

## New Features:

* **PREVIEW**: CycleCloud now supports use of [Entra ID for user authentication](../how-to/user-authentication.md#using-entra-id-authentication-with-cyclecloud)
* CycleCloud now provides [built-in support for mounting Azure Managed Lustre (AMLFS)](../how-to/mount-fileserver.md#mount-an-azure-managed-lustre-filesystem) and the Slurm Cluster type offers AMLFS as a built-in option. 
* Jetpack CLI now provides an action `run_on_shutdown` [command](../jetpack.md#jetpack-run_on_shutdown) that registers actions to be performed prior to shutdown or termination if Scheduled Events are enabled
* Allow Slurm users to configure the reported GPU counts to mitigate issues where ARM reports an incorrect value
* Slurm packages are now installed from _packages.microsoft.com_. This allows users to use standard packaging tools to update Slurm
* The Linux system service for CycleCloud now includes a new backend service process named `app_server`
* CycleCloud CLI will now prompt for Entra ID authentication if CycleCloud is configured to use Entra Authentication

## Resolved Issues:

* Scheduled Event notifications (such as the freeze event notification) were incorrectly logged as warnings  
* Access to Jetpack logs and directories was restricted to `root:root` rather than `root:cyclecloud`
* The _catalina.err_ file no longer logs every request
* Windows nodes did not boot correctly because CycleCloud included an empty string for cloud-init.
* RHEL 9 and other modern Linux distros could fail due to non-ascii characters in the node metadata
* Memory usage was unnecessarily large when using spot VMs in high demand
* Setting `webServerContextPath` to a non-default value in _cycle_server.properties_ caused errors in the web UI in 8.5
* The `cyclecloud-hpcpack` default version was set to 2.1.0 instead of current 2.1.1
* In rare cases, collecting prices would hit a "Series larger than 100000" error  
* The Slurm _gres.conf_ was not populated in sovereign clouds
