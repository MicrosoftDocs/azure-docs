* Jetpack installation could sometimes be halted by a rate-limited metadata server
* The custom settings for a graph on the cluster page were reverted when the page auto-refreshed
* Network metrics collected were incorrectly treating rates as bytes transferred
* Spot evictions detected in advance by CycleCloud were not labeled as spot-eviction as the reason in Event Grid
* Nodes that encountered certain errors while starting would get stuck in Acquiring state
* Keyboard navigation was broken.
* Quota consumption for limited-core HBv3 variants was treated as the limited count, not 120 cores
* Core-limited SKUs (eg, HB120-32v3) did not show prices
