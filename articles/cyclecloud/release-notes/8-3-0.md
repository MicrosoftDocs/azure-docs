# CycleCloud version 8.3.0

## New Features:

* LSF and Slurm schedulers now support SLES 
* RHEL/SLES Hybrid Benefit licensing is now supported 
* Added `cyclecloud_slurm start_nodes` [command](https://github.com/Azure/cyclecloud-slurm/blob/master/README.md) that starts and prevents nodes from scaling down 
* Spot VMs are now supported for regular non-array nodes 
* Added a `fix_mismatched_attributes` [command](../slurm.md#making-cluster-changes) to help with MPI nodes getting unintended changes 
* Nodes can be allocated into pre-existing [VMSS Flex scale sets](../how-to/flex-scalesets.md) 
* Automatically accepting marketplace terms can now be enabled/disabled on the subscription create and edit forms 
* Updated CycleCloud licensing terms 

## Resolved Issues:

* Authentication failures would not trigger the 5-minute lockout 
* Calling `cyclecloud import_template` with name of an existing cluster would hide the cluster 
* Nodearrays allowed “Persistent” disks to be specified, but this is not valid with scale sets 
* GridEngine nodes would always fail at least once due to hostname validation 
* Slurm nodename hostname had DNS validation issues 
* System time differences would prevent Slurm nodes from joining the cluster. 
* Slurm would not install on CentOS 8 
* Icons did not display properly when using a custom webContextPath 
* Large numbers of node arrays caused the cloud-init editor to have a horizontal scrollbar 
* Cluster init changes caused an incorrect "mismatched attributes" error 
* Jetpack defaulted to incompatible RAID superblock version.
* The `http_proxy.url` cluster setting was not backwards compatible
