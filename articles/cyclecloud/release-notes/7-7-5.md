# CycleCloud version 7.7.5

This patch release fixes issues autoscaling and manually adding nodes.

## New Features:
 * The autoscaling API now includes information on which VM allocation buckets are valid for the current cluster definition

## Resolved Issues:
 * The "Add Nodes" dialog box showed 0 quota if there were no VMs running in the cluster's region
 * In certain cases, the "Add Nodes" dialog box did not support adding nodes to a mixed-machine-type cluster
 * Autoscaling MPI clusters sometimes caused "Node definition does not match existing scaleset attributes" errors
