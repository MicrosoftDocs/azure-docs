# CycleCloud version 8.0.1

## New Features:
 * A new Clusters icon has been added to the top-level navigation bar to make it easy to navigate back to the main Clusters page.
 * The cloud-init GUI now warns if an invalid cloud-init is suspected.
 * HSTS is now supported to ensure HTTPS traffic is consistently used once enabled
 * The Apache Qpid broker is no longer packaged with Azure CycleCloud 8. New clusters created with CycleCloud 8 no longer use the broker for message passing. This removes the need to open the AMQP port in network security groups.
For users upgrading from earlier versions, the existing broker will be retained to maintain backwards compatibility for clusters created prior to the upgrade.

## Resolved Issues:
 * The `cyclecloud project init` command was not working correctly
 * "Set missing BootFinishedTime" warnings appeared during autoscale
 * The RDP download option in the connect UI was not working correctly.
 * The `cyclecloud project upload` command was unable to properly handle custom URLs.
 * CycleCloud 8.0 incorrectly truncated long hostnames using the ComputerName attribute.
 * The `jetpack test` subcommand was broken.
 * Using a dollar sign ($) in the cloud-init GUI would be incorrectly interpreted as a parameter.
 * Managed disks attached as Volumes were not mounted as filesystems.
