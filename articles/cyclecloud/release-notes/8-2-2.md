# CycleCloud version 8.2.2

## New Features:

* CycleCloud now supports [terminate notification](../how-to/scheduled-events.md#terminate-notification) for VMs
* The “node table” on the cluster page includes an Azure view which lists VM information
* Added [customizable throttling](/azure/cyclecloud/cluster-references/node-nodearray-reference) to improve cluster's response to `Insufficient Capacity` errors.
* Shutting down a group of nodes from the UI requires additional confirmation
* The Slurm integration supports non-autoscaled Slurm clusters
* Slurm clusters now support login nodes
* Slurm clusters now support High-Availability configuration of the slurmctlds
* The Alma Linux 8.5 HPC [image](../images.md) is now an option for clusters
* The unsupported Log4j 1.x version has been replaced with Reload4j

## Resolved Issues:

* In some usage patterns, CycleCloud would use much more disk space than needed
* Some fonts were being served from a public CDN, causing missing icons in environments with restricted network access.
* Nodes in an MPI scaleset could sometimes be stuck in `Acquiring` instead of showing an error
* The `Activity` and `Monitoring` tabs on the clusters page only appeared for users with administrative rights
* The Windows Remote Desktop username and password were visible to authenticated users without node login permissions.
* The CycleCloud CLI would error when using Python version 3.8 or higher
* Slurm nodes would sometimes get `Unknown deallocate` or `Unknown delete` errors
* CycleCloud would hit an error if a load balancer was attached to a scaleset without a public IP
