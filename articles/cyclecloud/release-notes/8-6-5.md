# CycleCloud version 8.6.5 

## New Features

* CycleServer tracks and logs internal performance metrics like CPU and memory usage
* The CycleCloud almalinux8 image now uses the AlmaLinux 8.10 HPC image by default rather than the deprecated AlmaLinux 8.7 HPC image.

## Resolved Issues

* Clusters with no owner failed to converge with UserData.processNode errors
* The health monitor URL could trigger excessive garbage collection under load
* CycleCloud could incorrectly use a loopback address (127.0.0.*) as its cluster address after its VM rebooted.
* The Event Log page used far more resources than necessary to query data.
* Clusters using AlmaLinux 8.10 failed to converge due to missing lvm2 package (resulting in vgscan errors).
* Resolved CVE-2024-47554, CVE-2024-43485, CVE-2024-45801
