# CycleCloud version 8.2.1

## New Features:

* Slurm hostnames now match their node names, via Azure DNS
* [VMSS Force Delete](~/articles/cyclecloud/how-to/terminate-cluster.md#force-delete-vms) is supported (if enabled)

## Resolved Issues:

* CycleCloud would sometimes get into a mode where connections failed with `__getattribute__ not found on type HttpsURLConnectionImpl` until it was restarted
* When editing accounts, the credential's default region was erroneously reset to WestUS.
* In some cases, CycleCloud requested Azure metrics for an interval that was too large and got errors
* Spot VM evictions that occurred while VMs were booting were not handled properly
* Certain VM errors were incorrectly classified as a VM error rather than a no-spot-capacity indicator
* Catching up on metrics could cause an out-of-memory error if CycleCloud had been off for an extended time
* Various accessibility improvements
