# CycleCloud version 8.2.1

## New features:

* Slurm hostnames now match their node names via Azure DNS.
* [Force-delete virtual machines](~/articles/cyclecloud/how-to/terminate-cluster.md#force-delete-virtual-machines) is supported (if enabled).

## Resolved issues:

* CycleCloud sometimes got into a mode where connections failed with `__getattribute__ not found on type HttpsURLConnectionImpl` until it was restarted.
* When editing accounts, the credential's default region erroneously reset to WestUS.
* In some cases, CycleCloud requested Azure metrics for an interval that was too large and got errors.
* Spot virtual machine evictions occurring while VMs were booting weren't handled properly.
* Certain VM errors were classified incorrectly as a VM error rather than as a no-spot-capacity indicator.
* Catching up on metrics could cause an out-of-memory error if CycleCloud had been off for an extended time.
* Various accessibility improvements
