# CycleCloud version 8.7.1

## New Features 

* The [Slurm cluster](../slurm.md) template now configures the */sched* volume to be persistent by default 
* The [Slurm cluster](../slurm.md) template now allows users to add resource tags to execute nodearrays under the **Advanced Settings** menu 
* The [Slurm cluster](../slurm.md) template now offers users the option to disable creating the dynamic partition with a checkbox in the **Advanced Settings** menu 
* The [Slurm cluster](../slurm.md) template now uses `MaxCount` in place of `MaxCoreCount`; users set a maximum number of nodes rather than cores for each partition 
* The [Slurm cluster](../slurm.md) template features a GPU partition 
* The [Slurm cluster](../slurm.md) template provides a separate option for OS images and cluster-init specs for login nodes 
* The [Slurm cluster](../slurm.md) template sets the */sched* directory to be persistent 
* The [CycleCloud CLI Entra authentication preview](../how-to/create-app-registration.md) now offers a `--use-device-code` option to skip browser-interactive authentication on hosts with no browser 
* The [CycleCloud CLI Entra authentication preview](../how-to/create-app-registration.md) now provides support for initialization with a Service Principal or Managed ID 
* The max header size is now configurable, and the default was increased to 16k 

## Resolved Issues 

* The [Slurm cluster](../slurm.md) type failed if the cluster name contained a dash (“-”) 
* The munge service for Slurm clusters was not set to restart upon reboot 
* Nodes in the Slurm dynamic nodes partition were registered incorrectly due to a missing gres flag during slurmd initialization 
* Slurm no longer reports an incorrect number of GPUs for the NDv5 VMs 
* Enabling builtin NFS for */sched* with parameter NFSAddress defined caused converge failures on execute nodes
* On-boot Node Health Checks failed on the most recent HPC VM image versions 
* The unused Thunderball Chef cookbook and references have been removed 
* The Active Directory and LDAP authentication forms were empty even after being configured 
* The DataStore **Export** UI widget failed to work when the button was clicked 
* The **Edit Cluster** dialog was slower than expected for clusters with many node arrays 
* Initializing CLI with as a user with the basic User role sometimes failed 
* The CycleCloud CLI had insufficient logging for Entra authentication failures 

## Known Issues 

* HPC Pack Broker nodes fail to converge breaking SOA workloads.  This will be resolved in the next release. 
* The Altair GridEngine demo release is no longer supported.   Altair GridEngine users must [upload their licensed GridEngine installer binary](../gridengine.md#copy-the-binaries-into-the-cloud-locker) to their CycleCloud Storage Locker. 
* On some Ubuntu systems, the “cycle_server_webserver” service may be flagged by the needrestart tool and trigger a CycleCloud restart on apt package install or upgrade.   This may be worked around by running the following snippet (as root on the CycleCloud VM): 
    ```bash
    mkdir -p /etc/needrestart/conf.d
    echo 'push(@{$nrconf{blacklist_mappings}}, qr(^/opt/cycle_server/system/tomcat/temp/));' > /etc/needrestart/conf.d/cycle_server.conf
    ```
