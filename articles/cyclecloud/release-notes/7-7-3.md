# CycleCloud version 7.7.3

This patch release includes performance and usability improvements, and bug fixes.

Major usability improvements include changes to facilitate the use of selinux with CycleCloud orchestrated clusters.

## Resolved Issues:
 * Corrected selinux access controls on cluster user's home directories.
 * Nodes in a terminated cluster could be started
 * CLI `show_node` command would fail with a "500 Server Error" message
 * PBS nodes in the 'down' state took too long to terminate. Timeout can now be configured via `pbspro.remove_down_nodes`.
 * Fixed issue where nodes assigned to a VMSS would fail to start due to `AttributesOutOfDate` being set
 * Uploading projects would fail if the storage account was empty.
 * Storage accounts are now created with secure transfer required (https-only).
 * Selecting multiple custom image references on a cluster resulted in all nodes using the same image.
 * Azure HTTP trace logs were truncated
 * Uploading files with spaces would sometimes fail.
 * The Add Nodes dialog box did not work if the node array machine type was unset
