# CycleCloud version 7.7.2

This patch release fixes a number of PBS and SGE issues.

## New Features:
 * Uploading projects with the CLI no longer requires manual credential setup.
 * Added boot diagnostics support for Nodes and Nodearrays

## Resolved Issues:
 * In some cases, the quota information displayed did not match the actual Azure quota
 * The default maximum size for single-placement-group scalesets was too small
 * Nodearrays using an image with embedded data disks would not start
 * Custom static nodes in the same cluster caused PBS autoscale to fail.
 * Auto-generated SSL certificates were not renewed frequently enough
 * Old style `-l nodes` PBS submissions caused autoscale issues once the jobs started running
 * Some Insights resources defined in an ARM deployment would fail 'environment' creation
 * ARM parameter validation during 'environment' allocation failed valid parameters
 * Multinode SGE jobs would not run by default
 * Adding more nodes that the size of a placement group resulted in more than one placement group
 * `Azure.MaxScalesetSize` was ignored for single-placement-group scalesets
