# CycleCloud version 8.0.2

## New Features:
 * [Node and cluster events](~/articles/cyclecloud/events.md) can be published to EventGrid
 * Upgraded built-in CentOS image references to 7.7 for cloud-init support
 * [VM images requiring a purchase plan](../how-to/create-custom-image.md#use-an-azure-marketplace-image-with-a-pricing-plan) are now supported (e.g., RHEL)
 * Logging level and error reporting (to Email and Microsoft Teams) have a new simplified dialog box
 * LSF scheduler configs now include extended GPU syntax.

## Resolved Issues:
 * "Subnet too small" errors (and similar) did not cause nodes to show up as Failed (in red)
 * VM agent errors on VM start from deallocation were not handled properly
 * Mitigated CVE-2020-11996 (DDoS attack against Tomcat)
 * In some cases, the "node installation succeeded" event was missed and a node would stay in the "Failed" state (regression in 8.0.1)
 * Spot VMs would show up with regular pricing (regression in 8.0.1)
 * Scalesets with more than 100 VMs had errors on orchestration (regression in 8.0.1)
 * Termination of unavailable/failed nodes can get stuck and fail to delete the VM
 * Ephemeral OS Disk would fail with "ReadOnly caching" error (regression in 8.0.1)
 * Table views in the browser could not be edited (regression in 8.0.1)
 * "Error in task Collecting metrics" was logged if a node had no VM (regression in 8.0.1)
