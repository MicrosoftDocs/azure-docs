# CycleCloud version 8.4.2

## New Features:

* Clusters can now be [moved to another resource group](../how-to/move-resource-group.md)
* Slurm: Optionally choose Availability Zone for the Main and/or Backup scheduler (when using HA) 

## Resolved Issues:

* `cyclecloud project upload` failed with "expected str" message if `azcopy` was not installed 
* The Import button on the Subscriptions page failed with "This field is required"
* Jetpack depended on an out of date version of 'cryptography'
* Editing a cloud account would clear the single-resource-group setting, if it was set
* Slurm HA backup schedulers failed to join the cluster due to incorrect hostname in slurm.conf
* `/shared/home` was not the default home dir in some environments with Slurm
* Failures in customer cluster-init scripts would not prevent slurmd from starting
* Nodes in a cluster at version 7.x failed to start with a "userdata" error
