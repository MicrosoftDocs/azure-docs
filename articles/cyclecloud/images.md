# Images

Azure CycleCloud ships with support for standard operating systems. You can specify the image with `ImageName`, which may be a CycleCloud image name, an image URN, or the resource ID of a custom image: 

``` ini
# CycleCloud image name
[[node defaults]]
ImageName = cycle.image.win2022

# Image URN (publisher:offer:sku:version)
[[node defaults]]
ImageName = MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2022-datacenter-g2:latest

# Image resource ID
[[node defaults]]
ImageName = /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/MyCustomImage
```

Alternatively, you can use `Image` which supports image labels:

``` ini
[[node defaults]]
Image = Windows 2022 DataCenter
```

When an exact version is not specified, CycleCloud automatically uses the latest released version of the image for the region that the node is in.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using a custom (non-standard) image that was created with Jetpack, you can set `AwaitInstallation=true` on the node, specifying that the image supports sending status messages back to CycleCloud. This will allow for more accurate representations of the node's state within CycleCloud.

CycleCloud currently includes the following images:
