A _device_ in Azure IoT Operations is a logical entity that defines the connections to physical assets or devices. Without a device, data can't flow from a physical device or asset to the MQTT broker. When you configure a device and asset, a connection is established to the physical asset or device and data point values, events, and streams arrive in Azure IoT Operations instance. A device has one or more inbound endpoints. Azure IoT Operations stores device definitions in the Azure Device Registry.
