An _asset_ in Azure IoT Operations is a logical entity that you create to represent a physical asset or device. An Azure IoT Operations asset can have custom properties, data points, streams, and events that describe its behavior and characteristics. An asset is associated with one or more devices. Azure IoT Operations stores asset definitions in the Azure Device Registry.
