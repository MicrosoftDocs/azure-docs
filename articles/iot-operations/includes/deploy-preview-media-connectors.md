When you deploy the preview version of Azure IoT Operations, the deployment includes the three preview connectors. You can verify that you have a preview instance of Azure IoT Operations by checking in the Azure portal that preview features are enabled for your instance:

Before you can use the preview connectors (ONVIF, media, and REST/HTTP) in the operations experience web UI, an administrator must add connector template instances to your Azure IoT Operations instance.

All three preview connectors can publish captured data to the MQTT broker. The media connector can also save captured data to storage. Azure IoT Operations uses [Azure Container Storage enabled by Azure Arc](/azure/azure-arc/container-storage/overview) to transfer the captured data to cloud storage destinations such as Azure Blob Storage. When you configure a connector template instance, you specify a _persistent volume claim_ and _mount path_ for the connector to use to save captured data. To learn how to create a suitable persistent volume claim, see [Cloud Ingest Edge Volumes configuration](/azure/azure-arc/container-storage/cloud-ingest-edge-volume-configuration).

To add a connector template instance to your Azure IoT Operations instance:

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Azure IoT Operations instance, select **Connector templates**, and then select **Add connector template instances**:

1. On the first page of the **Add an Akri connector template** wizard, select the type of connector template you want to add, such as **ONVIF**, **Media**, or **HTTP REST**. Then select **Metadata**.

1. On the **Metadata** page, accept the defaults, and then select **Device inbound endpoint type**.

1. On the **Device inbound endpoint type** page, accept the defaults, and then select **Diagnostics configurations**.

1. On the **Diagnostics configurations** page, accept the defaults, and then select **Runtime configuration**.

1. On the **Runtime configuration** page, select **Add a volume claim** and enter the details of the persistent volume claim you created previously. Then select **Review**:

1. On the **Review** page, review the details of the connector template instance, and then select **Create** to create the connector template instance.

An OT user can now use the operations experience web UI to create a device with a preview connector endpoint.
