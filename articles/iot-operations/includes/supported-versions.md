Microsoft always supports three generally available (GA) versions of Azure IoT Operations at any one time: the latest version, and the two previous minor versions.

Currently, there are only two minor versions available. [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans) is currently available for the following versions:

- [1.2.x](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-operations/releases/tag/v1.2.36) (latest preview version)
- [1.1.x](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-operations/releases/tag/v1.1.59) (latest GA version)
- [1.0.x](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-operations/releases/tag/v1.0.9) (previous minor GA version)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Previous minor versions don't receive security patches. Always upgrade to the latest version to ensure you have the latest security updates and features.

To verify your current version, see the overview page for your Azure IoT Operations instance in the Azure portal or use the Azure IoT Operations CLI [az iot ops instance show](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-show) command.
