Microsoft always supports three generally available (GA) versions of Azure IoT Operations at any one time: the latest version, and two previous minor versions.

Currently, there are only two minor versions available. The currently supported versions are:

- [1.1.x](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-operations/releases/tag/v1.1.19) (latest GA version)
- [1.0.x](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-operations/releases/tag/v1.0.9) (previous minor GA version)

To verify your current version, see the overview page for your Azure IoT Operations instance in the Azure portal or use the Azure IoT Operations CLI [az iot ops instance show](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-show) command.
