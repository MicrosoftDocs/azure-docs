Azure IoT Operations uses the terms *namespace asset* and *device* to refer to configuration resources. These configuration resources don't map directly to the physical assets and devices in your environment. Instead, they define how a connector in Azure IoT Operations connects to and interacts with the physical assets and devices in your environment. In Azure IoT Operations:

- A *device (preview)* is a configuration resource that encapsulates the connection information required to connect to one or more physical devices or assets.
- A *namespace asset (preview)* is a configuration resource that encapsulates information about the data that a physical asset or device exchanges with IoT Operations.
