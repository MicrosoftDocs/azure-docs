# Configure the connector for HTTP/REST

In Azure IoT Operations, the connector for HTTP/REST enables access to data from REST endpoints exposed by HTTP services.

[!INCLUDE [iot-operations-asset-definition](../includes/iot-operations-asset-definition.md)]

[!INCLUDE [iot-operations-device-definition](../includes/iot-operations-device-definition.md)]

The following table summarizes the features the connector for HTTP/REST currently supports:

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
|---------|:---------:|-------|
| Username/password authentication | Yes | Basic HTTP authentication |
| X.509 user certificates | Yes | Certificates for client authentication and authorization |
| Anonymous access | Yes | For testing purposes |
| Southbound certificate trust list | Yes | For secure TLS connections to the HTTP endpoint |
| OpenTelemetry integration | Yes | |
| Automatic retries | Yes | Reports failed status for nonretryable errors |
| WASM data transformation | Yes | Optionally transform incoming data |
| Schema generation | Yes | Registers inferred schema with the schema registry |

For each configured dataset, the connector for HTTP/REST:

1. Performs a GET request to the address specified in the device endpoint and appends the dataset's data source from the asset.
1. Generates a message schema for each dataset based on the data it receives, and registers it with the schema registry in Azure Device Registry.
1. Forwards the data to the specified destination.

This article explains how to use the connector for HTTP/REST to perform tasks such as:

- Define the devices that connect HTTP sources to your Azure IoT Operations instance.
- Add assets, and define the data points to enable the data flow from the HTTP source to the MQTT broker or [broker state store](../develop-edge-apps/overview-state-store.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure devices and assets, you need a running instance of Azure IoT Operations.

[!INCLUDE [iot-operations-entra-id-setup](../includes/iot-operations-entra-id-setup.md)]

Your IT administrator must configure the connector for HTTP/REST template for your Azure IoT Operations instance in the Azure portal.

You need any credentials required to access the HTTP source. If the HTTP source requires authentication, you need to create a Kubernetes secret that contains the username and password for the HTTP source.

## Deploy the connector for HTTP/REST

[!INCLUDE [deploy-connectors-simple](../includes/deploy-connectors-simple.md)]

### Configure a certificate trust list for the connector

[!INCLUDE [connector-certificate-application](../includes/connector-certificate-application.md)]

## Create a device

To configure the connector for HTTP/REST, first create a device that defines the connection to the HTTP source. The device includes the URL of the HTTP source and any credentials you need to access the HTTP source:

# [Operations experience](#tab/portal)

1. In the operations experience web UI, select **Devices** in the left navigation pane. Then select **Create new**.

1. Enter a name for your device, such as `http-connector`. To add the endpoint for the connector for HTTP/REST, select **New** on the **Microsoft.Http** tile.

1. Add the details of the endpoint for the connector for HTTP/REST including any authentication credentials:

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-use-http-connector/add-http-connector-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to add a connector for HTTP/REST endpoint." lightbox="media/howto-use-http-connector/add-http-connector-endpoint.png":::

    Select **Apply** to save the endpoint.

1. On the **Device details** page, select **Next** to continue.

1. On the **Add custom property** page, add any other properties you want to associate with the device. For example, you might add a property to indicate the manufacturer of the camera. Then select **Next** to continue.

1. On the **Summary** page, review the details of the device and select **Create** to create the asset.

1. After the device is created, you can view it in the **Devices** list:

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-use-http-connector/http-connector-device-created.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the list of devices." lightbox="media/howto-use-http-connector/http-connector-device-created.png":::

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Run the following commands:

```azurecli
az iot ops ns device create -n rest-http-connector-cli -g {your resource group name} --instance {your instance name} 

az iot ops ns device endpoint inbound add rest --device rest-http-connector-cli -g {your resource group name} -i {your instance name}  --name rest-http-connector-0 --endpoint-address "https://rest-http-connector-0"
```

To learn more, see [az iot ops ns device](/cli/azure/iot/ops/ns/device).

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

Deploy the following Bicep template to create a device with an inbound endpoint for the HTTP/REST connector. Replace the placeholders `<AIO_NAMESPACE_NAME>` and `<CUSTOM_LOCATION_NAME>` with your Azure IoT Operations namespace name and custom location name respectively:

```bicep
param aioNamespaceName string = '<AIO_NAMESPACE_NAME>'
param customLocationName string = '<CUSTOM_LOCATION_NAME>'

resource namespace 'Microsoft.DeviceRegistry/namespaces@2025-10-01' existing = {
  name: aioNamespaceName
}

resource customLocation 'Microsoft.ExtendedLocation/customLocations@2021-08-31-preview' existing = {
  name: customLocationName
}

resource device 'Microsoft.DeviceRegistry/namespaces/devices@2025-10-01' = {
  name: 'http-connector'
  parent: namespace
  location: resourceGroup().location
  extendedLocation: {
    type: 'CustomLocation'
    name: customLocation.id
  }
  properties: {
    endpoints: {
      outbound: {
        assigned: {}
      }
      inbound: {
        'http-connector-0': {
          endpointType: 'Microsoft.Http'
          address: 'https://rest-http-connector-0'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration deploys a new `device` resource called `http-connector` to the cluster with an inbound endpoint called `http-connector-0`.

### Configure a device to use a username and password

The previous example uses the `Anonymous` authentication mode. This mode doesn't require a username or password.

To use the `Username password` authentication mode, complete the following steps:

# [Operations experience](#tab/portal)

[!INCLUDE [connector-username-password-portal](../includes/connector-username-password-portal.md)]

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

[!INCLUDE [connector-username-password-cli](../includes/connector-username-password-cli.md)]

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

[!INCLUDE [connector-username-password-bicep](../includes/connector-username-password-bicep.md)]

---

### Configure a device to use an X.509 certificate

[!INCLUDE [connector-certificate-user](../includes/connector-certificate-user.md)]

## Create an asset

To define an asset that publishes data points from the HTTP endpoint, follow these steps:

# [Operations experience](#tab/portal)

1. In the operations experience web UI, select **Assets** in the left navigation pane. Then select **Create asset**.

1. Select the inbound endpoint for the connector for HTTP/REST that you created in the previous section.

1. Enter a name for your asset, such as `my-http-source`.

1. Add any custom properties you want to associate with the asset. For example, you might add a property to indicate the manufacturer of the camera. Select **Next** to continue.

A dataset defines where the connector sends the data it collects from a collection of data points. An HTTP/REST asset can have multiple datasets. To create a dataset:

1. Select **Create dataset**.

1. Enter the details for the dataset such as its name, data source, sampling interval, and destination. For HTTP/REST assets, the data source is the path on the REST endpoint. For HTTP/REST assets, the destination is either an MQTT topic or a [broker state store](../develop-edge-apps/overview-state-store.md) key. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-use-http-connector/create-dataset.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to create a dataset in the operations experience." lightbox="media/howto-use-http-connector/create-dataset.png":::

    To transform the incoming data, add the URL of a WebAssembly (WASM) module in the **Transform** field. To learn more, see [Transform incoming data](#transform-incoming-data).

1. Select **Create and next** to create the dataset.

    > [!TIP]
    > Use the **Manage default settings** option to configure default dataset settings such as the sampling interval.

1. On the **Review** page, review the details of the asset and select **Create** to create the asset. After a few minutes, the asset is listed on the **Assets** page:

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-use-http-connector/http-asset-created.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the list of assets." lightbox="media/howto-use-http-connector/http-asset-created.png":::

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Run the following commands:

```azurecli
az iot ops ns asset rest create --name myrestasset --instance {your instance name} -g {your resource group name} --device rest-http-connector-cli --endpoint rest-http-connector-0

az iot ops ns asset rest dataset add --asset myrestasset --instance {your instance name} -g {your resource group name} --name weatherdata --data-source "/api/weather" --dest topic="azure-iot-operations/data/erp" retain=Never qos=Qos1 ttl=3600 --sampling-int 30000
```

For more information, see [az iot ops ns asset rest](/cli/azure/iot/ops/ns/asset/rest).

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

Deploy the following Bicep template to create an asset that publishes messages from the device shown previously to an MQTT topic. The data source of the dataset defines the path on the REST endpoint to query. Replace the placeholders `<AIO_NAMESPACE_NAME>` and `<CUSTOM_LOCATION_NAME>` with your Azure IoT Operations namespace name and custom location name respectively:

```bicep
param aioNamespaceName string = '<AIO_NAMESPACE_NAME>'
param customLocationName string = '<CUSTOM_LOCATION_NAME>'

resource namespace 'Microsoft.DeviceRegistry/namespaces@2025-10-01' existing = {
  name: aioNamespaceName
}

resource customLocation 'Microsoft.ExtendedLocation/customLocations@2021-08-31-preview' existing = {
  name: customLocationName
}

resource asset 'Microsoft.DeviceRegistry/namespaces/assets@2025-10-01' = {
  name: 'myrestasset'
  parent: namespace
  location: resourceGroup().location
  extendedLocation: {
    type: 'CustomLocation'
    name: customLocation.id
  }
  properties: {
    displayName: 'myrestasset'
    description: 'An example HTTP asset'
    enabled: true

    deviceRef: {
      deviceName: 'http-connector'
      endpointName: 'http-connector-0'
    }

    defaultDatasetsConfiguration: '{}'
    defaultEventsConfiguration: '{}'

    datasets: [
      {
        name: 'weatherdata'
        dataSource: '/api/weather'
        datasetConfiguration: '{"samplingIntervalInMilliseconds":20000}'
        destinations: [
          {
            target: 'Mqtt'
            configuration: {
              topic: 'azure-iot-operations/data/erp'
              qos: 'Qos1'
              retain: 'Never'
              ttl: 3600
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

```
