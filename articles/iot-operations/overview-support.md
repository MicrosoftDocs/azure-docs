# Azure IoT Operations versions and support

This article explains the supported versions, environments, and regions for Azure IoT Operations, along with its key dependencies and related resources. Use this guide to ensure compatibility and optimize your deployment.

## Supported versions

[!INCLUDE [supported-versions](includes/supported-versions.md)]

## Supported environments

[!INCLUDE [supported-environments-table](includes/supported-environments-table.md)]

## Supported regions

Azure IoT Operations supports Arc-enabled clusters in these regions:

| Region       | CLI value   |
|--------------|-------------|
| East US      | eastus      |
| East US 2    | eastus2     |
| West US      | westus      |
| West US 2    | westus2     |
| West US 3    | westus3     |
| West Europe  | westeurope  |
| North Europe | northeurope |
| Germany West Central | germanywestcentral |

This list applies only to the region you use to connect your cluster to Azure Arc. It doesn't limit you from using your preferred Azure region for cloud resources. Azure IoT Operations components and other resources deployed to clusters in these regions connect to cloud resources in different regions.
