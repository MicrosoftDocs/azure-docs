[instructions troubleshooting -general](contribute-how-to-general-troubleshoot.md) in the pattern
library.

We write general troubleshooting articles when a specific error message isn't known.

<!-- 1. H1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: The headline (H1) is the primary heading at the top of the article. Pick an H1 that
clearly conveys what the content's about.

The heading of the general troubleshooting article should concisely describe the issue that the
customer is trying to fix. Make sure to include the word **troubleshoot** somewhere in the H1 of the
article to improve SEO.

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required: Lead with a light intro that describes, in customer-friendly language, what the customer
will do. Answer the fundamental “why would I want to do this?” question. Keep it short. Readers
should have a clear idea of what they will do in this article after reading the introduction.

<!-- 3. Prerequisites --------------------------------------------------------------------

unambiguous language and use a unordered list format. If there are specific versions of software a
user needs, call out those versions (for example: Visual Studio 2019 or later). It's OK to link to
content to assist them before they begin.
