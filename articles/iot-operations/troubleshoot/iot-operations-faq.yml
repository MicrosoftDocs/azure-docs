title: Azure IoT Operations frequently asked questions
summary: |
  This article provides a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) for Azure IoT Operations and their answers.

sections:
  - name: General
    questions:
    - question: |
         Does Azure IoT Operations offer a free trial?
      answer: Currently, No
    - question: |
         What are the hardware requirements?
      answer: For more information on hardware requirements, see Please see [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes system requirements](/azure-arc/kubernetes/system-requirements).
    - question: |
         What is the cost involved in using Azure IoT Operations?
      answer: We are currently working on the pricing. Providing any price indication right now has some challenges like the pricing may change when it goes to GA, it requires justifications and exec sign offs etc.
    - question: |
         Is message persistence supported?
      answer: At Azure IoT Operations GA1, full message persistence is not going to be supported - the capability will be added post-GA.
    - question: |
         Does Azure IoT Operations offer High Availability and Zero Data loss as GA features?
      answer: Azure IoT Operations workloads on K3s and HCI/Aks-Arc multi-node clusters should support distribution of Azure IoT Operations workloads across multi-nodes setups taking advantage of fault tolerance and Kubernetes scheduling of pods across nodes. The expected timeline for this is GA
    - question: |
         Can I migrate my IoT Edge workloads to Azure IoT Operations?
      answer: At this point, there is no documented migration path from IoT Edge to Azure IoT Operations. In the future we will have some more targeted migration. If you have any feature asks for Azure IoT Operations as part of any migration you're planning to do, please relay this back to us.
    - question: |
         Can I just upgrade my preview version to GA version?
      answer: No, you won't be able to upgrade from the preview to GA version directly. You'll need to redeploy. Upgrade scenario will be available post-GA
    - question: |
         What Kubernetes distros are compatible with Azure IoT Operations?
      answer: Azure IoT Operations is only officially supported on two platforms now Ubuntu+K3s, Windows IoT + AKS EE. For more information, see [Prepare your Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster](../deploy-iot-ops/howto-prepare-cluster.md). We are adding support for Stack HCI 23H2 + AKS Hybrid. The rest of the platform combinations are supported by GA. This platform will expand over time.
    - question: |
         For IoT Operations, which device comm protocols are going to be supported out-of-the-box in GA?
      answer: At GA we will support OPC UA and MQTT. There are many devices and protocol bridges that exist in-market to enable customers to connect much of the existing device ecosystem via these two protocols. After GA we will add ONVIF and Media Stream support [Camera use cases] and enable a third-party ecosystem to allow ISVs (or other Microsoft teams) to build pluggable protocols for other environments like Medical, etc.
    - question: |
         Is there a non-Dapr Azure IoT Operations state store code example?
      answer: |
        At this point we don't have an example/asset for external use. However, the StateStore documentation can help you understand how it can be used. For more information, see [MQTT broker state store protocol](../create-edge-apps/concept-about-state-store-protocol.md) For an SDK there is an upcoming Akri, MQ SDK which will simplify using StateStore, currently only in .NET This won't be available until Azure IoT Operations goes to GA later this year. The [SDKs](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/explore-akri-sdk/) will be initially available in Rust, Go and .NET.
    - question: |
         MQTT with QOS 2. Is this in the roadmap for IoT Operations MQ
      answer: For Azure IoT Operations, it is on the backlog but not prioritized yet. QoS 2 will not be supported in the initial Azure IoT Operations GA.
    - question: |
         Which Azure regions is Azure IoT Operations currently available in?
      answer: Azure IoT Operations is available in East US2, West US 3, West Europe, East US, West US, West US 2, North Europe regions. We plan to add support for Taiwan, Japan, EU, and China later.
    - question: |
         Is there a way to gracefully fail over between two redundant OPC UA servers in case one of them fails. The idea is to have minimal/zero data loss and no reconfiguration effort.
      answer: Yes, we have this as a feature on our roadmap for post Azure IoT Operations GA.
    - question: |
         Is there a hard limit on the sampling intervals for OPC UA tags for minimum and maximum sampling interval?
      answer: The minimum is 1ms, however there is no upper restriction imposed at the connector level
    - question: |
         How do I write my own apps?
      answer: |
        Answer.
    - question: |
         Does Azure IoT Operations already work on multi-node setups? If not, what would be the expected timeline for this?
      answer: |
        Answer.
    - question: |
         Will Azure IoT Operations be able to support private endpoints with Azure IoT Operations clusters.
      answer: |
        Answer.
