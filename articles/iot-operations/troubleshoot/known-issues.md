# Known issues: Azure IoT Operations

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-note](../includes/public-preview-note.md)]

This article contains known issues for Azure IoT Operations Preview.

## Azure IoT Operations

- QoS0 is not currently supported.

- You must use the Azure CLI interactive login `az login`. If you don't you might see an error such as _ERROR: AADSTS530003: Your device is required to be managed to access this resource_.

## Azure IoT MQ (preview)

- You can only access the default deployment only accessible by using the cluster IP, TLS, and a service account token.

- Clients outside the cluster need additional configuration before they can connect.

- You can't update the Broker custom resource after the initial deployment. You can't make configuration changes to cardinality, memory profile, or disk buffer.

- You can't configure the size of a disk-backed buffer unless your chosen storage class supports it.

- Resource synchronization isn't currently supported: updating a custom resource in the cluster doesn't reflect to Azure.

- QoS2 isn't currently available.

- Full persistence support isn't currently available.

## Azure IoT Data Processor (preview)

If edits you make to a pipeline aren't applied to messages, run the following commands to propagate the changes:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment aio-dp-operator -n azure-iot-operations 

kubectl rollout restart statefulset aio-dp-runner-worker -n azure-iot-operations 

kubectl rollout restart statefulset aio-dp-reader-worker -n azure-iot-operations
```
