# Clean up observability resources
This article shows how to clean up the observability resources in your cluster without removing the cluster itself. 

## Delete resources

To uninstall the observability resources, complete the following steps.

1. Browse to the resource group where you installed the shared resources, and delete the following resources:

    - Azure Monitor Workspace
    - Azure Managed Grafana
    - Log Analytics Workspace
    - Container Insights Solution

    For a resource group with a single cluster connected, the following screenshot shows what the list of resources looks like:

1. Browse to the resource group where your cluster is located (if different from the resource group for the previous resources). Delete the following resources: 

    - The data collection endpoint
    - The two data collection rules (one ends with "logsDataCollectionRule" and the other ends with "metricsDataCollectionRule")
    - The two recording rule groups (one ends with "KubernetesRecordingRuleGroup" and the other ends with "NodeRecordingRuleGroup")

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You might need to run the delete more than once for all resources to be successfully deleted. 

## Delete the configuration from your cluster

Finally, you can remove the configuration that was installed on your cluster. To do that, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete -f ama-metrics-prometheus-config.yaml
```
