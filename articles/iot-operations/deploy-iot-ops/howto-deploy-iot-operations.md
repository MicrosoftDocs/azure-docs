# Deploy Azure IoT Operations to an Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster

Learn how to deploy Azure IoT Operations to a Kubernetes cluster using the Azure portal.

In this article, we discuss Azure IoT Operations *deployments* and *instances*, which are two different concepts:

* An Azure IoT Operations *deployment* describes all of the components and resources that enable the Azure IoT Operations scenario. These components and resources include:
  * An Azure IoT Operations instance
  * Arc extensions
  * Custom locations
  * Resources that you can configure in your Azure IoT Operations solution, like assets and asset endpoints.

* An Azure IoT Operations *instance* is the parent resource that bundles the suite of services that are defined in [What is Azure IoT Operations?](../overview-iot-operations.md) like MQTT broker, data flows, and connector for OPC UA.

When we talk about deploying Azure IoT Operations, we mean the full set of components that make up a *deployment*. Once the deployment exists, you can view, manage, and update the *instance*.

## Prerequisites

Cloud resources:

* An Azure subscription.

* Azure access permissions. For more information, see [Deployment details > Required permissions](overview-deploy.md#required-permissions).

Development resources:

* Azure CLI installed on your development machine. This scenario requires Azure CLI version 2.64.0 or higher. Use `az --version` to check your version and `az upgrade` to update if necessary. For more information, see [How to install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

* The Azure IoT Operations extension for Azure CLI. Use the following command to add the extension or update it to the latest version:

  ```azurecli
  az extension add --upgrade --name azure-iot-ops
  ```

A cluster host:

* Have an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster with the custom location and workload identity features enabled. If you don't have one, follow the steps in [Prepare your Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster](./howto-prepare-cluster.md).

  If you deployed Azure IoT Operations to your cluster previously, uninstall those resources before continuing. For more information, see [Update Azure IoT Operations](./howto-manage-update-uninstall.md#uninstall).

* (Optional) Prepare your cluster for observability before deploying Azure IoT Operations: [Configure observability](../configure-observability-monitoring/howto-configure-observability.md).

* (Optional) Configure your own certificate authority issuer before deploying Azure IoT Operations: [Bring your own issuer](../secure-iot-ops/concept-default-root-ca.md#bring-your-own-issuer).

## Deploy

The Azure portal deployment experience is a helper tool that generates a deployment command based on your resources and configuration. The final step is to run an Azure CLI command, so you still need the Azure CLI prerequisites described in the previous section.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for and select **Azure IoT Operations**.

1. Select **Create**.

1. On the **Basics** tab, provide the following information:

   | Parameter | Value |
   | --------- | ----- |
   | **Subscription** | Select the subscription that contains your Arc-enabled cluster. |
   | **Resource group** | Select the resource group that contains your Arc-enabled cluster. |
   | **Cluster name** | Select the cluster that you want to deploy Azure IoT Operations to. |
   | **Custom location name** | *Optional*: Replace the default name for the custom location. |

   :::image type="content" source="./media/howto-deploy-iot-operations/deploy-basics.png" alt-text="A screenshot that shows the first tab for deploying Azure IoT Operations from the portal.":::

1. Select **Next: Configuration**.

1. On the **Configuration** tab, provide the following information:

   | Parameter | Value |
   | --------- | ----- |
   | **Azure IoT Operations name** | *Optional*: Replace the default name for the Azure IoT Operations instance. |
   | **MQTT broker configuration** | *Optional*: Edit the default settings for the MQTT broker. In Azure portal it's possible to [configure cardinality and memory profile settings](../manage-mqtt-broker/howto-configure-availability-scale.md). To configure other settings including disk-backed message buffer and advanced MQTT client options, see [Azure CLI support for advanced MQTT broker configuration](https://aka.ms/aziotops-broker-config). |
   | **Data flow profile configuration** | *Optional*: Edit the default settings for data flows. For more information, see [Configure data flow profile](../connect-to-cloud/howto-configure-dataflow-profile.md). |

   :::image type="content" source="./media/howto-deploy-iot-operations/deploy-configuration.png" alt-text="A screenshot that shows the second tab for deploying Azure IoT Operations from the portal.":::

1. Select **Next: Dependency management**.

1. On the **Dependency management** tab, select an existing schema registry or use these steps to create one:

   1. Select **Create new**.

   1. Provide a **Schema registry name** and **Schema registry namespace**.

   1. Select **Select Azure Storage container**.

   1. Choose a storage account from the list of hierarchical namespace-enabled accounts, or select **Create** to create one.

      Schema registry requires an Azure Storage account with hierarchical namespace and public network access enabled. When creating a new storage account, choose a **General purpose v2** storage account type and set **Hierarchical namespace** to **Enabled**.

   1. Select a container in your storage account or select **Container** to create one.

   1. Select **Apply** to confirm the schema registry configurations.

1. On the **Dependency management** tab, select either the **Test settings** or the **Secure settings** deployment option. If you aren't sure which is right for your scenario, review the guidance in [Deployment details > Choose your features](overview-deploy.md#choose-your-features).

   Depending on your choice, follow the steps to either:

   * [Deploy with test settings](#deploy-with-test-settings), or
   * [Deploy with secure settings](#deploy-with-secure-settings)

### Deploy with test settings

Use these steps if you chose the **Test settings** option on the **Dependency management** tab.

1. Select **Next: Automation**.

1. One at a time, run each Azure CLI command on the **Automation** tab in a terminal:

   1. Sign in to Azure CLI interactively with a browser even if you already signed in before. If you don't sign in interactively, you might get an error that says *Your device is required to be managed to access your resource*.

      ```azurecli
      az login
      ```

   1. Install the latest Azure IoT Operations CLI extension.

      ```azurecli
      az upgrade
      az extension add --upgrade --name azure-iot-ops
      ```

   1. Create a schema registry which will be used by Azure IoT Operations components. Copy and run the provided [az iot ops schema registry create](/cli/azure/iot/ops/schema/registry#az-iot-ops-schema-registry-create) command.

      If you chose to use an existing schema registry, this command isn't displayed on the **Automation** tab.

   1. Prepare the cluster for Azure IoT Operations deployment. Copy and run the provided [az iot ops init](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-init) command.

      >[!TIP]
      >The `init` command only needs to be run once per cluster. If you're reusing a cluster that already had Azure IoT Operations version 0.8.0 deployed on it, you can skip this step.

      If you followed the optional prerequisite to set up your own certificate authority issuer, add the `--user-trust` flag to the `init` command.

      This command might take several minutes to complete. You can watch the progress in the deployment progress display in the terminal.

   1. Deploy Azure IoT Operations. Copy and run the provided [az iot ops create](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-create) command.

      * If you followed the optional prerequisites to prepare your cluster for observability, add the following parameters to the `create` command:

        | Parameter | Value | Description |
        | --------- | ----- | ----------- |
        | `--ops-config` | `observability.metrics.openTelemetryCollectorAddress=<FULLNAMEOVERRIDE>.azure-iot-operations.svc.cluster.local:<GRPC_ENDPOINT>` | Provide the OpenTelemetry (OTel) collector address you configured in the otel-collector-values.yaml file.<br><br>The sample values used in [Configure observability](../configure-observability-monitoring/howto-configure-observability.md) are **fullnameOverride=aio-otel-collector** and **grpc.endpoint=4317**. |
        | `--ops-config` | `observability.metrics.exportInternalSeconds=<CHECK_INTERVAL>` | Provide the **check_interval** value you configured in the otel-collector-values.yaml file.<br><br>The sample value used in [Configure observability](../configure-observability-monitoring/howto-configure-observability.md) is **check_interval=60**. |
  
      * If you followed the optional prerequisites to set up your own certificate authority issuer, add the `--trust-settings` parameters to the `create` command:

        ```bash
        --trust-settings configMapName=<CONFIGMAP_NAME> configMapKey=<CONFIGMAP_KEY_WITH_PUBLICKEY_VALUE> issuerKind=<CLUSTERISSUER_OR_ISSUER> issuerName=<ISSUER_NAME>
        ```

      This command might take several minutes to complete. You can watch the progress in the deployment progress display in the terminal.

1. Once all of the Azure CLI commands complete successfully, you can close the **Install Azure IoT Operations** wizard.

Once the `create` command completes successfully, you have a working Azure IoT Operations instance running on your cluster. At this point, your instance is configured for most testing and evaluation scenarios.

If at any point in the future you want to prepare your instance for production scenarios, follow the steps in [Enable secure settings on an existing Azure IoT Operations instance](./howto-enable-secure-settings.md).

### Deploy with secure settings

Use these steps if you chose the **Secure settings** option on the **Dependency management** tab.

   <!-- :::image type="content" source="./media/howto-deploy-iot-operations/deploy-dependency-management-1.png" alt-text="A screenshot that shows selecting secure settings on the third tab for deploying Azure IoT Operations from the portal."::: -->

1. In the **Deployment options** section, provide the following information:

   | Parameter | Value |
   | --------- | ----- |
   | **Subscription** | Select the subscription that contains your Azure key vault. |
   | **Azure Key Vault** | Select an Azure key vault or select **Create new**.<br><br>Ensure that your key vault has **Azure role-based access control** as its permission model. To check this setting, select **Manage selected vault** > **Settings** > **Access configuration**. <br><br>Ensure to [give your user account permissions to manage secrets](/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-cli#give-your-user-account-permissions-to-manage-secrets-in-key-vault) with the `Key Vault Secrets Officer` role.|
   | **User assigned managed identity for secrets** | Select an identity or select **Create new**. |
   | **User assigned managed identity for AIO components** | Select an identity or select **Create new**. Don't use the same managed identity as the one you selected for secrets. |

   :::image type="content" source="./media/howto-deploy-iot-operations/deploy-dependency-management-2.png" alt-text="A screenshot that shows configuring secure settings on the third tab for deploying Azure IoT Operations from the portal.":::

1. Select **Next: Automation**.

1. One at a time, run each Azure CLI command on the **Automation** tab in a terminal:

   1. Sign in to Azure CLI interactively with a browser even if you already signed in before. If you don't sign in interactively, you might get an error that says *Your device is required to be managed to access your resource* when you continue to the next step to deploy Azure IoT Operations.

      ```azurecli
      az login
      ```

   1. Install the latest Azure IoT Operations CLI extension.

      ```azurecli
      az upgrade
      az extension add --upgrade --name azure-iot-ops
      ```

   1. Create a schema registry which will be used by Azure IoT Operations components. Copy and run the provided [az iot ops schema registry create](/cli/azure/iot/ops/schema/registry#az-iot-ops-schema-registry-create) command.

      If you chose to use an existing schema registry, this command isn't displayed on the **Automation** tab.

      >[!NOTE]
      >This command requires that you have role assignment write permissions because it assigns a role to give schema registry access to the storage account. By default, the role is the built-in **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role, or you can create a custom role with restricted permissions to assign instead. For more information, see [az iot ops schema registry create](/cli/azure/iot/ops/schema/registry#az-iot-ops-schema-registry-create).

   1. Prepare the cluster for Azure IoT Operations deployment. Copy and run the provided [az iot ops init](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-init) command.

      >[!TIP]
      >The `init` command only needs to be run once per cluster. If you're reusing a cluster that already had Azure IoT Operations version 0.8.0 deployed on it, you can skip this step.

      This command might take several minutes to complete. You can watch the progress in the deployment progress display in the terminal.

   1. Deploy Azure IoT Operations. Copy and run the provided [az iot ops create](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-create) command.

      If you followed the optional prerequisites to prepare your cluster for observability, add the following optional parameters to the `create` command:

      | Optional parameter | Value | Description |
      | --------- | ----- | ----------- |
      | `--ops-config` | `observability.metrics.openTelemetryCollectorAddress=<FULLNAMEOVERRIDE>.azure-iot-operations.svc.cluster.local:<GRPC_ENDPOINT>` | Provide the OpenTelemetry (OTel) collector address you configured in the otel-collector-values.yaml file.<br><br>The sample values used in [Configure observability](../configure-observability-monitoring/howto-configure-observability.md) are **fullnameOverride=aio-otel-collector** and **grpc.endpoint=4317**. |
      | `--ops-config` | `observability.metrics.exportInternalSeconds=<CHECK_INTERVAL>` | Provide the **check_interval** value you configured in the otel-collector-values.yaml file.<br><br>The sample value used in [Configure observability](../configure-observability-monitoring/howto-configure-observability.md) is **check_interval=60**. |

      This command might take several minutes to complete. You can watch the progress in the deployment progress display in the terminal.

   1. Enable secret sync for the deployed Azure IoT Operations instance. Copy and run the provided [az iot ops secretsync enable](/cli/azure/iot/ops/secretsync#az-iot-ops-secretsync-enable) command.
   
      This command:

      * Creates a federated identity credential using the user-assigned managed identity.
      * Adds a role assignment to the user-assigned managed identity for access to the Azure Key Vault.
      * Adds a minimum secret provider class associated with the Azure IoT Operations instance.

   1. Assign a user-assigned managed identity to the deployed Azure IoT Operations instance. Copy and run the provided [az iot ops identity assign](/cli/azure/iot/ops/identity#az-iot-ops-identity-assign) command.
   
      This command creates a federated identity credential using the OIDC issuer of the indicated connected cluster and the Azure IoT Operations service account.

1. Once all of the Azure CLI commands complete successfully, you can close the **Install Azure IoT Operations** wizard.

Once the `create` command completes successfully, you have a working Azure IoT Operations instance running on your cluster. At this point, your instance is configured for production scenarios.

## Verify deployment

After the deployment is complete, use [az iot ops check](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-check) to evaluate IoT Operations service deployment for health, configuration, and usability. The *check* command can help you find problems in your deployment and configuration.

```azurecli
az iot ops check
```

The `check` command displays a warning about missing data flows, which is normal and expected until you create a data flow. For more information, see [Process and route data with data flows](../connect-to-cloud/overview-dataflow.md).

You can check the configurations of topic maps, QoS, and message routes by adding the `--detail-level 2` parameter to the `check` command for a verbose view.
