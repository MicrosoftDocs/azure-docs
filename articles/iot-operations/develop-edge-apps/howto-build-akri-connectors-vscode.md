# Build Akri connectors in VS Code

This article describes how to build, validate, debug, and publish custom Akri connectors using the **Azure IoT Operations Akri Connectors** preview VS Code extension.

The extension supports the following platforms:

- Linux
- Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- Windows

The extension enables you to create connectors by using the following programming languages:

- .NET
- Rust

## Prerequisites

Development environment:

- Docker
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Azure IoT Operations Akri Connectors (preview)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azureiotoperations.azure-iot-operations-akri-connectors-vscode) VS Code extension
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- To debug .NET based connectors - [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)
- To debug Rust based connectors - [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-VSCode.cpptools)
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [ORAS CLI](https://oras.land/docs/installation/)
- Clone the [Explore Azure IoT Operations](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/explore-iot-operations) repository if you haven't already done so.

Docker configuration:

- Images used by the extension must be pulled and tagged locally before you use the extension:

    ```bash
    docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotoperations/devx-runtime:0.1.8
    docker tag mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotoperations/devx-runtime:0.1.8 devx-runtime
    ```

- All the containers the extension launches are configured to run on a custom network named `aio_akri_network` for network isolation purpose:

    ```bash
    docker network create aio_akri_network
    ```

- The DevX container uses a custom volume `akri_devx_docker_volume` to store cluster configuration:

    ```bash
    docker volume rm akri_devx_docker_volume # delete the volume created from any previous release
    docker volume create akri_devx_docker_volume
    ```

To deploy and use your connector with an Azure IoT Operations instance, you also need:

- An instance of [Azure IoT Operations](../deploy-iot-ops/howto-deploy-iot-operations.md).
- Access to a container registry, such as Azure Container Registry, to publish your connector images.
- A container registry endpoint configured in your Azure IoT Operations instance to pull your connector images. For more information, see [Configure registry endpoints](howto-configure-registry-endpoint.md).

## Author and validate an Akri connector

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

In this example, you create an HTTP/REST connector using the C# language, build a docker image, and then run the connector application by using the VS Code extension:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette and search for **Azure IoT Operations Akri Connectors: Create a New Akri Connector** command. Create a new folder called `my-connectors` and select it, select **C#** as the language, enter a name for the connector like `rest_connector`, and select **PollingTelemetryConnector** as the connector type.

1. The extension creates a new workspace named by using the connector name you chose in the previous step. The workspace includes the scaffolding for a polling telemetry connector written in the C# language.

[!INCLUDE [akri-connector-code](../includes/akri-connector-code.md)]

Next, build the project to confirm there are no errors. Use the VS Code command **Azure IoT Operations Akri Connectors: Build an Akri Connector** and choose the **Release** mode. This command shows the build progress in the **OUTPUT** console and notifies you when the build completes. You can then see a new Docker image named `<connector_name>` with tag `release` locally in Docker Desktop.

# [Rust](#tab/rust)

In this example, you create an HTTP/REST connector using the Rust language, build a Docker image, and then run the connector application by using the VS Code extension:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following example code is meant for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be used in production. In a production connector, you should implement robust error handling and retry logic, and ensure that any credentials used to connect to the asset are stored and used securely. A production quality connector must implement the contract described in the [Akri operator and connector contract](https://github.com/Azure/iot-operations-sdks/blob/main/doc/akri_connector/Akri%20operator%20and%20connector%20contract.md) document in the SDKs repository.

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette and search for the **Azure IoT Operations Akri Connectors: Create a New Akri Connector** command. Create a new folder called `my-connectors` and select it, select **Rust** as the language, and enter a name for the connector like `rest_connector`.

1. The extension creates a new workspace named by using the connector name you chose in the previous step. The workspace includes the scaffolding for a connector written in the Rust language. There are `Implement` tags in the comments to help you write your own custom Akri connector. For testing purposes, you can try out the connector with just the scaffolding code. To see logs from your connector crate, replace the tag `sample_connector_scaffolding` with your connector name in the `DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL` variable in the `main.rs` file.

Next, build the project to confirm there are no errors. Use the VS Code command **Azure IoT Operations Akri Connectors: Build an Akri Connector** and choose the **Release** mode. This command shows the build progress in the **OUTPUT** console and notifies you when the build completes. You can then see a new Docker image named `<connector_name>` with tag `release` locally in Docker Desktop.

To test the new connector locally, follow these steps:

1. Create a local endpoint that acts as a REST server for the connector to connect to. In the `explore-iot-operation` repository you cloned previously, run the following commands to build a local REST server for testing:

    ```bash
    cd samples/akri-vscode-extension/sample-rest-server
    docker build -t rest-server:latest .
    ```

    You can see the image in Docker Desktop.

1. Run the following command to start the REST server in a local container:

    ```bash
    docker run -d --rm --network aio_akri_network --name restserver rest-server:latest
    ```

1. You can see the container running in Docker Desktop. The REST server is accessible at `http://restserver:3000` for containers running on `aio_akri_network`.

1. Copy the file `rest-server-device-definition.yaml` from the `samples/akri-vscode-extension/rest-server-custom-resources` folder in your local copy of the `explore-iot-operations` repository to the **Devices** folder in your connector workspace in VS Code. This device resource defines an endpoint connection to the REST server.

1. Copy the file `rest-server-asset1-definition.yaml` from the `samples/akri-vscode-extension/rest-server-custom-resources` folder in your local copy of the `explore-iot-operations` repository to the **Assets** folder in your connector workspace in VS Code. This asset publishes temperature information from the device to the `mqtt/machine/asset1/status` MQTT topic.

1. Copy the file `rest-server-asset2-definition.yaml` from the `samples/akri-vscode-extension/rest-server-custom-resources` folder in your local copy of the `explore-iot-operations` repository to the **Assets** folder in your connector workspace in VS Code. This asset publishes temperature information from the device to the state store.

1. To test the connector with the device and asset resources, go to the **Run and Debug** panel in the VS Code workspace and select the **Run an Akri Connector** configuration. This configuration launches a terminal that runs the prelaunch tasks to start the `aio-broker` container and the REST connector you developed in another container called `<connector_name>_release`. This process takes several minutes. You can see the telemetry data flow from the REST server to the MQ broker through the REST connector in the terminal window in VS Code. The container logs are also visible in Docker Desktop.

1. You can stop the execution anytime by using the **Stop** button on the debug command panel. This command cleans up and deletes the running containers `aio-broker` and `<connector_name>_release`.

## Debug an Akri connector

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

To debug a .NET based Akri connector, make sure you have the **C#** VS Code extension installed. Use the same REST connector you created previously:

1. To build the connector in **Debug** mode, use the VS Code command **Azure IoT Operations Akri Connectors: Build an Akri Connector** and select **Debug** mode. This command creates a local Docker image called `<connector_name>` with the tag `debug`. You can see the image in Docker Desktop.

1. You can add a breakpoint and the execution stops when the breakpoint is hit. Try adding a breakpoint at the start of the `SampleDatasetAsync` method in `DatasetSampler.cs`.
 
1. To debug the connector, go to the **Run and Debug** panel in VS Code workspace and select the **Debug an Akri Connector** configuration. This configuration launches a terminal that runs the prelaunch tasks to start the `aio-broker` container and the REST connector you developed in another container called `<connector_name>_debug`. This process takes several minutes. You can see the telemetry data flow from the REST server to the MQ broker through the REST connector in the terminal window in VS Code. The container logs are also visible in Docker Desktop.

1. Use the **Disconnect** button on the debug command panel to terminate the execution.

> [!NOTE]
> The Akri VS Code extension launches the DevX container in a Run/Debug scenario with a timeout period of three minutes. If the container doesn't complete the launch within the timeout period, the extension terminates the container.

# [Rust](#tab/rust)

To debug a Rust-based Akri connector, make sure you have the **C/C++** VS Code extension installed. Use the same REST connector you created previously:

1. To build the connector in **Debug** mode, use the VS Code command **Azure IoT Operations Akri Connectors: Build an Akri Connector** and select **Debug** mode. This command creates a local Docker image called `<connector_name>` with the tag `debug`. You can see the image in Docker Desktop.

1. Add a breakpoint. The execution stops when the breakpoint is hit. Try adding a breakpoint in the `report_status_one_way` macro in `main.rs`.
 
1. To debug the connector, go to the **Run and Debug** panel in VS Code workspace and select the **Debug an Akri Connector** configuration. This configuration launches a terminal that runs the prelaunch tasks to start the `aio-broker` container and the REST connector you developed in another container called `<connector_name>_debug`. This process takes several minutes. You can see the telemetry data flow from the REST server to the MQ broker through the REST connector in the terminal window in VS Code. The container logs are also visible in Docker Desktop.

1. Use the **Disconnect** button on the debug command panel to terminate the execution.

> [!NOTE]
> The Akri VS Code extension launches the DevX container in a Run/Debug scenario with a timeout period of three minutes. If the container doesn't complete the launch within the timeout period, the extension terminates the container.

## Apply configuration updates

You can dynamically update the device and asset configurations in the local runtime environment while you're running your connector. This capability lets you verify that your connector responds to configuration changes. Use the following VS Code extension commands to make these changes:

- **Azure IoT Operations Akri Connectors: Apply Device YAML on cluster**
- **Azure IoT Operations Akri Connectors: Apply Asset YAML on cluster**
- **Azure IoT Operations Akri Connectors: Delete Device YAML from cluster**
- **Azure IoT Operations Akri Connectors: Delete Asset YAML from cluster**

## Capture connector state

To capture the current state of the schema registry, use the **Azure IoT Operations Akri Connectors: Capture Connector State** VS Code extension command. This command creates a folder in the workspace **OUTPUT** folder with a name based on the current timestamp. The created folder contains a copy of the current state of the schema registry, including any schemas created by the custom connector. 

The state of the schema registry is always visible in the `Output/ConnectorState` folder. The command lets you capture the state of the schema registry at a specific point in time.

## Publish a connector image

Use the **Azure IoT Operations Akri connectors: Publish Akri Connector Image or Metadata** command to publish connector images to a Microsoft Azure Container Registry (ACR) registry. The command uses the Microsoft Azure CLI and `oras` commands. To publish to an ACR registry, you need your Azure subscription ID and ACR registry name.

## Author connector metadata configuration

Use the VS Code workspace created from the **Create an Akri Connector** command to author the `connector-metadata.json` file that complies with the [JSON schema for Azure IoT Operations Connector Metadata 9.0-preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/refs/heads/master/src/schemas/json/aio-connector-metadata-9.0-preview.json) schema. You can place this file anywhere in your connector workspace. The extension provides a static validation capability using the `connector-metadata.json` file and shows warnings in the `PROBLEMS` panel if any required properties are missing.

## Publish metadata artifacts

Use the **Azure IoT Operations Akri connectors: Publish Akri Connector Image or Metadata** command to publish metadata folders to an ACR registry. The command uses the Azure CLI and `oras` commands. To publish to an ACR registry, you need your Azure subscription ID and ACR registry name. Currently, the extension expects files called `connector-metadata.json` and optionally `additionalConfig.json` to be present in any folder you push.


## Known Issues

- The configuration updates that result from the `Delete/Apply Asset/Device YAML` VS Code commands currently don't work in Windows due limitations of CIFS implementation in Linux kernel. Any file change events in mounted folders on the host aren't propagated to the container by Docker for Windows.

-  When you delete an asset or device from the cluster by using the VS Code commands, the .NET connector currently throws the following 404 error:

    ```
    Unhandled exception. Azure.Iot.Operations.Protocol.Retry.RetryExpiredException: Retry expired while attempting the operation. Last known exception is the inner exception.
    ---> Azure.Iot.Operations.Services.AssetAndDeviceRegistry.Models.AkriServiceErrorException: ApiError: assets.namespaces.deviceregistry.microsoft.com "my-rest-thermostat-asset2" not found: NotFound (ErrorResponse { status: "Failure", message: "assets.namespaces.deviceregistry.microsoft.com \"my-rest-thermostat-asset2\" not found", reason: "NotFound", code: 404 })

    ```

- Currently, launching the DevX image as a container from WSL without Docker Desktop installed causes the container to hang forever.
