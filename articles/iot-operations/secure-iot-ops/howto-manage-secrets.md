#CustomerIntent: As an IT professional, I want to manage secrets in Azure IoT Operations, by leveraging Key Vault and Azure Secrete Store to sync the secrets down from the cloud and store them on the edge as Kubernetes secrets.

# Manage secrets for your Azure IoT Operations deployment

Azure IoT Operations uses Azure Key Vault as the managed vault solution on the cloud, and uses [Azure Key Vault Secret Store extension for Kubernetes](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/secret-store-extension) to sync the secrets down from the cloud and store them on the edge as Kubernetes secrets.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow best practices to secure the Azure Key Vault you use with Azure IoT Operations. Ensuring the security of your Key Vault is crucial to protect your secrets. For detailed guidance on how to secure your Azure Key Vault, see [Best practices for using Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/best-practices).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure IoT Operations instance deployed with secure settings. If you deployed Azure IoT Operations with test settings and now want to use secrets, you need to first [enable secure settings](../deploy-iot-ops/howto-enable-secure-settings.md).

* Creating secrets in the key vault requires **Secrets officer** permissions at the resource level. For information about assigning roles to users, see [Steps to assign an Azure role](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps.md).

## Add and use secrets

Secrets management for Azure IoT Operations uses Secret Store extension to sync the secrets from an Azure Key Vault and store them on the edge as Kubernetes secrets. When you enabled secure settings during deployment, you selected an Azure Key Vault for secret management. It is in this Key Vault where all secrets to be used within Azure IoT Operations are stored. 

> [!NOTE]
> Azure IoT Operations instances work with only one Azure Key Vault, multiple key vaults per instance isn't supported.

Once the [set up secrets management](../deploy-iot-ops/howto-enable-secure-settings.md#set-up-secrets-management) steps are completed, you can start adding secrets to Azure Key Vault, and sync them to the Kubernetes cluster to be used in **Devices** or **Data flow endpoints** using the [operations experience](https://iotoperations.azure.com) web UI.

Secrets are used in devices and data flow endpoints for authentication. This section uses devices as an example. The same process can be applied to data flow endpoints. You have the option to directly create the secret in Azure Key Vault and have it automatically synchronized down to the cluster, or use an existing secret reference from the key vault:

1. Go to the **Devices** page in the [operations experience](https://iotoperations.azure.com) web UI.

1. To add a new secret reference, select **Add reference** when creating a new device:

    - **Create a new secret**: creates a secret reference in the Azure Key Vault and also automatically synchronizes the secret down to the cluster using Secret Store extension. Use this option if you didn't create the secret you require for this scenario in the key vault beforehand. 
    
    - **Add from Azure Key Vault**: synchronizes an existing secret in key vault down to the cluster if it wasn't synchronized before. Selecting this option shows you the list of secret references in the selected key vault. Use this option if you created the secret in the key vault beforehand. *Only the latest version of the secret is synced to the cluster*.

1. When you add the username and password references to the devices or data flow endpoints, you then need to give the synchronized secret a name. The secret references are saved in the cluster with this given name as one secret sync resource. In the example from the screenshot below, the username and password references are saved to the cluster as *edp1secrets*.

## Manage synced secrets

This section uses devices as an example. The same process can be applied to data flow endpoints:

1. Go to the **Devices** page in the [operations experience](https://iotoperations.azure.com) web UI.

1. To view the secrets list, select **Manage certificates and secrets** and then **Secrets**:

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-manage-secrets/synced-secret-list.png" lightbox="media/howto-manage-secrets/synced-secret-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the synced secrets list in the operations experience secrets page.":::

You can use the **Secrets** page to view synchronized secrets in your devices and data flow endpoints. Secrets page shows the list of all current synchronized secrets at the edge for the resource you're viewing. A synced secret represents one or multiple secret references, depending on the resource using it. Any operation applied to a synced secret will be applied to all secret references contained within the synced secret. 

You can delete synced secrets as well in the **Secrets** page. When you delete a synced secret, it only deletes the synced secret from the Kubernetes cluster, and doesn't delete the contained secret reference from Azure Key Vault. You must delete the certificate secret manually from the key vault.

> [!WARNING]
> Directly editing **SecretProviderClass** and **SecretSync** custom resources in your Kubernetes cluster can break the secrets flow in Azure IoT Operations. For any operations related to secrets, use the operations experience web UI.
>
> Before deleting a synced secret, make sure that all references to the secret from Azure IoT Operations components are removed.
