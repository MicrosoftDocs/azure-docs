# Secure MQTT broker communication by using BrokerListener

[!INCLUDE [kubernetes-management-preview-note](../includes/kubernetes-management-preview-note.md)]

A BrokerListener resource corresponds to a network endpoint that exposes the broker to clients over the network. You can have one or more BrokerListener resources for each broker, with multiple ports and different access control on each.

Each BrokerListener port can have its own authentication and authorization rules that define who can connect on that listener port and what actions they can perform on the broker. You can use [BrokerAuthentication](./howto-configure-authentication.md) and [BrokerAuthorization](./howto-configure-authorization.md) resources to specify the access control policies for each listener port. This flexibility allows you to fine-tune the permissions and roles for your MQTT clients based on their needs and use cases.

> [!TIP]
> The default MQTT broker deployment is a cluster IP service that requires clients to connect with the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and authenticate with service account tokens. Clients connecting from outside the cluster [need extra configuration](./howto-test-connection.md) before they can connect.

Broker listeners have the following characteristics:

- **Name**: Name of the listener. This name is also the Kubernetes service name [unless overridden](#service-name).
- **Service type**: You can have up to three listeners, one per [service type](#service-type). The [default listener](#default-brokerlistener) is service type `ClusterIp`.
- **Ports**: Each listener supports [multiple ports](#ports). Ports [can't conflict over different listeners](#use-the-same-port-across-listeners).
- **Authentication and Authorization references**: [BrokerAuthentication](./howto-configure-authentication.md) and [BrokerAuthorization](./howto-configure-authorization.md) are configured per port.
- **TLS**: [Manual](#enable-tls-manual-certificate-management-for-a-port) or [automatic](#enable-tls-automatic-certificate-management-for-a-port) TLS configuration is applied per port.
- **Protocol**: [MQTT over WebSockets](#websockets-support) can be enabled per port.

For a list of all available settings, see the [Broker Listener API reference](/rest/api/iotoperations/broker-listener).

## Default BrokerListener

When you deploy Azure IoT Operations, the deployment creates a BrokerListener resource named *default*. This listener is used for encrypted internal communication between IoT Operations components. The default listener is part of the [default broker](./overview-broker.md#default-broker-resource).

- It exposes a [ClusterIp service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-clusterip) on port 18883.
- It requires clients to use [Kubernetes service account authentication](./howto-configure-authentication.md#default-brokerauthentication-resource).
- It has an [automatically managed](#configure-tls-with-automatic-certificate-management) TLS certificate.
- It doesn't configure any client authorization policies.

> [!CAUTION]
> To avoid disrupting internal IoT Operations communication, keep the default listener unchanged and dedicated for internal use. For external communication, [create a new listener](#create-new-broker-listeners). If you need to use the `ClusterIp` service, add more ports to the default listener without changing any of the existing settings.

To view or edit the default listener, follow these steps.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the Azure portal, go to your IoT Operations instance.
1. Under **Components**, select **MQTT Broker**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-configure-brokerlistener/configure-broker-listener.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows using the Azure portal to view Azure IoT Operations MQTT configuration.":::

1. From the broker listener list, select the **default** listener.

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-configure-brokerlistener/default-broker-listener.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows using the Azure portal to view or edit the default broker listener.":::

1. Review the listener settings, but avoid modifying any of the existing settings. Instead, create a new port and configure it as needed.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

Be careful when you modify the default listener by using Bicep. Don't change the existing settings. Instead, add more ports to the default listener. The following example shows how to add a new port to the default listener:

```bicep
param aioInstanceName string = '<AIO_INSTANCE_NAME>'
param customLocationName string = '<CUSTOM_LOCATION_NAME>'

resource aioInstance 'Microsoft.IoTOperations/instances@2024-11-01' existing = {
  name: aioInstanceName
}

resource customLocation 'Microsoft.ExtendedLocation/customLocations@2021-08-31-preview' existing = {
  name: customLocationName
}

resource defaultBroker 'Microsoft.IoTOperations/instances/brokers@2024-11-01' existing = {
  parent: aioInstance
  name: 'default'
}

resource defaultListener 'Microsoft.IoTOperations/instances/brokers/listeners@2024-11-01' = {
  parent: defaultBroker
  name: 'default'
  extendedLocation: {
    name: customLocation.id
    type: 'CustomLocation'
  }
  properties: {
    // Don't change the service name or service type
    serviceType: 'ClusterIp'
    serviceName: 'aio-broker'
    ports: [
      // Don't modify the default port 18883 settings
      {
        port: 18883
        authenticationRef: 'default'
        protocol: 'Mqtt'
        tls: {
          mode: 'Automatic'
          certManagerCertificateSpec: {
            issuerRef: {
              name: 'azure-iot-operations-aio-certificate-issuer'
              kind: 'ClusterIssuer'
              group: 'cert-manager.io'
            }
            privateKey: {
              algorithm: 'Ec256'
              rotationPolicy: 'Always'
            }
          }
        }
      }
      // Add more ports here, like the following example
      {
        port: 1884
        protocol: 'Mqtt'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Deploy the Bicep file by using the Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az deployment group create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --template-file <FILE>.bicep
```

# [Kubernetes (preview)](#tab/kubernetes)

To view the default BrokerListener resource, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get brokerlistener default -n azure-iot-operations -o yaml
```

The output should look similar to this example, with most metadata removed for brevity:

```yaml
apiVersion: mqttbroker.iotoperations.azure.com/v1
kind: BrokerListener
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: azure-iot-operations
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: mqttbroker.iotoperations.azure.com/v1
    kind: Broker
    name: default
spec:
  serviceType: ClusterIp
  serviceName: aio-broker
  ports:
  - port: 18883
    authenticationRef: default
    protocol: Mqtt
    tls:
      mode: Automatic
      certManagerCertificateSpec:
        issuerRef:
          name: azure-iot-operations-aio-certificate-issuer
          kind: ClusterIssuer
          group: cert-manager.io
        privateKey:
          algorithm: Ec256
          rotationPolicy: Always
```

To add a new port 1883, with no TLS and authentication off, to the default listener, use the `kubectl patch` command:

```bash
kubectl patch brokerlistener default -n azure-iot-operations --type='json' -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/ports/-", "value": {"port": 1883, "protocol": "Mqtt"}}]'
```

---

### Avoid modifying default broker listener

To prevent disrupting internal IoT Operations communication, keep the default listener unchanged and dedicated for internal use. For external communication, [create a new listener](#create-new-broker-listeners).

Since the default broker listener uses the service type `ClusterIp`, and you can have [only one listener per service type](#service-type), add more ports to the default listener without changing any of the existing settings if you need to use the `ClusterIp` service.

## Create new broker listeners

To create a new listener, specify the following settings:

- **Name**: Name of the listener. This name is also the Kubernetes service name [unless overridden](#service-name).
- **Service type**: Type of the Kubernetes service. See [Service type](#service-type).
- **Ports**: List of ports to listen on. See [Ports](#ports).
- **Service name** (optional): Override the Kubernetes service name. See [Service name](#service-name).

### Example: Create a new listener with two ports

This example shows how to create a new listener with the `LoadBalancer` service type. The BrokerListener resource defines two ports that accept MQTT connections from clients.

- The first port listens on port 1883 without TLS and authentication. This setup is suitable for testing only. [Don't use this configuration in production](./howto-test-connection.md#only-turn-off-tls-and-authentication-for-testing).
- The second port listens on port 8883 with TLS and authentication enabled. Only [authenticated clients with a Kubernetes service account token](./howto-configure-authentication.md#default-brokerauthentication-resource) can connect. TLS is set to [automatic mode](#enable-tls-automatic-certificate-management-for-a-port), using cert-manager to manage the server certificate from the [default issuer](../secure-iot-ops/concept-default-root-ca.md#default-self-signed-issuer-and-root-ca-certificate-for-tls-server-certificates). This setup is closer to a production configuration.

## Service type

Each BrokerListener resource maps to a [Kubernetes service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/). The service type determines how the broker is exposed to the network. The supported service types are:

- **ClusterIp**: Exposes the broker on a cluster-internal IP. Clients can connect to the broker from within the cluster. This default service type is for the default listener.
- **NodePort**: Exposes the broker on each node's IP at a static port. Clients can connect to the broker from outside the cluster. This service type is useful for development and testing.
- **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the broker externally. The service is assigned an external IP address that clients can use to connect to the broker. This service type is the most common for production deployments.

### Only one listener per service type

Only one listener per service type is allowed. If you need more connectivity of the same service type, add more ports to the existing listener of that service type.

## Service name

The service name is the name of the Kubernetes service associated with the broker. If not specified, the broker listener name is used as the service name. The service name must be unique within the namespace.

> [!TIP]
> To prevent management overhead, we recommend that you leave the service name empty. The listener name is unique, and you can use it to identify the service. Use the service name as an override only when you can't name the service after the listener.

## Ports

Each listener can have multiple ports, and each port can have its own settings for authentication, authorization, protocol, and TLS.

To use your own authentication or authorization setting for a port, you must create the corresponding resources before you use it with a listener. For more information, see [Configure MQTT broker authentication](howto-configure-authentication.md) and [Configure MQTT broker authorization](howto-configure-authorization.md).

To use TLS, see the [Configure TLS with automatic certificate management](#configure-tls-with-automatic-certificate-management) or [Configure TLS with manual certificate management](#configure-tls-with-manual-certificate-management) sections.

### Use the same port across listeners

Using the same port number across different listeners isn't supported. Each port number must be unique within the IoT Operations MQTT broker.

For example, if you have a listener using port 1883, you can't create another listener with port 1883. Similarly, the default listener uses port 18883, so you can't create another listener with port 18883.

## WebSockets support

IoT Operations MQTT broker supports MQTT over WebSockets. To enable WebSockets, set the protocol to `WebSockets` for the port.

## Configure TLS with automatic certificate management

To enable TLS with automatic certificate management, specify the TLS settings on a listener port.

### Verify cert-manager installation

With automatic certificate management, you use cert-manager to manage the TLS server certificate. By default, cert-manager is installed alongside IoT Operations in the `cert-manager` namespace already. Verify the installation before you proceed.

1. Use kubectl to check for the pods that match the cert-manager app labels.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods --namespace cert-manager -l 'app in (cert-manager,cainjector,webhook)'
    ```
    
    ```Output
    NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
    aio-cert-manager-64f9548744-5fwdd              1/1     Running   4 (145m ago)   4d20h
    aio-cert-manager-cainjector-6c7c546578-p6vgv   1/1     Running   4 (145m ago)   4d20h
    aio-cert-manager-webhook-7f676965dd-8xs28      1/1     Running   4 (145m ago)   4d20h
    ```

1. If you see the pods shown as ready and running, cert-manager is installed and ready to use.

> [!TIP]
> To further verify the installation, check the cert-manager documentation to [verify installation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/#verifying-the-installation). Remember to use the `cert-manager` namespace.

### Create an issuer for the TLS server certificate

The cert-manager issuer resource defines how certificates are automatically issued. Cert-manager [supports several issuers types natively](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/). It also supports an [external](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/external/) `issuer` type for extending functionality beyond the natively supported issuers. You can use an MQTT broker with any type of cert-manager issuer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During initial deployment, IoT Operations is installed with a default issuer for TLS server certificates. You can use this issuer for development and testing. For more information, see [Default root Certificate Authority (CA) and issuer with Azure IoT Operations](#default-root-ca-and-issuer). The following steps are required only if you want to use a different issuer.

The approach to create the issuer is different depending on your scenario. The following sections list examples to help you get started.

# [Development or test](#tab/test)

The CA issuer is useful for development and testing. It must be configured with a certificate and private key stored in a Kubernetes secret.

#### Set up the root certificate as a Kubernetes secret

If you have an existing CA certificate, create a Kubernetes secret with the CA certificate and CA private key PEM files. Run the following command to import the CA certificate as a Kubernetes secret and skip the next section.

```bash
kubectl create secret tls test-ca --cert tls.crt --key tls.key -n azure-iot-operations
```

If you don't have a CA certificate, cert-manager can generate a CA certificate for you. Using cert-manager to generate a CA certificate is known as [bootstrapping](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/selfsigned/#bootstrapping-ca-issuers) a CA issuer with a self-signed certificate.

1. Start by creating `ca.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: Issuer
    metadata:
      name: selfsigned-ca-issuer
      namespace: azure-iot-operations
    spec:
      selfSigned: {}
    ---
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: Certificate
    metadata:
      name: selfsigned-ca-cert
      namespace: azure-iot-operations
    spec:
      isCA: true
      commonName: test-ca
      secretName: test-ca
      issuerRef:
        # Must match Issuer name above
        name: selfsigned-ca-issuer
        # Must match Issuer kind above
        kind: Issuer
        group: cert-manager.io
      # Override default private key config to use an EC key
      privateKey:
        rotationPolicy: Always
        algorithm: ECDSA
        size: 256
    ```

1. Create the self-signed CA certificate with the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ca.yaml
    ```

Cert-manager creates a CA certificate by using its defaults. You can change the properties of this certificate by modifying the Certificate specification. For a list of valid options, see [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/reference/api-docs/#cert-manager.io/v1.CertificateSpec).

#### Distribute the root certificate

The prior example stores the CA certificate in a Kubernetes secret called `test-ca`. You can retrieve the certificate in PEM format from the secret and store it in the file `ca.crt` with the following command:

```bash
kubectl get secret test-ca -n azure-iot-operations -o json | jq -r '.data["tls.crt"]' | base64 -d > ca.crt
```

This certificate must be distributed and trusted by all clients. For example, use the `--cafile` flag for a Mosquitto client.

#### Create issuer based on CA certificate

Cert-manager needs an issuer based on the CA certificate generated or imported in the earlier step. Create the following file as `issuer-ca.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: my-issuer
  namespace: azure-iot-operations
spec:
  ca:
    # Must match secretName of generated or imported CA cert
    secretName: test-ca
```

Create the issuer with the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f issuer-ca.yaml
```

The prior command creates an issuer for issuing TLS server certificates. Note the name and kind of the issuer. In the example, the name is `my-issuer` and the kind is `Issuer`. These values are set in the BrokerListener resource later.

# [Production](#tab/prod)

For production, check cert-manager documentation to see which issuer works best for you. For example, with the [Vault Issuer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-cert-manager):

1. Deploy HashiCorp Vault in an environment of choice, like [Kubernetes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-raft-deployment-guide). Initialize and unseal Vault accordingly.
1. Create and configure the PKI secrets engine by importing your CA certificate.
1. Configure Vault with a role and a policy for issuing server certificates.

    The following role is an example. Note that `ExtKeyUsageServerAuth` makes the server certificate work:

    ```bash
    vault write pki/roles/my-issuer \
      allow_any_name=true \
      client_flag=false \
      ext_key_usage=ExtKeyUsageServerAuth \
      no_store=true \
      max_ttl=240h
    ```

    Example policy for the role:

    ```hcl
    path "pki/sign/my-issuer" {
      capabilities = ["create", "update"]
    }
    ```

1. Set up authentication between cert-manager and Vault by using a method of choice, like [SAT](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/kubernetes).
1. [Configure the cert-manager Vault issuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/vault/).

### Enable TLS automatic certificate management for a port

The following example is a BrokerListener resource that enables TLS on port 8884 with automatic certificate management.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the Azure portal, go to your IoT Operations instance.
1. Under **Components**, select **MQTT Broker**.
1. Select or create a listener. You can create only one listener per service type. If you already have a listener of the same service type, you can add more ports to the existing listener.
1. You can add TLS settings to the listener by selecting **TLS** on an existing port or by adding a new port.

    ]
  }
}

```

Deploy the Bicep file by using the Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az deployment group create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --template-file <FILE>.bicep
```

# [Kubernetes (preview)](#tab/kubernetes)

Modify the `tls` setting in a BrokerListener resource to specify a TLS port and `Issuer` for the frontends.

```yaml
apiVersion: mqttbroker.iotoperations.azure.com/v1
kind: BrokerListener
metadata:
  name: aio-broker-loadbalancer-tls # Avoid conflicts with default service name 'aio-broker'
  namespace: azure-iot-operations
spec:
  brokerRef: default
  serviceType: loadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 8884 # Avoid conflicts with default port 18883
    tls:
      mode: Automatic
      certManagerCertificateSpec:
        issuerRef:
          name: my-issuer
          kind: Issuer
```

---

After the BrokerListener resource is configured, the MQTT broker automatically creates a new service with the specified port and TLS enabled.

#### Optional: Configure server certificate parameters

The only required parameters are `Issuer` name and `Issuer` kind. All other properties of the generated TLS server certificates are automatically chosen. However, the MQTT broker allows certain properties to be customized following the same syntax as cert-manager certificates. For example, you can specify the private key algorithm and rotation policy. These settings are under `tls.certManagerCertificateSpec` or on the **TLS configuration** pane in the Azure portal.

For a full list of these settings, see [Broker Listener CertManagerCertificateSpec API reference](/rest/api/iotoperations/broker-listener/create-or-update#certmanagercertificatespec).

#### Verify deployment

Use kubectl to check that the service associated with the BrokerListener resource is running. From the preceding example, the service name is `aio-broker-loadbalancer-tls` and the namespace is `azure-iot-operations`. The following command checks the service status:

```console 
$ kubectl get service my-new-tls-listener -n azure-iot-operations
NAME                           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
aio-broker-loadbalancer-tls    LoadBalancer   10.X.X.X        172.X.X.X     8884:32457/TCP   33s
```

#### Connect to the broker with TLS

After the server certificate is configured, TLS is enabled. To test with Mosquitto:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h $HOST -p 8884 -V mqttv5 -i "test" -t "test" -m "test" --cafile ca.crt
```

The `--cafile` argument enables TLS on the Mosquitto client and specifies that the client should trust all server certificates issued by the specific file. You must specify a file that contains the issuer of the configured TLS server certificate.

Replace `$HOST` with the appropriate host:

- If you're connecting from [within the same cluster](howto-test-connection.md#connect-to-the-default-listener-inside-the-cluster), replace with the service name given (`my-new-tls-listener` in example) or the service `CLUSTER-IP`.
- If you're connecting from outside the cluster, use the service `EXTERNAL-IP`.

Remember to specify authentication methods if needed.

### Default root CA and issuer

To help you get started, IoT Operations is deployed with a default "quickstart" CA certificate and issuer for TLS server certificates. You can use this issuer for development and testing. For more information, see [Default root CA and issuer for TLS server certificates](../deploy-iot-ops/concept-default-root-ca.md).

For production, you must configure a CA issuer with a certificate from a trusted CA, as described in the previous sections.

## Configure TLS with manual certificate management

To manually configure an MQTT broker to use a specific TLS certificate, specify it in a BrokerListener resource with a reference to a Kubernetes secret and deploy it using kubectl. This article shows an example that configures TLS with self-signed certificates for testing.

### Create a certificate authority with Step CLI

[Step](https://smallstep.com/) is a certificate manager that can quickly get you up and running when you create and manage your own private CA.

1. [Install Step CLI](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/installation/) and create a root CA certificate and key.

    ```bash
    step certificate create --profile root-ca "Example Root CA" root_ca.crt root_ca.key
    ```

1. Create an intermediate CA certificate and key signed by the root CA.

    ```bash
    step certificate create --profile intermediate-ca "Example Intermediate CA" intermediate_ca.crt intermediate_ca.key \
    --ca root_ca.crt --ca-key root_ca.key
    ```

### Create a server certificate

Use Step CLI to create a server certificate from the intermediate CA certificate and key.

```bash
step certificate create mqtts-endpoint mqtts-endpoint.crt mqtts-endpoint.key \
--profile leaf \
--not-after 8760h \
--san mqtts-endpoint \
--san localhost \
--ca intermediate_ca.crt --ca-key intermediate_ca.key \
--no-password --insecure
```

Here, `mqtts-endpoint` and `localhost` are the Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for the MQTT broker's frontend in Kubernetes and local clients, respectively. To connect over the internet, add a `--san` with [an external IP](#use-external-ip-for-the-server-certificate). The `--no-password --insecure` flags are used for testing to skip password prompts and disable password protection for the private key because it's stored in a Kubernetes secret. For production, use a password and store the private key in a secure location like Azure Key Vault.

#### Certificate key algorithm requirements

Both EC and RSA keys are supported, but all certificates in the chain must use the same key algorithm. If you import your own CA certificates, ensure that the server certificate uses the same key algorithm as the CAs.

### Import server certificate chain as a Kubernetes secret

1. Create a full server certificate chain, where the order of the certificates matters. The server certificate is the first one in the file, and the intermediate is the second.

    ```bash
    cat  mqtts-endpoint.crt intermediate_ca.crt  > server_chain.crt
    ```

1. Create a Kubernetes secret with the server certificate chain and server key by using kubectl.

    ```bash
    kubectl create secret tls server-cert-secret -n azure-iot-operations \
    --cert server_chain.crt \
    --key mqtts-endpoint.key
    ```

### Enable TLS manual certificate management for a port

The following example shows a BrokerListener resource that enables TLS on port 8884 with manual certificate management.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the Azure portal, go to your IoT Operations instance.
1. Under **Components**, select **MQTT Broker**.
1. Select or create a listener. You can create only one listener per service type. If you already have a listener of the same service type, you can add more ports to the existing listener. To follow the example, specify the listener service name as `mqtts-endpoint`.
1. You can add TLS settings to the listener by selecting **TLS** on an existing port or by adding a new port.

    Enter the following settings:

    | Setting        | Description                                                                                   |
    | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

    | Authorization  | The [authorization resource reference](howto-configure-authorization.md).                     |
    | TLS            | Select the **Add** button.                                                                      |
    | Secret name    | Kubernetes secret containing an X.509 client certificate.                                     |

1. Select **Apply** to save the TLS settings.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

Modify the `tls` setting in a BrokerListener resource to specify manual TLS configuration referencing the Kubernetes secret. Note the name of the secret used for the TLS server certificate (`server-cert-secret` in the previous example).

```bicep
param aioInstanceName string = '<AIO_INSTANCE_NAME>'
param customLocationName string = '<CUSTOM_LOCATION_NAME>'
param listenerServiceName string = 'mqtts-endpoint'
param listenerName string = '<LISTENER_NAME>' // Match the SAN in the server certificate

resource aioInstance 'Microsoft.IoTOperations/instances@2024-11-01' existing = {
  name: aioInstanceName
}

resource customLocation 'Microsoft.ExtendedLocation/customLocations@2021-08-31-preview' existing = {
  name: customLocationName
}

resource defaultBroker 'Microsoft.IoTOperations/instances/brokers@2024-11-01' existing = {
  parent: aioInstance
  name: 'default'
}

resource loadBalancerListener 'Microsoft.IoTOperations/instances/brokers/listeners@2024-11-01' = {
  parent: defaultBroker
  name: listenerName
  extendedLocation: {
    name: customLocation.id
    type: 'CustomLocation'
  }

  properties: {
    serviceName: listenerServiceName
    serviceType: 'LoadBalancer'
    ports: [
      {
        authenticationRef: 'default'
        port: 8885 // Avoid port conflict with default listener at 18883
        tls: {
          mode: 'Manual'
          manual: {
            secretRef: 'server-cert-secret'
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

Deploy the Bicep file by using the Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az deployment group create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --template-file <FILE>.bicep
```

# [Kubernetes (preview)](#tab/kubernetes)

Modify the `tls` setting in a BrokerListener resource to specify manual TLS configuration referencing the Kubernetes secret. Note the name of the secret used for the TLS server certificate (`server-cert-secret` in the previous example).

```yaml
apiVersion: mqttbroker.iotoperations.azure.com/v1
kind: BrokerListener
metadata:
  name: loadbalancer-tls
  namespace: azure-iot-operations
spec:
  brokerRef: default
  serviceType: loadBalancer # Optional, defaults to clusterIP
  serviceName: mqtts-endpoint # Match the SAN in the server certificate
  ports:
  - port: 8885 # Avoid port conflict with default listener at 18883
    tls:
      mode: Manual
      manual:
        secretRef: server-cert-secret
```

After the BrokerListener resource is created, the operator automatically creates a Kubernetes service and deploys the listener. You can check the status of the service by running `kubectl get svc`.

---

### Connect to the broker with TLS

To test the TLS connection with Mosquitto client, publish a message and pass the root CA certificate in the parameter `--cafile`.

```bash
mosquitto_pub -d -h localhost -p 8885 -i "my-client" -t "test-topic" -m "Hello" --cafile root_ca.crt
```

Remember to specify items like username and password if MQTT broker authentication is enabled.

```Output
Client my-client sending CONNECT
Client my-client received CONNACK (0)
Client my-client sending PUBLISH (d0, q0, r0, m1, 'test-topic', ... (5 bytes))
Client my-client sending DISCONNECT
```

> [!TIP]
> To use localhost, the port must be available on the host machine. An example is `kubectl port-forward svc/mqtts-endpoint 8885:8885 -n azure-iot-operations`. With some Kubernetes distributions like K3d, you can add a forwarded port with `k3d cluster edit $CLUSTER_NAME --port-add 8885:8885@loadbalancer`.

To connect to the broker, you need to distribute root of trust, also known as trust bundle, to all clients. In this case, the root of trust is the self-signed root CA created by the Step CLI. Distribution of root of trust is required for the client to verify the server certificate chain. If your MQTT clients are workloads on the Kubernetes cluster, you also need to create a ConfigMap with the root CA and mount it in your pod.

#### Use external IP for the server certificate

To connect with TLS over the internet, MQTT broker's server certificate must have its external hostname or IP address as a SAN. In production, this information is usually a DNS name or a well-known IP address. During dev/test, you might not know what hostname or external IP is assigned before deployment. To solve this problem, deploy the listener without the server certificate first, create the server certificate and secret with the external IP, and import the secret to the listener.

If you try to deploy the example TLS listener `manual-tls-listener` but the referenced Kubernetes secret `server-cert-secret` doesn't exist, the associated service gets created, but the pods don't start. The service is created because the operator needs to reserve the external IP for the listener.

```bash
kubectl get svc mqtts-endpoint -n azure-iot-operations
```

```Output
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
mqtts-endpoint         LoadBalancer   10.X.X.X        172.X.X.X     8885:30674/TCP      1m15s
```

This behavior is expected while we import the server certificate. The health manager logs mention that the MQTT broker is waiting for the server certificate.

```bash
kubectl logs -l app=health-manager -n azure-iot-operations
```

```Output
...
<6>2023-11-06T21:36:13.634Z [INFO] [1] - Server certificate server-cert-secret not found. Awaiting creation of secret.
```

> [!NOTE]
> Generally, in a distributed system, pods logs aren't deterministic and should be used with caution. The right way for information like this to surface is through Kubernetes events and custom resource status, which is in the backlog. Consider the previous step as a temporary workaround.

Even though the frontend pods aren't up, the external IP is already available.

```bash
kubectl get svc mqtts-endpoint -n azure-iot-operations
```

```Output
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
mqtts-endpoint         LoadBalancer   10.X.X.X        172.X.X.X     8885:30674/TCP      1m15s
```

From here, follow the same steps as previously shown to create a server certificate with this external IP in `--san` and create the Kubernetes secret in the same way. After the secret is created, it's automatically imported to the listener.
