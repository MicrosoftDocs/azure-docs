# Tutorial: TLS, X.509 client authentication, and attribute-based access control (ABAC) authorization with Azure IoT Operations MQTT broker

This tutorial guides you through setting up the Azure IoT Operations MQTT broker with TLS encryption and X.509 client authentication. It includes step-by-step instructions and scripts for creating certificates for both the broker and clients. The tutorial explains how to configure the MQTT broker with different root certificate authorities (CAs) for the client and broker. It also covers setting up an attribute-based access control (ABAC) authorization policy based on the client certificate chain. Finally, the tutorial uses the Mosquito client to test various scenarios to ensure the setup works correctly.

The tutorial simulates an environment where Azure IoT Operations is installed in a Contoso factory, with devices manufactured by Fabrikam. To make TLS and X.509 authentication work:

- Azure IoT Operations MQTT broker, installed in a Contoso factory, must trust the Fabrikam root CA
- Fabrikam sensors, like thermostats, must trust the Contoso root CA
- Each entity must have its own leaf certificate issued by the correct root CA

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need:

- A Kubernetes cluster with port forwarding enabled for port 8883.
- Azure IoT Operations deployed without an existing load balancer listener.
- Kubectl access to the cluster to create Kubernetes secrets and config maps.
- [Mosquitto client](https://mosquitto.org/download/) to publish and subscribe to MQTT messages running on the same machine as the Kubernetes cluster for `localhost` access. To not use `localhost`, see [Optional: Use a real hostname or IP address instead of `localhost`](#optional-use-a-real-hostname-or-ip-address-instead-of-localhost) section.
- [Step CLI](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/) to create certificates.

> [!TIP]
> To meet these requirements, use the [quickstart codespace](../get-started-end-to-end-sample/quickstart-deploy.md). The quickstart codespace simplifies the setup process by providing these components out of the box.

Additionally, familiarity with public key cryptography and terms like root CA, private key, and intermediate certificates is useful.

### Optional: Use a real hostname or IP address instead of `localhost`

To keep this tutorial simple, we use `localhost` to access the MQTT broker. This approach ensures that the broker's server certificate has a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) that matches the hostname used to access the broker. Using `localhost` simplifies the setup since the SAN is already set correctly.

In a real-world scenario, you'd use the hostname or external IP of the broker instead of `localhost` and connect to it from another device on the network. In this case, you need to determine the correct hostname or IP address and use it as the SAN when creating the server certificate:

- If the hostname or IP address is already known (for example, through a DNS record or static IP), use it as the SAN when creating the server certificate. Then, connect to the broker using that hostname or IP instead of `localhost`.
- If the hostname or IP address isn't already known, you can use a placeholder service to determine the external IP address:
  1. Create the LoadBalancer service on a port that's not being used (like 8080):
     ```sh
     kubectl create service loadbalancer placeholder-service --tcp=8080:8080
     ```
  1. Retrieve the external IP:
     ```sh
     kubectl get svc placeholder-service
     ```
  1. If the external IP:
       - Shows a value like `192.168.X.X` - use that IP as the SAN when creating the server certificate and secret. Then, connect to the broker using that IP instead of `localhost`.
       - Shows `<pending>` - the Kubernetes distribution you use might not support automatically assigning an external IP. To find the external IP, follow the steps in the Kubernetes documentation for your distribution and host environment. You might also need to configure [port forwarding](./howto-test-connection.md#use-port-forwarding) or a VPN depending on the network setup.
  1. After determining the external IP, delete the placeholder service: 
     ```sh
     kubectl delete svc placeholder-service
     ```

This method ensures that the server certificate matches the external IP address, allowing secure access to the MQTT broker.

## Prepare server-side certificates and full chain

First, create a server-side root CA. This CA is separate from the client-side root CA which is created later. To keep the separation clear, we name everything server side "Contoso". To make later steps easier, we skip the password for encrypting the private key. This practice is only acceptable in a tutorial setting.

```sh
step certificate create "Contoso Root CA" \
contoso_root_ca.crt contoso_root_ca.key \
--profile root-ca \
--no-password --insecure
```

Then, create an intermediate CA signed by this root CA.

```sh
step certificate create "Contoso Intermediate CA 1" \
contoso_intermediate_ca.crt contoso_intermediate_ca.key \
--profile intermediate-ca \
--ca ./contoso_root_ca.crt --ca-key ./contoso_root_ca.key \
--no-password --insecure
```

Lastly, use this intermediate CA to sign a server certificate for MQTT broker's broker frontend. Here, `localhost` is the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) used for the tutorial.

```sh
step certificate create mqtts-endpoint \
mqtts-endpoint.crt mqtts-endpoint.key \
--profile leaf \
--ca ./contoso_intermediate_ca.crt --ca-key ./contoso_intermediate_ca.key \
--bundle \
--san localhost \
--not-after 2400h --no-password --insecure
```

With the `--bundle` flag, the server certificate is bundled with the signing intermediate certificate. TLS handshake requires the bundle to verify the full chain.

## Prepare client-side certificates and full chain

Similarly, create the root CA for Fabrikam and the intermediate CA.

```sh
step certificate create --profile root-ca "Fabrikam Root CA" \
fabrikam_root_ca.crt fabrikam_root_ca.key \
--no-password --insecure
```

```sh
step certificate create "Fabrikam Intermediate CA 1" \
fabrikam_intermediate_ca.crt fabrikam_intermediate_ca.key \
--profile intermediate-ca \
--ca ./fabrikam_root_ca.crt --ca-key ./fabrikam_root_ca.key \
--no-password --insecure
```

Then, generate client certificates for a thermostat, hygrometer, heater, and lightbulb.

```sh
# Create a client certificate for the thermostat
step certificate create thermostat thermostat.crt thermostat.key \
--ca ./fabrikam_intermediate_ca.crt --ca-key ./fabrikam_intermediate_ca.key --bundle \
--not-after 2400h --no-password --insecure

# Create a client certificate for the hygrometer
step certificate create hygrometer hygrometer.crt hygrometer.key \
--ca ./fabrikam_intermediate_ca.crt --ca-key ./fabrikam_intermediate_ca.key --bundle \
--not-after 2400h --no-password --insecure

# Create a client certificate for the heater
step certificate create heater heater.crt heater.key \
--ca ./fabrikam_intermediate_ca.crt --ca-key ./fabrikam_intermediate_ca.key --bundle \
--not-after 2400h --no-password --insecure

# Create a client certificate for the lightbulb
step certificate create lightbulb lightbulb.crt lightbulb.key \
--ca ./fabrikam_intermediate_ca.crt --ca-key ./fabrikam_intermediate_ca.key --bundle \
--not-after 2400h --no-password --insecure
```

## Configure Kubernetes

Import the newly generated server certificate and private key into a Kubernetes secret. This secret is used to configure a TLS listener for MQTT broker later.

```sh
kubectl create secret tls broker-server-cert -n azure-iot-operations \
--cert mqtts-endpoint.crt \
--key mqtts-endpoint.key
```

Also, create a config map to contain the Fabrikam (client-side) root CA. This config map is required for MQTT broker to trust it for X.509 authentication.

```sh
kubectl create configmap fabrikam-ca -n azure-iot-operations \
--from-file=client_ca.pem=fabrikam_root_ca.crt
```

## Configure MQTT broker

The next steps configure the MQTT broker with TLS encryption and X.509 client authentication. The tutorial uses the Azure portal to configure the MQTT broker.

### Authentication

To allow clients to authenticate using X.509 certificates issued by the Fabrikam root CA, create an authentication policy that trusts the Fabrikam root CA certificate and maps the client certificates to authorization attributes for ABAC.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your IoT Operations instance.
1. Under **Components**, select **MQTT Broker**.
1. Select the **Authentication** tab.
1. Select **Create authentication policy**.
1. For **Policy name**, enter `x509-auth`.
1. Add a new method by selecting **Add method**.
1. Choose the method type **X.509** from the dropdown list then select **Add details** to configure the method.
1. In the **X.509 authentication details** pane, specify the Fabrikam trusted CA certificate ConfigMap name `fabrikam-ca` and the attributes.

    ```json
    {
      "trustedClientCaCert": "fabrikam-ca",
      "authorizationAttributes": {
        "thermostat": {
          "subject": "CN = thermostat",
          "attributes": {
            "group": "thermostat_group"
          }
        },
        "hygrometer": {
          "subject": "CN = hygrometer",
          "attributes": {
            "group": "hygrometer_group"
          }
        },
        "intermediate": {
          "subject": "CN = Fabrikam Intermediate CA 1",
          "attributes": {
            "manufacturer": "fabrikam"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. Select **Apply** then **Add** to save the changes.

### Listener

With the authentication policy in place, create a listener that uses the X.509 authentication policy. Also, since X.509 authentication requires TLS, configure the listener to use the Contoso server certificate and private key created earlier.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your IoT Operations instance.
1. Under **Components**, select **MQTT Broker**.
1. Select **MQTT broker listener for LoadBalancer** > **Create**. Enter the following settings:

    | Setting        | Description                                                                                   |
    | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Name           | Enter `mqtts-endpoint`.                                                          |
    | Service name   | Name of the Kubernetes service. Leave empty to use the listener name `mqtts-endpoint` as service name.         |
    | Service type   | **LoadBalancer** already selected.                                                            |

1. Under **Ports**, enter the following settings for the first port:

    | Setting        | Description           |
    | -------------- | --------------------- |
    | Port           | Enter 8883            |
    | Authentication | Choose **x509-auth**    |
    | Authorization  | Choose **None**       |
    | Protocol       | Choose **MQTT**       |
    | TLS            | Select **Add**        |

1. In the **TLS configuration** pane, enter the following settings:

    | Setting        | Description           |
    | -------------- | --------------------- |
    | TLS Mode       | Choose **Manual**  |
    | Issuer name    | Enter `broker-server-cert` |

1. Select **Apply** and **Create listener**.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-tls-and-x509/broker-listener-tls.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Azure portal method to set a listener with TLS port.":::

After a minute or two, the `mqtts-endpoint` LoadBalancer service is created. 

```console
$ kubectl get service mqtts-endpoint -n azure-iot-operations
NAME             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
mqtts-endpoint   LoadBalancer   10.43.28.140   XXX.XX.X.X    8883:30988/TCP   104s
```

Instead of using the external IP, we use `localhost` for the tutorial. 

> [!TIP]
> The codespace configuration automatically sets up port forwarding for 8883. To setup other environments, see [Use port forwarding](./howto-test-connection.md#use-port-forwarding).

## Use a single Mosquito client to publish messages over TLS

From the same folder as the certificate files: `contoso_root_ca.crt`, `thermostat.crt`, and `thermostat.key`, use Mosquito client to publish a message. The `--cafile contoso_root_ca.crt` flag is for Mosquito to perform server certificate verification.

```sh
mosquitto_pub -t "example/topic" -m "example temperature measurement" -i thermostat \
-q 1 -V mqttv5 -d \
-h localhost \
--key thermostat.key \
--cert thermostat.crt \
--cafile contoso_root_ca.crt
```

The publish succeeds because Mosquito uses a client certificate that is rooted in `fabrikam_root_ca.crt`. The MQTT broker trusts this certificate because the `x509-auth` authentication policy created earlier. Additionally, the MQTT broker currently allows authenticated clients to publish to any topic.

```console
Client thermostat sending CONNECT
Client thermostat received CONNACK (0)
Client thermostat sending PUBLISH (d0, q1, r0, m1, 'example/topic', ... (31 bytes))
Client thermostat received PUBACK (Mid: 1, RC:0)
Client thermostat sending DISCONNECT
```

## Configure authorization to MQTT topics for multiple clients using X.509

To restrict access to MQTT topics based on the client certificate attributes, create an authorization policy that maps the client certificate attributes to allowed actions on specific topics.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your IoT Operations instance.
1. Under **Components**, select **MQTT Broker**.
1. Select the **Authorization** tab.
1. Select **Create authorization policy**.
1. For **Policy name**, enter `abac-authz`.
1. Under **Rules**, enter the following rules:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "principals": {
          "attributes": [
            {
              "group": "thermostat_group"
            }
          ]
        },
        "brokerResources": [
          {
            "method": "Connect"
          },
          {
            "method": "Publish",
            "topics": [
              "telemetry/temperature"
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "principals": {
          "attributes": [
            {
              "group": "hygrometer_group"
            }
          ]
        },
        "brokerResources": [
          {
            "method": "Connect"
          },
          {
            "method": "Publish",
            "topics": [
              "telemetry/humidity"
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "principals": {
          "attributes": [
            {
              "manufacturer": "fabrikam"
            }
          ]
        },
        "brokerResources": [
          {
            "method": "Connect"
          },
          {
            "method": "Publish",
            "topics": [
              "health/heartbeat"
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "principals": {
          "usernames": [
            "heater"
          ]
        },
        "brokerResources": [
          {
            "method": "Connect"
          },
          {
            "method": "Subscribe",
            "topics": [
              "telemetry/temperature",
              "telemetry/humidity"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```
    
1. Select **Add** to save the changes.

## Publish messages to a restricted topic

In this section, we test out the newly applied authorization policies.

First, connect with `thermostat` and try to publish on topic `telemetry/humidity`:

```sh
mosquitto_pub -t "telemetry/humidity" -m "example temperature measurement" -i thermostat \
-q 1 -V mqttv5 -d \
-h localhost \
--key thermostat.key \
--cert thermostat.crt \
--cafile contoso_root_ca.crt
```

Since `thermostat` is part of `thermostat_group`, which isn't allowed to publish to the humidity topic, the publish fails.

```console {hl_lines=5}
Client thermostat sending CONNECT
Client thermostat received CONNACK (0)
Client thermostat sending PUBLISH (d0, q1, r0, m1, 'telemetry/humidity', ... (6 bytes))
Client thermostat received PUBACK (Mid: 1, RC:135)
Warning: Publish 1 failed: Not authorized.
```

Change to publish to `telemetry/temperature`, which is allowed and the publish succeeds. Leave the command running.

```sh
mosquitto_pub -t "telemetry/temperature" -m "example temperature measurement" -i thermostat \
-q 1 -V mqttv5 -d \
-h localhost \
--repeat 10000 \
--repeat-delay 3 \
--key thermostat.key \
--cert thermostat.crt \
--cafile contoso_root_ca.crt
```

## Subscribe to messages on restricted topics

In a separate terminal session, connect with `heater` to subscribe to `health/heartbeat`.

```sh
mosquitto_sub -q 1 -t "health/heartbeat" -d -V mqttv5 \
-i heater \
-h localhost \
--key heater.key \
--cert heater.crt \
--cafile contoso_root_ca.crt
```

Since `heater` is not authorized to subscribe to the heartbeat topic, the subscription fails. Here, code 135 means [not authorized](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/mqtt-v5.0.html#_Toc471483680:~:text=not%20accept%20it.-,135,The%20Client%20is%20not%20authorized%20to%20make%20this%20subscription.,-143).

```text {hl_Lines="5"}
Client heater sending CONNECT
Client heater received CONNACK (0)
Client heater sending SUBSCRIBE (Mid: 1, Topic: health/heartbeat, QoS: 1, Options: 0x00)
Client heater received SUBACK
Subscribed (mid: 1): 135
```

Switch the subscription topic to `telemetry/temperature`, which `thermostat` is still sending messages to.

```sh
mosquitto_sub -q 1 -t "telemetry/temperature" -d -V mqttv5 \
-i heater \
-h localhost \
--key heater.key \
--cert heater.crt \
--cafile contoso_root_ca.crt
```

Now `heater` starts to receive messages because it's authorized with its [username](./howto-configure-authorization.md#use-a-username-for-authorization).

In *another* separate terminal session, publish messages to `health/heartbeat` with `lightbulb`:

```sh
mosquitto_pub -q 1 -t "health/heartbeat" -m "example heartbeat" -d -V mqttv5 \
-i lightbulb \
-h localhost \
--repeat 100 \
--repeat-delay 3 \
--key lightbulb.key \
--cert lightbulb.crt \
--cafile contoso_root_ca.crt
```

The publish succeeds because `lightbulb` has an intermediate certificate with `CN = Fabrikam Intermediate CA 1`, which is mapped to the attribute `manufacturer=fabrikam`. Clients with that attribute can publish on `health/heartbeat`. When the client starts sending messages, `heater` started earlier doesn't receive anything.

## Clean up resources

To clean up the resources created in this tutorial, delete the listener and the authentication and authorization policies.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your IoT Operations instance.
1. Under **Components**, select **MQTT Broker**.
