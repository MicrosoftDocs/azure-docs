This template provides the basic structure of a Quickstart - General article pattern. See the [instructions - Quickstart - General](../level4/article-quickstart.md) in the pattern library.

You can provide feedback about this template at: https://aka.ms/patterns-feedback

Quickstart is an article pattern that shows how a product or service solves a customer problem. These articles focus on what the product or service "can do" rather than "how to use" it. The goal is to help new customers evaluate whether the product or service will meet their needs.

-->

<!-- 1. H1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Use a "Quickstart: <verb> * <capability> * <product or service> * <scenario>" format for you H1. Pick an H1 that clearly conveys the product capability that's covered and how the capability will be demonstrated.

For example: "Quickstart: Demonstrate the incident response capabilities of Microsoft 365 Defender by simulating an attack".

* Include only a single H1 in the article.
* If the Quickstart is part of a numbered series, don't include the number in the H1.
* Don't start with a gerund.
* Don't add "Quickstart:" to the H1 of any article that's not a Quickstart.
* Don't include "Tutorial" in the H1.

# Quickstart: Get insights from Deploy Azure IoT Operations – enabled by Azure Arc Preview to an Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-note](../includes/public-preview-note.md)]

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required: In the opening sentence, focus on the product capability that will be demonstrated. Emphasize general industry terms (such as "serverless," which are better for SEO) more than Microsoft-branded terms or acronyms (such as "Azure Functions" or "ACR"). That is, try to include terms people typically search for and avoid using *only* Microsoft terms.

* Introduction immediately follows the H1 text.
* Introduction section should be between 1-3 paragraphs.
* Begin with a sentence that says, "In this Quickstart, you'll ..."
* After the opening sentence, summarize the demonstration in the article to answer "what is this article about?" Then include a brief statement of cost, if applicable.

Example:
You'll simulate a sophisticated attack that uses advanced techniques to hide from detection. The attack enumerates opened Server Message Block (SMB) sessions on domain controllers and retrieves recent IP addresses of users' devices. After the attack, you'll use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to review the generated alerts and automated remediation.

Use a Power BI report to capture insights from your OPC UA data you sent to the Microsoft Fabric OneLake lakehouse.

TODO: Add your introductory paragraph

Demonstrate the [capability] of [service/product] by using [specific tools or activities] to [achieve a goal or job to be done]. [Summary of steps]. [Brief statement of cost incurred.]

<!---Avoid notes, tips, and important boxes. Readers tend to skip over them. Better to put that info directly into the article text.

-->

<!-- 3. Free account links 
----------------------------------------------------------------

Required, if a free trial account exists Because Quickstarts are intended to help new customers evaluate the product, include a link to a free trial before the first H2. You can find listed examples in the  [Quickstart pattern](article-quickstart.md)
-->

If you don’t have a \<service\> subscription, create a free trial account...
TODO: Add the free account information if it exists

<!-- 4. Prerequisites --------------------------------------------------------------------

Make Prerequisites the first H2 after the H1. 

The prerequisites H2 is never numbered.

Provide a bulleted list of items that the user needs to complete the Quickstart. Omit any preliminary text to the list.

If there aren't any prerequisites, list "None" in plain text, not as a bulleted item.

If the prerequisite is something to install, link to the applicable and specific installer or download.

List each as an _item_, not instructions, to minimize the verbiage. For example, use "Python 3.6" instead of "Install Python 3.6". Include an action word only if necessary to make the meaning clear.

If there are specific versions of software a user needs, call out those versions (for example: Visual Studio 2019 or later).

-->

## Prerequisites

- (Include as needed) Accounts
- (Include as needed) Completion of a previous Quickstart
- (Include as needed) Language runtimes
- (Include as needed) Packages
- (Include as needed) Tools
- (Include as needed) Sample code
- (Include as needed) Specialized hardware
- (Include as needed) Other preparatory work
- (Include as needed) Service keys

<!-- 5. Account sign in --------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: If you need to sign in to a portal to do the Quickstart, this H2 and link are required.

-->

## Sign in to <service/product/tool name>
TODO: add your instructions

<!-- If signing in requires more than one step, then use this section. If it's just a single
step, include that step in the first section that requires it.

-->

<!-- 6. Open Azure Cloud Shell ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to refer to using the Cloud Shell, place the instructions after the
Prerequisites to keep the prerequisites as the first H2.

However, only include the Cloud Shell if ALL commands can be run in the cloud shell.

--->

## Open Azure Cloud Shell
TODO: add your instructions

<!-- 7. Demonstration H2s ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Quickstarts are prescriptive and guide the customer through an end-to-end demonstration. Make sure to use specific naming for setting up accounts and configuring technology.

Avoid linking off to other content - include whatever the customer needs to complete the demonstration in the article. For example, if the customer needs to set permissions, include the permissions they need to set, and the specific settings in the Quickstart procedure. Don't send the customer to another article to read about it.

In a break from tradition, do not link to reference topics in the Quickstart when using cmdlets or code. Provide customers what they need to know in the Quickstart to successfully complete the Quickstart.

For portal-based procedures, minimize bullets and numbering.

For the CLI or PowerShell based procedures, don't use bullets or numbering.

Be mindful of the number of H2/procedures in the Quickstart. 3-5 procedural steps are about right.
Once you've staged the article, look at the right-hand "In this article" section on the docs page;
if there are more than 8 total, consider restructuring the article.

--->

<!-- Use this exact H2 -->
## What problem will we solve?
TODO: Write a brief description of the problem and how the product or service solves that problem. Include one or more diagrams when appropriate to show the solution architecture and/or the dataflow.

<!-- 

Present the demonstration in a series of H2s.

Each H2 should describe either what they'll do in the step or which part of the problem the step solves.

* Each H2 should be a major step in the demonstration
* The H2 title should describe either what they'll do in the step or which part of the problem the step solves
* Phrase each H2 title as "<verb> * <noun>".
* Don't start with a gerund.
* Don't number the H2s.
* Begin each H2 with a brief explanation for context
* Provide a numbered list of procedural steps as applicable
* Provide a code block, diagram, or screenshot if appropriate
* An image, code block, or other graphical element comes after numbered step it illustrates.

-->
## "\<verb\> * \<noun\>"
TODO: Add introduction sentence(s)
[Include a sentence or two to explain only what is needed to complete the procedure.]
TODO: Add ordered list of procedure steps
1. Step 1
1. Step 2
1. Step 3

## Task 2
TODO: Add introduction sentence(s)
[Include a sentence or two to explain only what is needed to complete the procedure.]
TODO: Add ordered list of procedure steps
1. Step 1
1. Step 2
1. Step 3

## Task 3
TODO: Add introduction sentence(s)
[Include a sentence or two to explain only what is needed to complete the procedure.]
TODO: Add ordered list of procedure steps
1. Step 1
1. Step 2
1. Step 3

<!-- Use this exact H2 -->
## How did we solve the problem?
TODO: End the demonstration with a few paragraphs of analysis to make it clear that the product or service was a good choice to solve the customer problem.

<!-- 8. Clean up resources ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: To avoid any costs associated with following the Quickstart procedure, a Clean up resources (H2) should come just before Next step or Related content (H2)

If there is a follow-on Quickstart that uses the same resources, make that option clear so that a reader doesn't need to recreate those resources. 

-->

<!-- Use this exact H2 -->
## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this application, delete \<resources\> with the following steps:

1. From the left-hand menu...
2. ...click Delete, type...and then click Delete

<!-- 9. Next step/Related content ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Optional: You have two options for manually curated links in this pattern: Next step and Related content. You don't have to use either, but don't use both.
  - For Next step, provide one link to the next step in a sequence. Use the blue box format
  - For Related content provide 1-3 links. Include some context so the customer can determine why they would click the link. Add a context sentence for the following links.

-->

## Next step

TODO: Add your next step link(s)

<!-- 

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Write concepts](article-concept.md)

OR -->

## Related content
