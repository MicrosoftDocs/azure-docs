# Setting up the Azure Import/Export Tool v1
The Microsoft Azure Import/Export Tool is the drive preparation and repair tool that you can use with the Microsoft Azure Import/Export service. You can use the tool for the following functions:  

-   Before creating an import job, you can use this tool to copy data to the hard drives you're shipping to a Windows Azure data center.  

-   After an import job has completed, you can use this tool to repair any blobs that were corrupted, were missing, or conflicted with other blobs.  

-   After you receive the drives from a completed export job, you can use this tool to repair any files that were corrupted or missing on the drives.  

## Prerequisites  
If you're preparing drives for an import job, you'll need to meet the following prerequisites:  

-   You must have an active Azure subscription.  

-   Your subscription must include a storage account with enough available space to store the files you're importing.  

-   You need at least one of the account keys for the storage account.  

-   You need a computer (the "copy machine") with Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, or a newer Windows operating system installed.  

-   The .NET Framework 4 must be installed on the copy machine.  

-   BitLocker must be enabled on the copy machine.  

-   You'll need one or more drives that contains data to be imported or empty 3.5-inch SATA hard drives connected to the copy machine.  

-   The files you plan to import must be accessible from the copy machine, whether they are on a network share or a local hard drive.

If you are attempting to repair an import that has partially failed, you will need:  

- The copy log files  

- The storage account key  

  If you are attempting to repair an export that has partially failed, you will need:  

- The copy log files  

- The manifest files (optional)  

- The storage account key  

## Installing the Azure Import/Export Tool  
 The Azure Import/Export Tool consists of the following files:  

- WAImportExport.exe  

- WAImportExport.exe.config  

- WAImportExportCore.dll  

- WAImportExportRepair.dll  

- Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.dll  

- Hddid.dll  

  Copy these files to a working directory, for example, `c:\WAImportExport`. Next, open a command-line window in Administrator mode, and set the above directory as current directory.  

  To output help for the command, run the tool without parameters:  

```

        [/logdir:<LogDirectory>] /ExportBlobListFile:<ExportBlobListFile> /DriveSize:<DriveSize>  

Parameters:  

    /j:<JournalFile>  
        - Required. Path to the journal file. Each drive must have one and only one  
          journal file. The journal file corresponding to the target drive must always  
          be specified.  
    /logdir:<LogDirectory>  
        - Optional. The log directory. Verbose log files as well as some temporary  
          files will be written to this directory. If not specified, current directory  
          will be used as the log directory.  
    /id:<SessionId>  
        - Required. The session Id is used to identify a copy session. It is used to  
          ensure accurate recovery of an interrupted copy session. In addition, files  
          that are copied in a copy session are stored in a directory named after the  
          session Id on the target drive.  
    /resumesession  
        - Optional. If the last copy session was terminated abnormally, this parameter  
          can be specified to resume the session.  
    /abortsession  
        - Optional. If the last copy session was terminated abnormally, this parameter  
          can be specified to abort the session.  
    /t:<TargetDriveLetter>  
        - Required. Drive letter of the target drive.  
    /r:<RepairFile>  
        - Required. Only applicable for RepairImport and RepairExport.  
          Path to the file for tracking repair progress. Each drive must have one  
          and only one repair file.  
    /d:<TargetDirectories>  
        - Required. Only applicable for RepairImport and RepairExport.  
          For RepairImport, one or more semicolon-separated directories to repair;  
          For RepairExport, one directory to repair, e.g. root directory of the drive.  
    /format  
        - Optional. If specified, the target drive will be formatted. DO NOT specify  
          this parameter if you do not want to format the drive.  
    /silentmode  
        - Optional. If not specified, the /format parameter will require a confirmation  
          from console before the tool formats the drive. If this parameter is specified,  
          not confirmation will be given for formatting the drive.  
    /encrypt  
        - Optional. If specified, the target drive will be encrypted with BitLocker.  
          If the drive has already been encrypted with BitLocker, do not specify this  
          parameter and instead specify the BitLocker key using the "/k" parameter.  
    /bk:<BitLockerKey>  
        - Optional. The current BitLocker key if the drive has already been encrypted  
          with BitLocker.  
    /Disposition:<Disposition>

          default value.  
    /BlobType:<BlobType>  
        - Optional. The blob type for the imported blob(s). Valid values are BlockBlob  
          and PageBlob. If not specified, BlockBlob will be used as the default value.  
    /PropertyFile:<PropertyFile>  
        - Optional. Path to the property file for the file(s) to be imported.  
    /MetadataFile:<MetadataFile>  
        - Optional. Path to the metadata file for the file(s) to be imported.  
    /CopyLogFile:<DriveCopyLogFile>  
        - Required. Only applicable for RepairImport and RepairExport. Path to the  
          drive copy log file (verbose or error).  
    /ManifestFile:<DriveManifestFile>  
        - Required. Only applicable for RepairExport. Path to the drive manifest file.  
    /PathMapFile:<DrivePathMapFile>  
        - Optional. Only applicable for RepairImport. Path to the file containing  
          mappings of file paths relative to the drive root to locations of actual files  
          (tab-delimited). When first specified, it will be populated with file paths  
          with empty targets, which means either they are not found in TargetDirectories,  
          access denied, with invalid name, or they exist in multiple directories. The  
          path map file can be manually edited to include the correct target paths and  
          specified again for the tool to resolve the file paths correctly.  
    /ExportBlobListFile:<ExportBlobListFile>  
        - Required. Path to the XML file containing list of blob paths or blob path  
          prefixes for the blobs to be exported. The file format is the same as the  
          blob list blob format in the Put Job operation of the Import/Export service  
          REST API.  
    /DriveSize:<DriveSize>  
        - Required. Size of drives to be used for export. For example, 500GB, 1.5TB.  
          Note: 1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes  
                1 TB = 1,000,000,000,000 bytes  
    /srcdir:<SourceDirectory>  
        - Required. Source directory that contains files to be copied to the  
          target drives.  
    /dstdir:<DestinationBlobVirtualDirectory>  
        - Required. Destination blob virtual directory to which the files will  
          be imported.

        - Required. Path to the source file to be imported.  
    /dstblob:<DestinationBlobPath>  
        - Required. Destination blob path for the file to be imported.  
    /skipwrite
        - Optional. To skip write process. Used for inplace data drive preparation.
          Be sure to reserve enough space (3 GB per 7TB) for drive manifest file!
Examples:  

    Copy a source directory to a drive:  
    WAImportExport.exe PrepImport  
        /j:9WM35C2V.jrn /id:session#1 /t:x /format /encrypt 
        /srcdir:d:\movies\drama /dstdir:movies/drama/  

    Copy another directory to the same drive following the above command:  
    WAImportExport.exe PrepImport  
        /j:9WM35C2V.jrn /id:session#2 /srcdir:d:\movies\action /dstdir:movies/action/  

    Copy another file to the same drive following the above commands:  
    WAImportExport.exe PrepImport  
        /j:9WM35C2V.jrn /id:session#3 /srcfile:d:\movies\dvd.vhd /dstblob:movies/dvd.vhd /BlobType:PageBlob  

    Preview how many 1.5 TB drives are needed for an export job:  
    WAImportExport.exe PreviewExport  
        /ExportBlobListFile:C:\temp\myexportbloblist.xml  
        /DriveSize:1.5TB  

    Repair a finished import job:  
    WAImportExport.exe RepairImport  
        /r:9WM35C2V.rep /d:X:\ /bk:442926-020713-108086-436744-137335-435358-242242-2795  
        98 /CopyLogFile:C:\temp\9WM35C2V_error.log

    Skip write process, inplace data drive preparation:
    WAImportExport.exe PrepImport
        /j:9WM35C2V.jrn /id:session#1 /t:d /encrypt /srcdir:d:\movi
        es\drama /dstdir:movies/drama/ /skipwrite
```
