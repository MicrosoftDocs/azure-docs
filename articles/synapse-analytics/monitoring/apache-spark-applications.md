# Use Synapse Studio to monitor your Apache Spark applications

With Azure Synapse Analytics, you can use Apache Spark to run notebooks, jobs, and other kinds of applications on your Apache Spark pools in your workspace.

This article explains how to monitor your Apache Spark applications, allowing you to keep an eye on the latest status, issues, and progress.

## View Apache Spark applications 

You can view all Apache Spark applications from **Monitor** -> **Apache Spark applications**.

  ![Screenshot of Apache Spark applications.](./media/how-to-monitor-spark-applications/apache-spark-applications.png)

## View completed Apache Spark applications

Open **Monitor**, then select **Apache Spark applications**. To view the details about the completed Apache Spark applications, select the Apache Spark application.

  ![Screenshot of completed job details.](./media/how-to-monitor-spark-applications/select-completed-job.png)

1. Check the **Completed tasks**, **Status**, and **Total duration**.

2. **Refresh** the job.

3. Click on **Compare applications** to use the comparison feature, for more information on this feature, see the [**Compare Apache Spark applications**](#compare-apache-spark-applications).

4. Click on **Spark history server** to open the History Server page.

5. Check the **Summary** info.

6. Check the diagnostics in **Diagnostic** tab.

7. Check the **Logs**. You can view full log of **Livy**, **Prelaunch**, and **Driver** logs via selecting different options in the drop-down list. And you can directly retrieve the required log information by searching keywords. Click **Download log** to download the log information to the local, and select the **Filter errors and warnings** check box to filter the errors and warnings you need.

8. You can see an overview of your job in the generated job graph. By default, the graph shows all jobs. You can filter this view by **Job ID**.

9. By default, the **Progress** display is selected. You can check the data flow by selecting **Progress**/**Read**/**Written**/**Duration** in the **View** dropdown list.

10. To play back the job, click on **Playback** button. You can click on **Stop** button at any time to stop.

11. Use scroll bar to zoom in and zoom out the job graph, you can also select **Zoom to Fit** to make it fit the screen.

12. The job graph node displays the following information of each stage:

    - Job ID
    - Task number
    - Duration time
    - Row count
    - Data read: the sum of input size and shuffle read size
    - Data written: the sum of output size and shuffle writes size
    - Stage number

       ![Screenshot of job graph node.](./media/how-to-monitor-spark-applications/job-graph-node.png)

13. Hover the mouse over a job, and the job details will be displayed in the tooltip:
    
    - Icon of job status: If the job status is successful, it will be displayed as a green "√"; if the job detects a problem, it will display a yellow "!"
    - Job ID
    - General part:
      - Progress
      - Duration time
      - Total tasks number
    - Data part:
      - Total rows number
      - Read size
      - Written size
    - Skew part:
      - Data skew
      - Time skew
    - Stage number

      ![Screenshot of tooltip hovering over a job.](./media/how-to-monitor-spark-applications/hover-a-job.png)

14. Click **Stage number** to expand all the stages contained in the job. Click **Collapse** next to the Job ID to collapse all the stages in the job.

15. Click on **View details** in a stage graph, then the details for a stage will appear.

## Monitor Apache Spark application progress

Open **Monitor**, then select **Apache Spark applications**. To view the details about the Apache Spark applications that are running, select the submitted Apache Spark application. If the Apache Spark application is still running, you can monitor the progress.

  ![Screenshot of selected running job](./media/how-to-monitor-spark-applications/select-running-job.png)

1. Check the **Completed tasks**, **Status**, and **Total duration**.

2. **Cancel** the Apache Spark application.

3. **Refresh** the Job.

4. Click on **Spark UI** button to go to Spark Job page.

5. For **Job graph**, **Summary**, **Diagnostics**, **Logs**. You can see an overview of your job in the generated job graph. Refer to steps 5 - 15 of [View completed Apache Spark applications](#view-completed-apache-spark-applications). 

  [![Screenshot of running job.](./media/how-to-monitor-spark-applications/view-running-job.png)](./media/how-to-monitor-spark-applications/view-running-job.png#lightbox)

## View canceled Apache Spark applications

Open **Monitor**, then select **Apache Spark applications**. To view the details about the canceled Apache Spark applications, select the Apache Spark application.

  ![Screenshot of canceled job.](./media/how-to-monitor-spark-applications/select-cancelled-job.png)

## Compare Apache Spark Applications

There are two ways to compare applications. You can compare by choosing **Compare Application**, or click the **Compare in notebook** button to view it in the notebook.

### Compare by application

Click on **Compare applications** button and choose an application to compare performance. You can see the difference between the two applications.

![Screenshot of compare applications.](./media/how-to-monitor-spark-applications/compare-applications.png)

![Screenshot of details to compare applications.](./media/how-to-monitor-spark-applications/details-compare-applications.png)

1. Use the mouse to hover over an application, and then the **Compare applications** icon is displayed.

2. Click on the **Compare applications** icon, and the Compare applications page will pop up.

3. Click on **Choose application** button to open **Choose comparison application** page.

4. When choosing the comparison application, you need to either enter the application URL, or choose from the recurring list. Then, click **OK** button. 

   ![Screenshot of choose comparison application.](./media/how-to-monitor-spark-applications/choose-comparison-application.png)

5. The comparison result will be displayed on the compare applications page.

### Compare in notebook

Click the **Compare in Notebook** button on the **Compare applications** page to open the notebook. The default name of the *.ipynb* file is **Recurrent Application Analytics**.

![Screenshot of compare in notebook.](./media/how-to-monitor-spark-applications/compare-in-notebook.png)

In the Notebook: Recurrent Application Analytics file, you can run it directly after setting the Spark pool and Language.
