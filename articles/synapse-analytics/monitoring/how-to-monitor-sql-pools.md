# Use Synapse Studio to monitor your SQL pools

With Synapse Studio, you can run SQL scripts on the SQL pools in your workspace.

This article explains how to monitor your SQL pools, allowing you to keep an eye on the status and activity of your pools.

## Access SQL pools list

To see the list of SQL pools in your workspace, first [open the Synapse Studio](https://web.azuresynapse.net/) and select your workspace.

Select **SQL pools** to view the list of SQL pools.

## Filter your SQL pools

You can filter the list of SQL pools to the ones that interest you. The filters at the top of the screen allow you to specify a field on which you'd like to filter.

For example, you can filter the view to see only the SQL pools containing the name "salesrecords":
