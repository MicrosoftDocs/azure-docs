# What is Azure Synapse Analytics?

**Azure Synapse** is an enterprise analytics service that accelerates time to insight across data warehouses and big data systems. Azure Synapse brings together the best of **SQL** technologies used in enterprise data warehousing, **Spark** technologies used for big data, **Data Explorer** for log and time series analytics, **Pipelines** for data integration and ETL/ELT, and deep integration with other Azure services such as **Power BI**, **CosmosDB**, and **AzureML**.

## Industry-leading SQL

**Synapse SQL** is a distributed query system for T-SQL that enables data warehousing and data virtualization scenarios and extends T-SQL to address streaming and machine learning scenarios.

* Synapse SQL offers both **serverless** and **dedicated** resource models. For predictable performance and cost, create dedicated SQL pools to reserve processing power for data stored in SQL tables. For unplanned or bursty workloads, use the always-available, serverless SQL endpoint.
* Use built-in **streaming** capabilities to land data from cloud data sources into SQL tables
* Integrate AI with SQL by using **machine learning** models to score data using the [T-SQL PREDICT function](/sql/t-sql/queries/predict-transact-sql?view=azure-sqldw-latest&preserve-view=true)

## Industry-standard Apache Spark

**Apache Spark for Azure Synapse** deeply and seamlessly integrates Apache Spark--the most popular open source big data engine used for data preparation, data engineering, ETL, and machine learning.

* ML models with SparkML algorithms and Azure Machine Learning integration for Apache Spark 3.1 with built-in support for Linux Foundation Delta Lake.
* Simplified resource model that frees you from having to worry about managing clusters.
* Fast Spark start-up and aggressive autoscaling.
* Built-in support for .NET for Spark allowing you to reuse your C# expertise and existing .NET code within a Spark application.

## Working with your Data Lake

Azure Synapse removes the traditional technology barriers between using SQL and Spark together. You can seamlessly mix and match based on your needs and expertise.

* Tables defined on files in the data lake are seamlessly consumed by either Spark or SQL.
* SQL and Spark can directly explore and analyze Parquet, CSV, TSV, and JSON files stored in the data lake.
* Fast, scalable data loading between SQL and Spark databases

## Built-in data integration

Azure Synapse contains the same Data Integration engine and experiences as Azure Data Factory, allowing you to create rich at-scale ETL pipelines without leaving Azure Synapse Analytics.

* Ingest data from 90+ data sources
* Code-Free ETL with Data flow activities
* Orchestrate notebooks, Spark jobs, stored procedures, SQL scripts, and more

## Data Explorer (Preview)

Azure Synapse Data Explorer provides customers with an interactive query experience to unlock insights from system-generated logs. To complement existing SQL and Apache Spark analytics runtime engines, Data Explorer analytics runtime is optimized for efficient log analytics using powerful indexing technology to automatically index free-text and semi-structured data commonly found in the system-generated logs. 

Use Data Explorer as a data platform for building near real-time log analytics and IoT analytics solutions to:

* Consolidate and correlate your logs and events data across on-premises, cloud, and third-party data sources.
* Accelerate your AI Ops journey (pattern recognition, anomaly detection, forecasting, and more)
* Replace infrastructure-based log search solutions to save cost and increase productivity.
* Build IoT Analytics solution for your IoT data.
* Build Analytical SaaS solutions to offer services to your internal and external customers.

## Unified experience 

**Synapse Studio** provides a single way for enterprises to build solutions, maintain, and secure all in a single user experience

* Perform key tasks: ingest, explore, prepare, orchestrate, visualize
* Monitor resources, usage, and users across SQL, Spark, and Data Explorer
* Use Role-based access control to simplify access to analytics resources
* Write SQL, Spark, or KQL code and integrate with enterprise CI/CD processes
