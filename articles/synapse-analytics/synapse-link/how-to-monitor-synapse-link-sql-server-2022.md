# Monitor Azure Synapse Link for SQL Server 2022 through Synapse Studio and Azure Monitor

This article provides a guide on how to get started with monitoring your Azure Synapse Link for SQL Server 2022 connections. Before you go through this article, you should know how to create and start an Azure Synapse Link for SQL Server 2022 link connection from [Get started with Azure Synapse Link for SQL Server 2022](connect-synapse-link-sql-server-2022.md). Once you've'created and started your Synapse Link connection, you can monitor your link connection through Synapse Studio or Azure Monitor. 

## Monitor the status of an Azure Synapse Link for SQL Server 2022 connection in Synapse Studio

You can monitor the status of your Azure Synapse Link connection, see which tables are being initially copied over (*snapshotting*), and see which tables are in continuous replication mode (*replicating*) directly in Synapse Studio. In this section, we'll deep dive link-level monitoring and table-level monitoring:

### Link-level monitoring 

1. Once your link connection is running in your Azure Synapse workspace, navigate to the **Monitor** hub, and then select **Link connections**. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/studio-monitor-link-connections-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to monitor the status of the Azure Synapse Link connection from the monitor hub.":::

1. Automatically all your link connections will show up on this page, along with link-level monitoring metrics that summarize a few details of your link connection.

1. The link-level connection grid contains the following columns: 

    | **Column Name**  | **Description**  |
    |---------|---------|
    | Link connection name | Name of the Link Connection |
    | Source name | The name of the data source where the data is coming from (Azure SQL Database or SQL Server 2022) |
    | Target name | The name of the destination location where the data is being replicated into (a dedicated SQL Pool) |
    | Status | **Initial**, **Starting**, **Running**, **Stopping**, **Stopped**, **Pausing**, **Paused**, or **Resuming**. Details of what each status means can be found here: [Azure Synapse Link for SQL Server 2022](sql-server-2022-synapse-link.md) |
    | Start time | Start date and time for the link connection run (Month, Date, Year, HH:MM:SS AM/PM) |
    | End time  | End date and time for the link connection run (Month, Date, Year, HH:MM:SS AM/PM) |
    | Landing zone SAS token expire time | Expiration date/time for the SAS token that is used to access the landing zone storage. More details can be found here: [Configure an expiration policy for shared accessed signatures (SAS)](../../storage/common/sas-expiration-policy.md?context=%2fazure%2fsynapse-analytics%2fcontext%2fcontext) |
    | Continuous run ID | ID of the link connection run *Helpful when troubleshooting any issues and contacting Microsoft support. |

1. You need to manually select the **Refresh** button to refresh the list of link connections and their corresponding monitoring details. Autorefresh is currently not supported.  

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/studio-monitor-refresh-link-connections.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to press the Refresh button to refresh the statuses and details of the Azure Synapse Link connections.":::

### Table-level monitoring 

1. Follow the same steps 1 and 2 above from the link-level monitoring. 

1. Click on the Link connection name of the **link connection** that you want to monitor. 

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/studio-monitor-click-on-link-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of clicking on an Azure Synapse Link connection.":::

1. After clicking on your link connection, you'll see the tables and their corresponding table-level metrics that summarize a few details about the tables that you're replicating over in your link connection.

1. The table-level connection grid contains the following columns: 
       
    | **Column Name** | **Description** |
    |---------|---------|
    | Source schema/table name | Name of the source table that is being replicated from |
    | Target schema/table name | Name of the destination table that the source table is being replicated to |
    | Status | **Waiting**, **Snapshotting**, **Replicating**, **Failed**, **Suspended**. Details of what each status means can be found here: [Azure Synapse Link for SQL Server 2022](sql-server-2022-synapse-link.md) |
    | Link table ID | ID of the table in the link connection. *Helpful when troubleshooting any issues and contacting Microsoft support. |
    | Processed rows | Row counts processed by Synapse Link for SQL |
    | Processed data volume | Data volume in bytes processed by Synapse Link for SQL |
    | Time of last processed data | Time when last processed change data arrived in data warehouse (Month, Date, Year, HH:MM:SS AM/PM) |
    | Time of last data commit on source store | Time when last processed change data arrived in the landing zone (Month, Date, Year, HH:MM:SS AM/PM) |

1. You need to manually select the **Refresh** button to refresh the list of tables in the link connections and their corresponding monitoring details. Autorefresh is currently not supported.

## Advanced monitoring with Azure Monitor

No matter what cloud applications you're using, it's hard to manage and keep track of all the moving pieces. Azure Monitor provides base-level infrastructure metrics, alerts, and logs for most Azure services. Azure diagnostic logs are emitted by a resource and provide rich, frequent data about the operation of that resource. Azure Synapse Analytics can write diagnostic logs in Azure Monitor, to help you understand deep insights about your applications, improve application performance, and more. 

For more information, refer to [How to monitor Synapse Analytics using Azure Monitor](../monitoring/how-to-monitor-using-azure-monitor.md)

In this section, we'll deep dive into setting up metrics, alerts, and logs in Azure Monitor to ensure that you understand more of the advanced capabilities of monitoring your link connection. 

### Metrics

The most important type of Monitor data is the metric, which is also called the performance counter. Metrics are emitted by most Azure resources. Azure Monitor provides several ways to configure and consume these metrics for monitoring and troubleshooting.

For a list of metrics that Azure Synapse Link emits to Azure Monitor, see [Azure Synapse Link metrics](../monitor-synapse-analytics-reference.md#azure-synapse-link-metrics).

Now let’s step through how we can see these metrics in the Azure portal. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Search for your **Synapse workspace** that your link connection resides in. 

1. Once you've landed on the overview page for your Synapse Workspace, click on the **Metrics** tab underneath “Monitoring”.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/monitor-click-on-metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to go to get to the Metrics tab to create a new metric in the Azure portal.":::

1. You'll then see a new chart that is automatically generated for you.

1. Under the **Metric dropdown**, you'll see many different categories of metrics. You want to scroll down to the **INTEGRATION** category, and choose any one of the 5 Link metrics: 

    * Link connection events 
    * Link latency in seconds 
    * Link processed data volume (bytes) 
    * Link processed rows 
    * Link table events 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/monitor-select-a-metric.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to select a link metric.":::

1. After selecting a metric of your choosing, you can see a graph representation of the data below. 

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/monitor-display-of-metric.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the graph representation of the link metric that was chosen in the previous step." lightbox="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/monitor-display-of-metric.png":::

1. A few things that you can adjust on this screen (refer to the letter on the screenshot above to the bullet point letter below): 

    1. You can add another chart. 

    2. You can add another metric to the same chart. Then you can click between the metrics and their corresponding graphs.  

    3. You can customize the aggregation. Some of the metrics only have one aggregation, but others have many. Refer to the chart above for the aggregations available for each metric. 

    4. You can pick how far back you want the metrics to go. By default, the metrics show the past 24 hours, but you've the ability to customize the time period by clicking on the time.
    
    5. You can pin your metrics chart to your dashboard. This functionality makes it easy to look at your specific chart whenever you log in into your Azure portal. 

### Alerts

In this section, we're going to walk through how you can set up [alerts](../monitor-synapse-analytics.md#alerts) for your Azure Synapse Link connection through Azure Synapse Analytics. Let’s say, for example, that you're running your link connection and realize that you want to monitor the latency of your link connection. The workload requirements for this scenario require that any link connection with a maximum latency over 900 seconds (or 15 minutes) needs to be alerted to your Engineering team. Let’s walk through how we would set up an alert for this example: 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Search for your **Synapse workspace** that your link connection resides in.
 
1. Once you've landed on the overview page for your Synapse Workspace, click on the **Alerts** tab underneath “Monitoring”. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/monitor-click-on-alerts.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to go to get to the Alerts tab to create a new alert in the Azure portal.":::

1. Click on the dropdown **Create**.

1. Click on **Alert rule** to add a new alert rule.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/monitor-create-an-alert.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to create a new alert.":::

1. The first step is to define the **scope**. The scope is the target resource that you want to monitor, and in this case, your scope should be Azure Synapse Analytics. The scope should automatically be filled out as current Azure Synapse Analytics workspace that you're creating the alert for.

1. Second, we need to define the **condition**. The condition defines the logic of when the alert rule should trigger. 

    a. Click **+Add condition**
    
    b. You can see the 5 link connection **signal names**. For this example, let’s choose the **Link latency in seconds** signal. 
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/monitor-select-an-alert.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to select one of the Link signals.":::

1. Third, we need to configure the alert logic, or when the alert rule should be triggered.

    1. Select **Static** for the **Threshold** field
    
    1. Enter the following values for **Aggregation type**, **Operator**, and **Unit** fields:
        * **Aggregation type**: **Maximum** 
        * **Operator**: **Greater than** 
        * **Unit**: **Count** 

    1. Input a **Threshold value** of **900** (***Note: this value is in seconds***) 

1. You can also configure the **Split by dimensions** value that monitors specific time series and provides context to the fired alert. These additions do have their own separate charge. For this example, we'll leave it blank.

1. Choose **30 minutes** for **Check every** and **1 hour** for **Lookback period** fields. These fields define how often you want the checks to happen.

1. The graph in the Preview shows the events based on the alert logic that we defined, along with the estimated cost per month. 
     
   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/monitor-create-an-alert-rule.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows all of the details, configurations, and preview of the price when creating an alert rule." lightbox="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/monitor-create-an-alert-rule.png":::

1. Fourth, we now need to set up **Actions**. we'll configure an action group, which is a set of actions that can be applied to an alert rule.

    a. The **Select action group** option is chosen if you already have an action group that you want to choose. Let's click on **create action group**. 

1. On the **Basic** tab, pick a **Subscription**, **resource group**, and **region**. Then provide appropriate values for the **Action group name** and **Display name**. Then press **Next**.

1. On the **Notifications** tab, under the Notification type, select **Email/SMS message/Push/Voice**. And give it an appropriate name.

    a. Check the boxes for **Email** and **SMS**, and then provide the corresponding values. Then press **OK**.  
    
    b. Then press **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/monitor-create-action-group.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to create an action group and specify notifications when an alert rule's conditions are met.":::

1. On the **Actions** tab, let’s select an option for **Action type**. 
 
1. In this example, let's use the **Event Hubs** action type, so we'll need to input the **subscription name**, **Event Hub namespace**, and select an **Event Hub name**. Then click on **OK**. 

    a. If you don’t have an Event Hub created, refer to the document here to create one: [Configure an expiration policy for shared accessed signatures (SAS)](/rest/api/eventhub/create-event-hub)
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/monitor-create-action-group-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to create an action group and specify an action type when an alert rule's conditions are met.":::

1. Click on **Review + Create** to review the settings, and then hit **Create**.

1. Immediately we're taken back to the **Alerts homepage**. If we click on the **Alert Rules** on the top, we can see our newly created alert. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/monitor-display-alert-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows all of the alert rules that were created, including the one we just created.":::

This was just one example of how to create an alert rule following an example. You've the ability to create multiple alerts for your Azure Synapse Link connections through Azure Synapse Analytics. 

### Logs

Azure Monitor Logs is a feature of Azure Monitor that collects and organizes log and performance data from monitored resources. Several features of Azure Monitor store their data in Logs and present this data in various ways to assist you in monitoring the performance and availability of your cloud and hybrid applications and their supporting components. You can analyze Logs data by using a sophisticated query language that’s capable of quickly analyzing millions of records.

Now let’s step through how we can see logs for our Azure Synapse Link connections in the Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Search for your **Synapse workspace** that your link connection resides in. 

1. Once you've landed on the overview page for your Synapse Workspace, click on the **Logs** tab underneath “Monitoring”. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/monitor-click-on-logs.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to go to get to the Logs tab to create a new log in the Azure portal.":::

1. You're immediately greeted with a workspace that is roughly the equivalent of a database in Azure Data Explorer. Tables are structured the same, and both use [Kusto Query Language (KQL)](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/)

    a. There's a table called “**SynapseLinkEvent**” that stores many different values for each of the link connections. The table and the details are shown on the left-hand side.
    
    b. You can perform a query in the query pane that retrieves a specific set of records. In this case, we'll type in “**SynapseLinkEvent**” in the query pane and then press the blue **Run** button. We can see the link connections that ran in the Results section where you can see details about each of the link connections.  
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/monitor-display-results-of-log-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the tables, query, and results of the log query that was run." lightbox="../media/connect-synapse-link-sql-database/monitor-display-results-of-log-query.png":::
