In this article, you create an Event Hub data connection for Azure Synapse Data Explorer by using Python. 

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [data-explorer-ingest-prerequisites](../includes/data-explorer-ingest-prerequisites.md)]

- [Event Hub with data for ingestion](data-explorer-ingest-event-hub-portal.md#create-an-event-hub).
- [Python 3.4+](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
<!-- - [Database and table policies](database-table-policies-python.md) (optional). -->

## Add an Event Hub data connection

The following example shows you how to add an Event Hub data connection programmatically. See [connect to the event hub](data-explorer-ingest-event-hub-portal.md#connect-to-the-event-hub) for adding an Event Hub data connection using the Azure portal.

```Python
from azure.mgmt.kusto import KustoManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.kusto.models import EventHubDataConnection
from azure.common.credentials import ServicePrincipalCredentials

#Directory (tenant) ID
tenant_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
#Application ID
client_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
#Client Secret
client_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
subscription_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
credentials = ServicePrincipalCredentials(
        client_id=client_id,
        secret=client_secret,
        tenant=tenant_id
    )
kusto_management_client = KustoManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)

resource_group_name = "testrg"
#The cluster and database that are created as part of the Prerequisites
cluster_name = "mykustocluster"
database_name = "mykustodatabase"
data_connection_name = "myeventhubconnect"
#The event hub that is created as part of the Prerequisites
event_hub_resource_id = "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces/xxxxxx/eventhubs/xxxxxx";
consumer_group = "$Default"
location = "Central US"
#The table and column mapping that are created as part of the Prerequisites
table_name = "StormEvents"
mapping_rule_name = "StormEvents_CSV_Mapping"
data_format = "csv"
#Returns an instance of LROPoller, check https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/msrest/msrest.polling.lropoller?view=azure-python
poller = kusto_management_client.data_connections.create_or_update(resource_group_name=resource_group_name, cluster_name=cluster_name, database_name=database_name, data_connection_name=data_connection_name,
                                        parameters=EventHubDataConnection(event_hub_resource_id=event_hub_resource_id, consumer_group=consumer_group, location=location,
                                                                            table_name=table_name, mapping_rule_name=mapping_rule_name, data_format=data_format))
```
