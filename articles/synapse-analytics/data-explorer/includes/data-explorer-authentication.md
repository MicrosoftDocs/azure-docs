## Authentication

To run the following example, you need a Microsoft Entra application and service principal that can access resources. To create a free Microsoft Entra application and add role assignment at the subscription level, see [Create a Microsoft Entra application](../../../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md). You also need the directory (tenant) ID, application ID, and client secret.
