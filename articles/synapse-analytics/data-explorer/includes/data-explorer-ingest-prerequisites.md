        |--|--|--|
        | Pool name | *contosodataexplorer* | The name of the Data Explorer pool to use |
        | Name | *TestDatabase* | The database name must be unique within the cluster. |
        | Default retention period | *365* | The time span (in days) for which it's guaranteed that the data is kept available to query. The time span is measured from the time that data is ingested. |
        | Default cache period | *31* | The time span (in days) for which to keep frequently queried data available in SSD storage or RAM, rather than in longer-term storage. |
