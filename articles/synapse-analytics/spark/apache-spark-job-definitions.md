# Tutorial: Create Apache Spark job definition in Synapse Studio

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Synapse Studio to create Apache Spark job definitions, and then submit them to a serverless Apache Spark pool.

This tutorial covers the following tasks:
> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Create an Apache Spark job definition for PySpark (Python)
> - Create an Apache Spark job definition for Spark (Scala)
> - Create an Apache Spark job definition for .NET Spark (C#/F#)
> - Create job definition by importing a JSON file
> - Exporting an Apache Spark job definition file to local
> - Submit an Apache Spark job definition as a batch job
> - Add an Apache Spark job definition into pipeline


## Prerequisites

Before you start with this tutorial, make sure to meet the following requirements:

* An Azure Synapse Analytics workspace. For instructions, see [Create an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-manage-workspace).
* A serverless Apache Spark pool.
* An ADLS Gen2 storage account. You need to be the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** of the ADLS Gen2 filesystem you want to work with. If you aren't, you need to add the permission manually.
* If you don’t want to use the workspace default storage, link the required ADLS Gen2 storage account in Synapse Studio. 


## Create an Apache Spark job definition for PySpark (Python)

In this section, you create an Apache Spark job definition for PySpark (Python).

1. Open [Synapse Studio](https://web.azuresynapse.net/).

2. You can go to [Sample files for creating Apache Spark job definitions](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Synapse/tree/master/Spark/Python) to download **sample files for python.zip**, then unzip the compressed package, and extract the **wordcount.py** and **shakespeare.txt** files. 

     ![sample files](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/sample-files.png)

3. Select **Data** -> **Linked** -> **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**, and upload **wordcount.py** and **shakespeare.txt** into your ADLS Gen2 filesystem.

## Create Apache Spark job definition by importing a JSON file

 You can import an existing local JSON file into Azure Synapse workspace from the **Actions** (...) menu of the Apache Spark job definition Explorer to create a new Apache Spark job definition.

 ![create import definition](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/create-import-definition.png)

 
 The Spark job definition is fully compatible with Livy API. You can add additional parameters for other Livy properties [(Livy Docs - REST API (apache.org)](https://livy.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/rest-api.html) in the local JSON file. You can also specify the Spark configuration related parameters in the config property as shown below. Then, you can import the JSON file back to create a new Apache Spark job definition for your batch job. Example JSON for spark definition import:
 
```Scala
   {
  "targetBigDataPool": {
    "referenceName": "socdemolarge",
    "type": "BigDataPoolReference"
  },
  "requiredSparkVersion": "2.3",
  "language": "scala",
  "jobProperties": {
    "name": "robinSparkDefinitiontest",
    "file": "adl://socdemo-c14.azuredatalakestore.net/users/robinyao/wordcount.jar",
    "className": "WordCount",
    "args": [
      "adl://socdemo-c14.azuredatalakestore.net/users/robinyao/shakespeare.txt"
    ],
    "jars": [],
    "files": [],
    "conf": {
      "spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled": "false",
      "spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors": "2",
      "spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors": "2"
    },
    "numExecutors": 2,
    "executorCores": 8,
    "executorMemory": "24g",
    "driverCores": 8,
    "driverMemory": "24g"
  }
}

```

## Export an existing Apache Spark job definition file

 You can export existing Apache Spark job definition files to local from **Actions** (...) menu of the File Explorer. You can further update the JSON file for additional Livy properties, and import it back to create new job definition if necessary.

 ![create export definition](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/create-export-definition.png)

 ![create export definition 2](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/create-export-definition-2.png)

## Submit an Apache Spark job definition as a batch job

After creating an Apache Spark job definition, you can submit it to an Apache Spark pool. Make sure you are the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** of the ADLS Gen2 filesystem you want to work with. If you aren't, you need to add the permission manually.

### Scenario 1: Submit Apache Spark job definition
 1. Open an Apache spark job definition window by selecting it.

      ![Open spark job definition to submit ](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/open-spark-definition.png)

 2. Select **Submit** button to submit your project to the selected Apache Spark Pool. You can select **Spark monitoring URL** tab to see the LogQuery of the Apache Spark application.

    ![The Spark Submission dialog box](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/submit-definition-result.png)

### Scenario 2: View Apache Spark job running progress

 1. Select **Monitor**, then select the **Apache Spark applications** option. You can find the submitted Apache Spark application.

     ![View Spark application](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/view-spark-application.png)

 2. Then select an Apache Spark application, the **SparkJobDefinition** job window displays. You can view the job execution progress from here.

### Scenario 3: Check output file

 1. Select **Data** -> **Linked** -> **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** (hozhaobdbj), open the **result** folder created earlier, you can go to the result folder and check if the output is generated.

     ![View output file](./media/apache-spark-job-definitions/view-output-file.png)

## Add an Apache Spark job definition into pipeline

In this section, you add an Apache Spark job definition into pipeline.

 1. Open an existing Apache Spark job definition.

 2. Select the icon on the top right of Apache Spark job definition, choose **Existing Pipeline**, or **New pipeline**. You can refer to Pipeline page for more information.
