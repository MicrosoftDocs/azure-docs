# Hyperspace: An indexing subsystem for Apache Spark

Hyperspace introduces the ability for Apache Spark users to create indexes on their datasets, such as CSV, JSON, and Parquet, and use them for potential query and workload acceleration.

In this article, we highlight the basics of Hyperspace, emphasize its simplicity, and show how it can be used by just about anyone.

Disclaimer: Hyperspace helps accelerate your workloads or queries under two circumstances:

* Queries contain filters on predicates with high selectivity. For example, you might want to select 100 matching rows from a million candidate rows.
* Queries contain a join that requires heavy shuffles. For example, you might want to join a 100-GB dataset with a 10-GB dataset.

You might want to carefully monitor your workloads and determine whether indexing is helping you on a case-by-case basis.

This document is also available in notebook form, for [Python](https://github.com/microsoft/hyperspace/blob/master/notebooks/python/Hitchhikers%20Guide%20to%20Hyperspace.ipynb), [C#](https://github.com/microsoft/hyperspace/blob/master/notebooks/csharp/Hitchhikers%20Guide%20to%20Hyperspace.ipynb), and [Scala](https://github.com/microsoft/hyperspace/blob/master/notebooks/scala/Hitchhikers%20Guide%20to%20Hyperspace.ipynb)

## Setup

To begin with, start a new Spark session. Since this document is a tutorial merely to illustrate what Hyperspace can offer, you will make a configuration change that allows us to highlight what Hyperspace is doing on small datasets. 

By default, Spark uses broadcast join to optimize join queries when the data size for one side of join is small (which is the case for the sample data we use in this tutorial). Therefore, we disable broadcast joins so that later when we run join queries, Spark uses sort-merge join. This is mainly to show how Hyperspace indexes would be used at scale for accelerating join queries.

The output of running the following cell shows a reference to the successfully created Spark session and prints out '-1' as the value for the modified join config, which indicates that broadcast join is successfully disabled.

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
// Start your Spark session
spark

// Disable BroadcastHashJoin, so Spark will use standard SortMergeJoin. Currently, Hyperspace indexes utilize SortMergeJoin to speed up query.
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold", -1)

// Verify that BroadcastHashJoin is set correctly
println(spark.conf.get("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold"))

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python
# Start your Spark session.
spark

# Disable BroadcastHashJoin, so Spark will use standard SortMergeJoin. Currently, Hyperspace indexes utilize SortMergeJoin to speed up query.
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold", -1)

# Verify that BroadcastHashJoin is set correctly 
print(spark.conf.get("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold"))
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp
// Disable BroadcastHashJoin, so Spark will use standard SortMergeJoin. Currently, Hyperspace indexes utilize SortMergeJoin to speed up query.
spark.Conf().Set("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold", -1);

// Verify that BroadcastHashJoin is set correctly.
Console.WriteLine(spark.Conf().Get("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold"));
```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console
res3: org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession = org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession@297e957d
-1
```

## Data preparation

To prepare your environment, you'll create sample data records and save them as Parquet data files. Parquet is used for illustration, but you can also use other formats such as CSV. In the subsequent cells, you'll see how you can create several Hyperspace indexes on this sample dataset and make Spark use them when running queries.

The example records correspond to two datasets: department and employee. You should configure the "empLocation" and "deptLocation" paths so that on the storage account they point to your desired location to save generated data files.

The output of running the following cell shows contents of our datasets as lists of triplets followed by references to dataFrames created to save the content of each dataset in our preferred location.

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame

// Sample department records
val departments = Seq(
      (10, "Accounting", "New York"),
      (20, "Research", "Dallas"),
      (30, "Sales", "Chicago"),
      (40, "Operations", "Boston"))

// Sample employee records
val employees = Seq(
      (7369, "SMITH", 20),
      (7499, "ALLEN", 30),
      (7521, "WARD", 30),
      (7566, "JONES", 20),

      (7934, "MILLER", 10),
      (7902, "FORD", 20),
      (7654, "MARTIN", 30))

// Save sample data in the Parquet format
import spark.implicits._
val empData: DataFrame = employees.toDF("empId", "empName", "deptId")
val deptData: DataFrame = departments.toDF("deptId", "deptName", "location")

val empLocation: String = "/<yourpath>/employees.parquet"       //TODO ** customize this location path **
val deptLocation: String = "/<yourpath>/departments.parquet"     //TODO ** customize this location path **
empData.write.mode("overwrite").parquet(empLocation)
deptData.write.mode("overwrite").parquet(deptLocation)
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

from pyspark.sql.types import StructField, StructType, StringType, IntegerType

# Create a schema for the dataframe
dept_schema = StructType([StructField('deptId', IntegerType(), True), StructField('deptName', StringType(), True), StructField('location', StringType(), True)])
emp_schema = StructType([StructField('empId', IntegerType(), True), StructField('empName', StringType(), True), StructField('deptId', IntegerType(), True)])

departments_df = spark.createDataFrame(departments, dept_schema)
employees_df = spark.createDataFrame(employees, emp_schema)

#TODO ** customize this location path **

empData.Write().Mode("overwrite").Parquet(empLocation);
deptData.Write().Mode("overwrite").Parquet(deptLocation);

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console
import org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame  
departments: Seq[(Int, String, String)] = List((10,Accounting,New York), (20,Research,Dallas), (30,Sales,Chicago), (40,Operations,Boston))  
employees: Seq[(Int, String, Int)] = List((7369,SMITH,20), (7499,ALLEN,30), (7521,WARD,30), (7566,JONES,20), (7698,BLAKE,30), (7782,CLARK,10), (7788,SCOTT,20), (7839,KING,10), (7844,TURNER,30), (7876,ADAMS,20), (7900,JAMES,30), (7934,MILLER,10), (7902,FORD,20), (7654,MARTIN,30))

empLocation: String = /your-path/employees.parquet  
deptLocation: String = /your-path/departments.parquet  
```

Let's verify the contents of the Parquet files we created to make sure they contain expected records in the correct format. Later, we'll use these data files to create Hyperspace indexes and run sample queries.

Running the following cell produces and output that displays the rows in employee and department dataFrames in a tabular form. There should be 14 employees and 4 departments, each matching with one of triplets you created in the previous cell.

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
// empLocation and deptLocation are the user defined locations above to save parquet files
val empDF: DataFrame = spark.read.parquet(empLocation)
val deptDF: DataFrame = spark.read.parquet(deptLocation)

// Verify the data is available and correct
empDF.show()
deptDF.show()
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

# emp_Location and dept_Location are the user-defined locations above to save parquet files
emp_DF = spark.read.parquet(emp_Location)
dept_DF = spark.read.parquet(dept_Location)

# Verify the data is available and correct
emp_DF.show()
dept_DF.show()

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp

// empLocation and deptLocation are the user-defined locations above to save parquet files
DataFrame empDF = spark.Read().Parquet(empLocation);
DataFrame deptDF = spark.Read().Parquet(deptLocation);

// Verify the data is available and correct
empDF.Show();
deptDF.Show();

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console
empDF: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [empId: int, empName: string ... 1 more field]

## Indexes

Hyperspace lets you create indexes on records scanned from persisted data files. After they're successfully created, an entry that corresponds to the index is added to the Hyperspace's metadata. This metadata is later used by Apache Spark's optimizer (with our extensions) during query processing to find and use proper indexes.

After indexes are created, you can perform several actions:

* **Refresh if the underlying data changes.** You can refresh an existing index to capture the changes.
* **Delete if the index isn't needed.** You can perform a soft delete, that is, the index isn't physically deleted but is marked as "deleted" so that it's no longer used in your workloads.
* **Vacuum if an index is no longer required.** You can vacuum an index, which forces a physical deletion of the index contents and associated metadata completely from Hyperspace's metadata.

Refresh if the underlying data changes, you can refresh an existing index to capture that.
Delete if the index is not needed, you can perform a soft-delete that is, index is not physically deleted but is marked as 'deleted' so it is no longer used in your workloads.

The following sections show how such index management operations can be done in Hyperspace.

First, you need to import the required libraries and create an instance of Hyperspace. Later, you'll use this instance to invoke different Hyperspace APIs to create indexes on your sample data and modify those indexes.

The output of running the following cell shows a reference to the created instance of Hyperspace.

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
// Create an instance of Hyperspace
import com.microsoft.hyperspace._

val hyperspace: Hyperspace = Hyperspace()
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

# Create an instance of Hyperspace
hyperspace = Hyperspace(spark)

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp

// Create an instance of Hyperspace
using Microsoft.Spark.Extensions.Hyperspace;

Hyperspace hyperspace = new Hyperspace(spark);

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console
import com.microsoft.hyperspace._  
hyperspace: com.microsoft.hyperspace.Hyperspace = com.microsoft.hyperspace.Hyperspace@1432f740
```

## Create indexes

To create a Hyperspace index, you need to provide two pieces of information:

* A Spark DataFrame that references the data to be indexed.
* An index configuration object, IndexConfig, which specifies the index name and the indexed and included columns of the index.

You start by creating three Hyperspace indexes on our sample data: two indexes on the department dataset named "deptIndex1" and "deptIndex2" and one index on the employee dataset named "empIndex". For each index, you need a corresponding IndexConfig to capture the name along with columns lists for the indexed and included columns. Running the following cell creates these IndexConfigs, and its output lists them.

> [!Note]
> An index column is a column that appears in your filters or join conditions. An included column is a column that appears in your select/project.

For instance, in the following query:

```sql
SELECT X
FROM T
WHERE Y = 2
```

Y can be an index column, and X can be an included column.

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
// Create index configurations
import com.microsoft.hyperspace.index.IndexConfig

val empIndexConfig: IndexConfig = IndexConfig("empIndex", Seq("deptId"), Seq("empName"))
val deptIndexConfig1: IndexConfig = IndexConfig("deptIndex1", Seq("deptId"), Seq("deptName"))
val deptIndexConfig2: IndexConfig = IndexConfig("deptIndex2", Seq("location"), Seq("deptName"))
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

# Create index configurations

emp_IndexConfig = IndexConfig("empIndex1", ["deptId"], ["empName"])
dept_IndexConfig1 = IndexConfig("deptIndex1", ["deptId"], ["deptName"])
dept_IndexConfig2 = IndexConfig("deptIndex2", ["location"], ["deptName"])

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp

using Microsoft.Spark.Extensions.Hyperspace.Index;

var empIndexConfig = new IndexConfig("empIndex", new string[] {"deptId"}, new string[] {"empName"});
var deptIndexConfig1 = new IndexConfig("deptIndex1", new string[] {"deptId"}, new string[] {"deptName"});
var deptIndexConfig2 = new IndexConfig("deptIndex2", new string[] {"location"}, new string[] {"deptName"});

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console
import com.microsoft.hyperspace.index.IndexConfig  
empIndexConfig: com.microsoft.hyperspace.index.IndexConfig = [indexName: empIndex; indexedColumns: deptid; includedColumns: empname]  
deptIndexConfig1: com.microsoft.hyperspace.index.IndexConfig = [indexName: deptIndex1; indexedColumns: deptid; includedColumns: deptname]  
deptIndexConfig2: com.microsoft.hyperspace.index.IndexConfig = [indexName: deptIndex2; indexedColumns: location; includedColumns: deptname]  
```
Now, you create three indexes using your index configurations. For this purpose, you invoke "createIndex" command on our Hyperspace instance. This command requires an index configuration and the dataFrame containing rows to be indexed. Running the following cell creates three indexes.

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
// Create indexes from configurations
import com.microsoft.hyperspace.index.Index

hyperspace.createIndex(empDF, empIndexConfig)
hyperspace.createIndex(deptDF, deptIndexConfig1)
hyperspace.createIndex(deptDF, deptIndexConfig2)
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

# Create indexes from configurations

hyperspace.createIndex(emp_DF, emp_IndexConfig)
hyperspace.createIndex(dept_DF, dept_IndexConfig1)
hyperspace.createIndex(dept_DF, dept_IndexConfig2)

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp

// Create indexes from configurations
hyperspace.CreateIndex(empDF, empIndexConfig);
hyperspace.CreateIndex(deptDF, deptIndexConfig1);
hyperspace.CreateIndex(deptDF, deptIndexConfig2);

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console
import com.microsoft.hyperspace.index.Index
```

## List indexes

The code that follows shows how you can list all available indexes in a Hyperspace instance. It uses "indexes" API that returns information about existing indexes as a Spark DataFrame so you can perform additional operations. 

For instance, you can invoke valid operations on this DataFrame for checking its content or analyzing it further (for example filtering specific indexes or grouping them according to some desired property).

The following cell uses DataFrame's 'show' action to fully print the rows and show details of our indexes in a tabular form. For each index, you can see all information Hyperspace has stored about it in the metadata. You will immediately notice the following:

* config.indexName, config.indexedColumns, config.includedColumns, and status.status are the fields that a user normally refers to.
* dfSignature is automatically generated by Hyperspace and is unique for each index. Hyperspace uses this signature internally to maintain the index and exploit it at query time.


In the following output, all three indexes should have "ACTIVE" as status and their name, indexed columns, and included columns should match with what we defined in index configurations above.

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
hyperspace.indexes.show
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

hyperspace.indexes().show()

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp

hyperspace.Indexes().Show();

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console
|Config.IndexName|Config.IndexedColumns|Config.IncludedColumns|        SchemaString|   SignatureProvider|         DfSignature|      SerializedPlan|NumBuckets|             DirPath|Status.Value|Stats.IndexSize|
|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------|--------------------|------------|---------------|
|      deptIndex1|             [deptId]|            [deptName]|`deptId` INT,`dep...|com.microsoft.cha...|0effc1610ae2e7c49...|Relation[deptId#3...|       200|abfss://datasets@...|      ACTIVE|              0|
|      deptIndex2|           [location]|            [deptName]|`location` STRING...|com.microsoft.cha...|0effc1610ae2e7c49...|Relation[deptId#3...|       200|abfss://datasets@...|      ACTIVE|              0|
|        empIndex|             [deptId]|             [empName]|`deptId` INT,`emp...|com.microsoft.cha...|30768c6c9b2533004...|Relation[empId#32...|       200|abfss://datasets@...|      ACTIVE|              0|
```

## Delete indexes

You can drop an existing index by using the "deleteIndex" API and providing the index name. Index deletion does a soft delete: It mainly updates index's status in the Hyperspace metadata from "ACTIVE" to "DELETED". This will exclude the dropped index from any future query optimization and Hyperspace no longer picks that index for any query. 

However, index files for a deleted index still remain available (since it is a soft-delete), so that the index could be restored if user asks for.

The following cell deletes index with name "deptIndex2" and lists Hyperspace metadata after that. The output should be similar to above cell for "List Indexes" except for "deptIndex2", which now should have its status changed into "DELETED".

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
hyperspace.deleteIndex("deptIndex2")

hyperspace.indexes.show
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

hyperspace.deleteIndex("deptIndex2")
hyperspace.indexes().show()

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp
hyperspace.DeleteIndex("deptIndex2");

hyperspace.Indexes().Show();

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console
|Config.IndexName|Config.IndexedColumns|Config.IncludedColumns|        SchemaString|   SignatureProvider|         DfSignature|      SerializedPlan|NumBuckets|             DirPath|Status.Value|Stats.IndexSize|
|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------|--------------------|------------|---------------|
|      deptIndex1|             [deptId]|            [deptName]|`deptId` INT,`dep...|com.microsoft.cha...|0effc1610ae2e7c49...|Relation[deptId#3...|       200|abfss://datasets@...|      ACTIVE|              0|
|      deptIndex2|           [location]|            [deptName]|`location` STRING...|com.microsoft.cha...|0effc1610ae2e7c49...|Relation[deptId#3...|       200|abfss://datasets@...|     DELETED|              0|
|        empIndex|             [deptId]|             [empName]|`deptId` INT,`emp...|com.microsoft.cha...|30768c6c9b2533004...|Relation[empId#32...|       200|abfss://datasets@...|      ACTIVE|              0|
```

## Restore indexes

You can use the "restoreIndex" API to restore a deleted index. This will bring back the latest version of index into ACTIVE status and makes it usable again for queries. The following cell shows an example of "restoreIndex" usage. You delete "deptIndex1" and restore it. The output shows "deptIndex1" first went into the "DELETED" status after invoking "deleteIndex" command and came back to the "ACTIVE" status after calling "restoreIndex".

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
hyperspace.deleteIndex("deptIndex1")

hyperspace.indexes.show

hyperspace.restoreIndex("deptIndex1")

hyperspace.indexes.show
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

hyperspace.deleteIndex("deptIndex1")
hyperspace.indexes().show()
hyperspace.restoreIndex("deptIndex1")
hyperspace.indexes().show()

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp

hyperspace.DeleteIndex("deptIndex1");
hyperspace.Indexes().Show();
hyperspace.RestoreIndex("deptIndex1");
hyperspace.Indexes().Show();

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console
|Config.IndexName|Config.IndexedColumns|Config.IncludedColumns|        SchemaString|   SignatureProvider|         DfSignature|      SerializedPlan|NumBuckets|             DirPath|Status.Value|Stats.indexSize|

## Vacuum indexes

You can perform a hard delete, that is, fully remove files and the metadata entry for a deleted index by using the **vacuumIndex** command. This action is irreversible. It physically deletes all the index files, which is why it's a hard delete.

The following cell vacuums the "deptIndex2" index and shows Hyperspace metadata after vacuuming. You should see metadata entries for two indexes "deptIndex1" and "empIndex" both with "ACTIVE" status and no entry for "deptIndex2".

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
hyperspace.vacuumIndex("deptIndex2")

hyperspace.indexes.show
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

hyperspace.vacuumIndex("deptIndex2")
hyperspace.indexes().show()

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp

hyperspace.VacuumIndex("deptIndex2");
hyperspace.Indexes().Show();

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console

```

## Enable or disable Hyperspace

Hyperspace provides APIs to enable or disable index usage with Spark.

* By using the **enableHyperspace** command, Hyperspace optimization rules become visible to the Spark optimizer and exploit existing Hyperspace indexes to optimize user queries.
* By using the **disableHyperspace** command, Hyperspace rules no longer apply during query optimization. Disabling Hyperspace has no impact on created indexes because they remain intact.

The following cell shows how you can use these commands to enable or disable Hyperspace. The output shows a reference to the existing Spark session whose configuration is updated.

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
// Enable Hyperspace
spark.enableHyperspace

// Disable Hyperspace
spark.disableHyperspace
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

# Enable Hyperspace
Hyperspace.enable(spark)

# Disable Hyperspace
Hyperspace.disable(spark)

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp

// Enable Hyperspace
spark.EnableHyperspace();

// Disable Hyperspace
spark.DisableHyperspace();

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console
res48: org.apache.spark.sql.Spark™Session = org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession@39fe1ddb  
res51: org.apache.spark.sql.Spark™Session = org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession@39fe1ddb
```

## Index usage

To make Spark use Hyperspace indexes during query processing, you need to make sure that Hyperspace is enabled.

The following cell enables Hyperspace and creates two DataFrames containing your sample data records, which you use for running example queries. For each DataFrame, a few sample rows are printed.

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
// Enable Hyperspace
spark.enableHyperspace

val empDFrame: DataFrame = spark.read.parquet(empLocation)
val deptDFrame: DataFrame = spark.read.parquet(deptLocation)

empDFrame.show(5)
deptDFrame.show(5)
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

# Enable Hyperspace
Hyperspace.enable(spark)

emp_DF = spark.read.parquet(emp_Location)
dept_DF = spark.read.parquet(dept_Location)

emp_DF.show(5)
dept_DF.show(5)

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp

// Enable Hyperspace
spark.EnableHyperspace();

DataFrame empDFrame = spark.Read().Parquet(empLocation);
DataFrame deptDFrame = spark.Read().Parquet(deptLocation);

empDFrame.Show(5);
deptDFrame.Show(5);

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console
res53: org.apache.spark.sql.Spark™Session = org.apache.spark.sql.Spark™Session@39fe1ddb  
empDFrame: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [empId: int, empName: string ... 1 more field]  
deptDFrame: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [deptId: int, deptName: string ... 1 more field]  
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

```console
|empId|empName|deptId|

| 7499|  ALLEN|    30|
| 7521|   WARD|    30|
| 7369|  SMITH|    20|
| 7844| TURNER|    30|
| 7876|  ADAMS|    20|
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
This only shows the top 5 rows
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

```console
|deptId|  deptName|location|
|------|----------|--------|
|    10|Accounting|New York|
|    40|Operations|  Boston|
|    20|  Research|  Dallas|
|    30|     Sales| Chicago|
```

## Index types

Currently, Hyperspace has rules to exploit indexes for two groups of queries:

* Selection queries with lookup or range selection filtering predicates.
* Join queries with an equality join predicate (that is, equijoins).

## Indexes for accelerating filters

The first example query does a lookup on department records, as shown in the following cell. In SQL, this query looks like the following example:

```sql
SELECT deptName
FROM departments
WHERE deptId = 20
```

The output of running the following cell shows:

* Query result, which is a single department name.
* Query plan that Spark used to run the query.

In the query plan, the **FileScan** operator at the bottom of the plan shows the data source where the records were read from. The location of this file indicates the path to the latest version of the "deptIndex1" index. This information shows that according to the query and using Hyperspace optimization rules, Spark decided to exploit the proper index at runtime.

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
// Filter with equality predicate

val eqFilter: DataFrame = deptDFrame.filter("deptId = 20").select("deptName")
eqFilter.show()

eqFilter.explain(true)
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

# Filter with equality predicate

eqFilter = dept_DF.filter("""deptId = 20""").select("""deptName""")
eqFilter.show()

eqFilter.explain(True)

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp

DataFrame eqFilter = deptDFrame.Filter("deptId = 20").Select("deptName");
eqFilter.Show();

eqFilter.Explain(true);

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console
eqFilter: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [deptName: string]
```

```console
|DeptName|
|--------|
|Research|
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

```console

```

The second example is a range selection query on department records. In SQL, this query looks like the following example:

```sql
SELECT deptName
FROM departments
WHERE deptId > 20
```

Similar to the first example, the output of the following cell shows the query results (names of two departments) and the query plan. The location of the data file in the **FileScan** operator shows that "deptIndex1" was used to run the query.

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
// Filter with range selection predicate

val rangeFilter: DataFrame = deptDFrame.filter("deptId > 20").select("deptName")
rangeFilter.show()

rangeFilter.explain(true)
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

# Filter with range selection predicate

rangeFilter = dept_DF.filter("""deptId > 20""").select("deptName")
rangeFilter.show()

rangeFilter.explain(True)

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp

// Filter with range selection predicate
DataFrame rangeFilter = deptDFrame.Filter("deptId > 20").Select("deptName");
rangeFilter.Show();

rangeFilter.Explain(true);

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console
rangeFilter: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [deptName: string]
```

```console
|  DeptName|
|----------|
|Operations|
|     Sales|
```

```console
== Parsed Logical Plan ==
'Project [unresolvedalias('deptName, None)]
+- Filter (deptId#533 > 20)
   +- Relation[deptId#533,deptName#534,location#535] parquet

Project [deptName#534]
+- Filter (deptId#533 > 20)

```
The third example is a query joining department and employee records on the department ID. The equivalent SQL statement is shown as follows:

```sql
SELECT employees.deptId, empName, departments.deptId, deptName
FROM   employees, departments
WHERE  employees.deptId = departments.deptId
```
The output of running the following cell shows the query results, which are the names of 14 employees and the name of the department each employee works in. The query plan is also included in the output. Notice how the file locations for two **FileScan** operators show that Spark used "empIndex" and "deptIndex1" indexes to run the query.

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
// Join

val eqJoin: DataFrame =
      empDFrame.
      join(deptDFrame, empDFrame("deptId") === deptDFrame("deptId")).
      select(empDFrame("empName"), deptDFrame("deptName"))

eqJoin.show()

eqJoin.explain(true)
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

## Support for SQL semantics

The index usage is transparent to whether you use the DataFrame API or Spark SQL. The following example shows the same join example as before, in SQL form, showing the use of indexes if applicable.

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
empDFrame.createOrReplaceTempView("EMP")
deptDFrame.createOrReplaceTempView("DEPT")

val joinQuery = spark.sql("SELECT EMP.empName, DEPT.deptName FROM EMP, DEPT WHERE EMP.deptId = DEPT.deptId")

joinQuery.show()
joinQuery.explain(true)
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

emp_DF.createOrReplaceTempView("EMP")
dept_DF.createOrReplaceTempView("DEPT")

joinQuery = spark.sql("SELECT EMP.empName, DEPT.deptName FROM EMP, DEPT WHERE EMP.deptId = DEPT.deptId")

joinQuery.show()
joinQuery.explain(True)

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp

empDFrame.CreateOrReplaceTempView("EMP");
deptDFrame.CreateOrReplaceTempView("DEPT");

var joinQuery = spark.Sql("SELECT EMP.empName, DEPT.deptName FROM EMP, DEPT WHERE EMP.deptId = DEPT.deptId");

joinQuery.Show();
joinQuery.Explain(true);

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console

joinQuery: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [empName: string, deptName: string]

## Explain API

Indexes are great, but how do you know if they're being used? Hyperspace allows users to compare their original plan versus the updated index-dependent plan before running their query. You have an option to choose from HTML, plaintext, or console mode to display the command output.

The following cell shows an example with HTML. The highlighted section represents the difference between original and updated plans along with the indexes being used.

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
spark.conf.set("spark.hyperspace.explain.displayMode", "html")
hyperspace.explain(eqJoin) { displayHTML }
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

eqJoin = emp_DF.join(dept_DF, emp_DF.deptId == dept_DF.deptId).select(emp_DF.empName, dept_DF.deptName)

spark.conf.set("spark.hyperspace.explain.displayMode", "html")
hyperspace.explain(eqJoin, True, displayHTML)

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp

spark.Conf().Set("spark.hyperspace.explain.displayMode", "html");
spark.Conf().Set("spark.hyperspace.explain.displayMode.highlight.beginTag", "<b style=\"background:LightGreen\">");
spark.Conf().Set("spark.hyperspace.explain.displayMode.highlight.endTag", "</b>");

hyperspace.Explain(eqJoin, false, input => DisplayHTML(input));

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

### Indexes used

```console
deptIndex1:abfss://datasets@hyperspacebenchmark.dfs.core.windows.net/<container>/indexes/public/deptIndex1/v__=0
empIndex:abfss://datasets@hyperspacebenchmark.dfs.core.windows.net/<container>/indexes/public/empIndex/v__=0
```

## Refresh indexes

If the original data on which an index was created changes, the index will no longer capture the latest state of data. You can refresh a stale index by using the **refreshIndex** command. This command causes the index to be fully rebuilt and updates it according to the latest data records. We'll show you how to incrementally refresh your index in other notebooks.

The following two cells show an example for this scenario:

* The first cell adds two more departments to the original departments data. It reads and prints a list of departments to verify new departments are added correctly. The output shows six departments in total: four old ones and two new. Invoking **refreshIndex** updates "deptIndex1" so that the index captures new departments.
* The second cell runs our range selection query example. The results should now contain four departments: two are the ones seen before when we ran the preceding query, and two are the new departments we added.

### Specific index refresh

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
val extraDepartments = Seq(
      (50, "Inovation", "Seattle"),
      (60, "Human Resources", "San Francisco"))

val extraDeptData: DataFrame = extraDepartments.toDF("deptId", "deptName", "location")
extraDeptData.write.mode("Append").parquet(deptLocation)

val deptDFrameUpdated: DataFrame = spark.read.parquet(deptLocation)

deptDFrameUpdated.show(10)

hyperspace.refreshIndex("deptIndex1")
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

extra_Departments = [(50, "Inovation", "Seattle"), (60, "Human Resources", "San Francisco")]

extra_departments_df = spark.createDataFrame(extra_Departments, dept_schema)
extra_departments_df.write.mode("Append").parquet(dept_Location)


dept_DFrame_Updated = spark.read.parquet(dept_Location)

dept_DFrame_Updated.show(10)

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp

var extraDepartments = new List<GenericRow>()
{
    new GenericRow(new object[] {50, "Inovation", "Seattle"}),
    new GenericRow(new object[] {60, "Human Resources", "San Francisco"})
};
	
DataFrame extraDeptData = spark.CreateDataFrame(extraDepartments, departmentSchema);
extraDeptData.Write().Mode("Append").Parquet(deptLocation);

DataFrame deptDFrameUpdated = spark.Read().Parquet(deptLocation);

deptDFrameUpdated.Show(10);

hyperspace.RefreshIndex("deptIndex1");

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console
extraDepartments: Seq[(Int, String, String)] = List((50,Inovation,Seattle), (60,Human Resources,San Francisco))  
extraDeptData: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [deptId: int, deptName: string ... 1 more field]  
deptDFrameUpdated: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [deptId: int, deptName: string ... 1 more field]
```

### Range selection

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-scala"

```scala
val newRangeFilter: DataFrame = deptDFrameUpdated.filter("deptId > 20").select("deptName")
newRangeFilter.show()

newRangeFilter.explain(true)
```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-python"

```python

newRangeFilter = dept_DFrame_Updated.filter("deptId > 20").select("deptName")
newRangeFilter.show()

newRangeFilter.explain(True)

```

::: zone-end

:::zone pivot = "programming-language-csharp"

```csharp

DataFrame newRangeFilter = deptDFrameUpdated.Filter("deptId > 20").Select("deptName");
newRangeFilter.Show();

newRangeFilter.Explain(true);

```

::: zone-end

Results in:

```console
newRangeFilter: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [deptName: string]
```

```console
|       DeptName|
|---------------|
|Human Resources|
|      Inovation|
|     Operations|
|          Sales|
```
