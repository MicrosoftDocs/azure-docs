# Success by design

Welcome to the Azure Synapse Customer Success Engineering Success by Design repository.

As part of the Synapse Engineering Group at Microsoft, the Azure Synapse Customer Success Engineering (CSE) team is relied upon to help with complex projects that involve Azure Synapse. As a team of experienced professionals, we provide guidance for all facets of Azure Synapse, including working with customers on architecture reviews, configuration guidance, and performance analysis and recommendations. It's from this experience that the CSE team created this repository of guidance articles to help you produce successful solutions.

This guidance is intended to supplement the official Azure Synapse documentation with additional specialized content that:

- Helps you evaluate Azure Synapse by using a Proof of Concept (POC) project.
- Helps you successfully implement a solution that incorporates Azure Synapse by using our [implementation success method](implementation-success-overview.md). This method can guide you through the key phases of your implementation, including planning, solution development, deployment, and post go-live evaluation.
- Provides detailed guidance on complex topics, including security, networking, troubleshooting, performance tuning, and migration.

> [!NOTE]
> This guidance undergoes continuous improvement by the Synapse CSE team. In time, guidance articles will cover additional topics, including enterprise development support using continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) methods, business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR), high availability (HA), and Azure Synapse monitoring.
