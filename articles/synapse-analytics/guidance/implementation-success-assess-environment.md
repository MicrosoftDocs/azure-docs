# Synapse implementation success methodology: Assess environment

[!INCLUDE [implementation-success-context](includes/implementation-success-context.md)]

The first step when implementing Azure Synapse Analytics is to conduct an assessment of your environment. An assessment provides you with the opportunity to gather all the available information about your existing environment, environmental requirements, project requirements, constraints, timelines, and pain points. This information will form the basis of later evaluations and checkpoint activities. It will prove invaluable when it comes time to validate and compare against the project solution as it's planned, designed, and developed. We recommend that you dedicate a good amount of time to gather all the information and be sure to have necessary discussions with relevant groups. Relevant groups can include project stakeholders, business users, solution designers, and subject matter experts (SMEs) of the existing solution and environment.

The assessment will become a guide to help you evaluate the solution design and make informed technology recommendations to implement Azure Synapse.

## Workload assessment

The workload assessment is concerned with the environment, analytical workload roles, ETL/ELT, networking and security, the Azure environment, and data consumption.

### Environment

## Azure Synapse services assessment

The Azure Synapse services assessment is concerned with the services within Azure Synapse. Azure Synapse has the following components for compute and data movement:

- **Synapse SQL:** A distributed query system for Transact-SQL (T-SQL) that enables data warehousing and data virtualization scenarios. It also extends T-SQL to address streaming and machine learning (ML) scenarios. Synapse SQL offers both *serverless* and *dedicated* resource models.
- **Serverless SQL pool:** A distributed data processing system, built for large-scale data and computational functions. There's no infrastructure to set up or clusters to maintain. This service is suited for unplanned or burst workloads. Recommended scenarios include quick data exploration on files directly on the data lake, logical data warehouse, and data transformation of raw data.
- **Dedicated SQL pool:** Represents a collection of analytic resources that are provisioned when using Synapse SQL. The size of a dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) is determined by Data Warehousing Units (DWU). This service is suited for a data warehouse with predictable, high performance continuous workloads over data stored in SQL tables. 
- **Apache Spark pool:** Deeply and seamlessly integrates Apache Spark, which is the most popular open source big data engine used for data preparation, data engineering, ETL, and ML.
- **Data integration pipelines:** Azure Synapse contains the same data integration engine and experiences as Azure Data Factory (ADF). They allow you to create rich at-scale ETL pipelines without leaving Azure Synapse.

To help determine the best SQL pool type (dedicated or serverless), evaluate the following points.

- Do you want to build a traditional relational data warehouse by reserving processing power for data stored in SQL tables?
- Do your use cases demand predictable performance?
- Do you want to a build a logical data warehouse on top of a data lake?
- Do you want to query data directly from a data lake?
- Do you want to explore data from a data lake?

The following table compares the two Synapse SQL pool types.

| **Comparison** | **Dedicated SQL pool** | **Serverless SQL pool** |
|:-|:-|:-|
| Value propositions | Fully managed capabilities of a data warehouse. Predictable and high performance for continuous workloads. Optimized for managed (loaded) data. | Easy to get started and explore data lake data. Better total cost of ownership (TCO) for ad hoc and intermittent workloads. Optimized for querying data in a data lake. |
| Workloads | *Ideal for continuous workloads.* Loading boosts performance, with more complexity. Charging per DWU (when sized well) will be cost-beneficial. | *Ideal for ad hoc or intermittent workloads.* There's no need to load data, so it's easier to start and run. Charging per usage will be cost-beneficial. |
| Query performance | *Delivers high concurrency and low latency.* Supports rich caching options, including materialized views. There's the ability to choose trade-offs with workload management (WLM). | *Not suited for dashboarding queries.* Millisecond response times aren't expected. It works only on external data. |

### Dedicated SQL pool assessment

For the dedicated SQL pool assessment, evaluate the following platform points.

- What is the current data warehouse platform (Microsoft SQL Server, Netezza, Teradata, Greenplum, or other)?
- For a migration workload, determine the make and model of your appliance for each environment. Include details of CPUs, GPUs, and memory.
- For an appliance migration, when was the hardware purchased? Has the appliance been fully depreciated? If not, when will depreciation end? And, how much capital expenditure is left?
- Are there any hardware and network architecture diagrams?
- Where are the data sources for your planned data warehouse located (Azure, other cloud provider, or on-premises)?
- What are the data hosting platforms of the data sources for your data warehouse (Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, DB2, Oracle, Azure Blob Storage, AWS, Hadoop, or other)?
- Are any of the data sources data warehouses? If so, which ones?
- Identify all ETL, ELT, and data loading scenarios (batch windows, streaming, near real-time). Identify existing service level agreements (SLAs) for each scenario and document the expected SLAs in the new environment.
- What is the current data warehouse size?
- What rate of dataset growth is being targeted for the dedicated SQL pool?
- Describe the environments you're using today (development, test, or production).
- Which tools are currently in place for data movement (ADF, Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), robocopy, Informatica, SFTP, or others)?
- Are you planning to load real-time or near real-time data?

Evaluate the following database points.

- What is the number of objects in each data warehouse (schemas, tables, views, stored procedures, functions)?
- Is it a star schema, snowflake schema or other design?
- What are the largest tables in terms of size and number of records?
- What are the widest tables in terms of the number of columns?
- Is there already a data model designed for your data warehouse? Is it a Kimball, Inmon, or star schema design?
- Are Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) in use? If so, which types?
- Will a semantic layer be implemented by using relational data marts or Analysis Services (tabular or multidimensional), or another product?
- What are the HA/RPO/RTO/data archiving requirements?
- What are the region replication requirements?

Evaluate the following workload characteristics.

- What is the estimated number of concurrent users or jobs accessing the data warehouse during *peak hours*?

- Identify the data consuming patterns and platforms:
    - Current and planned reporting method and tools.
    - Which application or analytical tools will access the data warehouse?
    - Number of concurrent queries?
    - Average number of active queries at any point in time?
    - What is the nature of data access (interactive, ad hoc, export, or others)?
    - Data roles and complete description of their data requirements.
    - Maximum number of concurrent connections.
- Query performance SLA pattern by:
    - Dashboard users.
    - Batch reporting.
    - ML users.
    - ETL process.
- What are the security requirements for the existing environment and for the new environment (row-level security, column-level security, access control, encryption, and others)?
- Do you have requirements to integrate ML model scoring with T-SQL?

### Serverless SQL pool assessment

Synapse Serverless SQL pool supports three major use cases.

- **Basic discovery and exploration:** Quickly reason about the data in various formats (Parquet, CSV, JSON) in your data lake, so you can plan how to extract insights from it.
- **Logical data warehouse:** Provide a relational abstraction on top of raw or disparate data without relocating and transforming data, allowing an always-current view of your data.
- **Data transformation:** Simple, scalable, and performant way to transform data in the lake by using T-SQL, so it can be fed to BI and other tools or loaded into a relational data store (Synapse SQL databases, Azure SQL Database, or others).

Different data roles can benefit from serverless SQL pool:

- **Data engineers** can explore the data lake, transform and prepare data by using this service, and simplify their data transformation pipelines.
- **Data scientists** can quickly reason about the contents and structure of the data in the data lake, thanks to features such as OPENROWSET and automatic schema inference.
- **Data analysts** can [explore data and Spark external tables](../sql/develop-storage-files-spark-tables.md) created by data scientists or data engineers by using familiar T-SQL statements or their favorite query tools.
- **BI professionals** can quickly [create Power BI reports on top of data in the data lake](../sql/tutorial-connect-power-bi-desktop.md) and Spark tables.

> [!NOTE]
> The T-SQL language is used in both dedicated SQL pool and the serverless SQL pool, however there are some differences in the set of supported features. For more information about T-SQL features supported in Synapse SQL (dedicated and serverless), see [Transact-SQL features supported in Azure Synapse SQL](../sql/overview-features.md).

For the serverless SQL pool assessment, evaluate the following points.

- Do you have use cases to discover and explore data from a data lake by using relational queries (T-SQL)?
- Do you have use cases to build a logical data warehouse on top of a data lake?
- Identify whether there are use cases to transform data in the data lake without first moving data from the data lake.
- Is your data already in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) or Azure Blob Storage?
- If your data is already in ADLS, do you have a good partition strategy in the data lake?
- Do you have operational data in Azure Cosmos DB? Do you have use cases for real-time analytics on Azure Cosmos DB without impacting transactions?
- Identify the file types in the data lake.
- Identify the query performance SLA. Does your use case demand predictable performance and cost?
- Do you have unplanned or bursty SQL analytical workloads?
- Identify the data consuming pattern and platforms:
    - Current and planned reporting method and tools.
    - Which application or analytical tools will access the serverless SQL pool?
    - Average number of active queries at any point in time.
    - What is the nature of data access (interactive, ad hoc, export, or others)?
    - Data roles and complete description of their data requirements.
    - Maximum number of concurrent connections.
    - Query complexity?
- What are the security requirements (access control, encryption, and others)?
- What is the required T-SQL functionality (stored procedures or functions)?
- Identify the number of queries that will be sent to the serverless SQL pool and the result set size of each query.

> [!TIP]
> If you're new to serverless SQL pools, we recommend you work through the [Build data analytics solutions using Azure Synapse serverless SQL pools](/training/paths/build-data-analytics-solutions-using-azure-synapse-serverless-sql-pools/) learning path.

### Spark pool assessment

Spark pools in Azure Synapse enable the following key scenarios.

- **Data engineering/Data preparation:** Apache Spark includes many language features to support preparation and processing of large volumes of data. Preparation and processing can make the data more valuable and allow it to be consumed by other Azure Synapse services. It's enabled through multiple languages (C#, Scala, PySpark, Spark SQL) and by using supplied libraries for processing and connectivity.
- **Machine learning:** Apache Spark comes with [MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/mllib/), which is an ML library built on top of Spark that you can use from a Spark pool. Spark pools also include Anaconda, which is a Python distribution that comprises various packages for data science including ML. In addition, Apache Spark on Synapse provides pre-installed libraries for [Microsoft Machine Learning](https://mmlspark.blob.core.windows.net/website/index.html), which is a fault-tolerant, elastic, and RESTful ML framework. When combined with built-in support for notebooks, you have a rich environment for creating ML applications.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information, see [Apache Spark in Azure Synapse Analytics](../spark/apache-spark-overview.md).
>
> Also, Azure Synapse is compatible with Linux Foundation Delta Lake. Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads. For more information, see [What is Delta Lake](../spark/apache-spark-what-is-delta-lake.md).

For the Spark pool assessment, evaluate the following points.

- Identify the workloads that require data engineering or data preparation.
- Clearly define the types of transformations.
- Identify whether you have unstructured data to process.
- When you're migrating from an existing Spark/Hadoop workload:
    - What is the existing big data platform (Cloudera, Hortonworks, cloud services, or other)?
    - If it's a migration from on-premises, has hardware depreciated or licenses expired? If not, when will depreciation or expiry happen?
    - What is the existing cluster type?
    - What are the required libraries and Spark versions?
    - Is it a Hadoop migration to Spark?
    - What are the current or preferred programming languages?
    - What is the type of workload (big data, ML, or other)?
    - What are the existing and planned client tools and reporting platforms?
    - What are the security requirements?
    - Are there any current pain points and limitations?
- Do you plan to use, or are currently using, Delta Lake?
- How do you manage packages today?
- Identify the required compute cluster types.
- Identify whether cluster customization is required.

> [!TIP]
> If you're new to Spark pools, we recommend you work through the [Perform data engineering with Azure Synapse Apache Spark Pools](/training/paths/perform-data-engineering-with-azure-synapse-apache-spark-pools/) learning path.
