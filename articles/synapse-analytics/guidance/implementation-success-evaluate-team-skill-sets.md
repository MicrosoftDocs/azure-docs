# Synapse implementation success methodology: Evaluate team skill sets

[!INCLUDE [implementation-success-context](includes/implementation-success-context.md)]

Solution development requires a team comprising individuals with many different skills. It's important for the success of your solution that your team has the necessary skills to successfully complete their assigned tasks. This evaluation takes an honest and critical look at the skill level of your project resources, and it provides you with a list of roles that are often required during the implementation of an Azure Synapse solution. Your team needs to possess relevant experience and skills to complete their assigned project tasks within the expected time frame.

## Microsoft learning levelÂ definitions

This article uses the Microsoft standard level definitions for describing learning levels.

| Level | Description |
|:-|:-|
| 100 | Assumes little or no expertise with the topic, and covers topic concepts, functions, features, and benefits. |
| 200 | Assumes 100-level knowledge and provides specific details about the topic. |
| 300 | *Advanced material.* Assumes 200-level knowledge, in-depth understanding of features in a real-world environment, and strong coding skills. Provides a detailed technical overview of a subset of product/technology features, covering architecture, performance, migration, deployment, and development. |
| 400 | *Expert material.* Assumes a deep level of technical knowledge and experience, and a detailed, thorough understanding of the topic. Provides expert-to-expert interaction and coverage of specialized topics. |

## Roles, resources, and readiness

Successfully delivering an Azure Synapse solution involves many different roles and skill sets. This topic describes roles commonly required to implement a successful project. Not all of these roles will be required for all projects, and not all of these roles will be required for the entire duration of the project. However, these roles will be required to complete some critical project tasks. You should evaluate the skill level of the individuals executing tasks to ensure their success in completing their job.

Refer to your [project plan](implementation-success-evaluate-project-plan.md) and verify that these resources and roles were identified. Also, check to see if your project plan identifies other resources and roles. In many cases, you may find that individuals belong to more than one role. For example, the Azure administrator could also be your Azure network administrator. It's also possible that a role in your organization is split between multiple individuals. For example, the Synapse administrator doesn't get involved in Synapse SQL security. In this case, adjust your evaluation accordingly.

Evaluate the following points.

- Identify the roles that will be required by your solution implementation.
- Identify the specific individuals in your project that will fulfill each role.
- Identify the specific project tasks that will be performed by each individual.
- Assign a [learning level](#microsoft-learning-leveldefinitions) to each individual for their tasks and roles.

Typically, a successful implementation requires that each individual has at least a level-300 proficiency for the tasks they'll perform. It's highly recommended that individuals at level-200 (or below) be provided with guidance and instruction to raise their level of understanding prior to beginning their project tasks. In this case, involve a level-300 (or above) individual to mentor and review. It's recommended that you adjust the project plan timeline and effort estimates to factor in learning new skills.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend you align your roles with the built-in roles. There are two sets of built-in roles: [RBAC roles for Azure Synapse](../security/synapse-workspace-synapse-rbac-roles.md) and [RBAC roles built into Azure](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md). These two sets of built-in roles and permissions are independent.
