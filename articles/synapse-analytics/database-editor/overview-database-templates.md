# Azure Synapse database templates

Azure Synapse Analytics now provides the ability to create a database using industry specific blueprints for databases. Use these templates to create your database in Synapse.

## What are database templates?
The Database templates are models that contain semantics how data in a lake can be represented and deployed as a database. These serve as templates to prepare your database, saving you the effort to build databases from scratch. This increases productivity and reduces time to insights with the automated data lifecycle. Database templates ease the preparation of database semantics and deployment into a lake database for further data ingestion, exploration, and analysis. They offer standardized semantics to choose and deploy to lake database.

## What is a lake database?
A lake database is an artifact that includes tables, columns, and logical relationships, and define schema for a business solution. The lake database can help you build your schema based on your operational data, transaction data, and business semantics while maintaining your data in data lake. A lake database is part of an Azure Synapse workspace and is unique within a workspace. You can define a lake database in Azure Synapse Spark, or through the database designer UI. You can also query using any Azure Synapse compute pool types, for example, Azure Synapse SQL, Azure Synapse Spark, or integration runtimes.
