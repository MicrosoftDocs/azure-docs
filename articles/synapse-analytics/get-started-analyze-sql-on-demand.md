# Analyze data with a serverless SQL pool

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to analyze data with serverless SQL pool. 

## The Built-in serverless SQL pool

Serverless SQL pools let you use SQL without having to reserve capacity. Billing for a serverless SQL pool is based on the amount of data processed to run the query and not the number of nodes used to run the query.

Every workspace comes with a preconfigured serverless SQL pool called **Built-in**. 

## Analyze NYC Taxi data with a serverless SQL pool
 
> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have [placed the sample data into the primary storage account](get-started-create-workspace.md#place-sample-data-into-the-primary-storage-account)

1. In the Synapse Studio, go to the **Develop** hub
1. Create a new SQL script.
1. Paste the following code into the script. (Update `contosolake` to the name of your storage account and `users` with the name of your container.)

    ```sql
    SELECT
        TOP 100 *
    FROM
        OPENROWSET(
            BULK 'https://contosolake.dfs.core.windows.net/users/NYCTripSmall.parquet',
            FORMAT='PARQUET'
        ) AS [result]
    ```

1. Select **Run**.

Data exploration is just a simplified scenario where you can understand the basic characteristics of your data. Learn more about data exploration and analysis in this [tutorial](sql/tutorial-data-analyst.md).

## Create data exploration database

You can browse the content of the files directly via `master` database. For some simple data exploration scenarios, you don't need to create a separate database.
However, as you continue data exploration, you might want to create some utility objects, such as:
- External data sources that represent the named references for storage accounts.
- Database scoped credentials that enable you to specify how to authenticate to external data source.
- Database users with the permissions to access some data sources or database objects.
- Utility views, procedures, and functions that you can use in the queries.

1. Use the `master` database to create a separate database for custom database objects. Custom database objects can't be created in the `master` database.

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE DataExplorationDB 
                   COLLATE Latin1_General_100_BIN2_UTF8
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Use a collation with `_UTF8` suffix to ensure that UTF-8 text is properly converted to `VARCHAR` columns. `Latin1_General_100_BIN2_UTF8` provides the best performance in the queries that read data from Parquet files and Azure Cosmos DB containers. For more information on changing collations, see [Collation types supported for Synapse SQL](sql/reference-collation-types.md).

1. Switch the database context from `master` to `DataExplorationDB` using the following command. You can also use the UI control **use database** to switch your current database:

   ```sql
   USE DataExplorationDB
   ```

1. From `DataExplorationDB` create utility objects such as credentials and data sources.

   ```sql
   CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE ContosoLake
   WITH ( LOCATION = 'https://contosolake.dfs.core.windows.net')
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > An external data source can be created without a credential. If a credential does not exist, the caller's identity will be used to access the external data source.

1. Optionally, use the newly created `DataExplorationDB` database to create a login for a user in `DataExplorationDB` that will access external data:

   ```sql
   CREATE LOGIN data_explorer WITH PASSWORD = 'My Very Strong Password 1234!';
   ```

   Next create a database user in `DataExplorationDB` for the above login and grant the `ADMINISTER DATABASE BULK OPERATIONS` permission.

   ```sql
   CREATE USER data_explorer FOR LOGIN data_explorer;
   GO
   GRANT ADMINISTER DATABASE BULK OPERATIONS TO data_explorer;
   GO
   ```

1. Explore the content of the file using the relative path and the data source:

   ```sql
   SELECT
       TOP 100 *
   FROM
       OPENROWSET(
               BULK '/users/NYCTripSmall.parquet',
               DATA_SOURCE = 'ContosoLake',
               FORMAT='PARQUET'
       ) AS [result]
   ```

1. **Publish** your changes to the workspace.

Data exploration database is just a simple placeholder where you can store your utility objects. Synapse SQL pool enables you to do much more and create a Logical Data Warehouse - a relational layer built on top of Azure data sources.
