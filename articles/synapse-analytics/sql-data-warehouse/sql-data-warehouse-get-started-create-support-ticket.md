1. Review your [Azure support plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/?WT.mc_id=Support_Plan_510979/).

   * **Billing, quota, and subscription management** support are available at all support levels.
   * **Break-fix** support is provided through [Developer](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/developer/), [Standard](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/standard/), [Professional Direct](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/prodirect/), or [Premier](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/premier/) support. Break-fix issues are problems experienced by customers while using Azure where there is a reasonable expectation that Microsoft caused the problem.
   * **Developer mentoring** and **advisory services** are available at the [Professional Direct](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/prodirect/) and [Premier](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/premier/) support levels.

   If you have a Premier support plan, you can also report Azure Synapse Analytics issues on the [Microsoft Premier online portal](https://www.microsoft.com/unifiedsupport/premier). See [Azure support plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/?WT.mc_id=Support_Plan_510979/) to learn more about the various support plans, including scope, response times, pricing, etc.  For frequently asked questions about Azure support, see [Azure support FAQs](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/faq/).
