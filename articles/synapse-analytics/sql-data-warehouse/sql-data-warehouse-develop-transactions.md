# Use transactions in a SQL pool in Azure Synapse 

This article includes tips for implementing transactions and developing solutions in a SQL pool.

## What to expect

As you would expect, SQL pool supports transactions as part of the data warehouse workload. However, to ensure SQL pool is maintained at scale, some features are limited when compared to SQL Server. This article highlights the differences.

## Transaction isolation levels

SQL pool implements ACID transactions. The isolation level of the transactional support is default to READ UNCOMMITTED.  You can change it to READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT ISOLATION by turning ON the READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT database option for a user SQL pool when connected to the master database.  

Once enabled, all transactions in this database are executed under READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT ISOLATION and setting READ UNCOMMITTED on session level will not be honored. Check [ALTER DATABASE SET options (Transact-SQL)](/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-set-options?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/breadcrumb/toc.json&view=azure-sqldw-latest&preserve-view=true) for details.

## Transaction size

A single data modification transaction is limited in size. The limit is applied per distribution. Therefore, the total allocation can be calculated by multiplying the limit by the distribution count.

To approximate the maximum number of rows in the transaction divide the distribution cap by the total size of each row. For variable length columns, consider taking an average column length rather than using the maximum size.

In the following table, two assumptions have been made:

* An even distribution of data has occurred
* The average row length is 250 bytes

The transaction size limit is applied per transaction or operation. It is not applied across all concurrent transactions. Therefore each transaction is permitted to write this amount of data to the log.

To optimize and minimize the amount of data written to the log, please refer to the [Transactions best practices](sql-data-warehouse-develop-best-practices-transactions.md) article.

> [!WARNING]
> The maximum transaction size can only be achieved for HASH or ROUND_ROBIN distributed tables where the spread of the data is even. If the transaction is writing data in a skewed fashion to the distributions then the limit is likely to be reached prior to the maximum transaction size.

## Transaction state

SQL pool uses the XACT_STATE() function to report a failed transaction using the value -2. This value means the transaction has failed and is marked for rollback only.

> [!NOTE]
> The use of -2 by the XACT_STATE function to denote a failed transaction represents different behavior to SQL Server. SQL Server uses the value -1 to represent an uncommittable transaction. SQL Server can tolerate some errors inside a transaction without it having to be marked as uncommittable. For example, `SELECT 1/0` would cause an error but not force a transaction into an uncommittable state.

SQL Server also permits reads in the uncommittable transaction. However, SQL pool does not let you do this. If an error occurs inside a SQL pool transaction, it will automatically enter the -2 state and you will not be able to make any further select statements until the statement has been rolled back.

As such, it's important to check that your application code to see if it uses  XACT_STATE() as you may need to make code modifications.

For example, in SQL Server, you might see a transaction that looks like the following:

```sql
SET NOCOUNT ON;
DECLARE @xact_state smallint = 0;

BEGIN TRAN
    BEGIN TRY
        DECLARE @i INT;
        SET     @i = CONVERT(INT,'ABC');
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        SET @xact_state = XACT_STATE();

        SELECT  ERROR_NUMBER()    AS ErrNumber
        ,       ERROR_SEVERITY()  AS ErrSeverity
        ,       ERROR_STATE()     AS ErrState
        ,       ERROR_PROCEDURE() AS ErrProcedure
        ,       ERROR_MESSAGE()   AS ErrMessage
        ;

        IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0
        BEGIN
            ROLLBACK TRAN;
            PRINT 'ROLLBACK';
        END

    END CATCH;

IF @@TRANCOUNT >0
BEGIN
    PRINT 'COMMIT';
    COMMIT TRAN;
END

SELECT @xact_state AS TransactionState;
```

The preceding code gives the following error message:

Msg 111233, Level 16, State 1, Line 1
111233; The current transaction has aborted, and any pending changes have been rolled back. The cause of this issue is that a transaction in a rollback-only state not being explicitly rolled back before a DDL, DML, or SELECT statement.

You won't get the output of the ERROR_* functions.

In SQL pool the code needs to be slightly altered:

```sql
SET NOCOUNT ON;
DECLARE @xact_state smallint = 0;

BEGIN TRAN
    BEGIN TRY
        DECLARE @i INT;
        SET     @i = CONVERT(INT,'ABC');
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        SET @xact_state = XACT_STATE();

        IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0
        BEGIN
            ROLLBACK TRAN;
            PRINT 'ROLLBACK';
        END

        SELECT  ERROR_NUMBER()    AS ErrNumber
        ,       ERROR_SEVERITY()  AS ErrSeverity
        ,       ERROR_STATE()     AS ErrState
        ,       ERROR_PROCEDURE() AS ErrProcedure
        ,       ERROR_MESSAGE()   AS ErrMessage
        ;
    END CATCH;

IF @@TRANCOUNT >0
BEGIN
    PRINT 'COMMIT';
    COMMIT TRAN;
END

SELECT @xact_state AS TransactionState;
```

The expected behavior is now observed. The error in the transaction is managed and the ERROR_* functions provide values as expected.

All that has changed is that the ROLLBACK of the transaction had to happen before the read of the error information in the CATCH block.

## Error_Line() function

It is also worth noting that SQL pool does not implement or support the ERROR_LINE() function. If you have this in your code, you need to remove it to be compliant with SQL pool.

Use query labels in your code instead to implement equivalent functionality. For more details, see the [LABEL](sql-data-warehouse-develop-label.md) article.

## Using THROW and RAISERROR

THROW is the more modern implementation for raising exceptions in SQL pool but RAISERROR is also supported. There are a few differences that are worth paying attention to however.

* User-defined error messages numbers cannot be in the 100,000 - 150,000 range for THROW
* RAISERROR error messages are fixed at 50,000
* Use of sys.messages is not supported

## Limitations

SQL pool does have a few other restrictions that relate to transactions.

They are as follows:

* No distributed transactions
* No nested transactions permitted
* No save points allowed
* No named transactions
* No marked transactions
* No support for DDL such as CREATE TABLE inside a user-defined transaction
