# Troubleshoot a misclassified workload in Azure Synapse Analytics

This article covers guidance on how to troubleshoot a misclassified workload, and how to identify the reason behind the classification, for workloads in a dedicated SQL pool.

Azure Synapse Analytics provides workload management capabilities like [classifying workloads to appropriate workload groups](sql-data-warehouse-workload-classification.md), [assigning importance](sql-data-warehouse-workload-importance.md), and [isolating resources](sql-data-warehouse-workload-isolation.md) to meet SLAs. 

However, in some scenarios, a combination of these capabilities can lead to workload classification that doesn't reflect user intent. This article lists such common scenarios and how to troubleshoot them. First, you should query basic information for troubleshooting misclassified workload scenarios.

> [!NOTE]
> Classifying managed identities behavior differs between the dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse workspaces and the standalone dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW). While the standalone dedicated SQL pool managed identity maintains the assigned identity, for Azure Synapse workspaces the managed identity runs as `dbo`. This cannot be changed. The dbo role, by default, is classified to smallrc. Creating a classifier for the dbo role allows for assigning requests to a workload group other than smallrc. If dbo alone is too generic for classification and has broader impacts, consider using label, session or time-based classification in conjunction with the dbo role classification. 
>
> Except for smallrc, the dynamic resource classes are implemented as pre-defined database roles. Smallrc does not appear as a database role, but is the [Default resource class](resource-classes-for-workload-management.md#default-resource-class).

## Basic troubleshooting information

To troubleshoot a misclassified workload scenario the following information is needed:

- List of all [workload groups](#workload-groups)
- List of all [workload classifiers](#workload-classifiers) and associated workload groups
- List of [users and mapped workload groups](#users-and-mapped-resource-classes) (system and user defined) 
- List of [workload group and classifier details](#workload-group-and-classifier-details-of-a-request) of a request


### Workload groups

#### Azure portal

To get a list of all workload groups (including system workload groups) and associated details in the Azure portal:

1. Go to the Azure Synapse workspace under which the dedicated SQL Pool of interest has been created.
1. On the left side pane, all pool types created under the workspace are listed. Select **SQL Pools** under **Analytical Pools** section.
1. Select the dedicated SQL pool of interest.
1. In the left side pane, select **Workload management** under **Settings**.
1. Under **Workload groups** section, all workloads are listed. By default only **User-Defined Workload groups** are listed. To view a list of both user-defined and system-defined workload groups, edit the filter and **Select All**.

#### T-SQL

To view workload groups using T-SQL, [connect to the dedicated SQL Pool using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](../sql/get-started-ssms.md) and issue following query:
 
```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.workload_management_workload_groups;
```

For more information, see [sys.workload_management_workload_groups](/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-workload-management-workload-groups-transact-sql).


### Workload classifiers

#### Azure portal

To list all workload classifiers (including system-defined classifiers) by workload group in the Azure portal, see the numbers listed in **Classifiers** column in Workload group table (see previous section).

#### T-SQL

To get the list of all workload classifiers (including system-defined classifiers) using T-SQL, use following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.workload_management_workload_classifiers;
```

For more information, see [sys.workload_management_workload_classifiers](/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-workload-management-workload-classifiers-transact-sql).

### Users and mapped resource classes

To get a list of system defined resource classes and mapped users in T-SQL, use following query:

```sql
SELECT  r.name AS [Resource Class]
,       m.name AS [Member Name]
FROM    sys.database_role_members AS rm
JOIN    sys.database_principals AS r ON rm.role_principal_id = r.principal_id
JOIN    sys.database_principals AS m ON rm.member_principal_id = m.principal_id
WHERE   r.name IN ('mediumrc','largerc','xlargerc','staticrc10','staticrc20','staticrc30','staticrc40','staticrc50','staticrc60','staticrc70','staticrc80');
```

### Workload group and classifier details of a request

The first step in troubleshooting a misclassified workload problem is to identify the workload group and workload classifier for a query. Use the dynamic management view [sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-pdw-exec-requests-transact-sql?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/breadcrumb/toc.json&view=azure-sqldw-latest&preserve-view=true) to view submitted queries and their classification:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests;
```

For more information, see [sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-pdw-exec-requests-transact-sql).

## Common scenarios of misclassified workloads

Here are some common scenarios where unintended misclassified workloads can occur:

### Mixed usage of resource classes and user-defined workload management

In scenarios where resource classes and workload groups are used together, user role to resource class mappings can conflict with workload classifier rules, and lead to unintended query classification. 

Consider following scenario:

1. A database user, DBAUser, is assigned to largerc resource class role using `sp_addrolemember` procedure.
1. DBAUser has created a new workload group and classifier using workload management.
1. A newly created workload classifier maps database role DBARole to mediumrc resource class with high importance. 
1. DBAUser is a made a member of the DBARole database role.
1. When DBAUser runs a query, the query is expected to run on mediumrc based on workload classifier. Instead it will be assigned to largerc, as **user** mapping takes precedence over **role membership** mapping to a classifier.

It's best to avoid mixing usage of resource classes and workload management groups to do workload management. For more information on steps to convert resource classes to workloads, see [Convert Resource Classes to Workload Groups](sql-data-warehouse-how-to-convert-resource-classes-workload-groups.md). 

However, there can be situations where both resource classes and workload management need to be used together. In such scenarios, to simplify troubleshooting misclassification, we recommend you remove resource class role mappings as you create workload classifiers. The code below returns existing resource class role memberships. Run [sp_droprolemember](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-droprolemember-transact-sql?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/breadcrumb/toc.json&view=azure-sqldw-latest&preserve-view=true) for each member name returned from the corresponding resource class.

```sql
SELECT  r.name AS [Resource Class]
, m.name AS membername
FROM    sys.database_role_members AS rm
JOIN    sys.database_principals AS r ON rm.role_principal_id = r.principal_id
JOIN    sys.database_principals AS m ON rm.member_principal_id = m.principal_id
WHERE   r.name IN ('mediumrc','largerc','xlargerc','staticrc10','staticrc20','staticrc30','staticrc40','staticrc50','staticrc60','staticrc70','staticrc80');

--for each row returned run
EXEC sp_droprolemember '[Resource Class]', membername;
```

### Some administrative users are always mapped to smallrc workload group

Consider a scenario for the Azure Synapse Workspace SQL Admin login, the Azure Synapse Microsoft Entra admin (user or group member), or a database owner. These users might still have a workload classifier or have been added to a resource class role other than smallrc. All queries executed by these users will still run on smallrc resource class, even though the users are mapped to a different resource class or workload group. 

**Recommendation**: These administrative users can't change their default workload group. For more information, see [workload management with resource classes](resource-classes-for-workload-management.md#default-resource-class). It is recommended that critical or performance-sensitive workloads not run as one of these administrative users in the dedicated SQL pool.

   The Azure Synapse Workspace SQL Admin login and the Azure Synapse Microsoft Entra admin (user or group member) are specified in the Azure portal, on the **Overview** page of the dedicated SQL pool.

   Similarly, the database owner (dbo) and **db_owner** database roles are not allowed to change their default resource class. If a user is either the database owner or added under **db_owner** database role, all queries executed by the user go to smallrc by default. These roles can't be added to a resource class other than smallrc. However, if a user who is part of this role would like to classify their queries to a different workload group, they can use `MEMBERNAME` option in [workload classifier definition](sql-data-warehouse-workload-classification.md).

### Use workload group precedence for better classification

In scenarios where workload classifiers are mapped to multiple workload groups, or a user is mapped to multiple resource classes, precedence order determines chosen workload group and Resource class. List of precedence rules: 

> [!NOTE]
> As mentioned in [Mixing Resource Classes and user-defined Workload Management](#mixed-usage-of-resource-classes-and-user-defined-workload-management) section, it isn't recommended to combine usage of Resource classes and user-defined workload groups/classes.

#### If resource classes are being used:

In scenarios where resource classes are being used it's best to create a dedicated user for each type of workload being run. However, if a user is a member of multiple resource classes, then precedence rules documented in [Resource Class Precedence](resource-classes-for-workload-management.md#resource-class-precedence) take effect:

1. Dynamic resource class takes precedence over static resource class. For example, if a user is member of mediumrc (dynamic) and staticrc80(static), user queries run with mediumrc.
1. Bigger resource classes are preferred over smaller resource classes. For example, if a user is member of staticrc20 and staticrc80, then user queries will run with staticrc80.

#### If workload management capabilities are used

Workload management (WLM) capabilities provide capability to create multiple workload classifiers for same user or workload group. Classifier definition statement has multiple parameters based on which incoming requests are assigned to workloads. These parameters have a **weight** score as shown below and this score determines order of precedence: 

|**Classifier parameter** |**Weight**   |
|---------------------|---------|
|MEMBERNAME:USER      |64       |
|MEMBERNAME:ROLE      |32       |
|WLM_LABEL            |16       |
|WLM_CONTEXT          |8        |
|START_TIME/END_TIME  |4        |

Let us see these precedence rules in action using an example. If a user creates two workload classifiers as follows:

```sql
CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER CLASSIFIER-1 WITH  
( WORKLOAD_GROUP = 'wgDataLoad'
 ,MEMBERNAME     = 'USER-1'  
 ,WLM_LABEL      = 'dimension_loads' 
 ,IMPORTANCE     = 'High');

CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER CLASSIFIER-2 WITH  
( WORKLOAD_GROUP = 'wgUserqueries'
 ,MEMBERNAME     = 'USER-1'  
 ,START_TIME     = '18:00' 
 ,END_TIME       = '07:30'
 ,IMPORTANCE     = 'Low')
```

Queries submitted by User-1 can be submitted via both classifiers. Query run by User-1 with the `dimension_loads` label between 6PM and 7AM UTC will be assigned to `wgDashboards` as weight score of `WLM_LABEL` is higher than `START_TIME`/`END_TIME`. The weighting of `CLASSIFIER-1` is 80 (64 for user, plus 16 for `WLM_LABEL`). The weighting of `CLASSIFIER-2` is 68 (64 for user, 4 for `START_TIME`/`END_TIME`). 

For more information on workload classification, see [classification weighting](sql-data-warehouse-workload-classification.md#classification-weighting) and [query labels](../sql/develop-label.md).

### What happens if precedence in workload classification leads to a tie?

Even after workload classifier precedence is applied, it is possible for a query to be classified to multiple workload groups. For example, consider following classifiers:

```sql
CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER CLASSIFIER-1 WITH  
( WORKLOAD_GROUP = 'wgDataLoad'
 ,MEMBERNAME     = 'USER-1'  
 ,WLM_LABEL      = 'dimension_loads' 
 ,IMPORTANCE     = 'High');

CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER CLASSIFIER-2 WITH  
( WORKLOAD_GROUP = 'wgUserqueries'
 ,MEMBERNAME     = 'USER-1'  
 ,WLM_LABEL      = 'dimension_loads' 
 ,IMPORTANCE     = 'Low');
```

If a user runs a query with `OPTION (LABEL = 'dimension_loads')`, it can be classified to either `wgDataLoad` or `wgUserqueries` based on precedence rules. But which workload group is chosen?

#### Workload group and classifier tie-breakers

If there was a tie in workload groups or classifiers, following precedence takes effect:

1. The workload group with the highest resource allocation is chosen. This behavior optimizes for performance in scenarios where logins are members of multiple resource classes. This behavior also ensures backward compatibility.
        
    Consider the following two workload groups and workload classifiers:
        
    ```sql
    -- Workload Groups
    CREATE WORKLOAD GROUP wgDataLoad
    WITH
    ( MIN_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE = 26 
    ,REQUEST_MIN_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT = 2              
    ,CAP_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE = 100 )
    
    CREATE WORKLOAD GROUP wgUserqueries
    WITH
    ( MIN_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE = 15
    ,REQUEST_MIN_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT = 5               
    ,CAP_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE = 50 );
    
    --Workload Classifiers
    CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER CLASSIFIER-1 WITH  
    ( WORKLOAD_GROUP = 'wgDataLoad'
    ,MEMBERNAME     = 'USER-1'  
    ,WLM_LABEL      = 'dimension_loads' 
    ,IMPORTANCE     = 'High');
    
    CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER CLASSIFIER-2 WITH  
    ( WORKLOAD_GROUP = 'wgUserqueries'
    ,MEMBERNAME     = 'USER-1'  
    ,WLM_LABEL      = 'dimension_loads' 
    ,IMPORTANCE     = 'High');
    ```
                      
    If a user runs a query with `OPTION (LABEL = 'dimension_loads')`, the query meets criteria for both the classifiers. However, the user request will be routed to `wgUserQueries` workload group as it has higher minimum resource allocation per request.
    
2. Next, concurrency setting and available concurrency for respective workload groups is considered for tie-breakers. The workload group with the highest available concurrency at a time when request arrived will give the query best chance of executing. 
    
    Consider following two workload groups and workload classifiers:
    
    ```sql
    --Workload Groups
    CREATE WORKLOAD GROUP wgDataLoad
    WITH
    ( MIN_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE = 30              
     ,REQUEST_MIN_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT = 2 (concurrency of 15)
     ,REQUEST_MIN_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT = 2
     ,CAP_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE = 100 );
    
    CREATE WORKLOAD GROUP wgUserqueries
    WITH
    ( MIN_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE = 30
     ,REQUEST_MIN_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT = 2 (concurrency of 15)
     ,REQUEST_MIN_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT = 2
     ,CAP_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE = 100 );
    
    -- Workload Classifiers
    CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER CLASSIFIER-1 WITH  
    ( WORKLOAD_GROUP = 'wgDataLoad'
     ,MEMBERNAME     = 'USER-1'  
     ,WLM_LABEL      = 'dimension_loads' 
     ,IMPORTANCE     = 'High');
    
    CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER CLASSIFIER-2 WITH  
    ( WORKLOAD_GROUP = 'wgUserqueries'
     ,MEMBERNAME     = 'USER-1'  
     ,WLM_LABEL      = 'dimension_loads' 
     ,IMPORTANCE     = 'High');
    ```
                  
    If a user runs a query with `OPTION (LABEL = 'dimension_loads')`, both the classifiers have a tie as the query meets criteria for both. When user submits the query, consider the scenario where five concurrent queries are getting executed in the `wgUserqueries` group and ten queries are getting executed in the `wgDataLoad` group. The user request will be routed to `wgUserqueries` group using `CLASSIFIER-2`, as the `wgUserqueries` workload group has higher available concurrency at the time the user submitted a query.
    
3. Next, the importance setting of the request is considered for tie-breakers. If there was a tie in workload classification using precedence rules, the request will be routed to workload group that has highest importance. For more information, see [workload importance](sql-data-warehouse-workload-importance.md).

4. Finally, the creation time of the workload group is considered for tie-breakers. The user request will be routed to the workload group that was created most recently.
