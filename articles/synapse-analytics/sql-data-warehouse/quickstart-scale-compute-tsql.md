# Quickstart: Scale compute for dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) in Azure Synapse Analytics using T-SQL

Scale compute in dedicated SQL pools using T-SQL and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). [Scale out compute](sql-data-warehouse-manage-compute-overview.md) for better performance, or scale back compute to save costs.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

> [!NOTE]  
> This article applies to dedicated SQL pools created in Azure Synapse Analytics workspaces, dedicated SQL pools (formerly SQL DW), and dedicated SQL pools (formerly SQL DW) in connected workspaces.

## Before you begin

Download and install the newest version of [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/breadcrumb/toc.json&view=azure-sqldw-latest&preserve-view=true).

## Create a dedicated SQL pool if needed

This quickstart assumes you already have a dedicated SQL pool.

If needed, it is recommended to create a new dedicated SQL pool in an Azure Synapse workspace. [Create an Azure Synapse workspace](../quickstart-create-workspace.md) and then [create a dedicated SQL pool using Synapse Studio](../quickstart-create-sql-pool-studio.md). Or, you can create a legacy dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW), using [Quickstart: create and Connect - portal](create-data-warehouse-portal.md) to create a dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) named `mySampleDataWarehouse`.

Ensure you have a firewall rule and can connect to your dedicated SQL pool from within SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

## Connect to the server as server admin

This section uses [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/breadcrumb/toc.json&view=azure-sqldw-latest&preserve-view=true) to establish a connection to your Azure SQL server.

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio.

1. In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, enter the following information:

   | Setting       | Suggested value | Description  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Server type | Database engine | This value is required |
   | Server name | The fully qualified server name | Here's an example: **mySampleDataWarehouseservername.database.windows.net**. |
   | Authentication | SQL Server Authentication | SQL Authentication is the only authentication type that is configured in this tutorial. |
   | Login | The server admin account | The account that you specified when you created the server. |
   | Password | The password for your server admin account | The password you specified when you created the server. |

1. Select **Connect**. The Object Explorer window opens in SSMS.

1. In Object Explorer, expand **Databases**. Then expand `mySampleDataWarehouse` to view the objects in your new database.

## View service objective

The service objective setting contains the number of data warehouse units for the dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW).

To view the current data warehouse units for your dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW):

1. Under the connection to `mySampleDataWarehouseservername.database.windows.net`, expand **System Databases**.
1. Right-click on the `master` system database and select **New Query**. A new query window opens.
1. Run the following query to select from the `sys.database_service_objectives` dynamic management view.

    ```sql
    SELECT
        db.name AS [Database]
    ,    ds.edition AS [Edition]
    ,    ds.service_objective AS [Service Objective]
    FROM
         sys.database_service_objectives ds
    JOIN
        sys.databases db ON ds.database_id = db.database_id
    WHERE
        db.name = 'mySampleDataWarehouse';
    ```

1. The following results show `mySampleDataWarehouse` has a service objective of DW400 in the `Service Objective` column.

## Scale compute

In dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW), you can increase or decrease compute resources by adjusting data warehouse units. The [Create and Connect - portal](create-data-warehouse-portal.md) created `mySampleDataWarehouse` and initialized it with 400 DWUs. The following steps adjust the DWUs for `mySampleDataWarehouse`.

To change data warehouse units:

1. Right-click on the `master` system database and select **New Query**.
1. Use the [ALTER DATABASE](/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-database-azure-sql-database?toc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/toc.json&bc=/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/breadcrumb/toc.json&view=azure-sqldw-latest&preserve-view=true) T-SQL statement to modify the service objective. Run the following query to change the service objective to DW300.

    ```Sql
    ALTER DATABASE mySampleDataWarehouse
    MODIFY (SERVICE_OBJECTIVE = 'DW300c');
    ```

## Monitor scale change request

To see the progress of the previous change request, you can use the `WAITFORDELAY` T-SQL syntax to poll the [sys.dm_operation_status](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-operation-status-azure-sql-database?view=azure-sqldw-latest&preserve-view=true) dynamic management view (DMV).

To poll for the service object change status:

1. Right-click on the `master` system database and select **New Query**.
1. Run the following query to poll the [sys.dm_operation_status](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-operation-status-azure-sql-database?view=azure-sqldw-latest&preserve-view=true) DMV.

    ```sql
    WHILE
    (
        SELECT TOP 1 state_desc
        FROM sys.dm_operation_status
        WHERE
            1=1
            AND resource_type_desc = 'Database'
            AND major_resource_id = 'mySampleDataWarehouse'
            AND operation = 'ALTER DATABASE'
        ORDER BY
            start_time DESC
    ) = 'IN_PROGRESS'
    BEGIN
        RAISERROR('Scale operation in progress',0,0) WITH NOWAIT;
        WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05';
    END
    PRINT 'Complete';
    ```

1. The resulting output shows a log of the polling of the status.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-scale-compute-tsql/polling-output.png" alt-text="A screenshot from SQL Server Management Studio showing the output of the query to monitor the dedicated SQL pool operation status. A series of 'Scale operation in progress' lines is displayed, ending with a line that says 'Complete'.":::

## Check dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) state

When a dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) is paused, you can't connect to it with T-SQL. To see the current state of the dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW), you can use a PowerShell cmdlet. For an example, see [Check dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW) state - PowerShell](quickstart-scale-compute-powershell.md#check-data-warehouse-state).

## Check operation status

To return information about various management operations on your dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW), run the following query on the [sys.dm_operation_status](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-operation-status-azure-sql-database?view=azure-sqldw-latest&preserve-view=true) DMV. For example, it returns the operation and the  state of the operation, which is IN_PROGRESS or COMPLETED.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM
    sys.dm_operation_status
WHERE
    resource_type_desc = 'Database'
AND
    major_resource_id = 'mySampleDataWarehouse';
```
