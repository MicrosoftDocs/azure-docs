# Monitor dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-intro](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-intro.md)]

## Synapse Analytics monitoring options

You can collect and analyze metrics and logs for Azure Synapse Analytics built-in and serverless SQL pools, dedicated SQL pools, Azure Spark pools, and Data Explorer pools (preview). You can monitor current and historical activities for SQL, Apache Spark, pipelines and triggers, and integration runtimes.

There are several ways to monitor activities in your Synapse Analytics workspace.

### Synapse Studio

Open Synapse Studio and navigate to the **Monitor** hub to see a history of all the activities in the workspace and which ones are active.

- Under **Integration**, you can monitor pipelines, triggers, and integration runtimes.
- Under **Activities**, you can monitor Spark and SQL activities.

For more information about monitoring in Synapse Studio, see [Monitor your Synapse Workspace](../get-started-monitor.md).

- For monitoring pipeline runs, see [Monitor pipeline runs in Synapse Studio](../monitoring/how-to-monitor-pipeline-runs.md).
- For monitoring Apache Spark applications, see [Monitor Apache Spark applications in Synapse Studio](../monitoring/apache-spark-applications.md).
- For monitoring SQL pools, see [Use Synapse Studio to monitor your SQL pools](../monitoring/how-to-monitor-sql-pools.md).
- For monitoring SQL requests, see [Monitor SQL requests in Synapse Studio](../monitoring/how-to-monitor-sql-requests.md).

### DMVs and Query Store

To programmatically monitor Synapse SQL via T-SQL, Synapse Analytics provides a set of Dynamic Management Views (DMVs). These views are useful to troubleshoot and identify performance bottlenecks with your workload. For more information, see [DMVs](../sql/query-history-storage-analysis.md#dmvs) and [Monitor your Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool workload using DMVs](sql-data-warehouse-manage-monitor.md). For the list of DMVs that apply to Synapse SQL, see [Dedicated SQL pool Dynamic Management Views (DMVs)](../sql/reference-tsql-system-views.md#dedicated-sql-pool-dynamic-management-views-dmvs).

Query Store is a set of internal stores and DMVs that provide insight on query plan choice and performance. Query Store simplifies performance troubleshooting by helping find performance differences caused by query plan changes. For more information about enabling and using Query Store on Synapse Analytics databases, see [Query Store](../sql/query-history-storage-analysis.md#query-store).

### Azure portal

You can monitor Synapse Analytics workspaces and pools directly from their Azure portal pages. On the left sidebar menu, you can access the Azure **Activity log**, or select **Alerts**, **Metrics**, **Diagnostic settings**, **Logs**, or **Advisor recommendations** from the **Monitoring** section. This article provides more details about these options.

### Sample queries

**Activity Log query for failed operations**: Lists all reports of failed operations over the past hour. 

```kusto
AzureActivity 
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)  
| where ActivityStatus == "Failed"
```

**Synapse Link table fail events**: Displays failed Synapse Link table events.

```kusto
SynapseLinkEvent
| where OperationName == "TableFail"
| limit 100
```
