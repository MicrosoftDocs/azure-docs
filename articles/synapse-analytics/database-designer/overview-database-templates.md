# What are Azure Synapse database templates?

Data takes many forms as it moves from source systems to data warehouses and data marts with the intent to solve business problems. Database templates can help with the transformation of data into insights. 

Database templates are a set of business and technical data definitions that are predesigned to meet the needs of a particular industry. They act as blueprints that provide common elements derived from best practices, government regulations, and the complex data and analytic needs of an industry-specific organization. 

These schema blueprints can be used by organizations to plan, architect, and design data solutions for data governance, reporting, business intelligence, and advanced analytics. The data models provide integrated business-wide information architectures that can help you implement, in a timely and predictable way, a proven industry data architecture. 

For example, if you're building a product recommendation solution for your retail customers, you'll need to understand what the customer purchased and the transaction that led to the purchase. You might also need information about the store where the purchase was made, and whether the customer is part of a loyalty program. Just to accomplish this use case, consider the following schemas: 

* Product 
* Transaction 
* TransactionLineItem 
* Customer 
* CustomerLoyalty 
* Store 

You can set up this use case by selecting the six tables in the **Retail** database template.

A typical database template addresses the core requirements of a specific industry and consists of: 

* One or more [enterprise templates](concepts-database-templates.md#enterprise-templates).
* Tables grouped by **business areas**.
