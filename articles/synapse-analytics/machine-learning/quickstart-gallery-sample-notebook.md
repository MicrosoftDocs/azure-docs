# Quickstart: Use a sample notebook from the Synapse Analytics gallery

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to copy a sample machine learning notebook from the Synapse Analytics gallery into your workspace, modify it, and run it.

## Prerequisites

* [Azure Synapse Analytics workspace](../get-started-create-workspace.md) with an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage account configured as the default storage. You need to be the *Storage Blob Data Contributor* of the Data Lake Storage Gen2 file system that you work with.
* [Spark pool](../get-started-analyze-spark.md) in your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.

## Copy the notebook to your workspace

1. Open your workspace and select **Learn** from the home page.
1. In the **Knowledge center**, select **Browse gallery**.
1. In the gallery, select **Notebooks**.
1. Find and select a notebook from the gallery.

1. Select **Continue**.
1. On the notebook preview page, select **Open notebook**. The sample notebook is copied into your workspace and opened.

1. In the **Attach to** menu in the open notebook, select your Apache Spark pool.

## Save the notebook

To save your notebook by selecting **Publish** on the workspace command bar.

## Copying the sample notebook

To make a copy of this notebook, click the ellipsis in the top command bar and select **Clone** to create a copy in your workspace or **Export** to download a copy of the notebook (`.ipynb`) file.

## Clean up resources

To ensure the Spark instance is shut down when you're finished, end any connected sessions (notebooks). The pool shuts down when the **idle time** specified in the Apache Spark pool is reached. You can also select **stop session** from the status bar at the upper right of the notebook.
