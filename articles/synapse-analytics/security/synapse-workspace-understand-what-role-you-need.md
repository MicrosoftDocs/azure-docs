# Understand the roles required to perform common tasks in Azure Synapse

This article explains which Synapse RBAC (role-based access control) or Azure RBAC roles you need to get work done in Synapse Studio. To manage role membership, see [How to manage Synapse RBAC role assignments](how-to-manage-synapse-rbac-role-assignments.md).

## Synapse Studio access control and workflow summary 

### Access Synapse Studio

You can open Synapse Studio and view details of the workspace and list any of its Azure resources such as SQL pools, Spark pools, or Integration runtimes. You can see if you've been assigned any Synapse RBAC role or have the Azure Owner, Contributor, or Reader role on the workspace.

### Resource management

You can create SQL pools, Data Explorer pools, and Apache Spark pools if you're an Azure Owner or Contributor on the resource group. You can create an Integration Runtime if you're an Azure Owner or Contributor on the workspace. When using ARM templates for automated deployment, you need to be an Azure Contributor on the resource group.

You can pause or scale a dedicated SQL pool, configure a Spark pool, or an integration runtime if you're an Azure Owner or Contributor on the workspace or that resource.

### View and edit code artifacts

With access to Synapse Studio, you can create new code artifacts, such as SQL scripts, KQL scripts, notebooks, Spark jobs, linked services, pipelines, dataflows, triggers, and credentials. These artifacts can be published or saved with additional permissions.  

You can list, open, and edit already published code artifacts, including scheduled pipelines, if you're a Synapse Artifact User, Synapse Artifact Publisher, Synapse Contributor, or Synapse Administrator.

### Execute your code

You can execute SQL scripts on SQL pools if you have the necessary SQL permissions defined in the SQL pools. You can execute KQL scripts on Data Explorer pools if you have the necessary permissions.  

You can run notebooks and Spark jobs if you have Synapse Compute Operator permissions on the workspace or specific Apache Spark pools.  

With Compute Operator permissions on the workspace or specific integration runtimes, and appropriate credential permissions, you can execute pipelines.

### Monitor and manage execution

You can review the status of running notebooks and jobs in Apache Spark pools if you're a Synapse User.

You can review logs and cancel running jobs and pipelines if you're a Synapse Compute Operator on the workspace or for a specific Spark pool or pipeline.  

### Debug pipelines

You can review and make changes in pipelines as a Synapse User. If you want to be able to debug pipelines, you also need to have Synapse Credential User.

### Publish and save your code

You can publish new or updated code artifacts to the service if you're a Synapse Artifact Publisher, Synapse Contributor, or Synapse Administrator. 

You can commit code artifacts to a working branch of a Git repository if the workspace is Git-enabled and you have Git permissions. With Git enabled, publishing is only allowed from the collaboration branch.

If you close Synapse Studio without publishing or committing changes to code artifacts, then those changes are lost.

## Tasks and required roles

The following table lists common tasks and the Synapse RBAC or Azure RBAC roles required for each task.

> [!NOTE]
> Synapse Administrator isn't listed for each task unless it's the only role that provides the necessary permission. A Synapse Administrator can perform all tasks enabled by other Synapse RBAC roles.

> [!NOTE]
> Guest users from another tenant are also able to review, add, or change role assignments once they have been assigned as Synapse Administrator.

The minimum Synapse RBAC role required is shown. All Synapse RBAC roles at any scope provide you with Synapse User permissions on the workspace.

All Synapse RBAC permissions/actions shown in the table are prefixed with `Microsoft/Synapse/workspaces/...`.
