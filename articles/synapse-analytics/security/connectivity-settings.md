# Azure Synapse Analytics connectivity settings

This article explains connectivity settings in Azure Synapse Analytics and how to configure them where applicable.

## Public network access

You can use the public network access feature to allow incoming public network connectivity to your Azure Synapse workspace. 

- When public network access is **disabled**, you can connect to your workspace only using [private endpoints](synapse-workspace-managed-private-endpoints.md). 
- When public network access is **enabled**, you can connect to your workspace also from public networks. You can manage this feature both during and after your workspace creation. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is only available to Azure Synapse workspaces associated with [Azure Synapse Analytics Managed Virtual Network](synapse-workspace-managed-vnet.md). However, you can still open your Synapse workspaces to the public network regardless of its association with managed VNet.
> 
> When the public network access is disabled, access to GIT mode in Synapse Studio and commit changes won't be blocked as long as the user has enough permission to access the integrated Git repo or the corresponding Git branch. However, the publish button won't work because the access to Live mode is blocked by the firewall settings.
> When the public network access is disabled, the self-hosted integration runtime can still communicate with Synapse. We do not currently support establishing a private link between a self-hosted integration runtime and Synapse control plane.

Selecting the **Disable** option will not apply any firewall rules that you might configure. Additionally, your firewall rules will appear grayed out in the Network setting in Synapse portal. Your firewall configurations are reapplied when you enable public network access again. 

> [!TIP]
> When you revert to enable, allow some time before editing the firewall rules.

### Configure public network access when you create your workspace

1. Select the **Networking** tab when you create your workspace in [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/azureportal).
1. Under Managed virtual network, select **Enable** to associate your workspace with managed virtual network and permit public network access. 
1. Under **Public network access**, select **Disable** to deny public access to your workspace. Select **Enable** if you want to allow public access to your workspace.

1. Complete the rest of the workspace creation flow.

### Configure public network access after you create your workspace

1. Select your Synapse workspace in [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/azureportal).
1. Select **Networking** from the left navigation.
1. Select **Disabled** to deny public access to your workspace. Select **Enabled** if you want to allow public access to your workspace.

1. When disabled, the **Firewall rules** gray out to indicate that firewall rules are not in effect. Firewall rule configurations will be retained. 
1. Select **Save** to save the change. A notification will confirm that the network setting was successfully saved.

## Connection policy
The connection policy for Synapse SQL in Azure Synapse Analytics is set to *Default*. You cannot change this in Azure Synapse Analytics. For more information, see [Connectivity architecture](/azure/azure-sql/database/connectivity-architecture#connection-policy).

## Minimal TLS version

The serverless SQL endpoint and development endpoint only accept TLS 1.2 and above.

Since December 2021, a minimum level of TLS 1.2 is required for workspace-managed dedicated SQL pools in new Synapse workspaces. You can raise or lower this requirement using the [minimal TLS REST API](/rest/api/synapse/sqlserver/workspace-managed-sql-server-dedicated-sql-minimal-tls-settings/update) for both new Synapse workspaces or existing workspaces, so users who cannot use a higher TLS client version in the workspaces can connect. Customers can also raise the minimum TLS version to meet their security needs. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure will begin to retire older TLS versions (TLS 1.0 and 1.1) starting in November 2024. Use TLS 1.2 or higher. After March 31, 2025, you will no longer be able to set the minimal TLS version for Azure Synapse Analytics client connections below TLS 1.2.  After this date, sign-in attempts from connections using a TLS version lower than 1.2 will fail. For more information, see [Announcement: Azure support for TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 will end](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-support-tls-will-end-by-31-october-2024-2/).

## Azure Policy

Azure policy to prevent modifications to the networking settings in Synapse Workspace is not currently available.
