# Synapse RBAC Roles

The article describes the built-in Synapse RBAC (role-based access control) roles, the permissions they grant, and the scopes at which they can be used.

For more information on reviewing and assigning Synapse role memberships, see [how to review Synapse RBAC role assignments](./how-to-review-synapse-rbac-role-assignments.md) and [how to assign Synapse RBAC roles](./how-to-manage-synapse-rbac-role-assignments.md).

## Built-in Synapse RBAC roles and scopes

The following table describes the built-in roles and the scopes at which they can be used.

> [!NOTE]
> Users with any Synapse RBAC role at any scope automatically have the Synapse User role at workspace scope.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Synapse RBAC roles do not grant permissions to create or manage SQL pools, Apache Spark pools, and Integration runtimes in Azure Synapse workspaces. Azure Owner or Azure Contributor roles on the resource group are required for these actions.

|Role |Permissions|Scopes|
|---|---|-----|
|Synapse Administrator |Full Synapse access to serverless and dedicated SQL pools, Data Explorer pools, Apache Spark pools, and Integration runtimes. Includes create, read, update, and delete access to all published code artifacts. Includes Compute Operator, Linked Data Manager, and Credential User permissions on the workspace system identity credential. Includes assigning Synapse RBAC roles. In addition to Synapse Administrator, Azure Owners can also assign Synapse RBAC roles. Azure permissions are required to create, delete, and manage compute resources. Synapse RBAC roles can be assigned even when the associated subscription is disabled.</br></br>_Can read and write artifacts</br> Can do all actions on Spark activities.</br> Can view Spark pool logs</br> Can view saved notebook and pipeline output </br> Can use the secrets stored by linked services or credentials</br>Can assign and revoke Synapse RBAC roles at current scope_|Workspace </br> Spark pool<br/>Integration runtime </br>Linked service</br>Credential |

## Synapse RBAC roles and the actions they permit

> [!NOTE]
>- All actions listed in the tables below are prefixed, "Microsoft.Synapse/..."</br>
>- All artifact read, write, and delete actions are with respect to published artifacts in the live service. These permissions do not affect access to artifacts in a connected Git repo. 

The following table lists the built-in roles and the actions/permissions that each support.
