# Sync Service Manager Metaverse Search

![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/mvsearch.png)

The metaverse search tab is useful for troubleshooting data-related problems. In the top half, you can create a query based on a combination of attributes. When you are satisfied with your query, click **Search**. The result is visible in the bottom grid. You can select which columns should be visible with **Column Settings**.

In the search results, select an object and **Properties** to see the [metaverse object properties](active-directory-aadconnectsync-troubleshoot-object-not-syncing.md#metaverse-object-properties).
