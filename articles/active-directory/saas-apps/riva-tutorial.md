# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Riva

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Riva with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Riva with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Riva.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Riva with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Microsoft Entra ID, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Riva single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Riva supports **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding Riva from the gallery

To configure the integration of Riva into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Riva from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](../roles/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Riva** in the search box.
1. Select **Riva** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for Riva

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Riva using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Riva.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Riva, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Riva SSO](#configure-riva-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create Riva test user](#create-riva-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Riva that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to Riva.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Riva SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Riva** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Riva support team](mailto:support@rivacrmintegration.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Riva test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Riva. Work with [Riva support team](mailto:support@rivacrmintegration.com) to add the users in the Riva platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Riva tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Riva for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).
