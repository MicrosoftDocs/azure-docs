# Tutorial: Configure myday for automatic user provisioning

This tutorial describes the steps you need to perform in both myday and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Azure AD automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups to [myday](https://go.mydaycloud.com) using the Azure AD Provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Capabilities supported
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in myday
> * Remove users in myday when they do not require access anymore
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Azure AD and myday
> * Provision groups and group memberships in myday
> * Single sign-on to myday (recommended)

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [An Azure AD tenant](../develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md) 
* A user account in Azure AD with [permission](../users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles.md) to configure provisioning (for example, Application Administrator, Cloud Application administrator, Application Owner, or Global Administrator). 
* A user account in myday with Admin permissions.

## Step 1. Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
2. Determine who will be in [scope for provisioning](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
3. Determine what data to [map between Azure AD and myday](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md). 

## Step 2. Configure myday to support provisioning with Azure AD

Reach out to your myday representative or the support team to receive the **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token**.

## Step 3. Add myday from the Azure AD application gallery

Add myday from the Azure AD application gallery to start managing provisioning to myday. If you have previously setup myday for SSO, you can use the same application. However it is recommended that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 4. Define who will be in scope for provisioning 

The Azure AD provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user / group. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the following [steps](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to assign users and groups to the application. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can use a scoping filter as described [here](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md). 

* When assigning users and groups to myday, you must select a role other than **Default Access**. Users with the Default Access role are excluded from provisioning and will be marked as not effectively entitled in the provisioning logs. If the only role available on the application is the default access role, you can [update the application manifest](../develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md) to add additional roles. 

* Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before rolling out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control this by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an [attribute based scoping filter](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md). 


## Step 5. Configure automatic user provisioning to myday 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in TestApp based on user and/or group assignments in Azure AD.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for myday in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

2. In the applications list, select **myday**.

	![The myday link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Provisioning tab](common/provisioning.png)

4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Provisioning tab automatic](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

5. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input the tenant URL value retrieved earlier in **Tenant URL**. Input the secret Token value retrieved earlier in **Secret Token**. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to myday. If the connection fails, ensure your myday account has Admin permissions and try again.

	![Tenant URL Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

6. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

7. Select **Save**.

8. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Provision Azure Active Directory Users**.

9. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to myday in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in myday for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you will need to ensure that the myday API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|
   |---|---|
   |userName|String|
   |active|Boolean|
   |displayName|String|
   |title|String|
   |emails[type eq "work"].value|String|
   |preferredLanguage|String|
   |name.givenName|String|
   |name.familyName|String|
   |name.formatted|String|
   |externalId|String|
   |addresses[type eq "work"].country|String|
   |addresses[type eq "work"].locality|String|
   |addresses[type eq "work"].postalCode|String|
   |addresses[type eq "work"].formatted|String|
   |addresses[type eq "work"].region|String|
   |addresses[type eq "work"].streetAddress|String|
   |addresses[type eq "other"].formatted|String|
   |phoneNumbers[type eq "fax"].value|String|
   |phoneNumbers[type eq "mobile"].value|String|
   |phoneNumbers[type eq "work"].value|String|
   |roles[primary eq "True"].display|String|
   |roles[primary eq "True"].type|String|
   |roles[primary eq "True"].value|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:department|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:employeeNumber|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:manager|Reference|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:organization|String|

10. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Provision Azure Active Directory Groups**.

11. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to myday in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the groups in myday for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

      |Attribute|Type|
      |---|---|
      |displayName|String|
      |externalId|String|
      |members|Reference|

12. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

13. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for myday, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

14. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to myday by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

15. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. 

## Step 6. Monitor your deployment
Once you've configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

1. Use the [provisioning logs](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md) to determine which users have been provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully
2. Check the [progress bar](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it is to completion
3. If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application will go into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states [here](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status.md).
