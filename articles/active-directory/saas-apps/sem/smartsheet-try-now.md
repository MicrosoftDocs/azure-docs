## What can you do with Smartsheet and Azure AD?

- **Easy single sign-on** - Eliminate multiple usernames and passwords and simplify access by allowing users to sign in to Smartsheet using their Azure AD accounts.
- **Automate user provisioning** - Automate the creation, maintenance, and removal of user accounts into Smartsheet when users join, move, or leave your organization.
- **Secure, govern, and monitor access** - Secure access to Smartsheet by applying conditional access policies, govern access through access reviews, and monitor access with sign-in logs.

## Get started

Set up [user provisioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/Smartsheet-provisioning-tutorial) and [single sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/Smartsheet-tutorial) for Smartsheet with our easy configuration guides.
