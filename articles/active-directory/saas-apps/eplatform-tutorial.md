# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with ePlatform

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate ePlatform with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate ePlatform with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to ePlatform.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ePlatform with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Microsoft Entra ID, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* ePlatform single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* ePlatform supports **IDP** initiated SSO

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding ePlatform from the gallery

To configure the integration of ePlatform into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add ePlatform from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](../roles/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **ePlatform** in the search box.
1. Select **ePlatform** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for ePlatform

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with ePlatform using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in ePlatform.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with ePlatform, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure ePlatform SSO](#configure-eplatform-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create ePlatform test user](#create-eplatform-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in ePlatform that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](../roles/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **ePlatform** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the application is pre-configured and the necessary URLs are already pre-populated with Azure. The user needs to save the configuration by clicking the **Save** button.

1. ePlatform application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, ePlatform application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

    | Name | Source Attribute |
	| ---------------| --------------- |
	| upn | user.userprincipalname |

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Edit** button to open **SAML Signing Certificate** dialog.

	![Edit SAML Signing Certificate](common/edit-certificate.png)

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, copy the **Thumbprint Value** and save it on your computer.

    ![Copy Thumbprint value](common/copy-thumbprint.png)

1. On the **Set up ePlatform** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create a Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll create a test user called B.Simon.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [User Administrator](../roles/permissions-reference.md#user-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Users** > **All users**.
1. Select **New user** > **Create new user**, at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Display name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User principal name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.

   1. Select **Review + create**.
1. Select **Create**.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to ePlatform.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](../roles/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **ePlatform**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure ePlatform SSO

To configure single sign-on on **ePlatform** side, you need to send the **Thumbprint Value** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [ePlatform support team](https://help.eplatform.co/hc/en-us). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create ePlatform test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in ePlatform. Work with [ePlatform support team](https://help.eplatform.co/hc/en-us) to add the users in the ePlatform platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the ePlatform tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the ePlatform for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).
