# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Tango Analytics

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Tango Analytics with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Tango Analytics with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Tango Analytics.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Tango Analytics with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Tango Analytics single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Tango Analytics supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Tango Analytics from the gallery

To configure the integration of Tango Analytics into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Tango Analytics from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](../roles/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Tango Analytics** in the search box.
1. Select **Tango Analytics** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Tango Analytics

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Tango Analytics using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Tango Analytics.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Tango Analytics, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Tango Analytics SSO](#configure-tango-analytics-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Tango Analytics test user](#create-tango-analytics-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Tango Analytics that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to Tango Analytics.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](../roles/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Tango Analytics**.
1. In the app's overview page, select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user/group**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
   1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
   1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Tango Analytics SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Tango Analytics** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Tango Analytics support team](mailto:support@tangoanalytics.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Tango Analytics test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Tango Analytics. Work with [Tango Analytics support team](mailto:support@tangoanalytics.com) to add the users in the Tango Analytics platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Tango Analytics for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Tango Analytics tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Tango Analytics for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Tango Analytics you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
