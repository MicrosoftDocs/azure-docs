# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with LIFT

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate LIFT with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate LIFT with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to LIFT.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to LIFT with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* LIFT single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* LIFT supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add LIFT from the gallery

To configure the integration of LIFT into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add LIFT from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](../roles/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **LIFT** in the search box.
1. Select **LIFT** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for LIFT

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with LIFT using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in LIFT.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with LIFT, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure LIFT SSO](#configure-lift-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create LIFT test user](#create-lift-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in LIFT that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to LIFT.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](../roles/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure LIFT SSO

To configure single sign-on on **LIFT** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [LIFT support team](mailto:support@liftsoftware.nl). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create LIFT test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in LIFT. Work with [LIFT support team](mailto:support@liftsoftware.nl) to add the users in the LIFT platform.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to LIFT Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to LIFT Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the LIFT tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to LIFT Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure LIFT you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
