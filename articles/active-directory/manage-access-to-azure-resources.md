# Manage access to Azure resources with Azure Active Directory

Identity and access management for cloud resources is a critical function for any organization that is using the cloud.  Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is the identity and access system for Microsoft Azure.  

Azure AD provides the following capabilities for managing access to Azure resources:

|||
|---|---|
| [Relationship between Azure AD tenants and subscriptions](active-directory-understanding-resource-access.md) | Learn about how Azure AD is the trusted source of users and groups for an Azure subscription. |
| [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](role-based-access-control-what-is.md) | Offer fine-grained access management through roles assigned to users, groups, or service principals. |
| [Privileged Identity Management with RBAC](pim-azure-resource.md) | Control highly privileged access by granting roles access just in time. |
| [Conditional Access for Azure management](conditional-access-azure-management.md) | Set up conditional access policies to allow or block access to Azure management endpoints. |
| [Managed Service Identity (MSI)](msi-overview.md) | Give Azure resources like Virtual Machines their own identity so that you don’t have to put credentials in your code. |
