# Don’t lose access to your account!

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT]
> **Why am I seeing this?** If you followed a link to get here, you're probably seeing this because your administrator requires you to register for password reset to gain access to your app. You might be asked for phone or email information, or to set up security questions.  Don’t worry – we won’t use this information to spam you, just to keep your account more secure. The steps presented here should help you to reach your goal.

The fastest way to register for password reset is to go to http://aka.ms/ssprsetup.  

 1. Navigate to http://aka.ms/ssprsetup.
 2. Enter your username and password.
 3. Choose an option to register for by clicking **set it up now**.  In this case, I'll demonstrate registering my **authentication phone**.

 4. Select your country code from the dropdown and enter your **full phone number + area code**.

 5. Select one of the **text me** or **call me** options.  In this case, I'll select **text me**, which will send a 6 digit code to my phone.  Wait for the code to arrive on your phone.

 6. Once the code arrives, enter it into the input box, and then click "verify."
 7. When you see **thanks**, that's it! Now you can use what you registered for to reset your password at any time by going to https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com.

 >[AZURE.IMPORTANT] If your admin lets you register for more than one option, we highly recommend you also register a back-up option in case you lose your phone or access to your email.
