# Azure Active Directory Identity Protection FAQ


## Why do some risk events have “Closed (system)” status?

**A:** These are events that Azure Active Directory Identity Protection detected and later closed because the events were no longer considered risky. These events do not count towards the user’s risk level. 

---

## Do I need to be a global admin to use Identity Protection in the Azure portal?
**A:** **No**. You can either be a Security Reader, a Security Admin or a Global Admin to use Identity Protection.

---

## How do I get Identity Protection?
**A:** See [Getting started with Azure Active Directory Premium](active-directory-get-started-premium.md) for an answer to this question.

---

## What happens when your Azure Active Directory Premium 2 trial expires?

**A:** If your Azure Active Directory Premium 2 trial edition has expired on your Azure Active Directory Free, Basic or Premium 1 edition, and you had Identity Protection enabled, you still have access to it even though you are not in compliance with licensing.
