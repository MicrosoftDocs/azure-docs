# Request Service API error codes

[!INCLUDE [Verifiable Credentials announcement](../../../includes/verifiable-credentials-brand.md)]

Microsoft Entra Verified ID includes the Request Service REST API that allows you to issue and verify a credential. This article specifies the error codes for the Request Service API.

## Error object

During public preview, the Request Service API returned errors in the following format.

```json
{
  "requestId": "4bb6726f77af7623ab52962323016442",
  "date": "Thu, 28 Apr 2022 14:30:54 GMT",
  "mscv": "17ppwf3uxR10MfRR.1",
  "error": {
    "code": "client_request.invalid_include_qr_code",
    "message": "The request contains `includeQRCode`, but it is not boolean."
  }
}

```

This format is now changed into the following to enable both simpler error handling and better support for troubleshooting. In the new format, the outer [error](#error-type) code and message fields have standardized values while the [```innererror```](#inner-error-type) object provide details on what caused the error.

```json
{
  "requestId": "782628eb-503a-4978-84f2-d7c634f25b15",
  "date": "Fri, 29 Apr 2022 11:20:19 GMT",
  "mscv": "QbBLwF7XAp0dt4Lw.1",
  "error": {
    "code": "badRequest",
    "message": "The request is invalid.",
    "innererror": {
      "code": "badOrMissingField",
      "message": "The request contains `includeQRCode`, but it is not boolean.",
      "target": "includeQRCode"
    }
  }
}
```
