# What's new in Azure Active Directory Verifiable Credentials (preview)

In this document you can find the latest features, improvements, and changes in the Azure AD Verifiable Credentials service.

## October 2021

**Public Preview of the Request Service API.**

- Developers can start using the new [Request Service API](get-started-request-api.md) to easily build applications that can issue, verify credentials from any programming language of choice. This new REST API provides an improved abstraction layer and integration to the Azure AD Verifiable Credentials Service.

- With the release of the Request Service API, we are moving away from our initial NodeJS-based SDK, and we highly recommend you to start using the API as we’ll be deprecating the NodeJS SDK in the following months. Our documentation and samples have been refreshed to use the Request Service API. Learn more about the [request service API](get-started-request-api.md)

## April 2021

**Azure Active Directory Verifiable Credentials is in Public Preview.**

Azure AD customers can now easily issue [verifiable credentials](decentralized-identifier-overview.md) to represent proof of employment, education, or any other claim so that the holder of such a credential can decide when, and with whom, to share their credentials. Each credential is signed using cryptographic keys associated with the DID that the user owns and controls.
