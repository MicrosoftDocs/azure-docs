# Azure Active Directory Connect Health Alert Catalog 

Azure AD Connect Health service send alerts indicate that your identity infrastructure is not healthy. This article includes alerts titles, descriptions, and remediation steps for each alert. <br />
Error, Warning, and Prewarning are three stages of alerts that are generated from Connect Health service. We highly recommend you take immediate actions on triggered alerts. <br />
Azure AD Connect Health alerts get resolved on a success condition. Azure AD Connect Health Agents detect and report the success conditions to the service periodically. For a few alerts, the suppression is time-based. In other words, if the same error condition is not observed within 72 hours from alert generation, the alert is automatically resolved.

## General Alerts

## Alerts for Active Directory Federation Services
| Alert Name | Description | Remediation |
| --- | --- | ----- |
|Test Authentication Request (Synthetic Transaction) failed to obtain a token | The test authentication requests (Synthetic Transactions) initiated from this server has failed to obtain a token after 5 retries. This may be caused due to transient network issues, AD DS Domain Controller availability or a mis-configured AD FS server.  As a result, authentication requests processed by the federation service may fail. The agent uses the Local Computer Account context to obtain a token from the Federation Service. | Ensure that the following steps are taken to validate the health of the server.<ol><li>Validate that there are no additional unresolved alerts for this or other AD FS servers in your farm.</li><li>Validate that this condition is not a transient failure by logging on with a test user from the AD FS login page available at https://{your_adfs_server_name}/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx</li><li>Go to <a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com">https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com</a> and choose the ‘Office 365’ tab. Perform the ‘Office 365 Single Sign-On Test’.</li><li>Verify if your AD FS service name can be resolved from this server by executing the following command from a command prompt on this server. nslookup your_adfs_server_name</li></ol><p>If the service name cannot be resolved, refer to the FAQ section for instructions of adding a HOST file entry of your AD FS service with the IP address of this server. This will allow the synthetic transaction module running on this server to request a token</p> | 
| The proxy server cannot reach the federation server | This AD FS proxy server is unable to contact the AD FS service. As a result, authentication requests processed by this server will fail. | Perform the following steps to validate the connectivity between this server and the AD FS service. <ol><li> Ensure that the firewall between this server and the AD FS service is configured accurately. </li><li> Ensure that DNS resolution for the AD FS service name appropriately points to the AD FS service that resides within the corporate network. This can be achieved through a DNS server that serves this server in the perimeter network or through entries in the HOSTS files for the AD FS service name. </li><li> Validate the network connectivity by opening up the browser on this server and accessing the federation metadata endpoint, which is at https://<your-adfs-service-name>/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml </li> | 
| The SSL Certificate is about to expire | The SSL certificate used by the Federation servers is about to expire within 90 days. Once expired, any requests that require a valid SSL connection will fail. For example, for Office 365 customers, mail clients will not be able to authenticate. | Update the SSL certificate on each AD FS server.<ol><li>Obtain the SSL certificate with the following requirements.<ol type="a"><li>Enhanced Key Usage is at least Server Authentication. </li><li>Certificate Subject or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) contains the DNS name of the Federation Service or appropriate wild card. For example: sso.contoso.com or *.contoso.com</li></ol></li><li>Install the new SSL certificate on each server in the local machine certificate store.</li><li>Ensure that the AD FS Service Account has read access to the certificate's Private Key</li></ol></p><p><b>For AD FS 2.0 in Windows Server 2008R2:</b><ul><li>Bind the new SSL certificate to the web site in IIS, which hosts the Federation Service. Note that you must perform this step on each Federation Server and Federation Server proxy.</li></ul></p><p><b>For AD FS in Windows Server 2012 R2 and later versions:</b> <li>  Refer to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/manage-ssl-certificates-ad-fs-wap">Managing SSL Certificates in AD FS and WAP </a> </li> | 
| AD FS service is not running on the server | Active Directory Federation Service (Windows Service) is not running on this server. Any requests targeted to this server will fail. | To start the Active Directory Federation Service (Windows Service):<ol><li>Log on to the server as an administrator.</li><li> Open services.msc</li><li>Find "Active Directory Federation Services". </li><li>Right-click and select "Start". | 
| DNS for the Federation Service may be misconfigured | The DNS server could be configured to use a CNAME record for the AD FS farm name. It is recommended to use A or AAAA record for AD FS in order for the Windows Integrated Authentication to work seamlessly within your corporate network. | Ensure that the DNS record type of the AD FS farm <Farm Name> is not CNAME. Configure it to be an A or AAAA record. | 
| AD FS Auditing is disabled | AD FS Auditing is disabled for the server. AD FS Usage section on the portal will not include data from this server.	| If AD FS Audits are not enabled follow these instructions:<ol><li>Grant the AD FS service account the "Generate security audits" right on the AD FS server.<li>Open the local security policy on the server gpedit.msc.</li><li>Navigate to "Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment" </li><li>Add the AD FS Service Account to have the "Generate security audits" right.</li></li><li>Run the following command from the command prompt:<br><i>auditpol.exe /set /subcategory:"Application Generated" /failure:enable /success:enable </i></li><li>Update Federation Service Properties to include Success and Failure Audits.<li>In the AD FS console, choose "Edit Federation Service Properties".</li><li>From "Federation Service Properties" dialogue box choose the Events tab and select "Success Audits" and "Failure Audits".</li></li></ol></p><p>After following these steps, AD FS Audit Events should be visible from the Event Viewer. To verify:<ol><li>Go to Event Viewer/ Windows Logs /Security.</li><li>Select Filter Current Logs and select AD FS Auditing from the Event sources drop down. For an active AD FS server with AD FS auditing enabled, events should be visible for the above filtering.</li></ol></p><p>If you have followed these instructions before, but still seeing this alert, it is possible that a Group Policy Object is disabling AD FS auditing. The root cause can be one of the following:<ol><li>AD FS service account is being removed from having the right to Generate Security Audits.</li><li>A custom script in Group Policy Object is disabling success and failure audits based on "Application Generated".</li><li>AD FS configuration is not enabled to generate Success/Failure audits. | 
| AD FS SSL certificate is self-signed | You are currently using a self-signed certificate as the SSL certificate in your AD FS farm. As a result, mail client authentication for Office 365 will fail | <p> Update the SSL certificate on each AD FS server. </p> <ol><li>Obtain a publicly trusted SSL certificate with the following requirements. </li><li>Certificate installation file contains its private key. </li> <li>Enhanced Key Usage is at least Server Authentication. </li> <li>Certificate Subject or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) contains the DNS name of the Federation Service or appropriate wild card. For example: sso.contoso.com or *.contoso.com </li></ol> <p>Install the new SSL certificate on each server in the local machine certificate store. </p> <ol>Ensure that the AD FS Service Account has read access to the certificate's Private Key. <br /> <b>For AD FS 2.0 in Windows Server 2008R2: </b> <li>Bind the new SSL certificate to the web site in IIS, which hosts the Federation Service. Note that you must perform this step on each Federation Server and Federation Server proxy. </li> <br /><b>For AD FS in Windows Server 2012 R2 or later versions: </b> <li>  Refer to  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/manage-ssl-certificates-ad-fs-wap">Managing SSL Certificates in AD FS and WAP </a> </li> </ol> | 
| The trust between the proxy server and federation server is not valid | The trust between the federation server proxy and the Federation Service could not be established or renewed. | Update the Proxy Trust Certificate on the proxy server. Re-Run the Proxy Configuration Wizard. |
| Extranet Lockout Protection Disabled for AD FS | The Extranet Lockout Protection feature is DISABLED on your AD FS farm. This feature protects your users from brute force password attacks from the internet and prevents denial of service attacks against your users when AD DS account lockout policies are in effect. With this feature enabled, if the number of failed extranet login attempts for a user (login attempts made via WAP server and AD FS) exceed the 'ExtranetLockoutThreshold' then AD FS servers will stop processing further login attempts for ‘ExtranetObservationWindow' We highly recommend you enable this feature on your AD FS servers. | Run the following command to enable AD FS Extranet Lockout Protection with default values.<br><i>Set-AdfsProperties -EnableExtranetLockout $true</i><br><br>If you have AD lockout policies configured for your users, ensure that the <i>'ExtranetLockoutThreshold'</i> property is set to a value below your AD DS lockout threshold. This ensures that requests that have exceeded the threshold for AD FS are dropped and never validated against your AD DS servers. | 
| Invalid Service Principal Name (SPN) for the AD FS service account | The Service Principal Name of the Federation Service account is not registered or is not unique. As a result, Windows Integrated Authentication from domain-joined clients may not be seamless. | Use [<b>SETSPN -L ServiceAccountName</b>] to list the Service Principals.<br>Use [<b>SETSPN -X</b>] to check for duplicate Service Principal Names.</p><p>If SPN is duplicated for the AD FS service account, remove the SPN from the duplicated account using [<b>SETSPN -d service/namehostname</b>]</p><p>If SPN is not set, use [<b>SETSPN -s {Desired-SPN} {domain_name}\{service_account}</b>] to set the desired SPN for the Federation Service Account. |

## Alerts for Active Directory Domain Services

| Alert Name | Description | Remediation |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| Domain controller is unreachable via LDAP ping | Domain Controller is not reachable via LDAP Ping. This can be caused due to Network issues or machine issues. As a result, LDAP Pings will fail.	|  <li>Examine alerts list for related alerts, such as: Domain Controller is not advertising. </li><li>Ensure affected Domain Controller has sufficient disk space. Running out of space will stop the DC from advertising itself as an LDAP server. </li><li> Attempt to find the PDC: Run <br> <i>netdom query fsmo </i> </br> on the affected Domain Controller. <li> Ensure physical network is properly configured/connected. </li> |
| Active Directory replication error encountered | This domain controller is experiencing replication issues, which can be found by going to the Replication Status Dashboard. Replication errors may be due to improper configuration or other related issues. Untreated replication errors can lead to data inconsistency. | See additional details for the names of the affected source and destination DCs. Navigate to Replication Status dashboard and look for the active errors on the affected DCs. Click on the error to open a blade with more details on how to remediate that particular error.| 
| Domain controller is unable to find a PDC	| A PDC is not reachable through this domain controller. This will lead to impacted user logons, unapplied group policy changes, and system time synchronization failure. | <li>Examine alerts list for related alerts that could be impacting your PDC, such as: Domain Controller is not advertising. </li> <li>Attempt to find the PDC: Run <br> <i>netdom query fsmo </i> </br> on the affected Domain Controller.<li>Ensure network is working properly. </li> |
| Domain controller is unable to find a Global Catalog server | A global catalog server is not reachable from this domain controller. It will result in failed authentications attempted through this Domain Controller. | Examine the alerts list for any <b>Domain Controller is not advertising</b> alerts where the impacted server might be a GC. If there are no advertising alerts, check the SRV records for the GCs. You can check them by running: <br> <i> nltest \/dnsgetdc: [ForestName] \/gc </i> </br> It should list the DCs advertising as GCs. If the list is empty, check the DNS configuration to ensure that the GC has registered the SRV records. The DC is able to find them in DNS. <br />For troubleshooting Global Catalogs, see <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc961811.aspx#ECAA">Advertising as a Global Catalog Server. </a> | 
| Domain controller unable to reach local SYSVOL share | Sysvol contains important elements from Group Policy Objects and scripts to be distributed within DCs of a domain. The DC will not advertise itself as DC and Group Policies will not be applied. | See <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2958414">How to troubleshoot missing SYSVOL and Netlogon shares </a> | 
| Domain Controller time is out of sync | The time on this Domain Controller is outside of the normal Time Skew range. As a result, Kerberos authentications will fail. | <li>Restart Windows Time Service: Run <br><i>net stop w32time</i> </br> then <br><i>net start w32time </i></br> on the affected Domain Controller.</li><li>Resync Time: Run <br><i>w32tm \/resync </i></br> on the affected Domain Controller. | 
| Domain controller is not advertising | This domain controller is not properly advertising the roles it's capable of performing. This can be caused by problems with replication, DNS misconfiguration, critical services not running, or because of the server not being fully initialized.  As a result, domain controllers, domain members, and other devices will not be able to locate this domain controller. Additionally, other domain controllers might not be able to replicate from this domain controller.	| Examine alerts list for other related alerts such as: Replication is broken. Domain controller time is out of sync. Netlogon service is not running. DFSR and/or NTFRS services are not running. Identify and troubleshoot related DNS problems: Logon to affected Domain controller. Open System Event Log. If events 5774, 5775 or 5781 are present, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb727055.aspx#ECAA">Troubleshooting Domain Controller Locator DNS Records Registration Failure</a> Identify and troubleshoot related Windows Time Service Issues: Ensure Windows Time service is running: Run '<b>net start w32time</b>' on the affected Domain Controller. Restart Windows Time Service: Run '<b>net stop w32time</b>' then '<b>net start w32time</b>' on the affected Domain Controller. | 
| GPSVC service is not running | If the service is stopped or disabled, settings configured by the admin will not be applied and applications and components will not be manageable through Group Policy. Any components or applications that depend on the Group Policy component might not be functional if the service is disabled.	| Run <br><i>net start gpsvc </i></br> on the affected Domain Controller. | 
| DFSR and/or NTFRS services are not running | If both DFSR and NTFRS services are stopped, Domain Controllers will not be able to replicate SYSVOL data. SYSVOL Data will be out of consistency. | <li>If using DFSR:<ol type="1" > Run '<b>net start dfsr</b>' on the affected Domain Controller. </li><li>If using NTFRS:<ol type="1" >Run '<b>net start ntfrs</b>' on the affected Domain Controller. </li>| 
| Netlogon service is not running | Logon requests, registration, authentication, and locating of domain controllers will be unavailable on this DC. | Run '<b>net start netlogon</b>' on the affected Domain Controller | 
| W32Time service is not running | If Windows Time Service is stopped, date and time synchronization will be unavailable. If this service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on it will fail to start. | Run '<b>net start win32Time</b>' on the affected Domain Controller | 
| ADWS service is not running | If Active Directory Web Services service is stopped or disabled, client applications, such as Active Directory PowerShell, will not be able to access or manage any directory service instances that are running locally on this server. | Run '<b>net start adws</b>' on the affected Domain Controller | 
| Root PDC is not Syncing from NTP Server | If you do not configure the PDC to synchronize time from an external or internal time source, the PDC emulator uses its internal clock and is itself the reliable time source for the forest. If time is not accurate on the PDC itself, all computers will have incorrect time settings. | On the affected Domain Controller, open a command prompt. Stop the Time service: net stop w32time</li> <li>Configure the external time source: <br> <i>w32tm \/config \/manualpeerlist: time.windows.com \/syncfromflags:manual \/reliable:yes </i></br><br>Note: Replace time.windows.com with the address of your desired external time source. Start the Time service: <br> <i>net start w32time </i></br> | 
| Domain controller is quarantined | This Domain Controller is not connected to any of the other working Domain Controllers. This may be caused due to improper configuration. As a result, this DC is not being used and will not replicate from/to anyone. | Enable inbound and outbound replication: Run '<b>repadmin /options ServerName -DISABLE_INBOUND_REPL</b>' on the affected Domain Controller. Run '<b>repadmin /options ServerName -DISABLE_OUTBOUND_REPL</b>' on the affected Domain Controller. Create a new replication connection to another Domain Controller:<ol type="1"><li>Open Active Directory Sites and Services: Start menu, point to Administrative Tools, then click Active Directory Sites and Services. </li><li>In the console tree, expand Sites, and then expand the site, which this DC belongs to. </li><li>Expand the Servers container to display the list of servers. </li><li>Expand the server object for this DC. </li><li>Right-click the NTDS Settings object, and click on New Active Directory Domain Services Connection... </li><li>Select a Server from the list, and click Ok.</li></ol><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/230306 ">How to remove orphaned domains from Active Directory.</a> |
| Outbound Replication is Disabled | DCs with disabled Outbound Replication, will not be able to distribute any changes originating within itself. | To enable outbound replication on the affected Domain Controller, follow these steps: Click Start, click Run, type cmd and then click OK. Type the following text, and then press ENTER:<br><i>repadmin /options -DISABLE_OUTBOUND_REPL </i> | 
| Inbound Replication is Disabled | DCs with disabled Inbound Replication, will not have the latest information. This condition can lead to logon failures. | To enable inbound replication on the affected Domain Controller, follow these steps: Click Start, click Run, type cmd and then click OK. Type the following text, and then press ENTER:<br><i>repadmin /options -DISABLE_INBOUND_REPL</i> </br> | 
| LanmanServer service is not running | If this service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on it will fail to start. | Run '<b>net start LanManServer</b>' on the affected Domain Controller. |
| Kerberos Key Distribution Center service is not running | If KDC Service is stopped, users will not be able to authentication through this DC using the Kerberos v5 authentication protocol. | Run '<b>net start kdc</b>' on the affected Domain Controller. |
| DNS service is not running | If DNS Service is stopped, computers and users using that server for DNS purposes will fail to find resources. | Run '<b>net start dns</b>' on the affected Domain Controller. |
| DC had USN Rollback | When USN rollbacks occur, modifications to objects and attributes are not inbound replicated by destination domain controllers that have previously seen the USN. Because these destination domain controllers believe they are up to date, no replication errors are reported in Directory Service event logs or by monitoring and diagnostic tools. USN rollback may affect the replication of any object or attribute in any partition. The most frequently observed side effect is that user accounts and computer accounts that are created on the rollback domain controller do not exist on one or more replication partners. Or, the password updates that originated on the rollback domain controller do not exist on replication partners. | There are two approaches to recover from a USN rollback: <p>Remove the Domain Controller from the domain, following these steps: <ol type="1"><li>Remove Active Directory from the domain controller to force it to be a stand-alone server.
