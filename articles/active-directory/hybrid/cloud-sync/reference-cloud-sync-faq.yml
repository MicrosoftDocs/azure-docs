  Read about frequently asked questions for Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync.

sections:
  - name: General installation
    questions:
      - question: |
          How often does cloud sync run?
        answer: |
          Cloud provisioning is scheduled to run every 2 mins. Every 2 mins, any user, group and password hash changes will be provisioned to Microsoft Entra ID.

      - question: |
          Seeing password hash sync failures on the first run. Why?
        answer: |
          This behavior is expected. The failures are due to the user object not present in Microsoft Entra ID. Once the user is provisioned, wait for a couple of runs and confirm that password hash sync no longer has the errors.

      - question: |
          What happens if the Active Directory instance has attributes that aren't supported by cloud sync (for instance, directory extensions)?
        answer: |
          Cloud provisioning will run and provision the supported attributes. The unsupported attributes won't be provisioned to Microsoft Entra ID. Review the directory extensions in Active Directory and ensure that you don't need those attributes to flow to Microsoft Entra ID. If one or more attributes are required, consider using Microsoft Entra Connect Sync or moving the required information to one of the supported attributes (for instance, extension attributes 1-15).

      - question: |
          What's the difference between Microsoft Entra Connect Sync and cloud sync?
        answer: |
          With Microsoft Entra Connect Sync, provisioning runs on the on-premises sync server. Configuration is stored on the on-premises sync server. With Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync, the provisioning configuration is stored in the cloud and runs in the cloud as part of the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. See the detailed article [What is Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync](what-is-cloud-sync.md#comparison-between-azure-ad-connect-and-cloud-sync) for a detailed comparison.

      - question: |
          Can I use cloud sync to sync from multiple Active Directory forests?
        answer: |
          Yes. Cloud provisioning can be used to sync from multiple Active Directory forests. In the multi-forest environment, all the references (example, manager) need to be within the domain.  

      - question: |
          How is the agent updated?
        answer: |
          The agents are auto upgraded by Microsoft. For the IT team, this reduces the burden of having to test and validate new agent versions. 

      - question: |
          Can I disable auto upgrade?
        answer: |
          There's no supported way to disable auto upgrade.

      - question: |
          Can I change the source anchor for cloud sync?
        answer: |
          By default, cloud sync uses ms-ds-consistency-GUID with a fallback to ObjectGUID as source anchor. There's no supported way to change the source anchor.

      - question: |
          I see new service principals with the AD domain name(s) when using cloud sync. Is it expected?
        answer: |
          Yes, cloud sync creates a service principal for the provisioning configuration with the domain name as the service principal name. Don't make any changes to the service principal configuration.

      - question: |
          What happens when a synced user is required to change password on next logon?
        answer: |
          If password hash sync is enabled in cloud sync and the synced user is required to change password on next logon in on-premises AD, cloud sync doesn't provision the "to-be-changed" password hash to Microsoft Entra ID. Once the user changes the password, the user password hash is provisioned from AD to Microsoft Entra ID.

      - question: |
          Does cloud sync support writeback of ms-ds-consistencyGUID for any object?
        answer: |
          No, cloud sync doesn't support writeback of ms-ds-consistencyGUID for any object (including user objects). 

      - question: |
          I'm provisioning users using cloud sync. I deleted the configuration. Why do I still see the old synced objects in Microsoft Entra ID? 
        answer: |
          When you delete the configuration, cloud sync doesn't automatically remove the synced objects in Microsoft Entra ID. To ensure you Don't have the old objects, change the scope of the configuration to an empty group or Organizational Units. Once the provisioning runs and cleans up the objects, disable and delete the  configuration. 

      - question: |
          Does cloud sync support Exchange hybrid?
        answer: |
          Yes.  Cloud sync now supports Exchange hybrid scenarios.  For more information see [Exchange hybrid with cloud sync](exchange-hybrid.md)

      - question: |
          Can I install the cloud provisioning agent on Windows Server Core?
        answer: |
          No, installing the agent on server core isn't supported.

      - question: |
          Can I install the cloud provisioning agent on the same server as Microsoft Entra Connect Sync?
        answer: |
          Yes, installing the agent on the same server is supported.

      - question: |
          Can I use a staging server with the cloud provisioning agent?
        answer: |
          No, staging servers aren't supported.

      - question: |
          Can I synchronize a Guest user account?
        answer: |
          No, synchronizing a guest user account isn't supported.

      - question: |
          If I move a user from an OU that is scoped for cloud sync to an OU that is scoped for Microsoft Entra Connect, what happens?
        answer: |
          The user will be deleted and recreated.  Moving a user from an OU that is scoped for cloud sync will be viewed as a delete operation.  If the user is moved to an OU that is managed by Microsoft Entra Connect, it will be reprovisioned to Microsoft Entra ID and a new user created.

      - question: |
          If I rename or move the OU that is in scope for the cloud sync filter, what happens to the user that were created in Microsoft Entra ID?
        answer: |
          Nothing.  The users won't be deleted if the OU is renamed or moved.

      - question: |
          Does Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync support large groups?
        answer: |
          Yes. Today we support up to 50,000 group members synchronized using the OU scope filtering. 
      - question: |
          Does Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync support nested groups with group scoping?
        answer: |
          No. Nested objects beyond the first level won't be included when scoping using security groups. Only use group scope filtering for pilot scenarios, there are limitations to syncing large groups. 
      - question: |
          Does the cloud provisioning agent load balance if I have multiple agents installed?
        answer: |
          No. Only one agent is ever active. 
      - question: |
          Does the cloud provisioning agent require a preferred domain controller list be set?
        answer: |
          No. The preferred domain controller list is specified during [agent installation](how-to-install.md) but it's optional.  If no preferred DCs are configured, then the agent will use any available DC in the domain.
