Ready to get started? You should try out some of the really cool stuff we've released with Azure Active Directory. Use these capabilities to really add value to your organization's identity and access management. Read documentation to learn how to configure these features. Then see how you can start testing these capabilities by taking the first step and assigning trial licenses to administrators and users.


> [AZURE.NOTE] Azure AD is available to everyone for free. Sign up now for an Azure trial subscription and your directory will be waiting for you. The directory is yours whether you buy anything or not. [Try Azure AD now](https://azure.microsoft.com/trial/get-started-active-directory/)

##Secure your organization's access
Protect your organization's identity data in the cloud using Multi-Factor Authentication to ensure secure local and remote access. [Learn more about multi-factor authentication](../multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication.md)

##Change and reset passwords
Cut costs and decrease helpdesk calls by empowering users to change or reset their Active Directory or Azure Active Directory passwords from any device, at any location. An administrator can manage password and notification policies, and can see detailed audit activity of these password reset operations the moment they occur. [Learn more about managing passwords with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-manage-passwords.md)

##Create and edit users
Create an account for every user who will access a Microsoft cloud service. By default, users do not have administrator permissions, but you can assign them. [Learn more about creating Azure AD users](active-directory-create-users.md).

##View access and usage reports
Azure AD provides a number of reports for administrators. Even more reports are available in the paid editions of Azure AD, and there's a reporting API for creating your own custom reports. [Learn more about Azure AD reports](active-directory-view-access-usage-reports.md).
