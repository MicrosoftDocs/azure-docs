# How to configure an Application Proxy application to use PingAccess

Our collaboration with PingAccess now allows you to extend the benefits of Application Proxy to applications using header-based authentication. If your applications do not use headers, see our [Single Sign-On documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-application-proxy-sso-using-kcd) for details on other options.

## Overview of steps and recommended documents

To configure an application with PingAccess, there are four steps:

1.  Configure Application Proxy Connectors

2.  Create an Azure AD Application Proxy Application

3.  Download & Configure PingAccess

4.  Configure Applications in PingAccess

For details on each of these steps, see our [Single Sign-On with Headers documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/application-proxy-ping-access).
