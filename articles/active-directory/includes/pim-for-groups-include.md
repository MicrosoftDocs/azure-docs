>[!Note]
> For groups used for elevating into Microsoft Entra roles, we recommend that you require an approval process for eligible member assignments. Assignments that can be activated without approval can leave you vulnerable to a security risk from less-privileged administrators. For example, the Helpdesk Administrator has permission to reset an eligible user's passwords.
