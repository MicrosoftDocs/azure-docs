>[!NOTE]
> When performing bulk operations, such as import or create, you may encounter a problem if the bulk operation does not complete within the hour.
To work around this issue, we recommend splitting the number of records processed per batch. For example, before an export, you could limit the result set by filtering on a group type or user name to reduce the size of the results.
