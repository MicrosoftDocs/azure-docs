# Quickstart: Add sign-in with Microsoft to a Java web app

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-develop-applies-v2](../../../includes/active-directory-develop-applies-v2.md)]

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to integrate a Java web application with the Microsoft identity platform. Your app 
will sign in a user, get an access token to call the Microsoft Graph API, and make a request to the Microsoft Graph API. 

When you've completed the guide, your application will accept sign-ins of personal Microsoft accounts (including outlook.com,
 live.com, and others) and work or school accounts from any company or organization that uses Azure Active Directory.

![Shows how the sample app generated by this quickstart works](media/quickstart-v2-java-webapp/java-quickstart.svg)

> ## Prerequisites
> To run this sample you will need: 
> - Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or greater and Maven.
>
> [!div renderon="docs"]
> ## Register and download your quickstart app
> You have two options to start your quickstart application: express (Option 1), or manual (Option 2)
> 
> ### Option 1: Register and auto configure your app and then download your code sample
>
> 1. Go to the [Azure portal - App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps).
> 1. Enter a name for your application and select **Register**.
> 1. Follow the instructions to download and automatically configure your new application.
>
> ### Option 2: Register and manually configure your application and code sample
> 
>
> #### Step 1: Download the code sample
> 
> - [Download the Code Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-java-webapp/archive/master.zip)
>
> #### Step 2: Open application.properties
>
> 1. Extract the zip file to a local folder.
> 1. (Optional) If you use an integrated development environment, open the sample in your favorite IDE.
> 1. Open the *application.properties* file. You will insert values for `aad.clientId`, `aad.authority`, and `aad.secretKey` when you register your application in the next step.


> #### Step 3: Register your application
> To register your application and manually add the app's registration information to your solution, follow these steps:
>
> 1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
> 1. If your account gives you access to more than one tenant, select your account in the top right corner, and set your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.
> 1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
> 1. Select **New registration**.
> 1. When the **Register an application** page appears, enter your application's registration information:
>    - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `java-webapp`.
>    - Leave **Redirect URI** blank for now, and select **Register**.
> 1. Find the **Application (client) ID** value of the application. Update the value of `Enter_the_Application_Id_here` in the *application.properties* file.
> 1. Find the **Directory (tenant) ID** value of the application. Update the value of `Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` in the *application.properties* file. 
> 1. Select the **Authentication** menu, and then add the following information:
>    - In **Redirect URIs**, add `http://localhost:8080/msal4jsamples/secure/aad` and `https://localhost:8080/msal4jsamples/graph/users`.
>    - Select **Save**.
> 1. On the left hand menu, choose **Certificates & secrets** and click on **New client secret** in the **Client Secrets** section:
>     
>    - Type a key description (of instance app secret).
>    - Select a key duration of **In 1 year**.
>    - When you click on **Add**, the key value will be displayed. 
>    - Copy the value of the key. Open the *application.properties* file that you downloaded earlier and update the value of `Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here` with the key value. 
>

> #### Step 1: Configure your application in the Azure portal
> For the code sample for this quickstart to work, you need to:
> 1. Add reply URLs as `http://localhost:8080/msal4jsamples/secure/aad` and `https://localhost:8080/msal4jsamples/graph/users`.
> 1. Create a Client Secret.
> > [!div renderon="portal" id="makechanges" class="nextstepaction"]
> > [Make this change for me]()
>
> > [!div id="appconfigured" class="alert alert-info"]
> > ![Already configured](media/quickstart-v2-aspnet-webapp/green-check.png) Your application is configured with these attributes.
> 
> #### Step 2: Download the code sample
> 
> - [Download the Code Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-java-webapp/archive/master.zip)
> 
> #### Step 3: Configure the code sample 
> 
> 1. Extract the zip file to a local folder.
> 1. If you use an integrated development environment, open the sample in your favorite IDE (optional).
> 1. Open the **application.properties** file, which can be found in *src/main/resources/*.
> 1. Replace application properties.
>   1. Find `aad.clientId` and update the value of `Enter_the_Application_Id_here` with the **Application (client) ID** value of the application you registered. 
>   1. Find `aad.authority` and update the value of `Enter_the_Tenant_Name_Here` with the **Directory (tenant) ID** value of the application you registered.
>   1. Find `aad.secretKey` and update the value of `Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here` with the **Client Secret** you created in **Certificates & Secrets** for the application you registered.

#### Step 4: Run the code sample
1. Run the code sample, and open a browser and navigate to *http://localhost:8080*.
1. The front page contains a **sign-in** button. Click on the **sign-in** button to redirect to Azure Active Directory. The user will be prompted for their credentials.  
1. After successfully authenticating on Azure Active Directory, they will be redirected to *http://localhost:8080/msal4jsamples/secure/aad*. They are officially signed in to the application, and the page should show information for the signed in account. It will also contain buttons for: 
    - *Sign Out*: Will sign out the current user from the application, and redirect them the home page.
    - *Show Users*: Will acquire a token for the Microsoft Graph, then call the Microsoft Graph with the token attached to the request to get all of the users in the tenant.


## More information

### Getting MSAL
MSAL4J is the library used to sign in users and request tokens used to access an API protected by the Microsoft identity Platform. 
You can add MSAL4J to your application by using Maven or Gradle to manage your dependencies by making the following changes to the pom.xml or build.gradle file in your application. 

```XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>msal4j</artifactId>
    <version>0.5.0-preview</version>
</dependency>
```

```$xslt
compile group: 'com.microsoft.azure', name: 'msal4j', version: '0.5.0-preview'
```


### Msal initialization
You can add the reference to MSAL4J by adding the following code to the top of the file where you will be using MSAL4J: 

```Java
import com.microsoft.aad.msal4j.*;
```
