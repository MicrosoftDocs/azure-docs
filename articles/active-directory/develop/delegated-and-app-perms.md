# How to recognize differences between delegated and application permissions

## Recommended documents

- Learn more about how client applications use [delegated and application permission requests](developer-glossary.md#permissions) to access resources.
- See step-by-step instructions on how to [configure a client application's permission requests](quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis.md)
- For more depth, learn how resource applications expose [scopes](developer-glossary.md#scopes) and [application roles](developer-glossary.md#roles) to client applications, which manifest as delegated and application permissions respectively in the Azure portal.
