# How to select permissions for a given API 

## Recommended documents

- Learn more about how client applications use [delegated and application permission requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-dev-glossary#permissions) to access resources.
- See step-by-step instructions on how to [configure a client application's permission requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications)
- For more depth, learn how resource applications expose [scopes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-dev-glossary#scopes) and [application roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-dev-glossary#roles) to client applications, which manifest as delegated and application permissions respectively in the Azure portal.
