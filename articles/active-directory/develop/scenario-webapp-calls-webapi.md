# Scenarios - Sign-in users to a Web App. Web App calling Web APIs on behalf of the signed-in user

## Scenario

### Overview

You add authentication to your Web App, which can therefore sign in users and calls a web API on behalf of the signed-in user.

![Daemon apps](./media/scenarios/web-apps.svg)

Web Apps calling Web APIs:

- are confidential client applications.
- therefore they have registered a secret (application password or certificate) with Azure AD. This secret is passed-in during the call to Azure AD to get a token

### Specifics

> [!NOTE]
> - Adding sign-in to a Web App does not use the MSAL libraries as this is about protecting the Web App. Protecting libraries is achieved by libraries named Middleware
>
> - Calling Web APIs from a Web App can be done by the MSAL libraries.

The end to end experience of developers for this scenario has, therefore, specific aspects as:

- During the [Application registration](#app-registration-specifics), you'll need to provide one, or several (if you deploy your app to several locations) Reply URIs, secrets, or certificates need to be shared with Azure AD.
- The [Application configuration](#msal-libraries-applications-code-configuration) needs to provide client credentials as shared with Azure AD during the application registration

## Libraries supporting Web App scenarios

The libraries supporting the authorization code flow are:

  MSAL library | Description
  ------------ | ----------
![MSAL.NET](media/sample-v2-code/logo_NET.png) <br/> MSAL.NET  | Supported platforms are .NET Framework and .NET Core platforms (not UWP, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android as those platforms are used to build public client applications)
![Python](media/sample-v2-code/logo_python.png) <br/> MSAL.Python | development in progress - public preview to come
![Java](media/sample-v2-code/logo_java.png) <br/> MSAL.Java | development in progress

## App registration specifics

### Registration of secrets or certificates

Like for any confidential client application, you need to register a secret or certificate. You can register your application secrets either through the interactive experience in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredAppsPreview), or using command-line tools (like PowerShell)

#### Registering client secrets using the application registration portal

The management of client credentials happens in the **certificates & secrets** page for an application:

![image](media/quickstart-update-azure-ad-app-preview/credentials-certificates-secrets-expanded.png)

- the application secret (also named client secret) is generated by Azure AD, during the registration of the confidential client application, when you select **New client secret**. At that point, you must copy the secret string in the clipboard for use in your app, before selecting **Save**. This string won't be presented any longer.
- the certificate is uploaded in the application registration using the **Upload certificate** button

For details, see [Quickstart: Configure a client application to access web APIs | Add credentials to your application](quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis.md#add-credentials-to-your-web-application)

#### Registering client secrets using PowerShell

Alternatively, you can register your application with Azure AD using command-line tools. The [active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2) sample shows how to register an application secret or a certificate with an Azure AD application:

- For details on how to register an application secret, see [AppCreationScripts/Configure.ps1](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2/blob/5199032b352a912e7cc0fce143f81664ba1a8c26/AppCreationScripts/Configure.ps1#L190)
- For details on how to register a certificate with the application, see [AppCreationScripts-withCert/Configure.ps1](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2/blob/5199032b352a912e7cc0fce143f81664ba1a8c26/AppCreationScripts-withCert/Configure.ps1#L162-L178)

## MSAL libraries: Application's code configuration

### Application configuration and instantiation

In MSAL libraries, the Client Credentials (secret or certificate) are passed as a parameter of the ``ConfidentialClientApplication`` construction.

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

```CSharp
using Microsoft.Identity.Client.ApiConfig;

IConfidentialClientApplication app;
```

Here is the code to build an application with an application secret:

```CSharp
app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config.ClientId)
           .WithClientSecret(config.ClientSecret)
           .WithAuthority(new Uri(config.Authority))
           .Build();
```

Here is the code to build an application with a certificate:

```CSharp
X509Certificate2 certificate = ReadCertificate(config.CertificateName);
app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config.ClientId)
    .WithCertificate(certificate)
    .WithAuthority(new Uri(config.Authority))
    .Build();
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```Python
# Create a preferably long-lived app instance which maintains a token cache.

app = msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(
    config["client_id"], authority=config["authority"],
    client_credential=config["secret"],
    # token_cache=...  # Default cache is in memory only.
                       # You can learn how to use SerializableTokenCache from
                       # https://msal-python.rtfd.io/en/latest/#msal.SerializableTokenCache

    )
```
