# Daemon app that calls web APIs - code configuration

Learn how to configure the code for your daemon application that calls web APIs.

## MSAL libraries that support daemon apps

These Microsoft libraries support daemon apps:

  MSAL library | Description
  ------------ | ----------
  ![MSAL.NET](media/sample-v2-code/logo_NET.png) <br/> MSAL.NET  | The .NET Framework and .NET Core platforms are supported for building daemon applications. (UWP, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android aren't supported because those platforms are used to build public client applications.)
  ![Python](media/sample-v2-code/logo_python.png) <br/> MSAL Python | Support for daemon applications in Python.
  ![Java](media/sample-v2-code/logo_java.png) <br/> MSAL Java | Support for daemon applications in Java.

## Configure the authority

Daemon applications use application permissions rather than delegated permissions. So their supported account type can't be an account in any organizational directory or any personal Microsoft account (for example, Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com). There's no tenant admin to grant consent to a daemon application for a Microsoft personal account. You'll need to choose *accounts in my organization* or *accounts in any organization*.

So the authority specified in the application configuration should be tenanted (specifying a tenant ID or a domain name associated with your organization).

If you're an ISV and want to provide a multitenant tool, you can use `organizations`. But keep in mind that you'll also need to explain to your customers how to grant admin consent. For details, see [Requesting consent for an entire tenant](v2-permissions-and-consent.md#requesting-consent-for-an-entire-tenant). Also, there's currently a limitation in MSAL: `organizations` is allowed only when the client credentials are an application secret (not a certificate).

## Configure and instantiate the application

In MSAL libraries, the client credentials (secret or certificate) are passed as a parameter of the confidential client application construction.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Even if your application is a console application that runs as a service, if it's a daemon application, it needs to be a confidential client application.

### Configuration file

The configuration file defines:

- The authority or the cloud instance and tenant ID.
- The client ID that you got from the application registration.
- Either a client secret or a certificate.

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

[appsettings.json](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2/blob/master/1-Call-MSGraph/daemon-console/appsettings.json) from the [.NET Core console daemon](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2) sample.

```json
{
  "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{0}",
  "Tenant": "[Enter here the tenantID or domain name for your Azure AD tenant]",
  "ClientId": "[Enter here the ClientId for your application]",
  "ClientSecret": "[Enter here a client secret for your application]",
  "CertificateName": "[Or instead of client secret: Enter here the name of a certificate (from the user cert store) as registered with your application]"
}
```

You provide either a `ClientSecret` or a `CertificateName`. These settings are exclusive.

# [Python](#tab/python)

When you build a confidential client with client secrets, the [parameters.json](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-daemon/blob/master/1-Call-MsGraph-WithSecret/parameters.json) config file in the [Python daemon](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-daemon) sample is as follows:

```Json
{
  "authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/Enter_the_Tenant_Name_Here",
  "client_id": "your_client_id",
  "scope": [ "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" ],
  "secret": "The secret generated by AAD during your confidential app registration",
  "endpoint": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users"
}
```

When you build a confidential client with certificates, the [parameters.json](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-daemon/blob/master/2-Call-MsGraph-WithCertificate/parameters.json) config file in the [Python daemon](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-daemon) sample is as follows:

```Json
{
  "authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/Enter_the_Tenant_Name_Here",
  "client_id": "your_client_id",
  "scope": [ "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" ],
  "thumbprint": "790E... The thumbprint generated by AAD when you upload your public cert",
  "private_key_file": "server.pem",
  "endpoint": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users"
}
```

# [Java](#tab/java)

```Java
 private final static String CLIENT_ID = "";
 private final static String AUTHORITY = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/";
 private final static String CLIENT_SECRET = "";
 private final static Set<String> SCOPE = Collections.singleton("https://graph.microsoft.com/.default");
```

### Instantiate the MSAL application

To instantiate the MSAL application, you need to add, reference, or import the MSAL package (depending on the language).

The construction is different, depending on whether you're using client secrets or certificates (or, as an advanced scenario, signed assertions).

#### Reference the package

Reference the MSAL package in your application code.

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

Add the [Microsoft.IdentityClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Client) NuGet package to your application.
In MSAL.NET, the confidential client application is represented by the `IConfidentialClientApplication` interface.
Use the MSAL.NET namespace in the source code.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
IConfidentialClientApplication app;
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
import msal
```

# [Java](#tab/java)

```java
import com.microsoft.aad.msal4j.ClientCredentialFactory;
import com.microsoft.aad.msal4j.ClientCredentialParameters;
import com.microsoft.aad.msal4j.ConfidentialClientApplication;
import com.microsoft.aad.msal4j.IAuthenticationResult;
import com.microsoft.aad.msal4j.IClientCredential;
import com.microsoft.aad.msal4j.MsalException;
import com.microsoft.aad.msal4j.SilentParameters;
```

#### Instantiate the confidential client application with a client secret

Here's the code to instantiate the confidential client application with a client secret:

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config.ClientId)
           .WithClientSecret(config.ClientSecret)
           .WithAuthority(new Uri(config.Authority))
           .Build();
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```Python
config = json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))

# Create a preferably long-lived app instance that maintains a token cache.
app = msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(
    config["client_id"], authority=config["authority"],
    client_credential=config["secret"],
    # token_cache=...  # Default cache is in memory only.
                       # You can learn how to use SerializableTokenCache from
                       # https://msal-python.rtfd.io/en/latest/#msal.SerializableTokenCache
    )
```

# [Java](#tab/java)

```Java
IClientCredential credential = ClientCredentialFactory.createFromSecret(CLIENT_SECRET);

ConfidentialClientApplication cca =
        ConfidentialClientApplication
                .builder(CLIENT_ID, credential)
                .authority(AUTHORITY)
                .build();
```

---

#### Instantiate the confidential client application with a client certificate

Here's the code to build an application with a certificate:

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
X509Certificate2 certificate = ReadCertificate(config.CertificateName);
app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config.ClientId)
    .WithCertificate(certificate)
    .WithAuthority(new Uri(config.Authority))
    .Build();
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```Python
config = json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))

# Create a preferably long-lived app instance that maintains a token cache.
app = msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(
    config["client_id"], authority=config["authority"],
    client_credential={"thumbprint": config["thumbprint"], "private_key": open(config['private_key_file']).read()},
    # token_cache=...  # Default cache is in memory only.
                       # You can learn how to use SerializableTokenCache from
                       # https://msal-python.rtfd.io/en/latest/#msal.SerializableTokenCache
    )
```

# [Java](#tab/java)

In MSAL Java, there are two builders to instantiate the confidential client application with certificates:

```Java

InputStream pkcs12Certificate = ... ; /* Containing PCKS12-formatted certificate*/
string certificatePassword = ... ;    /* Contains the password to access the certificate */

IClientCredential credential = ClientCredentialFactory.createFromCertificate(pkcs12Certificate, certificatePassword);

ConfidentialClientApplication cca =
        ConfidentialClientApplication
                .builder(CLIENT_ID, credential)
                .authority(AUTHORITY)
                .build();
```

or

```Java
PrivateKey key = getPrivateKey(); /* RSA private key to sign the assertion */
X509Certificate publicCertificate = getPublicCertificate(); /* x509 public certificate used as a thumbprint */

IClientCredential credential = ClientCredentialFactory.createFromCertificate(key, publicCertificate);

ConfidentialClientApplication cca =
        ConfidentialClientApplication
                .builder(CLIENT_ID, credential)
                .authority(AUTHORITY)
                .build();
```

---

#### Advanced scenario: Instantiate the confidential client application with client assertions

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

Instead of a client secret or a certificate, the confidential client application can also prove its identity by using client assertions.

MSAL.NET has two methods to provide signed assertions to the confidential client app:

- `.WithClientAssertion()`
- `.WithClientClaims()`

When you use `WithClientAssertion`, you need to provide a signed JWT. This advanced scenario is detailed in [Client assertions](msal-net-client-assertions.md).

```csharp
string signedClientAssertion = ComputeAssertion();
app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config.ClientId)
                                          .WithClientAssertion(signedClientAssertion)
                                          .Build();
```

When you use `WithClientClaims`, MSAL.NET will produce a signed assertion that contains the claims expected by Azure AD, plus additional client claims that you want to send.
This code shows how to do that:

```csharp
string ipAddress = "192.168.1.2";
var claims = new Dictionary<string, string> { { "client_ip", ipAddress } };
X509Certificate2 certificate = ReadCertificate(config.CertificateName);
app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config.ClientId)
                                          .WithAuthority(new Uri(config.Authority))
                                          .WithClientClaims(certificate, claims)
                                          .Build();```
```

Again, for details, see [Client assertions](msal-net-client-assertions.md).

# [Python](#tab/python)

In MSAL Python, you can provide client claims by using the claims that will be signed by this `ConfidentialClientApplication`'s private key.

```Python
config = json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))

# Create a preferably long-lived app instance that maintains a token cache.
app = msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(
    config["client_id"], authority=config["authority"],
    client_credential={"thumbprint": config["thumbprint"], "private_key": open(config['private_key_file']).read()},
    client_claims = {"client_ip": "x.x.x.x"}
    # token_cache=...  # Default cache is in memory only.
                       # You can learn how to use SerializableTokenCache from
                       # https://msal-python.rtfd.io/en/latest/#msal.SerializableTokenCache
    )
```

For details, see the MSAL Python reference documentation for [ConfidentialClientApplication](https://msal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#msal.ClientApplication.__init__).

# [Java](#tab/java)

```Java
IClientCredential credential = ClientCredentialFactory.createFromClientAssertion(assertion);

ConfidentialClientApplication cca =
        ConfidentialClientApplication
                .builder(CLIENT_ID, credential)
                .authority(AUTHORITY)
                .build();
```
