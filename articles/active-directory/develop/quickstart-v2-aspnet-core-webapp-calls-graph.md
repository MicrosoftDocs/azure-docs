#Customer intent: As an application developer, I want to download and run a demo ASP.NET Core web app that can sign in users with personal Microsoft accounts (MSA) and work/school accounts from any Azure Active Directory instance, then access their data in Microsoft Graph on their behalf.

> In this quickstart, you download and run a code sample that demonstrates how an ASP.NET Core web app can sign in users from any Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) organization and calls Microsoft Graph.
> 
> See [How the sample works](#how-the-sample-works) for an illustration.
> 
> ## Step 1: Configure your application in the Azure portal
> 
> For the code sample in this quickstart to work, add a **Redirect URI** of `https://localhost:44321/signin-oidc` and > **Front-channel logout URL** of `https://localhost:44321/signout-oidc` in the app registration.

> ## About the code
> 
> This section gives an overview of the code required to sign in users and call the Microsoft Graph API on their behalf. This overview can be useful to understand how the code works, main arguments, and also if you want to add sign-in to an existing ASP.NET Core application and call Microsoft Graph. It uses [Microsoft.Identity.Web](microsoft-identity-web.md), which is a wrapper around [MSAL.NET](msal-overview.md).

> ![Shows how the sample app generated by this quickstart works](media/quickstart-v2-aspnet-core-webapp-calls-graph/> aspnetcorewebapp-intro.svg)
> 
> ### Startup class
> 
> The *Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication* middleware uses a `Startup` class that's executed when the hosting process initializes:
> 
> ```csharp
> 
>   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
>   {  
>     // Get the scopes from the configuration (appsettings.json)
>     var initialScopes = Configuration.GetValue<string>("DownstreamApi:Scopes")?.Split(' ');
>   
>       // Add sign-in with Microsoft
>       services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
>         .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"))
> 
>             // Add the possibility of acquiring a token to call a protected web API
>             .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
> 
>                 // Enables controllers and pages to get GraphServiceClient by dependency injection
>                 // And use an in memory token cache
>                 .AddMicrosoftGraph(Configuration.GetSection("DownstreamApi"))
>                 .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();
> 
>       services.AddControllersWithViews(options =>
>       {
>           var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
>               .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
>               .Build();
>           options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
>       });
> 
>       // Enables a UI and controller for sign in and sign out.
>       services.AddRazorPages()
>           .AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
>   }
> ```
> 
> The `AddAuthentication()` method configures the service to add cookie-based authentication, which is used in browser scenarios and to set the challenge to OpenID Connect.
> 
> The line containing `.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp` adds the Microsoft identity platform authentication to your application. This is provided by [Microsoft.Identity.Web](microsoft-identity-web.md). It's then configured to sign in using the Microsoft identity platform based on the information in the `AzureAD` section of the *appsettings.json* configuration file:
> 
> | *appsettings.json* key | Description                                                                                                                 >                                          |
> |------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
> | `ClientId`             | **Application (client) ID** of the application registered in the Azure portal.                                                                                       |
> | `Instance`             | Security token service (STS) endpoint for the user to authenticate. This value is typically `https://login.microsoftonline.com/`, indicating the Azure public cloud. |
> | `TenantId`             | Name of your tenant or its tenant ID (a GUID), or *common* to sign in users with work or school accounts or Microsoft personal accounts.                             |
> 
> The `EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi` method enables your application to acquire a token to call protected web APIs. `AddMicrosoftGraph` enables your controllers or Razor pages to benefit directly the `GraphServiceClient` (by dependency injection) and the `AddInMemoryTokenCaches` methods enables your app to benefit from a token cache.
> 
> The `Configure()` method contains two important methods, `app.UseAuthentication()` and `app.UseAuthorization()`, that enable their named functionality. Also in the `Configure()` method, you must register Microsoft Identity Web's routes with at least one call to `endpoints.MapControllerRoute()` or a call to `endpoints.MapControllers()`.
> 
> ```csharp
> app.UseAuthentication();
> app.UseAuthorization();
> 
> app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
> {
> 
>     endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
>         name: "default",
>         pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
>     endpoints.MapRazorPages();
> });
> 
> // endpoints.MapControllers(); // REQUIRED if MapControllerRoute() isn't called.
> ```
> 
> ### Protect a controller or a controller's method
> 
> You can protect a controller or its methods by applying the `[Authorize]` attribute to the controller's class or one or more of its methods. This `[Authorize]` attribute restricts access by allowing only authenticated users. If the user isn't already authenticated, an authentication challenge can be started to access the controller. In this quickstart, the scopes are read from the configuration file:
> 
> ```csharp
> [AuthorizeForScopes(ScopeKeySection = "DownstreamApi:Scopes")]
> public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
> {
>     var user = await _graphServiceClient.Me.Request().GetAsync();
>     ViewData["ApiResult"] = user.DisplayName;
> 
>     return View();
> }
> ```

> 
> ## Next steps
> 
> The GitHub repo that contains the ASP.NET Core code sample referenced in this quickstart includes instructions and more code samples that show you how to:
> 
> - Add authentication to a new ASP.NET Core Web application
> - Call Microsoft Graph, other Microsoft APIs, or your own web APIs
> - Add authorization
> - Sign in users in national clouds or with social identities
