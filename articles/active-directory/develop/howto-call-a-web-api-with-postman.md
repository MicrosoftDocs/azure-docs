# Call an ASP.NET Core web API with Postman

::: zone pivot="no-api"

This article shows you how to call a protected ASP.NET Core web API using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). Postman is an application that lets you send HTTP requests to a web API to test its authorization and access control (authentication) policies. In this article, you'll register a web app and a web API in a tenant. The web app is used to get an access token generated by the Microsoft identity platform. Next, you'll use the token to make an authorized call to the web API using Postman.

This article shows you how to call a protected ASP.NET Core web API using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). Postman is an application that lets you send HTTP requests to a web API to test its authorization and access control (authentication) policies. Following on from the [Tutorial: Implement a protected endpoint to your API](web-api-tutorial-03-protect-endpoint.md), where you created a protected API, you'll need to register a web application with the Microsoft identity platform to generate an access token. Next, you'll use the token to make an authorized call to the API using Postman.

## Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform

The Microsoft identity platform requires your application to be registered before providing identity and access management services. The application registration allows you to specify the name and type of the application and the sign-in audience. The sign-in audience specifies what types of user accounts are allowed to sign-in to a given application.

::: zone pivot="no-api"

### Register the web API

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/articles/active-directory/includes/portal-update.md)]

Follow these steps to create the web API registration:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Application Developer](../roles/permissions-reference.md#application-developer).
1. If access to multiple tenants is available, use the **Directories + subscriptions** filter :::image type="icon" source="media/common/portal-directory-subscription-filter.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which you want to register the application.
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. Enter a **Name** for the application, such as _NewWebAPI1_.
1. For **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**. For information on different account types, select **Help me choose** option.
1. Select **Register**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/web-api-tutorial-01-register-app/register-application.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to enter a name and select the account type.":::

1. The application's **Overview** pane is displayed when registration is complete. Record the **Directory (tenant) ID** and the **Application (client) ID** to be used in your application source code.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/web-api-tutorial-01-register-app/record-identifiers.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the identifier values on the overview page.":::

> [!NOTE]
> The **Supported account types** can be changed by referring to [Modify the accounts supported by an application](howto-modify-supported-accounts.md).

#### Expose the API

Once the API is registered, you can configure its permission by defining the scopes that the API exposes to client applications. Client applications request permission to perform operations by passing an access token along with its requests to the protected web API. The web API then performs the requested operation only if the access token it receives is valid.

1. Under **Manage**, select **Expose an API > Add a scope**. Accept the proposed **Application ID URI** `(api://{clientId})` by selecting **Save and continue**. The `{clientId}` is the value recorded from the **Overview** page. Then enter the following information:
   1. For **Scope name**, enter `Forecast.Read`.
   1. For **Who can consent**, ensure that the **Admins and users** option is selected.
   1. In the **Admin consent display name** box, enter `Read forecast data`.
   1. In the **Admin consent description** box, enter `Allows the application to read weather forecast data`.
   1. In the **User consent display name** box, enter `Read forecast data`.
   1. In the **User consent description** box, enter `Allows the application to read weather forecast data`.
   1. Ensure that the **State** is set to **Enabled**.
1. Select **Add scope**. If the scope has been entered correctly, it's listed in the **Expose an API** pane.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/web-api-tutorial-01-register-app/add-a-scope-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the field values when adding the scope to an API." lightbox="./media/web-api-tutorial-01-register-app/add-a-scope-expanded.png":::

### Register the web app

Having a web API isn't enough however, as a web app is also needed to obtain an access token to access the web API you've created.

Follow these steps to create the web app registration:

::: zone pivot="no-api"

Select **Home** to return to the home page. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. Enter a **Name** for the application, such as `web-app-calls-web-api`.
1. For **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**. For information on different account types, select the **Help me choose** option.
1. Under **Redirect URI (optional)**, select **Web**, and then enter `http://localhost` in the URL text box.
1. Select **Register**.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="api"

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Application Developer](../roles/permissions-reference.md#application-developer).
1. If access to multiple tenants is available, use the **Directories + subscriptions** filter :::image type="icon" source="media/common/portal-directory-subscription-filter.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which you want to register the application.  
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. Enter a Name for the application, such as `web-app-calls-web-api`.
1. For **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**. For information on different account types, select the **Help me choose** option.
1. Under **Redirect URI (optional)**, select **Web**, and then enter `http://localhost` in the URL text box.
1. Select **Register**.

::: zone-end

The application's **Overview** pane is displayed when registration is complete. Record the **Directory (tenant) ID** and the **Application (client) ID** to be used in later steps.

#### Add a client secret

A client secret is a string value your app can use to identity itself, and is sometimes referred to as an _application password_. The web app uses the client secret to prove its identity when it requests tokens.

Follow these steps to configure a client secret:

1. From the **Overview** pane, under **Manage**, select **Certificates & secrets** > **Client secrets** > **New client secret**.
1. Add a description for your client secret, for example _My client secret_.
1. Select an expiration for the secret or specify a custom lifetime.

   - A client secret's lifetime is limited to two years (24 months) or less. You can't specify a custom lifetime longer than 24 months.
   - Microsoft recommends that you set an expiration value of less than 12 months.

1. Select **Add**.
1. Be sure to record the **Value** of the client secret. This secret value is **never displayed again** after you leave this page.

#### Add permissions to access your web API

By specifying a web API's scopes, the web app can obtain an access token containing the scopes provided by the Microsoft identity platform. Within the code, the web API can then provide permission-based access to its resources based on the scopes found in the access token.

Follow these steps to configure client's permissions to the web API:

1. From the **Overview** pane of your application, under **Manage**, select **API permissions** > **Add a permission** > **My APIs**.
1. Select **NewWebAPI1** or the API that you wish to add permissions to.
1. Under **Select permissions**, check the box next to **Forecast.Read**. You may need to expand the **Permission** list. This selects the permissions the client app should have on behalf of the signed-in user.
1. Select **Add permissions** to complete the process.

After adding these permissions to your API, you should see the selected permissions under **Configured permissions**.

You may also notice the **User.Read** permission for the Microsoft Graph API. This permission is added automatically when you register an app.

::: zone pivot="no-api"

## Test the web API

1. Clone the [ms-identity-docs-code-dotnet](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-docs-code-dotnet) repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-docs-code-dotnet.git
   ```

1. Navigate to `ms-identity-docs-code-dotnet/web-api` folder and open `appsettings.json`, replace the `{APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID}` and `{DIRECTORY_TENANT_ID}` with:

   - `{APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID}` is the web API **Application (client) ID** on the app's **Overview** pane.
   - `{DIRECTORY_TENANT_ID}` is the web API **Directory (tenant) ID** on the app's **Overview** pane.

1. Execute the following command to start the app:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

1. An output similar to the following will appear. Record the port number in the `https://localhost:{port}` URL.

   ```bash
   ...
   info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
         Now listening on: https://localhost:{port}
   ...
   ```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="api"

## Test the web API

1. Navigate to the web API that was created in [Tutorial: Create an ASP.NET Core project and configure the API](web-api-tutorial-02-prepare-api.md), for example _NewWebAPILocal_, and open the folder.

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the folder where the web API project is located.

   ### [.NET 6.0](#tab/dotnet6)

   1. Execute the following command to start the app:

      ```bash
      dotnet run
      ```

   ### [.NET 7.0](#tab/dotnet7)

   1. Open a new terminal and execute the following command to start the app on the `https` profile:

      ```bash
      dotnet run -launch-profile https`
      ```

     ---

1. An output similar to the following will appear. Record the port number in the `https://localhost:{port}` URL.

   ```bash
   ...
   info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
         Now listening on: https://localhost:{port}
   ...
   ```

::: zone-end

### Configure an authorized request to the web API in Postman

1. Launch the **Postman** application.
1. In the main Postman window, find **Create a new request** and select **HTTP Request**.
1. In the top bar, select **GET** from the dropdown menu.
1. For the request URL, enter the URL of the endpoint exposed by the web API, `https://localhost:{port}/weatherforecast`.
1. Select the **Authorization** tab to configure Postman to obtain a token from the Microsoft identity platform that will grant access to the web API.
1. From the **Type** dropdown, select **OAuth 2.0**. This displays **Configure New Token** form.
1. Enter the following values in the **Configure New Token** form:

   | Setting          | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Token Name       | Provide any name for the token. For example, enter `Bearer`                                                                                                                                                                                    |
   | Grant Type       | Select **Authorization Code**                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
   | Callback URL     | Enter `http://localhost`, which sets the Callback URL to the Redirect URI registered with Microsoft Entra ID. DO NOT check the **Authorize using browser** checkbox.                                                                               |
   | Auth URL         | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize` <br/> Replace `{tenantId}` with the **Directory (tenant) ID**                                                                                                             |
   | Access Token URL | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}/oauth2/v2.0/token` <br/> Replace `{tenantId}` with the **Directory (tenant) ID**                                                                                                                 |
   | Client ID        | The **Application (client) ID** value of your web app registration                                                                                                                                                                             |
   | Client Secret    | The client secret **Value** of your web app registration                                                                                                                                                                                       |

#### Get an access token and send a request to the web API

1. Once these values are entered select the **Get New Access Token** button. This launches a Postman browser window where you authenticate with your user credentials. Be sure to allow pop ups from the Postman application in the browser.
1. After authenticating, a new Postman generated pop-up window will appear. Select the **Use Token** button in Postman to provide the access token in the request.
1. Select **Send** to send the request to the protected web API endpoint.

With a valid access token included in the request, the expected response is 200 OK with output similar to:

```json
[
  {
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS",
    "temperatureC": -16,
    "summary": "Scorching",
    "temperatureF": 4
  },
  {
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS",
    "temperatureC": 1,
    "summary": "Sweltering",
    "temperatureF": 33
  },
  {
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS",
    "temperatureC": 26,
    "summary": "Freezing",
    "temperatureF": 78
  },
  {
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS",
    "temperatureC": 54,
    "summary": "Mild",
