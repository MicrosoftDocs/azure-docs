# Support and help options for developers

If you need an answer to a question or help in solving a problem not covered in our documentation, it might be time to reach out to experts for help. Here are several suggestions for getting answers to your questions as you develop applications that integrate with the Microsoft identity platform.

## Create an Azure support request

    <img alt='Azure support' src='./media/common/logo_azure.svg'>
</div>

Explore the range of [Azure support options and choose the plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans) that best fits you. There are two options to create and manage support requests in the Azure portal:

- If you already have an Azure Support Plan, [open a support request here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest).

- If you're not an Azure customer, you can open a support request with [Microsoft Support for business](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness).

## Post a question to Microsoft Q&A

</div>

Get answers to your identity app development questions directly from Microsoft engineers, Azure Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs), and members of our expert community.

[Microsoft Q&A](/answers/products/) is Azure's recommended source of community support.

If you can't find an answer to your problem by searching Microsoft Q&A, submit a new question. Use one of following tags when you ask your [high-quality question](/answers/articles/24951/how-to-write-a-quality-question.html):
