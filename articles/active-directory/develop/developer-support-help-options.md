# Support and help options for developers

If you need an answer to a question or help in solving a problem not covered in our documentation, it might be time to reach out to experts for help. Here are several suggestions for getting answers to your questions as you develop applications that integrate with the Microsoft identity platform.

## Create an Azure support request

</div>

Explore the range of [Azure support options and choose the plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans) that best fits you. There are two options to create and manage support requests in the Microsoft Entra admin center:

- If you already have an Azure Support Plan, [open a support request here](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/NewSupportRequestV3Blade/callerName/ActiveDirectory/issueType/technical).

- If you're using Microsoft Entra ID for customers (preview), the support request feature is currently unavailable in customer tenants. However, you can use the **Give Feedback** link on the **New support request** page to provide feedback. Or, you can switch to your Microsoft Entra workforce tenant and [open a support request](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/NewSupportRequestV3Blade/callerName/ActiveDirectory/issueType/technical).

- If you're not an Azure customer, you can open a support request with [Microsoft Support for business](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness).

## Post a question to Microsoft Q&A

Get answers to your identity app development questions directly from Microsoft engineers, Azure Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs), and members of our expert community.

[Microsoft Q&A](/answers/products/) is Azure's recommended source of community support.
