This article describes how to program directly against the protocol in your application to request tokens from Microsoft Entra ID.  When possible, we recommend you use the supported Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) instead to [acquire tokens and call secured web APIs](../authentication-flows-app-scenarios.md#scenarios-and-supported-authentication-flows).  Also take a look at the [sample apps that use MSAL](../sample-v2-code.md).
