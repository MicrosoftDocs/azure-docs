# Desktop app that calls web APIs: Acquire a token using Device Code flow 

If you're writing a command-line tool that doesn't have web controls, and you can't or don't want to use the previous flows, use the device code flow.

## Device code flow

Interactive authentication with Microsoft Entra ID requires a web browser. For more information, see [Usage of web browsers](https://aka.ms/msal-net-uses-web-browser). To authenticate users on devices or operating systems that don't provide a web browser, device code flow lets the user use another device such as a computer or a mobile phone to sign in interactively. By using the device code flow, the application obtains tokens through a two-step process that's designed for these devices or operating systems. Examples of such applications are applications that run on iOT or command-line tools (CLI). The idea is that:

1. Whenever user authentication is required, the app provides a code for the user. The user is asked to use another device, such as an internet-connected smartphone, to go to a URL, for instance, `https://microsoft.com/devicelogin`. Then the user is prompted to enter the code. That done, the web page leads the user through a normal authentication experience, which includes consent prompts and multi-factor authentication, if necessary.

2. Upon successful authentication, the command-line app receives the required tokens through a back channel and uses them to perform the web API calls it needs.

## Use it

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

`IPublicClientApplication`contains a method named `AcquireTokenWithDeviceCode`.

```csharp
 AcquireTokenWithDeviceCode(IEnumerable<string> scopes,
                            Func<DeviceCodeResult, Task> deviceCodeResultCallback)
```

This method takes as parameters:

- The `scopes` to request an access token for.
- A callback that receives the [`DeviceCodeResult`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.devicecoderesult).

The following sample code presents the synopsis of most current cases, with explanations of the kind of exceptions you can get and their mitigation. For a fully functional code sample, see [active-directory-dotnetcore-devicecodeflow-v2](https://github.com/azure-samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-devicecodeflow-v2) on GitHub.

```csharp
private const string ClientId = "<client_guid>";
private const string Authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.com";
private readonly string[] scopes = new string[] { "user.read" };

static async Task<AuthenticationResult> GetATokenForGraph()
{
    IPublicClientApplication pca = PublicClientApplicationBuilder
            .Create(ClientId)
            .WithAuthority(Authority)
            .WithDefaultRedirectUri()
            .Build();

    var accounts = await pca.GetAccountsAsync();

    // All AcquireToken* methods store the tokens in the cache, so check the cache first
    try
    {
        return await pca.AcquireTokenSilent(scopes, accounts.FirstOrDefault())
            .ExecuteAsync();
    }
    catch (MsalUiRequiredException ex)
    {
        // No token found in the cache or Azure AD insists that a form interactive auth is required (e.g. the tenant admin turned on MFA)
        // If you want to provide a more complex user experience, check out ex.Classification

        return await AcquireByDeviceCodeAsync(pca);
    }
}

private static async Task<AuthenticationResult> AcquireByDeviceCodeAsync(IPublicClientApplication pca)
{
    try
    {
        var result = await pca.AcquireTokenWithDeviceCode(scopes,
            deviceCodeResult =>
            {
                    // This will print the message on the console which tells the user where to go sign-in using
                    // a separate browser and the code to enter once they sign in.
                    // The AcquireTokenWithDeviceCode() method will poll the server after firing this
                    // device code callback to look for the successful login of the user via that browser.
                    // This background polling (whose interval and timeout data is also provided as fields in the
                    // deviceCodeCallback class) will occur until:
                    // * The user has successfully logged in via browser and entered the proper code
                    // * The timeout specified by the server for the lifetime of this code (typically ~15 minutes) has been reached
                    // * The developing application calls the Cancel() method on a CancellationToken sent into the method.
                    //   If this occurs, an OperationCanceledException will be thrown (see catch below for more details).
                    Console.WriteLine(deviceCodeResult.Message);
                return Task.FromResult(0);
            }).ExecuteAsync();

        Console.WriteLine(result.Account.Username);
        return result;
    }

    // TODO: handle or throw all these exceptions depending on your app
    catch (MsalServiceException ex)
    {
        // Kind of errors you could have (in ex.Message)

        // AADSTS50059: No tenant-identifying information found in either the request or implied by any provided credentials.
        // Mitigation: as explained in the message from Azure AD, the authoriy needs to be tenanted. you have probably created

        // no active subscriptions for the tenant. Check with your subscription administrator.
        // Mitigation: if you have an active subscription for the tenant this might be that you have a typo in the
        // tenantId (GUID) or tenant domain name.
    }
    catch (OperationCanceledException ex)
    {
        // If you use a CancellationToken, and call the Cancel() method on it, then this *may* be triggered
        // to indicate that the operation was cancelled.
        // See https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/threading/cancellation-in-managed-threads
        // for more detailed information on how C# supports cancellation in managed threads.
    }
    catch (MsalClientException ex)
    {
        // Possible cause - verification code expired before contacting the server
        // This exception will occur if the user does not manage to sign-in before a time out (15 mins) and the
        // call to `AcquireTokenWithDeviceCode` is not cancelled in between
    }

# [Python](#tab/python)

This extract is from the [MSAL Python dev samples](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python/blob/dev/sample/).

```python
# Create a preferably long-lived app instance which maintains a token cache.
app = msal.PublicClientApplication(
    config["client_id"], authority=config["authority"],
    # token_cache=...  # Default cache is in memory only.
                       # You can learn how to use SerializableTokenCache from
                       # https://msal-python.rtfd.io/en/latest/#msal.SerializableTokenCache
    )

# The pattern to acquire a token looks like this.
result = None

# Note: If your device-flow app does not have any interactive ability, you can
#   completely skip the following cache part. But here we demonstrate it anyway.
# We now check the cache to see if we have some end users signed in before.
accounts = app.get_accounts()
if accounts:
    logging.info("Account(s) exists in cache, probably with token too. Let's try.")
    print("Pick the account you want to use to proceed:")
    for a in accounts:
        print(a["username"])
    # Assuming the end user chose this one
    chosen = accounts[0]
    # Now let's try to find a token in cache for this account
    result = app.acquire_token_silent(config["scope"], account=chosen)

if not result:
    logging.info("No suitable token exists in cache. Let's get a new one from Azure AD.")

    flow = app.initiate_device_flow(scopes=config["scope"])
    if "user_code" not in flow:
        raise ValueError(
            "Fail to create device flow. Err: %s" % json.dumps(flow, indent=4))

    print(flow["message"])
    sys.stdout.flush()  # Some terminal needs this to ensure the message is shown

    # Ideally you should wait here, in order to save some unnecessary polling
    # input("Press Enter after signing in from another device to proceed, CTRL+C to abort.")

    result = app.acquire_token_by_device_flow(flow)  # By default it will block
        # You can follow this instruction to shorten the block time
        #    https://msal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#msal.PublicClientApplication.acquire_token_by_device_flow
        # or you may even turn off the blocking behavior,
        # and then keep calling acquire_token_by_device_flow(flow) in your own customized loop
