# Instantiate a public client application with configuration options using MSAL.NET

This article describes how to instantiate a [public client application](msal-client-applications.md) using Microsoft Authentication Library for .NET (MSAL.NET).  The application is instantiated with configuration options defined in a settings file.

Before initializing an application, you first need to [register](quickstart-register-app.md) it so that your app can be integrated with the Microsoft identity platform. After registration, you may need the following information (which can be found in the Azure portal):

- The client ID (a string representing a GUID)
- The identity provider URL (named the instance) and the sign-in audience for your application. These two parameters are collectively known as the authority.
- The tenant ID if you are writing a line of business application solely for your organization (also named single-tenant application).
- For web apps, and sometimes for public client apps (in particular when your app needs to use a broker), you'll have also set the redirectUri where the identity provider will contact back your application with the security tokens.


A .NET Core console application could have the following *appsettings.json* configuration file:

```json
{
  "Authentication": {
    "AzureCloudInstance": "AzurePublic",
    "AadAuthorityAudience": "AzureAdMultipleOrgs",
    "ClientId": "ebe2ab4d-12b3-4446-8480-5c3828d04c50"
  },

  "WebAPI": {
    "MicrosoftGraphBaseEndpoint": "https://graph.microsoft.com"
  }
}
```

The following code reads this file using the .NET configuration framework:

```csharp
public class SampleConfiguration
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Authentication options
    /// </summary>
    public PublicClientApplicationOptions PublicClientApplicationOptions { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Base URL for Microsoft Graph (it varies depending on whether the application is ran
    /// in Microsoft Azure public clouds or national / sovereign clouds
    /// </summary>
    public string MicrosoftGraphBaseEndpoint { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Reads the configuration from a json file
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="path">Path to the configuration json file</param>
    /// <returns>SampleConfiguration as read from the json file</returns>
    public static SampleConfiguration ReadFromJsonFile(string path)
    {
        // .NET configuration
        IConfigurationRoot Configuration;
        var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
          .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
        .AddJsonFile(path);
        Configuration = builder.Build();

        // Read the auth and graph endpoint config
        SampleConfiguration config = new SampleConfiguration()
        {
            PublicClientApplicationOptions = new PublicClientApplicationOptions()
        };
        Configuration.Bind("Authentication", config.PublicClientApplicationOptions);
        config.MicrosoftGraphBaseEndpoint = Configuration.GetValue<string>("WebAPI:MicrosoftGraphBaseEndpoint");
        return config;
    }
}
```

The following code creates your application, using the configuration from the settings file:

```csharp
SampleConfiguration config = SampleConfiguration.ReadFromJsonFile("appsettings.json");
var app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.CreateWithApplicationOptions(config.PublicClientApplicationOptions)
           .Build();
```
