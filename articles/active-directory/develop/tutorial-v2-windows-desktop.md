# Tutorial: Sign in users and call Microsoft Graph in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) desktop app

In this tutorial, you'll build a native Windows Desktop .NET (XAML) app that signs in users and gets an access token to call the Microsoft Graph API.

When you've completed the guide, your application will able to call a protected API that uses personal accounts (including outlook.com, live.com, and others). The application will also use work and school accounts from any company or organization that uses Microsoft Entra ID.

In this tutorial:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Create a _Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)_ project in Visual Studio
> - Install the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for .NET
> - Register the application
> - Add code to support user sign-in and sign-out
> - Add code to call Microsoft Graph API
> - Test the app

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

## How the sample app generated by this guide works

![Screenshot of how the sample app generated by this tutorial works.](./media/guidedsetup-windesktop-intro/win-desktop-how-it-works.svg)

The sample application that you create with this guide enables a Windows Desktop application that queries the Microsoft Graph API or a web API that accepts tokens from a Microsoft identity platform endpoint. For this scenario, you add a token to HTTP requests via the Authorization header. The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) handles token acquisition and renewal.

## Handling token acquisition for accessing protected web APIs

After the user is authenticated, the sample application receives a token you can use to query Microsoft Graph API or a web API that's secured by the Microsoft identity platform.

APIs such as Microsoft Graph require a token to allow access to specific resources. For example, a token is required to read a user's profile, access a user's calendar, or send email. Your application can request an access token by using MSAL to access these resources by specifying API scopes. This access token is then added to the HTTP Authorization header for every call that's made against the protected resource.

MSAL manages caching and refreshing access tokens for you, so that your application doesn't need to.

## NuGet packages

This guide uses the following NuGet packages:

| Library | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [Microsoft.Identity.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Client) | Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL.NET) |

## Set up your project

In this section you'll create a new project to demonstrate how to integrate a Windows Desktop .NET application (XAML) with _Sign-In with Microsoft_ so that the application can query web APIs that require a token.

The application that you'll create displays a button that'll call the Microsoft Graph API, an area to display the results, and a sign-out button.

> [!NOTE]
> Prefer to download this sample's Visual Studio project instead? [Download a project](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-desktop-msgraph-v2/archive/msal3x.zip), and skip to the [Configuration step](#register-your-application) to configure the code sample before you execute it.

Create the application using the following steps:

1. Open Visual Studio
1. On the start window, select **Create a new project**.
1. In the **All language** dropdown, select **C#**.
1. Search for and choose the **WPF App (.NET Framework)** template, and then select Next.
1. In the **Project name** box, enter a name like _Win-App-calling-MsGraph_.
1. Choose a **Location** for the project or accept the default option.
1. In the **Framework**, select **.NET framework 4.8**.
1. Select **Create**.

## Add MSAL to your project

1. In Visual Studio, select **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager**> **Package Manager Console**.
2. In the Package Manager Console window, paste the following Azure PowerShell command:

   ```powershell
   Install-Package Microsoft.Identity.Client -Pre
   ```

## Register your application

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/articles/active-directory/includes/portal-update.md)]

To register and configure your application, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Application Developer](../roles/permissions-reference.md#application-developer).
1. If access to multiple tenants is available, use the **Directories + subscriptions** filter :::image type="icon" source="media/common/portal-directory-subscription-filter.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which you want to register the application.
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your application, for example `Win-App-calling-MsGraph`. Users of your app might see this name, and you can change it later.
1. In the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)**.
1. Select **Register**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Authentication** > **Add a platform**.
1. Select **Mobile and desktop applications**.
1. In the **Redirect URIs** section, select **https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient**.
1. Select **Configure**.

## Add the code to initialize MSAL

In this step, you create a class to handle interaction with MSAL, such as handling of tokens.

1. Open the _App.xaml.cs_ file, and then add the reference for MSAL to the class:

   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
   ```

   <!-- Workaround for Docs conversion bug -->

2. Update the app class to the following:

   ```csharp
   public partial class App : Application
   {
       static App()
       {
           _clientApp = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(ClientId)
               .WithAuthority(AzureCloudInstance.AzurePublic, Tenant)
               .WithDefaultRedirectUri()
               .Build();
       }

       // Below are the clientId (Application Id) of your app registration and the tenant information.
       // You have to replace:
       // - the content of ClientID with the Application Id for your app registration
       // - the content of Tenant by the information about the accounts allowed to sign-in in your application:
       //   - For Work or School account in your org, use your tenant ID, or domain
       //   - for any Work or School accounts, use `organizations`
       //   - for any Work or School accounts, or Microsoft personal account, use `common`
       //   - for Microsoft Personal account, use consumers
       private static string ClientId = "Enter_the_Application_Id_here";

       private static string Tenant = "common";

       private static IPublicClientApplication _clientApp ;

       public static IPublicClientApplication PublicClientApp { get { return _clientApp; } }
   }
   ```

## Create the application UI

This section shows how an application can query a protected back-end server such as Microsoft Graph.

A _MainWindow.xaml_ file is automatically be created as a part of your project template. Open this file, and then replace your application's _\<Grid>_ node with the following code:

```xml
<Grid>
    <StackPanel Background="Azure">
        <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal" HorizontalAlignment="Right">
            <Button x:Name="CallGraphButton" Content="Call Microsoft Graph API" HorizontalAlignment="Right" Padding="5" Click="CallGraphButton_Click" Margin="5" FontFamily="Segoe Ui"/>
            <Button x:Name="SignOutButton" Content="Sign-Out" HorizontalAlignment="Right" Padding="5" Click="SignOutButton_Click" Margin="5" Visibility="Collapsed" FontFamily="Segoe Ui"/>
        </StackPanel>
        <Label Content="API Call Results" Margin="0,0,0,-5" FontFamily="Segoe Ui" />
        <TextBox x:Name="ResultText" TextWrapping="Wrap" MinHeight="120" Margin="5" FontFamily="Segoe Ui"/>
        <Label Content="Token Info" Margin="0,0,0,-5" FontFamily="Segoe Ui" />
        <TextBox x:Name="TokenInfoText" TextWrapping="Wrap" MinHeight="70" Margin="5" FontFamily="Segoe Ui"/>
    </StackPanel>
</Grid>
```

## Use MSAL to get a token for the Microsoft Graph API

In this section, you use MSAL to get a token for the Microsoft Graph API.

1. In the _MainWindow.xaml.cs_ file, add the reference for MSAL to the class:

   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
   ```

2. Replace the `MainWindow` class code with the following code:

   ```csharp
   public partial class MainWindow : Window
   {
       //Set the API Endpoint to Graph 'me' endpoint
       string graphAPIEndpoint = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me";

       //Set the scope for API call to user.read
       string[] scopes = new string[] { "user.read" };


       public MainWindow()
       {
           InitializeComponent();
       }

     /// <summary>
       /// Call AcquireToken - to acquire a token requiring user to sign-in
       /// </summary>
       private async void CallGraphButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
       {
           AuthenticationResult authResult = null;
           var app = App.PublicClientApp;
           ResultText.Text = string.Empty;
           TokenInfoText.Text = string.Empty;

           var accounts = await app.GetAccountsAsync();
           var firstAccount = accounts.FirstOrDefault();

           try
           {
               authResult = await app.AcquireTokenSilent(scopes, firstAccount)
                   .ExecuteAsync();
           }
           catch (MsalUiRequiredException ex)
           {
               // A MsalUiRequiredException happened on AcquireTokenSilent.
               // This indicates you need to call AcquireTokenInteractive to acquire a token
               System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"MsalUiRequiredException: {ex.Message}");

               try
               {
                   authResult = await app.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes)
                       .WithAccount(accounts.FirstOrDefault())
                       .WithPrompt(Prompt.SelectAccount)
                       .ExecuteAsync();
               }
               catch (MsalException msalex)
               {
                   ResultText.Text = $"Error Acquiring Token:{System.Environment.NewLine}{msalex}";
               }
           }
           catch (Exception ex)
           {
               ResultText.Text = $"Error Acquiring Token Silently:{System.Environment.NewLine}{ex}";
               return;
           }

           if (authResult != null)
           {
               ResultText.Text = await GetHttpContentWithToken(graphAPIEndpoint, authResult.AccessToken);
               DisplayBasicTokenInfo(authResult);
               this.SignOutButton.Visibility = Visibility.Visible;
           }
       }
       }
   ```

### More information

#### Get a user token interactively

Calling the `AcquireTokenInteractive` method results in a window that prompts users to sign in. Applications usually require users to sign in interactively the first time they need to access a protected resource. They might also need to sign in when a silent operation to acquire a token fails (for example, when a user's password is expired).

#### Get a user token silently

The `AcquireTokenSilent` method handles token acquisitions and renewals without any user interaction. After `AcquireTokenInteractive` is executed for the first time, `AcquireTokenSilent` is the usual method to use to obtain tokens that access protected resources for subsequent calls, because calls to request or renew tokens are made silently.

Eventually, the `AcquireTokenSilent` method may fail. Reasons for failure might be that the user has either signed out or changed their password on another device. When MSAL detects that the issue can be resolved by requiring an interactive action, it fires an `MsalUiRequiredException` exception. Your application can handle this exception in two ways:

- It can make a call against `AcquireTokenInteractive` immediately. This call results in prompting the user to sign in. This pattern is used in online applications where there's no available offline content for the user. The sample generated by this setup follows this pattern, which can be seen in action the first time you execute the sample.

- Because no user has used the application, `PublicClientApp.Users.FirstOrDefault()` contains a null value, and an `MsalUiRequiredException` exception is thrown.

- The code in the sample then handles the exception by calling `AcquireTokenInteractive`, which results in prompting the user to sign in.

- It can instead present a visual indication to users that an interactive sign-in is required, so that they can select the right time to sign in. Or the application can retry `AcquireTokenSilent` later. This pattern is frequently used when users can use other application functionality without disruption. For example, when offline content is available in the application. In this case, users can decide when they want to sign in to either access the protected resource or refresh the outdated information. Alternatively, the application can decide to retry `AcquireTokenSilent` when the network is restored after having been temporarily unavailable.

## Call the Microsoft Graph API by using the token you just obtained

Add the following new method to your `MainWindow.xaml.cs`. The method is used to make a `GET` request against Graph API by using an Authorize header:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Perform an HTTP GET request to a URL using an HTTP Authorization header
/// </summary>
/// <param name="url">The URL</param>
/// <param name="token">The token</param>
/// <returns>String containing the results of the GET operation</returns>
public async Task<string> GetHttpContentWithToken(string url, string token)
{
    var httpClient = new System.Net.Http.HttpClient();
    System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage response;
    try
    {
        var request = new System.Net.Http.HttpRequestMessage(System.Net.Http.HttpMethod.Get, url);
        //Add the token in Authorization header
        request.Headers.Authorization = new System.Net.Http.Headers.AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token);
        response = await httpClient.SendAsync(request);
        var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        return content;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        return ex.ToString();
    }
}
```

### More information about making a REST call against a protected API

In this sample application, you use the `GetHttpContentWithToken` method to make an HTTP `GET` request against a protected resource that requires a token and then return the content to the caller. This method adds the acquired token in the HTTP Authorization header. For this sample, the resource is the Microsoft Graph API _me_ endpoint, which displays the user's profile information.

## Add a method to sign out a user

To sign out a user, add the following method to your `MainWindow.xaml.cs` file:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Sign out the current user
/// </summary>
private async void SignOutButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    var accounts = await App.PublicClientApp.GetAccountsAsync();

    if (accounts.Any())
    {
        try
        {
            await App.PublicClientApp.RemoveAsync(accounts.FirstOrDefault());
            this.ResultText.Text = "User has signed-out";
            this.CallGraphButton.Visibility = Visibility.Visible;
            this.SignOutButton.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed;
        }
        catch (MsalException ex)
        {
            ResultText.Text = $"Error signing-out user: {ex.Message}";
        }
    }
}
```

### More information about user sign-out

The `SignOutButton_Click` method removes users from the MSAL user cache, which effectively tells MSAL to forget the current user so that a future request to acquire a token succeeds only if it's made to be interactive.

Although the application in this sample supports single users, MSAL supports scenarios where multiple accounts can be signed in at the same time. An example is an email application where a user has multiple accounts.

## Display basic token information

To display basic information about the token, add the following method to your _MainWindow.xaml.cs_ file:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Display basic information contained in the token
/// </summary>
private void DisplayBasicTokenInfo(AuthenticationResult authResult)
{
    TokenInfoText.Text = "";
    if (authResult != null)
    {
        TokenInfoText.Text += $"Username: {authResult.Account.Username}" + Environment.NewLine;
        TokenInfoText.Text += $"Token Expires: {authResult.ExpiresOn.ToLocalTime()}" + Environment.NewLine;
    }
}
```

### More information

In addition to the access token that's used to call the Microsoft Graph API, after the user signs in, MSAL also obtains an ID token. This token contains a small subset of information that's pertinent to users. The `DisplayBasicTokenInfo` method displays the basic information that's contained in the token. For example, it displays the user's display name and ID, as well as the token expiration date and the string representing the access token itself. You can select the _Call Microsoft Graph API_ button multiple times and see that the same token was reused for subsequent requests. You can also see the expiration date being extended when MSAL decides it's time to renew the token.
