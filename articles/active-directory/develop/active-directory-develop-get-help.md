# Support and help options for developers 

If you need help or support for development-related questions, use one of the options below:

## 1. Search

If you have a development related question, you may be able to find the answer you need on our documentation, our [github samples](https://github.com/azure-samples), or [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).

Type your problem or scenario on the following search box for a scoped search on Stack Overflow, our docs.microsoft.com, and code samples:
<br/><br/>
<div>
<form method="get" class="clearFilter" action="http://www.bing.com/search" target="_blank">
<input aria-label="Bing scoped search" type="search" placeholder="Bing scoped search" name="q" size="45">
<a title="Clear Filter" class="clearInput" href="#"><span class="visually-hidden">Clear Filter</span></a>
<input type="submit" value="Search" />
<input type="hidden" name="q1" value="(site:stackoverflow.com OR site:docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop OR site:github.com/azure-samples OR site:cloudidentity.com)" /></td></tr>
</form>
</div>

## 2. Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow is the preferred channel for development related questions - where both members of community as well as our team at Microsoft are directly involved on helping you to solve your problem.

If you cannot find an answer with Search, submit a new question on Stack Overflow: use one of the following tags when making questions to help the community answer your question on a timely manner:

|Component/Area  |Tags  |

|[Azure B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory-b2c/)  |[[azure-ad-b2c]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-ad-b2b)|
