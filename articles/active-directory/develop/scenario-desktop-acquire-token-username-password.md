# Desktop app that calls web APIs: Acquire a token using Username and Password

You can also acquire a token by providing the username and password. This flow is limited and not recommended, but there are still use cases where it's necessary.

## This flow isn't recommended

The username and password flow is *not recommended* because having your application ask a user for their password isn't secure. For more information, see [What's the solution to the growing problem of passwords?](https://news.microsoft.com/features/whats-solution-growing-problem-passwords-says-microsoft/) The preferred flow for acquiring a token silently on Windows domain joined machines is [integrated Windows authentication](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Integrated-Windows-Authentication). You can also use [device code flow](https://aka.ms/msal-net-device-code-flow).

Using a username and password is useful in some cases, such as DevOps scenarios. But if you want to use a username and password in interactive scenarios where you provide your own UI, think about how to move away from it. By using a username and password, you're giving up a number of things:

- Core tenets of modern identity. A password can get phished and replayed because a shared secret can be intercepted. It's incompatible with passwordless.
- Users who need to do MFA can't sign in because there's no interaction.
- Users can't do single sign-on (SSO).

## Constraints

The following constraints also apply:

- The username and password flow isn't compatible with Conditional Access and multi-factor authentication. As a consequence, if your app runs in a Microsoft Entra tenant where the tenant admin requires multi-factor authentication, you can't use this flow. Many organizations do that.
- It works only for work and school accounts (not MSA).
- The flow is available on .NET desktop and .NET Core, but not on UWP.

## B2C specifics

For more information, see [Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) with B2C](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/wiki/AAD-B2C-specifics#resource-owner-password-credentials-ropc-with-b2c).

## Use it

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

`IPublicClientApplication`contains the method `AcquireTokenByUsernamePassword`.

The following sample presents a simplified case.

```csharp
static async Task GetATokenForGraph()
{
 string authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.com";
 string[] scopes = new string[] { "user.read" };
 IPublicClientApplication app;
 app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
       .WithAuthority(authority)
       .Build();
 var accounts = await app.GetAccountsAsync();

 AuthenticationResult result = null;
 if (accounts.Any())
 {
  result = await app.AcquireTokenSilent(scopes, accounts.FirstOrDefault())
                    .ExecuteAsync();
 }
 else
 {
  try
  {
   var securePassword = new SecureString();
   foreach (char c in "dummy")        // you should fetch the password
    securePassword.AppendChar(c);  // keystroke by keystroke

   result = await app.AcquireTokenByUsernamePassword(scopes,
                                                    "joe@contoso.com",
                                                     securePassword)
                      .ExecuteAsync();
  }
  catch(MsalException)
  {
   // See details below
  }
 }
 Console.WriteLine(result.Account.Username);
}
```

The following sample presents the most current case, with explanations of the kind of exceptions you can get and their mitigations.

```csharp
static async Task GetATokenForGraph()
{
 string authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.com";
 string[] scopes = new string[] { "user.read" };
 IPublicClientApplication app;
 app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
                                   .WithAuthority(authority)
                                   .Build();
 var accounts = await app.GetAccountsAsync();

 AuthenticationResult result = null;
 if (accounts.Any())
 {
  result = await app.AcquireTokenSilent(scopes, accounts.FirstOrDefault())
                    .ExecuteAsync();
 }
 else
 {
  try
  {
   var securePassword = new SecureString();
   foreach (char c in "dummy")        // you should fetch the password keystroke
    securePassword.AppendChar(c);  // by keystroke

   result = await app.AcquireTokenByUsernamePassword(scopes,
                                                    "joe@contoso.com",
                                                    securePassword)
                    .ExecuteAsync();
  }
  catch (MsalUiRequiredException ex) when (ex.Message.Contains("AADSTS65001"))

   /// or dynamically (but this requires an interaction with Azure AD, which is not possible with
   // the username/password flow)
   // Statically: in the portal by doing the following in the "API permissions" tab of the application registration:
   // 1. Click "Add a permission" and add all the delegated permissions corresponding to the scopes you want (for instance

   // 2. Click "Grant/revoke admin consent for <tenant>") and click "yes".
   // Dynamically, if you are not using .NET Core (which does not have any Web UI) by
   // calling (once only) AcquireTokenInteractive.

   // If you are using .NET core or don't want to call AcquireTokenInteractive, you might want to:

This flow isn't supported on MSAL for macOS.

# [Node.js](#tab/nodejs)

This extract is from the [MSAL Node dev samples](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/samples/msal-node-samples/username-password). In the code snippet below, the username and password are hardcoded for illustration purposes only. This should be avoided in production. Instead, a basic UI prompting the user to enter her username/password would be recommended.

```javascript
const msal = require("@azure/msal-node");

const msalConfig = {
    auth: {
        clientId: "your_client_id_here",
        authority: "your_authority_here",
    }
};

const pca = new msal.PublicClientApplication(msalConfig);

// For testing, enter your username and password below.
// In production, replace this with a UI prompt instead.
const usernamePasswordRequest = {
    scopes: ["user.read"],
    username: "", // Add your username here
    password: "", // Add your password here
};

pca.acquireTokenByUsernamePassword(usernamePasswordRequest).then((response) => {
    console.log("acquired token by password grant");
}).catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
});
```

# Create a preferably long-lived app instance which maintains a token cache.

    )

# The pattern to acquire a token looks like this.
result = None

# Firstly, check the cache to see if this end user has signed in before
