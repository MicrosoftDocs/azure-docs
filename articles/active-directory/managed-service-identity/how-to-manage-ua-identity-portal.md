# Create, list and delete a user assigned Managed Service Identity (MSI) using the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE[preview-notice](~/includes/active-directory-msi-preview-notice-ua.md)]

Managed Service Identity provides Azure services with a managed identity in Azure Active Directory. You can use this identity to authenticate to services that support Azure AD authentication, without needing credentials in your code. 

At this time, it is not possible to create, list, or delete a user assigned MSI using the Azure portal.  When these operations are available via the Azure portal, this article will be updated accordingly.
