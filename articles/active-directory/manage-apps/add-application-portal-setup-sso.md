# Quickstart: Set up Single Sign-On (SSO) for an application in your Azure AD tenant

Get started with simplified user logins by setting up SSO for an application you have added to your Azure AD tenant. After setting up SSO your users will be able to sign into an application using their Azure AD credentials. SSO is included in the free edition of Azure AD. 

## Prerequisites

To set up SSO for an application you have added to your tenant, you need:

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An application that supports SSO
- (Optional: Completion of [View your apps](view-applications-portal.md))
- (Optional: Completion of [Add an app](add-application-portal.md))
- (Optional: Completion of [Configure an app](add-application-portal-configure.md))


>[!IMPORTANT]
>We recommend using a non-production environment to test the steps in this quickstart.
