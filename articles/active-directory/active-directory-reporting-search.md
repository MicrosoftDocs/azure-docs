# Azure Active Directory Reporting Search

Azure Active Directory provides directory admins the ability to search for user security, activity, and audit events across multiple reports.

To find the search panel, navigate to the Azure Management Portal -> Your Azure Active Directory -> Reports. The panel can be found at the top of the list of reports.

To search for activity or audit events for a certain user, select a date range in the From and To fields, type in the user's UPN or Display name, and click the checkmark button.
