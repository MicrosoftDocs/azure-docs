# How to review your access

Azure Active Directory simplifies how enterprises manage access to applications and members of groups in Azure AD and other Microsoft Online Services, with a feature called access reviews.  You may have received an email from Microsoft asking you to review access - members of a group, or users with access to an application. 

## Opening an access review

You can see the pending access reviews by clicking on the link in the email.  If you do not have the email, then you can locate the access reviews by performing the following actions:

1. Sign into the [Azure AD access panel](https://myapps.microsoft.com).
2. Click on the user icon in the upper-right corner of the page, which displays your name and default organization. If there is more than one organization listed, select the organization that has requested an access review.
3. If there is a tile labeled **Access reviews** on the right side of the page, click it. Otherwise, if the tile is not visible, then there are no access reviews to perform for that organization, and no action is needed at this time.

## Filling out an access review

Select an access review from the list, and you see your access.  You can click on the row and choose whether to approve or deny your need for continued access.

The reviewer may require that you supply a justification for approving continued access.

## Next steps

Note that denied access is not removed immediately, so if you wish to change your answer and approve, then reset the response, and pick a new response.  You can do this until the access review completes.
