# Tutorial: Configuring LucidChart for Automatic User Provisioning


The objective of this tutorial is to show you the steps you need to perform in LucidChart and Azure AD to automatically provision and de-provision user accounts from Azure AD to LucidChart. 

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following items:

*   An Azure Active Active directory tenant
*   A LucidChart tenant with the [Payment Account](https://www.lucidchart.com/user/117598685#/subscriptionLevel) or better enabled 
*   A user account in LucidChart with Admin permissions 

## Assigning users to LucidChart

Azure Active Directory uses a concept called "assignments" to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user account provisioning, only the users and groups that have been "assigned" to an application in Azure AD will be synchronized. 

Before configuring and enabling the provisioning service, you will need to decide what users and/or groups in Azure AD represent the users who need access to your LucidChart app. Once decided, you can assign these users to your LucidChart app by following the instructions here:

[Assign a user or group to an enterprise app](active-directory-coreapps-assign-user-azure-portal.md)

### Important tips for assigning users to LucidChart

*	It is recommended that a single Azure AD user be assigned to LucidChart to test the provisioning configuration. Additional users and/or groups may be assigned later.

*	When assigning a user to LucidChart, you must select the **User** or "Group" role in the assignment dialog. The "Default Access" role does not work for provisioning.


## Configuring user provisioning to LucidChart 

This section guides you through connecting your Azure AD to LucidChart's user account provisioning API, and configuring the provisioning service to create, update and disable assigned user accounts in LucidChart based on user and group assignment in Azure AD.

**Tip:** You may also choose to enabled SAML-based Single Sign-On for LucidChart, following the instructions provided in (Azure portal)[https://portal.azure.com]. Single sign-on can be configured independently of automatic provisioning, though these two features compliment each other.


### To configure automatic user account provisioning to LucidChart in Azure AD:


1)	In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), browse to the **Azure Active Directory > Enterprise Apps > All applications**  section.

2) If you have already configured LucidChart for single sign-on, search for your instance of LucidChart using the search field. Otherwise, select **Add** and search for **LucidChart** in the application gallery. Select LucidChart from the search results, and add it to your list of applications.

3)	Select your instance of LucidChart, then select the **Provisioning** tab.

4)	Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

5)	Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input the **Secret Token** generated by your LucidChart's account. 

6) In the Azure portal, click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to your LucidChart app. If the connection fails, ensure your LucidChart account has Team Admin permissions and try step 5 again.

7) Enter the email address of a person or group who should receive provisioning error notifications in the **Notification Email** field, and check the checkbox below.

8) Click **Save**. 

9) Under the Mappings section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to LucidChart**.

10) In the **Attribute Mappings** section, review the user attributes that will be synchronized from Azure AD to LucidChart. Note that the attributes selected as **Matching** properties will be used to match the user accounts in LucidChart for update operations. Select the Save button to commit any changes.

11) To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for LucidChart, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section

12) Click **Save**. 

This will start the initial synchronization of any users and/or groups assigned to LucidChart in the Users and Groups section. Note that the initial sync will take longer to perform than subsequent syncs, which occur approximately every 10 minutes as long as the service is running. You can use the **Synchronization Details** section to monitor progress and follow links to provisioning activity reports, which describe all actions performed by the provisioning service.
