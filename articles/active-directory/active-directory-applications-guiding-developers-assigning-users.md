# Azure AD and Applications: Assigning Users to an Application
Delete me. Before you can assign users and groups to an application, you must require user assignment.  To learn how to require user assignment please see the [Requring User Assignment](active-directory-applications-guiding-developers-requiring-user-assignment.md) article.

## Assigning Users to an Application
1. Log in to the Azure portal with an administrator account.
2. Click on the **All Items** item in the main menu.
3. Choose the directory you are using for the application.
4. Click on the **APPLICATIONS** tab.
5. Select the application from the list of applications associated with this directory.
6. Click the **USERS AND GROUPS** tab.
8. Select the users you want to assign to the application.
9. Click **ASSIGN**.
10. Click **yes** when prompted.
