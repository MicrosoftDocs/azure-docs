# Tutorial: Configuring ThousandEyes for Automatic User Provisioning


The objective of this tutorial is to show you the steps you need to perform in ThousandEyes and Azure AD to automatically provision and de-provision user accounts from Azure AD to ThousandEyes. 

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following items:

*   An Azure Active Active directory tenant
*   A ThousandEyes tenant with the [Standard plan](https://www.thousandeyes.com/pricing) or better enabled 
*   A user account in ThousandEyes with Team Admin permissions 

Note: The Azure AD provisioning integration relies on the [ThousandEyes SCIM API](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA044000000CnWrCAK) which is available to ThousandEyes teams on the Standard plan or better.

## Assigning users to ThousandEyes

Azure Active Directory uses a concept called "assignments" to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user account provisioning, only the users and groups that have been "assigned" to an application in Azure AD will be synchronized. 

Before configuring and enabling the provisioning service, you will need to decide what users and/or groups in Azure AD represent the users who need access to your ThousandEyes app. Once decided, you can assign these users to your ThousandEyes app by following the instructions here:

[Assign a user or group to an enterprise app](active-directory-coreapps-assign-user-azure-portal.md)

### Important tips for assigning users to ThousandEyes

*	It is recommended that a single Azure AD user be assigned to ThousandEyes to test the provisioning configuration. Additional users and/or groups may be assigned later.

*	When assigning a user to ThousandEyes, you must select the **User** or "Group" role in the assignment dialog. The "Default Access" role does not work for provisioning.


## Configuring user provisioning to ThousandEyes 

This section guides you through connecting your Azure AD to ThousandEyes's user account provisioning API, and configuring the provisioning service to create, update and disable assigned user accounts in ThousandEyes based on user and group assignment in Azure AD.

**Tip:** You may also choose to enabled SAML-based Single Sign-On for ThousandEyes, following the instructions provided in (Azure portal)[https://portal.azure.com]. Single sign-on can be configured independently of automatic provisioning, though these two features compliment each other.


### To configure automatic user account provisioning to ThousandEyes in Azure AD:


1)	In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), browse to the **Azure Active Directory > Enterprise Apps > All applications**  section.

2) If you have already configured ThousandEyes for single sign-on, search for your instance of ThousandEyes using the search field. Otherwise, select **Add** and search for **ThousandEyes** in the application gallery. Select ThousandEyes from the search results, and add it to your list of applications.

3)	Select your instance of ThousandEyes, then select the **Provisioning** tab.

4)	Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

5)	Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input the **Secret Token** generated by your ThousandEyes's account. 

6) In the Azure portal, click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to your ThousandEyes app. If the connection fails, ensure your ThousandEyes account has Team Admin permissions and try step 5 again.

7) Enter the email address of a person or group who should receive provisioning error notifications in the **Notification Email** field, and check the checkbox below.

8) Click **Save**. 

9) Under the Mappings section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to ThousandEyes**.

10) In the **Attribute Mappings** section, review the user attributes that will be synchronized from Azure AD to ThousandEyes. Note that the attributes selected as **Matching** properties will be used to match the user accounts in ThousandEyes for update operations. Select the Save button to commit any changes.

11) To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for ThousandEyes, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section

12) Click **Save**. 

This will start the initial synchronization of any users and/or groups assigned to ThousandEyes in the Users and Groups section. Note that the initial sync will take longer to perform than subsequent syncs, which occur approximately every 10 minutes as long as the service is running. You can use the **Synchronization Details** section to monitor progress and follow links to provisioning activity reports, which describe all actions performed by the provisioning service.
