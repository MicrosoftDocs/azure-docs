## Partner-driven application integrations

Microsoft Entra ID Governance allows you to balance your organization's need for security and employee productivity with the right processes and visibility, across hundreds of [Microsoft Entra ID Governance integrations with applications](apps.md). These application integrations are used to automate identity lifecycle management, through protocols such as SCIM, to implement governance controls across your organization.

In cases where an application doesn't support SCIM, partners have built gateways between the Microsoft Entra SCIM client and additional applications.  For a list of applications integrated through a partner offering, see [partner-driven integrations](../app-provisioning/partner-driven-integrations.md).
