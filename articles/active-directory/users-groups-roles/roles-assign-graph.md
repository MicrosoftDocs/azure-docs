# Assign custom admin roles using the Microsoft Graph API in Azure Active Directory 

You can automate how you assign roles to user accounts using the Microsoft Graph API. This article covers POST, GET, and DELETE operations on roleAssignments.

## Required permissions

Connect to your Azure AD organization using a Global administrator account or Privileged Identity administrator to assign or remove roles.

## POST Operations on RoleAssignment

HTTP request to create a role assignment between a user and a role definition.

POST

``` HTTP
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/roleManagement/directory/roleAssignments
Content-type: application/json
```

Body

``` HTTP
{
    "principalId":"ab2e1023-bddc-4038-9ac1-ad4843e7e539",
    "roleDefinitionId":"194ae4cb-b126-40b2-bd5b-6091b380977d",
    "resourceScopes":"/"
}
```

Response

``` HTTP
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```

HTTP request to create a role assignment where the principal or role definition does not exist

POST

``` HTTP
https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/roleManagement/directory/roleAssignments
```

Body

``` HTTP
{
    "principalId":" 2142743c-a5b3-4983-8486-4532ccba12869",
    "roleDefinitionId":"194ae4cb-b126-40b2-bd5b-6091b380977d",
    "resourceScopes":"/"
}
```

Response

``` HTTP
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

HTTP request to create a single resource scoped role assignment on a built-in role definition.

> [!NOTE] 
> Built-in roles today have a limitation where they can be scoped only to the “/” organization-wide scope or the “/AU/*” scope. Single resource scoping does not work for built-in roles, but works for custom roles.

POST

``` HTTP
https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/roleManagement/directory/roleAssignments
```

Body

``` HTTP
{
    "principalId":"ab2e1023-bddc-4038-9ac1-ad4843e7e539",

    "resourceScopes":"/ab2e1023-bddc-4038-9ac1-ad4843e7e539"
}
