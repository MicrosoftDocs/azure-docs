# View all the enterprise apps that I can manage in Azure Active Directory

You can manage your enterprise applications in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This includes viewing the apps you can manage, assigning users or groups to an app, maintaining properties for the app such as the application name/logo, and even disabling an application so that no users can sign in to it.

## How do I view all of my apps?

1.  Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that's a global admin for the directory.

2.  Select **More services**, enter Active Directory in the text box, and then select **Enter**.

3. On the **Azure Active Directory - *directoryname*** blade (that is, the Azure AD blade for the directory you are managing), select **Enterprise apps**.

4. On the **Enterprise applications** blade, select **All applications**. From this blade you can select apps to manage, change the displayed columns, or filter the list to find that app you want (for example, to view only disabled apps).
