# Microsoft Entra ID for customers frequently asked questions

This article answers frequently asked questions about Microsoft Entra ID for customers. This document offers guidance to help customers better understand Microsoft’s current external identities capabilities and the journey for our next generation platform (Microsoft Entra External ID).

This FAQ references customer identity and access management (CIAM). CIAM is an industry recognized category that covers solutions that manage identity, authentication, and authorization for external identity use cases (partners, customers, and citizens). Common functionality includes self-service capabilities, adaptive access, single sign-on (SSO), and bring your own identity (BYOI).

## Frequently asked questions

### What is Microsoft Entra External ID?

Microsoft Entra External ID is our next generation CIAM platform that represents an evolutionary step in unifying secure and engaging experiences across all external identities including customers, partners, citizens, and others, within a single, integrated platform.

### Is Microsoft Entra External ID a new name for Azure AD B2C?

No, this isn't a new name for Azure AD B2C. Microsoft Entra External ID builds on the success of our existing Azure AD B2C technologies but represents our future for CIAM. The new platform serves as the foundation for rapid innovation, features, and capabilities that address use cases across all external users.  

### What is the release date for Microsoft Entra External ID?  

Microsoft Entra External ID (for customers) entered preview at Microsoft Build 2023. The existing B2B collaboration feature remains unchanged.

### What is the pricing for Microsoft Entra External ID?

Microsoft Entra External ID (for customers) is in preview, so no pricing details are available at this time. The pricing for existing B2B collaboration features is unchanged.

### How does Microsoft Entra External ID affect B2B collaboration?

There are no changes to the existing B2B collaboration features or related pricing. Upon general availability, Microsoft Entra External ID will address use cases across all external user identities, including partners, customers, citizens, and others.

### How long will you support the current Azure AD B2C platform?

We remain fully committed to support of the current Azure AD B2C product. The SLA remains unchanged, and we’ll continue investments in the product to ensure security, availability, and reliability. For existing Azure AD B2C customers that have an interest in moving to the next generation platform, more details will be made available after general availability.

### I have many investments tied up in Azure AD B2C, both in code artifacts and CI/CD pipelines. Do I need to plan for a migration or some other effort?

We recognize the large investments in building and managing custom policies. We’ve listened to many customers who, like you, have shared that custom policies are too hard to build and manage. Our next generation platform will resolve the need for intricate custom policies. In addition to many other platform and feature improvements, you’ll have equivalent functionality in the new platform but a much easier way to build and manage it. We expect to share migration options closer to general availability of the next generation platform.  

### I’ve heard I can preview the Microsoft Entra External ID platform. Where can I learn more?

You can learn more about the preview and the features we're delivering on the new platform by visiting the Microsoft Entra ID for customers [developer center](https://aka.ms/ciam/dev).

### Why is Azure AD B2C not part of Microsoft Entra External ID?

Microsoft Entra External ID and Azure AD B2C are two separate platforms powered by ESTS and IEF respectively. Microsoft Entra External ID is our new converged platform which is future proof and developer friendly to meet all your identity needs – B2E, B2B and B2C. At the same time, we will still continue to support Azure AD B2C as a separate product offering with no change in SLA, and we’ll continue investments in the product to ensure security, availability, and reliability.
