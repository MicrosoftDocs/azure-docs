# Configure Azure Active Directory to meet CMMC Level 2

Azure Active Directory helps meet identity-related practice requirements in each Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) level. To be compliant with requirements in [CMMC V2.0 level 2](https://cmmc-coe.org/maturity-level-two/), it's the responsibility of companies performing work with, and on behalf of, the US Dept. of Defense (DoD) to complete other configurations or processes.

In CMMC Level 2, there are 13 domains that have one or more practices related to identity:

* Access Control (AC)
* Audit & Accountability (AU)
* Configuration Management (CM)
* Identification & Authentication (IA)
* Incident Response (IR)
* Maintenance (MA)
* Media Protection (MP)
* Personnel Security (PS)
* Physical Protection (PE)
* Risk Assessment (RA)
* Security Assessment (CA)
* System and Communications Protection (SC)
* System and Information Integrity (SI)

The remainder of this article provides guidance for all of the domains except Access Control (AC) and Identification and Authentication (IA) which are covered in other articles. For each domain, there's a table with links to content that provides step-by-step guidance to accomplish the practice.

## Audit & Accountability

The following table provides a list of practice statement and objectives, and Azure AD guidance and recommendations to enable you to meet these requirements with Azure AD.

| CMMC practice statement and objectives | Azure AD guidance and recommendations |
| - | - |
| AU.L2-3.3.1<br><br>**Practice statement:** Create and retain system audit logs and records to enable monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful or unauthorized system activity.<br><br>**Objectives:**<br>Determine if:<br>[a.] audit logs (for example, event types to be logged) to enable monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful or unauthorized system activity are specified;<br>[b.] the content of audit records needed to support monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful or unauthorized system activity is defined;<br>[c.] audit records are created (generated);<br>[d.] audit records, once created, contain the defined content;<br>[e.] retention requirements for audit records are defined; and<br>[f.] audit records are retained as defined.<br><br>AU.L2-3.3.2<br><br>**Practice statement:** Ensure that the actions of individual system users can be uniquely traced to those users so they can be held accountable for their actions.<br><br>**Objectives:**<br>Determine if:<br>[a.] the content of the audit records needed to support the ability to uniquely trace users to their actions is defined; and<br>[b.] audit records, once created, contain the defined content. | All operations are audited within the Azure AD audit logs.
