# Configure additional controls to meet FedRAMP High Impact level

The following list of controls (and control enhancements) might require configuration in your Microsoft Entra tenant.

Each row in the following tables provides prescriptive guidance. This guidance helps you in developing your organization's response to any shared responsibilities regarding the control or control enhancement.

## Audit and accountability

The guidance in the following table pertains to:

* AU-2 Audit events
* AU-3 Content of audit
* AU-6 Audit review, analysis, and reporting

| FedRAMP Control ID and description | Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations |
| - | - |
| **AU-2 Audit Events**<br>**The organization:**<br>**(a.)** Determines that the information system is capable of auditing the following events: [*FedRAMP Assignment: [Successful and unsuccessful account logon events, account management events, object access, policy change, privilege functions, process tracking, and system events.  For Web applications: all administrator activity, authentication checks, authorization checks, data deletions, data access, data changes, and permission changes*];<br>**(b.)** Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of auditable events;<br>**(c.)** Provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents; and<br>**(d.)** Determines that the following events are to be audited in the information system: [*FedRAMP Assignment: organization-defined subset of the auditable events defined in AU-2 a. to be audited continually for each identified event*].<br><br>**AU-2 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**<br>**Requirement:** Coordination between service provider and consumer shall be documented and accepted by the JAB/AO.<br><br>**AU-3 Content and Audit Records**<br>The information system generates audit records containing information that establishes what type of event occurred, when the event occurred, where the event occurred, the source of the event, the outcome of the event, and the identity of any individuals or subjects associated with the event.<br><br>**AU-3(1)**<br>The information system generates audit records containing the following additional information: [*FedRAMP Assignment: organization-defined additional, more detailed information*].<br><br>**AU-3 (1) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**<br>**Requirement:** The service provider defines audit record types [*FedRAMP Assignment: session, connection, transaction, or activity duration; for client-server transactions, the number of bytes received and bytes sent; additional informational messages to diagnose or identify the event; characteristics that describe or identify the object or resource being acted upon; individual identities of group account users; full-text of privileged commands*]. The audit record types are approved and accepted by the JAB/AO.<br>**Guidance:** For client-server transactions, the number of bytes sent and received gives bidirectional transfer information that can be helpful during an investigation or inquiry.<br><br>**AU-3(2)**<br>The information system provides centralized management and configuration of the content to be captured in audit records generated by [*FedRAMP Assignment: all network, data storage, and computing devices*]. | Ensure the system is capable of auditing events defined in AU-2 Part a. Coordinate with other entities within the organization's subset of auditable events to support after-the-fact investigations. Implement centralized management of audit records.<p>All account lifecycle operations (account creation, modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions) are audited within the Microsoft Entra audit logs. All authentication and authorization events are audited within Microsoft Entra sign-in logs, and any detected risks are audited in the Identity Protection logs. You can stream each of these logs directly into a security information and event management (SIEM) solution such as Microsoft Sentinel. Alternatively, use Azure Event Hubs to integrate logs with third-party SIEM solutions.<p>Audit events<li> [Audit activity reports in the Microsoft Entra admin center](../reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs.md)<li> [Sign-in activity reports in the Microsoft Entra admin center](../reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins.md)<li>[How To: Investigate risk](../identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk.md)<p>SIEM integrations<li> [Microsoft Sentinel : Connect data from Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/sentinel/connect-azure-active-directory)<li>[Stream to Azure event hub and other SIEMs](../reports-monitoring/howto-stream-logs-to-event-hub.md) |
| **AU-6 Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting**<br>**The organization:**<br>**(a.)** Reviews and analyzes information system audit records [*FedRAMP Assignment: at least weekly*] for indications of [*Assignment: organization-defined inappropriate or unusual activity*]; and<br>**(b.)** Reports findings to [*Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles*].<br>**AU-6 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**<br>**Requirement:** Coordination between service provider and consumer shall be documented and accepted by the Authorizing Official. In multi-tenant environments, capability and means for providing review, analysis, and reporting to consumer for data pertaining to consumer shall be documented.<br><br>**AU-6(1)**<br>The organization employs automated mechanisms to integrate audit review, analysis, and reporting processes to support organizational processes for investigation and response to suspicious activities.<br><br>**AU-6(3)**<br>The organization analyzes and correlates audit records across different repositories to gain organization-wide situational awareness.<br><br>**AU-6(4)**<br>The information system provides the capability to centrally review and analyze audit records from multiple components within the system.<br><br>**AU-6(5)**<br>The organization integrates analysis of audit records with analysis of [*FedRAMP Selection (one or more): vulnerability scanning information; performance data; information system monitoring information; penetration test data;* [*Assignment: organization-defined data/information collected from other sources*]] to further enhance the ability to identify inappropriate or unusual activity.<br><br>**AU-6(6)**<br>The organization correlates information from audit records with information obtained from monitoring physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate, unusual, or malevolent activity.<br>**AU-6 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**<br>**Requirement:** Coordination between service provider and consumer shall be documented and accepted by the JAB/AO.<br><br>**AU-6(7)**<br>The organization specifies the permitted actions for each [FedRAMP Selection (one or more): information system process; role; user] associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit information.<br><br>**AU-6(10)**<br>The organization adjusts the level of audit review, analysis, and reporting within the information system when there is a change in risk based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources of information. | Review and analyze audit records at least once each week to identify inappropriate or unusual activity, and report findings to appropriate personnel. <p>The preceding guidance provided for AU-02 and AU-03 allows for weekly review of audit records and reporting to appropriate personnel. You can't meet these requirements by using only Microsoft Entra ID. You must also use a SIEM solution such as Microsoft Sentinel. For more information, see [What is Microsoft Sentinel?](/azure/sentinel/overview). |

## Incident response

The guidance in the following table pertains to:

* IR-4 Incident handling

* IR-5 Incident monitoring

| FedRAMP Control ID and description | Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations |

This includes Automated Incident Handling, Dynamic Reconfiguration, Continuity of Operations, Information Correlation, Insider Threats, Correlation with External Organizations, and Incident Monitoring and Automated Tracking. <p>The audit logs record all configuration changes. Authentication and authorization events are audited within the sign-in logs, and any detected risks are audited in the Identity Protection logs. You can stream each of these logs directly into a SIEM solution, such as Microsoft Sentinel. Alternatively, use Azure Event Hubs to integrate logs with third-party SIEM solutions.
