# Configure CMMC Level 1 controls

Microsoft Entra ID meets identity-related practice requirements in each Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) level. To be compliant with requirements in CMMC, it's the responsibility of companies performing work with, and on behalf of, the US Dept. of Defense (DoD) to complete other configurations or processes.
In CMMC Level 1, there are three domains that have one or more practices related to identity:

* Access Control (AC)
* Identification and Authentication (IA)
* System and Information integrity (SI)

Learn more:

* DoD CMMC website - [Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition & Sustainment Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification](https://www.acq.osd.mil/cmmc/index.html)
* Microsoft Download Center - [Microsoft Product Placemat for CMMC Level 3 (preview)](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=102536)

The remainder of this content is organized by domain and associated practices. For each domain, there's a table with links to content that provides step-by-step guidance to accomplish the practice.

## Access Control domain

The following table provides a list of practice statement and objectives, and Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations to enable you to meet these requirements with Microsoft Entra ID.

## Identification and Authentication (IA) domain

The following table provides a list of practice statement and objectives, and Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations to enable you to meet these requirements with Microsoft Entra ID.

| CMMC practice statement and objectives | Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations |
| - | - |
| IA.L1-3.5.1<br><br>**Practice statement:** Identify information system users, processes acting on behalf of users, or devices.<br><br>**Objectives:**<br>Determine if:<br>[a.] system users are identified;<br>[b.] processes acting on behalf of users are identified; and<br>[c.] devices accessing the system are identified. | Microsoft Entra ID uniquely identifies users, processes (service principal/workload identities), and devices via the ID property on the respective directory objects. You can filter log files to help with your assessment using the following links. Use the following reference to meet assessment objectives.<br><br>Filtering logs by user properties<li>[User resource type: ID Property](/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true)<br><br>Filtering logs by service properties<li>[ServicePrincipal resource type: ID Property](/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true)<br><br>Filtering logs by device properties<li>[Device resource type: ID Property](/graph/api/resources/device?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true) |
IA.L1-3.5.2<br><br>**Practice statement:** Authenticate (or verify) the identities of those users, processes, or devices, as a prerequisite to allowing access to organizational information systems.<br><br>**Objectives:**<br>Determine if:<br>[a.] the identity of each user is authenticated or verified as a prerequisite to system access;<br>[b.] the identity of each process acting on behalf of a user is authenticated or verified as a prerequisite to system access; and<br>[c.] the identity of each device accessing or connecting to the system is authenticated or verified as a prerequisite to system access. | Microsoft Entra ID uniquely authenticates or verifies each user, process acting on behalf of user, or device as a prerequisite to system access.

## System and Information Integrity (SI) domain

The following table provides a list of practice statement and objectives, and Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations to enable you to meet these requirements with Microsoft Entra ID.

| CMMC practice statement | Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations |
| - | - |
| SI.L1-3.14.1 - Identify, report, and correct information and information system flaws in a timely manner.<br><br>SI.L1-3.14.2 - Provide protection from malicious code at appropriate locations in organizational information systems.<br><br>SI.L1-3.14.4 - Update malicious code protection mechanisms when new releases are available.<br><br>SI.L1-3.14.5 - Perform periodic scans of the information system and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded, opened, or executed. | **Consolidated Guidance for legacy managed devices**<br>Configure Conditional Access to require Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device. For devices joined to an on-premises AD, it's assumed that the control over these devices is enforced using management solutions such as Configuration Manager or group policy (GP). Because there's no method for Microsoft Entra ID to determine whether any of these methods has been applied to a device, requiring a Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device is a relatively weak mechanism to require a managed device. The administrator judges whether the methods applied to your on-premises domain-joined devices are strong enough to constitute a managed device, if the device is also a Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device.<br><br>**Consolidated guidance for cloud-managed (or co-management) devices**<br>Configure Conditional Access to require a device to be marked as compliant, the strongest form to request a managed device. This option requires device registration with Microsoft Entra ID, and indicated as compliant by Intune or a third-party mobile device management (MDM) system that manages Windows 10 devices via Microsoft Entra integration.
