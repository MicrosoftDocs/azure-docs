# Configure identity access controls to meet FedRAMP High Impact level

Access control is a major part of achieving a [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program](https://www.fedramp.gov/) (FedRAMP) High Impact level to operate.

The following list of controls and control enhancements in the access control (AC) family might require configuration in your Microsoft Entra tenant.

|Control family|Description|
| - | - |
| AC-2| Account management |
| AC-6| Least privilege |
| AC-7| Unsuccessful logon attempts |
| AC-8| System use notification |
| AC-10| Concurrent session control |
| AC-11| Session lock |
| AC-12| Session termination |
| AC-20| Use of external information systems |

Each row in the following table provides prescriptive guidance to help you develop your organization's response to any shared responsibilities for the control or control enhancement.

Intended system usage; and<br>(3.) Other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions;<p><p>**(j.)** Reviews accounts for compliance with account management requirements [*FedRAMP Assignment: monthly for privileged accessed, every six (6) months for non-privileged access*]; and<p><p>**(k.)** Establishes a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group. | **Implement account lifecycle management for customer-controlled accounts. Monitor the use of accounts and notify account managers of account lifecycle events. Review accounts for compliance with account management requirements every month for privileged access and every six months for nonprivileged access.**<p>Use Microsoft Entra ID to provision accounts from external HR systems, on-premises Active Directory, or directly in the cloud. All account lifecycle operations are audited within the Microsoft Entra audit logs. You can collect and analyze logs by using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution such as Microsoft Sentinel. Alternatively, you can use Azure Event Hubs to integrate logs with third-party SIEM solutions to enable monitoring and notification.

Users are accessing a U.S. Government information system;<br>(2.) Information system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit;<br>(3.) Unauthorized use of the information system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and<br>(4.) Use of the information system indicates consent to monitoring and recording;<p><p>**(b.)** Retains the notification message or banner on the screen until users acknowledge the usage conditions and take explicit actions to log on to or further access the information system; and<p><p>**(c.)** For publicly accessible systems:<br>(1.) Displays system use information [*Assignment: organization-defined conditions (FedRAMP Assignment: see additional Requirements and Guidance)*], before granting further access;<br>(2.)

The elements of the cloud environment that require System Use Notification are approved and accepted by the JAB/AO.<br>**Requirement:** The service provider shall determine how System Use Notification is going to be verified and provide appropriate periodicity of the check.  The System Use Notification verification and periodicity are approved and accepted by the JAB/AO.<br>**Guidance:** If performed as part of a Configuration Baseline check, then the % of items requiring setting that are checked and that pass (or fail) check can be provided.<br>**Requirement:** If not performed as part of a Configuration Baseline check, then there must be documented agreement on how to provide results of verification and the necessary periodicity of the verification by the service provider.

Implement Conditional Access policies to restrict access from external systems. Conditional Access policies might be integrated with Defender for Cloud Apps to provide controls for cloud and on-premises applications from external systems. Mobile application management in Intune can protect organization data at the application level, including custom apps and store apps, from managed devices that interact with external systems. An example would be accessing cloud services. You can use app management on organization-owned devices and personal devices.<P>Terms and conditions<br><li>[Terms of use: Microsoft Entra ID](../conditional-access/terms-of-use.md)<p>Conditional Access<br><li>[Require device to be marked as compliant](../conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant.md)<br><li>[Conditions in Conditional Access policy: Device state (preview)](../conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions.md)<br><li>[Protect with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps Conditional Access App Control](/cloud-app-security/proxy-intro-aad)<br><li>[Location condition in Microsoft Entra Conditional Access](../conditional-access/location-condition.md)<p>MDM<br><li>[What is Microsoft Intune?](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune)<br><li>[What is Defender for Cloud Apps?](/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security)<br><li>[What is app management in Microsoft Intune?](/mem/intune/apps/app-management)<p>Resource<br><li>[Integrate on-premises apps with Defender for Cloud Apps](../app-proxy/application-proxy-integrate-with-microsoft-cloud-application-security.md) |
