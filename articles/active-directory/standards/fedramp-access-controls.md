# Configure identity access controls to meet FedRAMP High Impact level

Access control is a major part of achieving a [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program](https://www.fedramp.gov/) (FedRAMP) High Authority to operate.

The following list of controls and control enhancements in the Access Control family may require configuration in your Azure AD tenant. 


|Control family|Description|
| - | - |
| AC-02| Account management |
| AC-06| Least privilege |
| AC-07| Unsuccessful logon attempts |
| AC-08| System use notification |
| AC-10| Concurrent session control |
| AC-11| Session lock | pattern hiding displays |
| AC-12| Session termination |
| AC-20| Use of external information systems |


Each row in the table below provides prescriptive guidance to aid you in developing your organization’s response to any shared responsibilities for the control or control enhancement.
 
## Configurations


| Control ID   | Customer responsibilities and guidance |
| - | - |
| AC-02   | **Implement account lifecycle management for customer-controlled accounts. Monitor the use of accounts and notify account managers of account lifecycle events. Review accounts for compliance with account management requirements every month for privileged access and every six (6) months for non-privileged access**.<p>Use Azure AD to provision accounts from external HR systems, on-premises Active Directory, or directly in the cloud. All account lifecycle operations are audited within the Azure AD audit logs. Logs can be collected and analyzed by a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution such as Azure Sentinel. Alternatively, you can use Azure Event Hub to integrate logs with third-party SIEM solutions to enable monitoring and notification.

| AC-02(1)| **Employ automated mechanisms to support management of customer-controlled accounts.**<p>Configure automated provisioning of customer-controlled accounts from external HR systems or on-premises Active Directory. For applications that support application provisioning, configure Azure AD to automatically create user identities and roles in cloud (SaaS) applications that users need access to. In addition to creating user identities, automatic provisioning includes the maintenance and removal of user identities as status or roles change.

Implement Conditional Access policies to restrict access from external systems. Conditional Access policies may also be integrated with Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) to provide additional controls for both cloud and on-premises applications from external systems. Mobile application management (MAM) in Intune can protect organization data at the application level, including custom apps and store apps, from managed devices interacting with external systems (for example, accessing cloud services). App management can be used on organization-owned devices, and personal devices.<P>Terms and Conditions<br>[Terms of use - Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/terms-of-use)<p>Conditional Access<br>[Require device to be marked as compliant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/require-managed-devices)<br>[Conditions in Conditional Access policy - Device State (Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions)<br>[Protect with Microsoft Cloud App Security Conditional Access App Control](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-intro-aad)<br>[Location condition in Azure Active Directory Conditional Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/location-condition)<p>Mobile Device management<br>[What is Microsoft Intune?](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune)<br>[What is Cloud App Security?](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security)<br>[What is app management in Microsoft Intune?](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/apps/app-management)<p>Resources<br>[Integrate on-premises apps with Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-integrate-with-microsoft-cloud-application-security) |
