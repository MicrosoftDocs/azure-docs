# Configure identification and authentication controls to meet FedRAMP High Impact level

Identification and authentication are key to achieving a [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program](https://www.fedramp.gov/) (FedRAMP) High Impact level.

The following list of controls and control enhancements in the identification and authentication (IA) family might require configuration in your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.

|Control family|Description|
| - | - |
| IA-02| Identification and authentication (organizational users) |
| IA-03| Device identification and authentication |
| IA-04| Identifier management |
| IA-05| Authenticator management |
| IA-06| Authenticator feedback |
| IA-07| Cryptographic module authentication |
| IA-08| Identification and authentication (non-organizational users) |

Each row in the following table provides prescriptive guidance to help you develop your organization's response to any shared responsibilities for the control or control enhancement.

## Configurations

| Control ID and subpart| Customer responsibilities and guidance |
| - | - |
| IA-02| **Uniquely identify and authenticate users or processes acting for users.**<p> Azure AD uniquely identifies user and service principal objects directly. Azure AD provides multiple authentication methods, and you can configure methods that adhere to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) authentication assurance level (AAL) 3.<p>Identifiers <br> <li>Users: [Working with users in Microsoft Graph: ID property](/graph/api/resources/users)<br><li>Service principals: [ServicePrincipal resource type : ID property](/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal)<p>Authentication and multifactor authentication<br> <li>[Achieving NIST authenticator assurance levels with the Microsoft identity platform](nist-overview.md) |

| IA-02(2)<br>IA-02(4)| **Implement multi-factor authentication for all access to non-privileged accounts**<p>Configure the following elements as an overall solution to ensure all access to non-privileged accounts requires MFA.<p> Configure Conditional Access policies to require MFA for all users.<br> Configure device management policies via MDM (such as Microsoft Intune), Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM) or group policy objects (GPO) to enforce use of specific authentication methods.<br> Configure Conditional Access policies to enforce device compliance.<p>Microsoft recommends using a multi-factor cryptographic hardware authenticator (e.g., FIDO2 security keys, Windows Hello for Business (with hardware TPM), or smart card) to achieve AAL3. If your organization is completely cloud-based, we recommend using FIDO2 security keys or Windows Hello for Business.<p>Windows Hello for Business has not been validated at the required FIPS 140 Security Level and as such federal customers would need to conduct risk assessment and evaluation before accepting it as AAL3. For additional details regarding Windows Hello for Business FIPS 140 validation please refer to [Microsoft NIST AALs](nist-overview.md).<p>Guidance regarding MDM polices differ slightly based on authentication methods, they are broken out below. <p>Smart Card / Windows Hello for Business<br> [Passwordless Strategy - Require Windows Hello for Business or smart card](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/passwordless-strategy)<br> [Require device to be marked as compliant](../conditional-access/require-managed-devices.md)<br> [Conditional Access - Require MFA for all users](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-all-users-mfa.md)<p> Hybrid Only<br> [Passwordless Strategy - Configure user accounts to disallow password authentication](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/passwordless-strategy)<p> Smart Card Only<br>[Create a Rule to Send an Authentication Method Claim](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/create-a-rule-to-send-an-authentication-method-claim)<br>[Configure Authentication Policies](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-authentication-policies)<p>FIDO2 Security Key<br> [Passwordless Strategy - Excluding the password credential provider](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/passwordless-strategy)<br> [Require device to be marked as compliant](../conditional-access/require-managed-devices.md)<br> [Conditional Access - Require MFA for all users](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-all-users-mfa.md)<p>Authentication Methods<br> [Azure Active Directory passwordless sign-in (preview) | FIDO2 security keys](../authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless.md)<br> [Passwordless security key sign-in Windows - Azure Active Directory](../authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key-windows.md)<br> [ADFS: Certificate Authentication with Azure AD & Office 365](/archive/blogs/samueld/adfs-certauth-aad-o365)<br> [How Smart Card Sign-in Works in Windows (Windows 10)](/windows/security/identity-protection/smart-cards/smart-card-how-smart-card-sign-in-works-in-windows)<br> [Windows Hello for Business Overview (Windows 10)](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-overview)<p>Additional Resources:<br> [Policy CSP - Windows Client Management](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-configuration-service-provider)<br> [Use PowerShell scripts on Windows 10 devices in Intune](/mem/intune/apps/intune-management-extension)<br> [Plan a passwordless authentication deployment with Azure AD](../authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-deployment.md)<br> |
| IA-02(5)| **When multiple users have access to a shared or group account password, require each user to first authenticate by using an individual authenticator.**<p>Use an individual account per user. If a shared account is required, Azure AD permits binding of multiple authenticators to an account so that each user has an individual authenticator. <p>Resources<br><li>[How it works: Azure AD multifactor authentication](../authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks.md)<br> <li>[Manage authentication methods for Azure AD multifactor authentication](../authentication/howto-mfa-userdevicesettings.md) |
| IA-02(8)| **Implement replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access to privileged accounts.**<p>Configure conditional access policies to require multifactor authentication for all users. All Azure AD authentication methods at authentication assurance level 2 and 3 use either nonce or challenges and are resistant to replay attacks.<p>References<br> <li>[Conditional access: Require multifactor authentication for all users](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-all-users-mfa.md)<br> <li>[Achieving NIST authenticator assurance levels with the Microsoft identity platform](nist-overview.md) |
| IA-02(11)| **Implement Azure AD multifactor authentication to access customer-deployed resources remotely so that one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the system gaining access where the device meets FIPS-140-2, NIAP certification, or NSA approval.**<p>See guidance for IA-02(1-4). Azure AD authentication methods to consider at AAL3 meeting the separate device requirements are:<p> FIDO2 security keys<br> <li>Windows Hello for Business with hardware TPM (TPM is recognized as a valid "something you have" factor by NIST 800-63B Section 5.1.7.1.)<br> <li>Smart card<p>References<br><li>[Achieving NIST authenticator assurance levels with the Microsoft identity platform](nist-overview.md)<br> <li>[NIST 800-63B Section 5.1.7.1](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) |
| IA-02(12)| **Accept and verify personal identity verification (PIV) credentials. This control isn't applicable if the customer doesn't deploy PIV credentials.**<p>Configure federated authentication by using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) to accept PIV (certificate authentication) as both primary and multifactor authentication methods and issue the multifactor authentication (MultipleAuthN) claim when PIV is used. Configure the federated domain in Azure AD with setting **federatedIdpMfaBehavior** to `enforceMfaByFederatedIdp` (recommended) or SupportsMfa to `$True` to direct multifactor authentication requests originating at Azure AD to AD FS. Alternatively, you can use PIV for sign-in on Windows devices and later use integrated Windows authentication along with seamless single sign-on. Windows Server and client verify certificates by default when used for authentication. <p>Resources<br><li>[What is federation with Azure AD?](../hybrid/whatis-fed.md)<br> <li>[Configure AD FS support for user certificate authentication](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-user-certificate-authentication)<br> <li>[Configure authentication policies](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-authentication-policies)<br> <li>[Secure resources with Azure AD multifactor authentication and AD FS](../authentication/howto-mfa-adfs.md)<br><li>[Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings](/powershell/module/msonline/set-msoldomainfederationsettings)<br> <li>[Azure AD Connect: Seamless single sign-on](../hybrid/how-to-connect-sso.md) |

| IA-04<br>IA-04(4)| **Disable account identifiers after 35 days of inactivity and prevent their reuse for two years. Manage individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each individual (for example, contractors and foreign nationals).**<p>Assign and manage individual account identifiers and status in Azure AD in accordance with existing organizational policies defined in AC-02. Follow AC-02(3) to automatically disable user and device accounts after 35 days of inactivity. Ensure that organizational policy maintains all accounts that remain in the disabled state for at least two years. After this time, you can remove them. <p>Determine inactivity<br> <li>[Manage inactive user accounts in Azure AD](../reports-monitoring/howto-manage-inactive-user-accounts.md)<br> <li>[Manage stale devices in Azure AD](../devices/manage-stale-devices.md)<br> <li>[See AC-02 guidance](fedramp-access-controls.md) |
| IA-05| **Configure and manage information system authenticators.**<p>Azure AD supports various authentication methods. You can use your existing organizational policies for management. See guidance for authenticator selection in IA-02(1-4). Enable users in combined registration for SSPR and Azure AD multifactor authentication and require users to register a minimum of two acceptable multifactor authentication methods to facilitate self-remediation. You can revoke user-configured authenticators at any time with the authentication methods API. <p>Authenticator strength/protecting authenticator content<br> <li>[Achieving NIST authenticator assurance levels with the Microsoft identity platform](nist-overview.md)<p>Authentication methods and combined registration<br> <li>[What authentication and verification methods are available in Azure Active Directory?](../authentication/concept-authentication-methods.md)<br> <li>[Combined registration for SSPR and Azure AD multifactor authentication](../authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined.md)<p>Authenticator revokes<br> <li>[Azure AD authentication methods API overview](/graph/api/resources/authenticationmethods-overview) |
| IA-05(1)| **Implement password-based authentication requirements.**<p>Per NIST SP 800-63B Section 5.1.1: Maintain a list of commonly used, expected, or compromised passwords.<p>With Azure AD password protection, default global banned password lists are automatically applied to all users in an Azure AD tenant. To support your business and security needs, you can define entries in a custom banned password list. When users change or reset their passwords, these banned password lists are checked to enforce the use of strong passwords.<p>We strongly encourage passwordless strategies. This control is only applicable to password authenticators, so removing passwords as an available authenticator renders this control not applicable.<p>NIST reference documents<br><li>[NIST Special Publication 800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)<br><li>[NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf) - IA-5 - Control enhancement (1)<p>Resource<br><li>[Eliminate bad passwords using Azure AD password protection](../authentication/concept-password-ban-bad.md) |
| IA-05(2)| **Implement PKI-based authentication requirements.**<p>Federate Azure AD via AD FS to implement PKI-based authentication. By default, AD FS validates certificates, locally caches revocation data, and maps users to the authenticated identity in Active Directory. <p> Resources<br> <li>[What is federation with Azure AD?](../hybrid/whatis-fed.md)<br> <li>[Configure AD FS support for user certificate authentication](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-user-certificate-authentication) |
| IA-05(4)| **Employ automated tools to validate password strength requirements.** <p>Azure AD implements automated mechanisms that enforce password authenticator strength at creation. This automated mechanism can also be extended to enforce password authenticator strength for on-premises Active Directory. Revision 5 of NIST 800-53 has withdrawn IA-04(4) and incorporated the requirement into IA-5(1).<p>Resources<br> <li>[Eliminate bad passwords using Azure AD password protection](../authentication/concept-password-ban-bad.md)<br> <li>[Azure AD password protection for Active Directory Domain Services](../authentication/concept-password-ban-bad-on-premises.md)<br><li>[NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf) - IA-5 - Control enhancement (4) |

| IA-05(13)| **Enforce the expiration of cached authenticators.**<p>Cached authenticators are used to authenticate to the local machine when the network isn't available. To limit the use of cached authenticators, configure Windows devices to disable their use. Where this action isn't possible or practical, use the following compensating controls:<p>Configure conditional access session controls by using application-enforced restrictions for Office applications.<br> Configure conditional access by using application controls for other applications.<p>Resources<br> <li>[Interactive logon number of previous logons to cache](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/interactive-logon-number-of-previous-logons-to-cache-in-case-domain-controller-is-not-available)<br> <li>[Session controls in conditional access policy: Application enforced restrictions](../conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-session.md)<br><li>[Session controls in conditional access policy: Conditional access application control](../conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-session.md) |
| IA-06| **Obscure authentication feedback information during the authentication process.**<p>By default, Azure AD obscures all authenticator feedback.<p>
| IA-07| **Implement mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that meets applicable federal laws.**<p>The FedRAMP High Impact level requires the AAL3 authenticator. All authenticators supported by Azure AD at AAL3 provide mechanisms to authenticate operator access to the module as required. For example, in a Windows Hello for Business deployment with hardware TPM, configure the level of TPM owner authorization.<p> Resources<br><li>For more information, see IA-02 (2 and 4).<br> <li>[Achieving NIST authenticator assurance levels with the Microsoft identity platform](nist-overview.md) <br> <li>[TPM Group Policy settings](/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/trusted-platform-module-services-group-policy-settings) |
