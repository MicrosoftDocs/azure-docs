| IA-02(12)| **Accept and verify Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials. This control is not applicable if the customer does not deploy PIV credentials.**<p>Configure federated authentication using Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) to accept PIV (certificate authentication) as both primary and multi-factor authentication methods and issue the MFA (MultipleAuthN) claim when PIV is used. Configure the federated domain in Azure AD with SupportsMFA to direct MFA requests originating at Azure AD to the ADFS. Alternatively, PIV can be used for sign-in on Windows devices and subsequently leverage Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) along with Seamless Single Sign-On (SSSO).

| IA-05| **Configure and manage information system authenticators.**<p>Azure AD supports a wide variety of authentication methods and can be managed using your existing organizational policies. See guidance for authenticator selection in IA-02(1-4). Enable users in combined registration for SSPR and Azure AD MFA and require users to register a minimum of two acceptable multi-factor authentication methods to facilitate self-remediation. Administrators can revoke user configured authenticators at any time with the authentication methods API. <p>Authenticator Strength/Protect Authenticator Content<br> [Achieving National Institute of Standards and Technology Authenticator Assurance Levels with the Microsoft Identity Platform.](nist-overview.md)<p>Authentication Methods & Combined Registration<br> [What authentication and verification methods are available in Azure Active Directory?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-methods)<br> [Combined registration for SSPR and Azure AD multi-factor authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined)<p>Authenticator Revoke<br> [Azure AD authentication methods API overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/authenticationmethods-overview?view=graph-rest-beta) |
| IA-05(1)| **Implement password-based authentication requirements.**<p>Per NIST SP 800-63B Section 5.1.1: Maintain a list of commonly used, expected, or compromised passwords.<p>With Azure AD Password Protection, default global banned password lists are automatically applied to all users in an Azure AD tenant. To support your own business and security needs, you can define entries in a custom banned password list. When users change or reset their passwords, these banned password lists are checked to enforce the use of strong passwords.<p>Microsoft strongly encourages passwordless strategies. This control is only applicable to password authenticators. Therefore, removing passwords as an available authenticator renders this control not applicable.<p>NIST Reference Documents:<br>[NIST Special Publication 800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)<br>[NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf) - IA-5 - Control Enhancement (1)<p>Additional Resources:<br>[Eliminate bad passwords using Azure Active Directory Password Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com///azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad) |
| IA-05(2)| **Implement PKI-Based authentication requirements.**<p>Federate Azure AD via ADFS to implement PKI-based authentication. By default, ADFS validates certificates, locally caches revocation data and maps users to the authenticated identity in Active Directory. <p> Additional Resources:<br> [What is federation with Azure AD?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-fed)<br> [Configure AD FS support for user certificate authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-user-certificate-authentication) |
| IA-05(4)| **Employ automated tools to validate password strength requirements.** <p>Azure AD implements automated mechanisms which enforce password authenticator strength at creation. This automated mechanism can also be extended to enforce password authenticator strength for on-premises Active Directory. Revision 5 of NIST 800-53 has withdrawn IA-04(4) and incorporated the requirement into IA-5(1).<p>Additional Resources:<p> [Eliminate bad passwords using Azure Active Directory Password Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad)<br> [Azure AD Password Protection for Active Directory Domain Services](https://docs.microsoft.com///azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad-on-premises)<br>[NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf) - IA-5 - Control Enhancement (4) |

| IA-06| **Obscure authentication feedback information during the authentication process.**<p>By default, Azure AD obscures all authenticator feedback. <p>
| IA-07| **Implement mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that meets applicable federal laws.**<p>FedRAMP High requires AAL3 authenticator. All authenticators supported by Azure AD at AAL3 provide mechanisms to authenticate operator access to the module as required. For example, in a Windows Hello for Business deployment with hardware TPM, configure the level of TPM owner authorization.<p> Resources:<br>See IA-02(2 & 4) for additional detail.
