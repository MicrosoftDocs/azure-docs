# Configure CMMC Level 2 Access Control (AC) controls

Microsoft Entra ID can help you meet identity-related practice requirements in each Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) level. To be compliant with requirements in [CMMC V2.0 level 2](https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/Model/), it's the responsibility of companies performing work with, and on behalf of, the US Dept. of Defense (DoD) to complete other configurations or processes.

In CMMC Level 2, there are 13 domains that have one or more practices related to identity:

* Access Control (AC)
* Audit & Accountability (AU)
* Configuration Management (CM)
* Identification & Authentication (IA)
* Incident Response (IR)
* Maintenance (MA)
* Media Protection (MP)
* Personnel Security (PS)
* Physical Protection (PE)
* Risk Assessment (RA)
* Security Assessment (CA)
* System and Communications Protection (SC)
* System and Information Integrity (SI)

The remainder of this article provides guidance for the Access Control (AC) domain. There's a table with links to content that provides step-by-step guidance to accomplish the practice.

## Access Control (AC)

The following table provides a list of practice statement and objectives, and Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations to enable you to meet these requirements with Microsoft Entra ID.

| CMMC practice statement and objectives | Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations |
| - | - |
| AC.L2-3.1.3<br><br>**Practice statement:** Control the flow of CUI in accordance with approved authorizations.<br><br>**Objectives:**<br>Determine if:<br>[a.] information flow control policies are defined;<br>[b.] methods and enforcement mechanisms for controlling the flow of CUI are defined;<br>[c.] designated sources and destinations (for example, networks, individuals, and devices) for CUI within the system and between intercfeetonnected systems are identified;<br>[d.] authorizations for controlling the flow of CUI are defined; and<br>[e.] approved authorizations for controlling the flow of CUI are enforced. | Configure Conditional Access policies to control the flow of CUI from trusted locations, trusted devices, approved applications and require app protection policy. For finer grained authorization to CUI, configure app-enforced restrictions(Exchange/SharePoint Online), App Control (with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps), Authentication Context.

|AC.L2-3.1.4<br><br>**Practice statement:** Separate the duties of individuals to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion.<br><br>**Objectives:**<br>Determine if:<br>[a.] the duties of individuals requiring separation are defined;<br>[b.] responsibilities for duties that require separation are assigned to separate individuals; and<br>[c.] access privileges that enable individuals to exercise the duties that require separation are granted to separate individuals. | Ensuring adequate separation of duties by scoping appropriate access. Configure Entitlement Management Access packages to govern access to applications, groups, Teams and SharePoint sites. Configure Separation of Duties checks within access packages to avoid a user obtaining excessive access. In Microsoft Entra entitlement management, you can configure multiple policies, with different settings for each user community that will need access through an access package. This configuration includes restrictions such that a user of a particular group, or already assigned a different access package, isn't assigned other access packages, by policy.<br><br>Configure administrative units in Microsoft Entra ID to scope administrative privilege so that administrators with privileged roles are scoped to only have those privileges on limited set of directory objects(users, groups, devices).<br>[What is entitlement management?](../governance/entitlement-management-overview.md)<br>[What are access packages and what resources can I manage with them?](../governance/entitlement-management-overview.md)<br>[Configure separation of duties for an access package in Microsoft Entra entitlement management](../governance/entitlement-management-access-package-incompatible.md)<br>[Administrative units in Microsoft Entra ID](../roles/administrative-units.md)|

This action can be accomplished with Privileged Identity Management for configuring enforcement, monitoring, and alerting. Set requirements and conditions for role membership.<br><br>Once privileged accounts are identified and managed, use [Entitlement Lifecycle Management](../governance/entitlement-management-overview.md) and [Access reviews](../governance/access-reviews-overview.md) to set, maintain and audit adequate access.

| AC.L2-3.1.6<br><br>**Practice statement:** Use non-privileged accounts or roles when accessing non security functions.<br><br>**Objectives:**<br>Determine if:<br>[a.] non security functions are identified; and <br>[b.] users are required to use non-privileged accounts or roles when accessing non security functions.<br><br>AC.L2-3.1.7<br><br>**Practice statement:** Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions and capture the execution of such functions in audit logs.<br><br>**Objectives:**<br>Determine if:<br>[a.] privileged functions are defined;<br>[b.] non-privileged users are defined;<br>[c.] non-privileged users are prevented from executing privileged functions; and<br>[d.] the execution of privileged functions is captured in audit logs. |Requirements in AC.L2-3.1.6 and AC.L2-3.1.7 complement each other. Require separate accounts for privilege and non-privileged use. Configure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to bring just-in-time(JIT) privileged access and remove standing access. Configure role based Conditional Access policies to limit access to productivity application for privileged users. For highly privileged users, secure devices as part of the privileged access story.

You can granularly target these terms of use policies to specific users (Member or Guest).

For application that don't support CAE, or for conditions not applicable to CAE, implement policies in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to automatically terminate sessions when conditions occur.
