# Configure CMMC Level 2 Access Control (AC) controls

Azure Active Directory can help you meet identity-related practice requirements in each Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) level. To be compliant with requirements in [CMMC V2.0 level 2](https://cmmc-coe.org/maturity-level-two/), it's the responsibility of companies performing work with, and on behalf of, the US Dept. of Defense (DoD) to complete other configurations or processes.

In CMMC Level 2, there are 13 domains that have one or more practices related to identity. The domains are:

* Access Control (AC)
* Audit & Accountability (AU)
* Configuration Management (CM)
* Identification & Authentication (IA)
* Incident Response (IR)
* Maintenance (MA)
* Media Protection (MP)
* Personnel Security (PS)
* Physical Protection (PE)
* Risk Assessment (RA)
* Security Assessment (CA)
* System and Communications Protection (SC)
* System and Information Integrity (SI)

The remainder of this article provides guidance for the Access Control (AC) domain. There's a table with links to content that provides step-by-step guidance to accomplish the practice.

## Access Control (AC)

The following table provides a list of control IDs and associated customer responsibilities and guidance.

| *Control* | *Guidance* |

| AC.L2-3.1.3 | Configure Conditional Access policies to control the flow of CUI from trusted locations, trusted devices, approved applications and require app protection policy. For finer grained authorization to CUI, configure app-enforced restrictions(Exchange/SharePoint Online), App Control (with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps), Authentication Context.

|AC.L2-3.1.4 | Ensuring adequate separation of duties by scoping appropriate access. Configure Entitlement Management Access packages to govern access to applications, groups, Teams and SharePoint sites. Configure Separation of Duties checks within access packages to avoid a user obtaining excessive access. In Azure AD entitlement management, you can configure multiple policies, with different settings for each user community that will need access through an access package. This configuration includes restrictions such that a user of a particular group, or already assigned a different access package, isn't assigned other access packages, by policy.<br><br>Configure administrative units in Azure Active Directory to scope administrative privilege so that administrators with privileged roles are scoped to only have those privileges on limited set of directory objects(users, groups, devices).<br>[What is entitlement management?](../governance/entitlement-management-overview.md)<br>[What are access packages and what resources can I manage with them?](../governance/entitlement-management-overview.md)<br>[Configure separation of duties for an access package in Azure AD entitlement management](../governance/entitlement-management-access-package-incompatible.md)<br>[Administrative units in Azure Active Directory](../roles/administrative-units.md)|

This action can be accomplished with Privileged Identity Management for configuring enforcement, monitoring, and alerting. Set requirements and conditions for role membership.<br><br>Once privileged accounts are identified and managed, use [Entitlement Lifecycle Management](../governance/entitlement-management-overview.md) and [Access reviews](../governance/access-reviews-overview.md) to set, maintain and audit adequate access.

| AC.L2-3.1.6<br><br>AC.L2-3.1.7 |Requirements in AC.L2-3.1.6 and AC.L2-3.1.7 complement each other. Require separate accounts for privilege and non-privileged use. Configure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to bring just-in-time(JIT) privileged access and remove standing access. Configure role based conditional access policies to limit access to productivity application for privileged users. For highly privileged users, secure devices as part of the privileged access story.

| AC.L2-3.1.9 | With Azure AD, you can deliver notification or banner messages for all apps that require and record acknowledgment before granting access. You can granularly target these terms of use policies to specific users (Member or Guest). You can also customize them per application via conditional access policies.<br><br>**Conditional access** <br>[What is conditional access in Azure AD?](../conditional-access/overview.md)<br><br>**Terms of use**<br>[Azure Active Directory terms of use](../conditional-access/terms-of-use.md)<br>[View report of who has accepted and declined](../conditional-access/terms-of-use.md) |
| AC.L2-3.1.10 | Implement device lock by using a conditional access policy to restrict access to compliant or hybrid Azure AD joined devices. Configure policy settings on the device to enforce device lock at the OS level with MDM solutions such as Intune. Endpoint Manager or group policy objects can also be considered in hybrid deployments. For unmanaged devices, configure the Sign-In Frequency setting to force users to reauthenticate.<br>[Require device to be marked as compliant](../conditional-access/require-managed-devices.md)<br>[Grant controls in Conditional Access policy - Require hybrid Azure AD joined device](../conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant.md)<br>[User sign-in frequency](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-session-lifetime.md)<br><br>Configure devices for maximum minutes of inactivity until the screen locks ([Android](/mem/intune/configuration/device-restrictions-android), [iOS](/mem/intune/configuration/device-restrictions-ios), [Windows 10](/mem/intune/configuration/device-restrictions-windows-10)).|
| AC.L2-3.1.11 | Enable Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE) for all supported applications. For application that don't support CAE, or for conditions not applicable to CAE, implement policies in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to automatically terminate sessions when conditions occur. Additionally, configure Azure Active Directory Identity Protection to evaluate user and sign-in Risk.

|AC.L2-3.1.12 | In today’s world, users access cloud-based applications almost exclusively remotely from unknown or untrusted networks. It's critical to securing this pattern of access to adopt zero trust principals.
