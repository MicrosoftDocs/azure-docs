# Add or request access to applications in the My Apps (preview) portal

The **My Apps** (preview) portal lists your organization's applications for use. If there are other apps you need, you can add them to your workspace using a self-service process. If you don't see the app you need, it means that your administrator hasn't set up or shared it with you. Contact your organization's Helpdesk for additional assistance or permissions to see shared app.

>[!Important]
>This content is intended for users. If you're an administrator, you can find more information about how to set up and manage your cloud-based apps in the [Application Management Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps).

## Add apps to a workspace

When you select and view a workspace, you only see the default applications that you have access to. Not all available applications are listed. For example, you may have a *Design* workspace. A new design app is available that requires a license, so your administrator only wants people who need to use app to have access. The administrator adds the app to the *Design* workspace, but it's not shown by default. Anyone with access to the *Design* workspace can request access for that new app as needed.

You can find and request access to the other applications in a workspace by choosing **Add app** within the workspace.

When you add an app, there's a category called *Your Company Apps* that shows all the apps your administrator has set up for self-service. You can also see categories for the **My Apps** workspaces available to you.

Select and add one of the apps from the list. The app is added to both your *All* workspace, as well as the workspace the category was named after.
