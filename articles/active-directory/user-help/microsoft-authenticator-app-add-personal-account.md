# Add your personal Microsoft account
You can add your personal accounts, such as for Outlook.com, Xbox LIVE, Google, or Facebook, to the Microsoft Authenticator app for two-factor verification.

>[!Important]
>Before you can add your account, you have to download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app. If you haven't done that yet, follow the steps in the [Download and install the app](microsoft-authenticator-app-how-to.md) article.

## Add your personal Microsoft account

1. On your PC, go to your [Security basics](https://account.microsoft.com/security) page and sign-in using your personal Microsoft account.

2. At the bottom of the **Security basics** page, choose the **More security options** link.

3. Go to the **Two-step verification** section and choose to turn the feature **On**. You can also turn it off here if you no longer want to use it with your personal account.

4. Open the Microsoft Authenticator app on your mobile device.

5. Select **Add account** from the **Customize and control** icon in the upper-right, and then select **Personal account**.

6. Enter the email address for your personal account, (such as alain@outlook.com) and then choose **Next**.

    >[!Note]
    >If you don't have a personal Microsoft account, you have the ability to create one here.

7. Enter your password, and then choose **Sign in**.

    Your account is added to the Microsoft Authenticator app.

### Add a personal Google account
You can add your personal Google account to the Microsoft Authenticator app.

1. On your PC, go to the two-step verification section of your Google account.

2. Sign in to your account and follow all of the instructions to turn on two-factor verification.

For more information about two-factor verification and your Google account, see [Turn on 2-Step Verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839).

3. Open the Microsoft Authenticator app, select **Add account** from the **Customize and control** icon in the upper-right, and then select **Other account (Google, Facebook, etc)**.

4. Use your device's camera to scan the QR code from the account screen on your PC (for example, the **Authenticator Set up** page of your Google account or the **Add a new app** section from your Facebook account), and then choose **Done**.

    >[!Note]
    >If your camera isn't working properly, you can [enter the QR code and URL manually](#add-an-account-to-the-app-manually).

5. Review the **Accounts** screen of the app on your device, to make sure your account is right and that there's an associated six-digit verification code. For additional security, the verification code changes every 30 seconds preventing you from using the same code twice.

### Add a personal Facebook account
You can add your personal Facebook account to the Microsoft Authenticator app.
