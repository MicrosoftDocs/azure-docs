> If you're having issues signing in to your account, see [When you can't sign in to your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12429) for help.  Also, you can get more info about what to do when you receive the [“That Microsoft account doesn't exist”](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13811) message when you try to sign in to your Microsoft account.

The Microsoft Authenticator app helps you sign in to your accounts if you use two-factor verification. Two-factor verification helps you to use your accounts more securely because passwords can be forgotten, stolen, or compromised. Two-factor verification uses a second factor like your phone to make it harder for other people to break in to your account. You can use the Microsoft Authenticator app in multiple ways, including:

- **Two-factor verification.** The standard verification method, where one of the factors is your password. After you sign in using your username and password, you can either approve a notification or enter a provided verification code.

- **Phone sign-in.** A version of two-factor verification that lets you sign in without requiring a password, using your username and your mobile device with your fingerprint, face, or PIN.

- **Code generation.** As a code generator for any other accounts that support authenticator apps.

Authenticator works with any account that uses two-factor verification and supports the time-based one-time password (TOTP) standards.

Your organization might require you to use the Authenticator app to sign in and access your organization's data and documents. Even if your user name appears in the app, the account isn't set up as a verification method until you complete the registration. For more information, see [Add your work or school account](user-help-auth-app-add-work-school-account.md).
