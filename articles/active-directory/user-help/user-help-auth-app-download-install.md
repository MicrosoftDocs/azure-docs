# Download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app
>[!Important]
>This content is intended for users. If you're an administrator, you can find more information about how to set up and manage your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) environment in the [Azure Active Directory Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory).

The Microsoft Authenticator app helps you sign-in to your accounts if you use two-factor verification. Two-factor verification helps you to access your accounts more securely, especially while viewing sensitive information. Because passwords can be forgotten, stolen, or compromised, two-factor verification is an additional security step that helps protect your account by making it harder for other people to break in.

You can use the Microsoft Authenticator app in multiple ways, including:

- **Two-factor verification.** The standard verification method, where one of the factors is your password. After you sign-in using your username and password, you can either approve a notification or enter a provided verification code.

- **Phone sign-in.** A version of two-factor verification that lets you sign-in without requiring a password, using your username and your mobile device with your fingerprint, face, or PIN.

- **Code generation.** As a code generator for any other accounts that support authenticator apps.

> [!Important]
> The Microsoft Authenticator app works with any account that uses two-factor verification and supports the time-based one-time password (TOTP) standards.
> 
> Your organization might require you to use an authenticator app to sign-in and access your organizational data and documents. Although your user name might appear in the app, the account isn't actually set up to act as a verification method until you complete the registration process. For more information, see [Add your work or school account](user-help-auth-app-add-work-school-account.md).
> 
> [!NOTE]
> If you're having issues signing in to your account, see [When you can't sign in to your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12429) for help.  Get more info about what to do when you receive the [“That Microsoft account doesn't exist”](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13811) message when you try to sign in to your Microsoft account.
