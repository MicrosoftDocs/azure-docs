# View recent sign-in activity from the My Sign-ins (preview) portal

You can view all of your recent work or school account sign-in activity, from the **My Sign-ins** portal.

[!INCLUDE [preview-notice](../../../includes/active-directory-end-user-preview-notice-myprofile.md)]

## View your recent sign-in activity

1. Sign in to your work or school account and then go to your https://myprofile.microsoft.com/ page.

2. Select **My Sign-ins** from the left navigation pane or select the **Review activity** link from the **Recent activity** block.

    ![My Profile page, showing highlighted Recent activity links](media/myprofile-portal/myprofile-portal-recent-activity-links.png)

3. Expand and review each of the sign-in items, making sure that you recognize each one. If you find an sign-in item that doesn't look familiar, we highly recommend you change your password to help protect your account if it was compromised.
