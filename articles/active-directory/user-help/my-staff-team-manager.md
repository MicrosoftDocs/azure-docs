# Delegate user management with My Staff (preview)

Your organization can use **My Staff** to delegate user management tasks to figures of authority, such as a store manager or team leader, to help their staff members access the applications that they need. If your team member can't access an application because they forget a password, productivity is lost. This also drives up support costs and causes a bottleneck in your administrative processes.  With My Staff, a team member who can't access their account can regain access in just a couple of clicks, with no administrator help required.

## Manage your staff in My Staff

Managing your team members in My Staff is simple. To start, [go to My Staff](https://aka.ms/mystaff), select a team or location, and then select a user. Locations and the team members in a location are determined by your IT administrator and you can't change them.

If you manage more than one location, when you go to My Staff you must select a location to see the team member who are assigned to the location.

If you don't yet have sufficient permissions to access My Staff, you'll see the following message "Oops, seems you're not authorized to see My Staff at this time. Please contact your admin for more information."

### Find a staff member in My Staff

You must open the profile of a staff member before you can start managing them.
