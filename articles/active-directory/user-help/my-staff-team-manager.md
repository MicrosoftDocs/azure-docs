# Delegate user management with My Staff (preview)

Your organization can use **My Staff** to delegate user management tasks to figures of authority, such as a store manager or team leader, to help their staff members access the applications that they need. If your team member can't access an application because they forget a password, productivity is lost. This also drives up support costs and causes a bottleneck in your administrative processes.  With My Staff, a team member who can't access their account can regain access in just a couple of clicks, with no administrator help required.

## Manage your staff in My Staff

Managing your team members in My Staff is simple. To start, [go to My Staff](https://aka.ms/mystaff), select a team or location, and then select a user. Locations and the team members in a location are determined by your IT administrator and you can't change them.

If you manage more than one location or group of staff members, when you go to My Staff you must select a location to see the list of staff who are part of the location or team.

If you don't yet have sufficient permissions to access My Staff, you'll see the following message:

## Reset a user password

If your organization has given you permission, you can reset passwords for your staff members.

1. [Open My Staff](https://aka.ms/mystaff).
1. Open a staff member's profile.
1. Select **Reset password**.
1. Generate or enter the new password. You might be shown an automatically generated temporary password or you might be asked to enter a temporary password for the user.

After you have reset the user's password, give the user the temporary password. When the user signs in with their temporary password, they are required to change it.
