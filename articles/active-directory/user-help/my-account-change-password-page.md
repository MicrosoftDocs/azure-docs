# Change your work or school account password from the My Account portal

From the **Change password** page of the **My Account** portal, you can update your work or school account password. This will only work if you know your existing password and if you aren't locked out of your account.

If you don't remember your password, if you've been locked out of your account, or if you never got a password from your company support team, you can use your security info and your mobile device to reset your password. For more information, see [Reset your work or school password](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/user-help/user-help-reset-password).

>[!Note]
>If you're trying to get back into a personal account like for Xbox, hotmail.com, or outlook.com, try the suggestions in the [When you can't sign in to your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12429/microsoft-account-sign-in-cant) article.

## To change your password from the My Account portal

1. Sign in to your work or school account, using your existing password, and then go to your https://myprofile.microsoft.com/ page.

2. Select **Password** from the left navigation pane or select the **Change password** link from the **Password** block.
