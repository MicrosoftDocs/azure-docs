# Switching organizations in a portal

We're looking to add some documentation about switching between organizations (tenants) in our end user docs. We wanted to get your opinion on the best location to add the documentation.

The organization picker is available in the following portals:

- [**My Account**](https://myaccount.microsoft.com)
- [**My Apps**](https://myapps.microsoft.com)
- [**My Access**](https://myaccess.microsoft.com)
- [**My Staff**](https://mystaff.microsoft.com)

Switching organization is not available for **My Sign-ins**, **Security info** or **My Groups**.

Your account and access portals, such as the **My Account** portal for your Microsoft accounts, lets you switch to other organizations you might work with to manage your account information with other organizations.

## Switch organizations

For example, to switch to another organization in the **My Account** portal:

1. Sign in to your work or school account, and then open the [My Account](https://myaccount.microsoft.com) page.
1. Select the organization switcher :::image type="content" source="media/cross-tenant-switcher/switcher-icon.png" alt-text="The icon for the organization switcher"::: at the top of the page, next to your account photo.

   :::image type="content" source="media/cross-tenant-switcher/switcher-location.png" alt-text="The menu of organizations you can switch to":::

1. Select the organization to which you would like to switch. You'll automatically be switched to the organization you selected.

If the organization you selected has additional security requirements, you might be prompted to provide an additional piece of security information.

## After switching

After you switched organizations, all portal pages will reflect the organization you selected.

> [!Note]
> If you're signed in to an organization that isn't your home organization and then select **Password** on the My Account Overview page or other places where it appears, you are immediately switched back to your home organization. This is because the password you use to sign in to your home organization is used to sign you in to other organizations.
> In the My Staff portal, if you switch to another organization, they'll only have access to My Staff if you are enabled for My Staff in that organization.
