# Sign in and start apps from the My Apps portal

You can use your work or school account with the web-based **My Apps** portal to:

- Go to the [**My Groups** portal](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r#/groups)
- Go to the [**My Account** portal](https://myaccount.microsoft.com/)

If you don’t have access to the **My Apps** portal, contact your organization's Help desk for permission.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This content is intended for **My Apps** users. If you're an administrator, you can find more information about how to set up and manage your cloud-based apps in the [Application Management Documentation](../manage-apps/index.yml).

- Microsoft Edge (the mobile version of Edge is currently the only supported mobile browser)

## Access and use the My Apps portal on your computer

If you have permission to access and use your organization's cloud-based apps, you can get to them through the **My Apps** portal.

1. Sign in to your work or school account on your computer.

1. In a supported web browser, go to https://myapps.microsoft.com, or use the link provided by your organization if they direct you to a customized page such as `https://myapps.microsoft.com/contoso.com`.

   The **Apps** page appears, showing all the cloud-based apps owned by your organization that are available for you to use.

1. From the **Apps** page, select the app you want to start using.

   A new page opens for the app, where you can sign in (if necessary) or begin using the app.

### Download and install the My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension

Download and install the **My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension**, if you're prompted. This extension helps you use your desktop browser to use single sign-on with your organization's cloud apps. Just hover over an app in the **My Apps** portal, select **...**, then select **Manage your application**.

If your organization has already set you up for single sign-on, the extension is installed automatically and you can skip this section.

The **My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension** helps you:

- Sign in directly to apps from the sign-in page.
- Start any apps using the **Quick search** feature.
- See the last apps you used in the **Recently Used** section.
- Use internal company URLs when remote using [Application Proxy](../manage-apps/application-proxy.md).

### To download and install the extension

Download and install the extension, based on the browser you're using.

- **Microsoft Edge** - From the Microsoft Store, go to the [My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/my-apps-secure-signin-ex/gaaceiggkkiffbfdpmfapegoiohkiipl) feature, and then select **Get** to get the extension for Microsoft Edge legacy browser.

- **Google Chrome** - From the Chrome Web Store, go to the [My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/my-apps-secure-sign-in-ex/ggjhpefgjjfobnfoldnjipclpcfbgbhl) feature, and then select **Add to Chrome**.

- **Mozilla Firefox** - From the **Firefox Add-ons** page, go to the [My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/access-panel-extension/) feature, and then select **Add to Firefox**.

An icon is added to the right of your **Address** bar, letting you sign in and customize the extension.

### To change your My Apps portal using the extension

You can choose how many apps to view in the **Recently Used** section and decide whether to allow your organization's internal URLs to redirect.

1. Select the new **My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension** icon ![Extension icon](media/my-apps-portal/my-apps-portal-extension-icon.png) to the right of your **Address** bar, and then select **Sign in to get started**.

1. Right-click the **Settings** icon ![Settings icon](media/my-apps-portal/my-apps-portal-extension-settings-icon.png), and then select **Settings**.

## Access and use the My Apps portal on mobile Edge

View and use your organization's apps from the mobile version of the Edge browser on your devices.

1. On your mobile device, download and install the mobile Edge browser app from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.

1. Open the mobile Edge browser and go to https://myapps.microsoft.com, or use the link provided by your organization if they direct you to a customized page, such as https://myapps.microsoft.com/contoso.com.

   The **Apps** page appears, showing all the cloud-based apps owned by your organization and available for you to use.

1. From the **Apps** page, select the app you want to start using.

   A new page opens for the app, where you can sign in (if necessary) or begin using the app.

## Add a new app to the My Apps portal

If your administrator has given you permission, you can add a new app to the **Apps** page.

1. From the **Apps** page, select **Add self-service apps**.

   ![Add apps page, in the My Apps portal at myapplications.microsoft.com](media/my-apps-portal/my-apps-portal-add-app-link.png)

1. Select the app you want to add from the provided list, and then select **Add**.

1. The app is added to the list on the **Apps** page.

   Some apps might require administrator approval before being added. When that happens, the app isn't added to the **Apps** page until the administrator approves it.

## Start a cloud-based app

You can start any of the available cloud-based apps from the **My Apps** portal. You'll only see apps you have permission to use.

- From the **Apps** page, select the app you want to start using.

   A new page opens for the app, where you can sign in (if necessary) or begin using the app.

## Activities in the My Apps portal

>[!NOTE]
>If you don't see any collections or categories available, it means that your administrator hasn't set up or shared any with you. Contact your organization's help desk for additional assistance or permissions to see shared collections.
