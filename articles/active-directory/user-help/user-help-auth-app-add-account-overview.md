# Overview about adding accounts to the Microsoft Authenticator app

The Microsoft Authenticator app helps you sign-in to your accounts if you use two-factor verification. Two-factor verification helps you to access your accounts more securely, especially while viewing sensitive information. Because passwords can be forgotten, stolen, or compromised, two-factor verification is an additional security step that helps protect your account by making it harder for other people to break in.

> [!Important]
> The Microsoft Authenticator app works with any app that uses two-factor verification and any account that supports the time-based one-time password (TOTP) standards.
> 
> This content is intended for users. If you're an administrator, you can find more information about how to set up and manage your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) environment in the [Azure Active Directory Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory).

You can use the Microsoft Authenticator app in multiple ways, including:

- Providing a prompt for a second verification method after you sign in with your username and password.

- Providing sign-in without requiring a password, using your username and your mobile device with your fingerprint, face, or PIN.

## What account types can I add
You can turn on two-factor verification for many accounts that you use every day, including:

|Account type|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|Work or school accounts|The account your work or school organization gave you, for example alain@contoso.com.|
|Personal accounts|The Microsoft and non-Microsoft accounts you've personally opened, such as for Outlook.com, Xbox LIVE, Google, Facebook, and more.|
