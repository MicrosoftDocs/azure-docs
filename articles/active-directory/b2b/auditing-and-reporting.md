# Auditing and reporting a B2B collaboration user
With guest users, you have auditing capabilities similar to with member users. Here's an example of the invitation and redemption history of invitee Sam Oogle:

![audit log](./media/auditing-and-reporting/audit-log.png)

You can dive into each of these events to get the details. For example, let's look at the acceptance details.

![activity details](./media/auditing-and-reporting/activity-details.png)

You can also export these logs from Azure AD and use the reporting tool of your choice to get customized reports.
