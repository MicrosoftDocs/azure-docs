## Create a Conditional Access policy

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal** as a Conditional Access Administrator, Security Administrator, or Global Administrator.
1. Browse to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Conditional Access**.
1. Select **New policy**.
1. Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users or workload identities**.
   1. Under **Include**, select **All users**
   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts.
1. Under **Cloud apps or actions**, select the following options:
   1. Under **Include**, choose **Select apps**.
   1. Choose **Office 365**, then select **Select**.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Session**, select **Use app enforced restrictions**, then select **Select**.
1. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **Report-only**.
1. Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

After confirming your settings using [report-only mode](howto-conditional-access-insights-reporting.md), an administrator can move the **Enable policy** toggle from **Report-only** to **On**.
