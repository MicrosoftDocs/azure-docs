#How to get AppSource Certified for Azure Active Directory (AD) 

To receive AppSource certification for Azure AD, your application must implement the multi-tenant sign in pattern with Azure AD using the OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, or SAML 2.0 protocols. 

If you’re not familiar with Azure AD sign in or multi-tenant application development:

1. Start by reading about the [Browser to Web App scenarios in Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD][AAD-Auth-Scenarios-Browser-To-WebApp]. 
2. Next, check out the Azure AD [web application quick-start guides][AAD-QuickStart-Web-Apps], which demonstrate how to implement sign-in, and include companion code samples. 
3. To learn how to implement the multi-tenant sign in pattern with Azure AD, check out [How to sign in any Azure Active Directory (AD) user using the multi-tenant application pattern][AAD-Howto-Multitenant-Overview]
