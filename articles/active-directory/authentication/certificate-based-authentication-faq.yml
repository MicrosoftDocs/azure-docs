      - question: |
          How do I enable Azure AD CBA?
        answer: |
          1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as a Global Administrator.
          1. Click **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Authentication methods** > **Certificate-based Authentication** > **Basics**, click **On** to enable certificate-based authentication.

      - question: |
          Is Azure AD CBA a free feature?
        answer: |
          Certificate-based authentication is a free feature. 
          Every edition of Azure AD includes Azure AD CBA.
          For more information about features in each Azure AD edition, see [Azure AD pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access-management/azure-ad-pricing).

      - question: |
          Does Azure AD CBA support Alternate ID as the username instead of userPrincipalName?
        answer: |
          No, sign-in using a non-UPN value, such as an alternate email, isn't supported now.
          
      - question: |
          Can I have more than one CRL Distribution Point (CDP) for a Certificate Authority (CA)?
        answer: |
          No, only one CDP is supported per CA.

      - question: |
          Can I have non-http URLs for CDP?
        answer: |
          No, CDP supports only HTTP URLs.

      - question: |
          How do I turn certificate revocation checking on or off for a particular CA?
        answer: |
          We highly recommend not to disable certificate revocation list (CRL) checking as you won't be able to revoke certificates. 
          However, to disable CRL checking if there are issues with CRL for a particular CA, you can update a trusted certificate authority and set the crlDistributionPoint attribute to """.
          
          Use the [Set-AzureADTrustedCertificateAuthority](/powershell/module/azuread/set-azureadtrustedcertificateauthority) cmdlet:
          
          ```powershell
          $c=Get-AzureADTrustedCertificateAuthority
          $c[0]. crlDistributionPoint =””
          Set-AzureADTrustedCertificateAuthority -CertificateAuthorityInformation $c[0]
          ```

      - question: |
          Is there a limit for CRL size?
        answer: |
          Today, as part of the public preview, CRL sizes are limited as follows:
          
          - 20 MB in commercial (Microsoft 365, GCC)
          - 45 MB in US Government (GCC High, Dept. of Defense)

          We're reviewing the impact of these limits during public preview.

      - question: |
          Will the changes to authentication policy change take effect immediately?
        answer: |
          The policy is cached. After a policy update, it may take up to an hour for the changes to be effective.
          
      - question: |
          How do I instantly revoke a certificate?
        answer: |
          Follow the steps to [manually revoke a certificate](active-directory-certificate-based-authentication-get-started.md#step-3-configure-revocation).
