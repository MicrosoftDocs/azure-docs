# View personal and organization information

The **Account settings** dashboard in Permissions Management allows you to view personal information, passwords, and account preferences.
This information can't be modified because the user information is pulled from Azure AD. Only **User Session Time(min)**

## View personal information

1. In the Permissions Management home page, select the down arrow to the right of the **User** (your initials) menu, and then select **Account Settings**.

    The **Personal Information** box displays your **First Name**, **Last Name**, and the **Email Address** that was used to register your account on Permissions Management.

## View current organization information

1. In the Permissions Management home page, select the down arrow to the right of the **User** (your initials) menu, and then select **Account Settings**.

    The **Current Organization Information** displays the **Name** of your organization, the **Tenant ID** box, and the **User Session Timeout (min)**.

1. To change duration of the **User Session Timeout (min)**, select **Edit** (the pencil icon), and then enter the number of minutes before you want a user session to time out.
1. Select the check mark to confirm your new setting.
