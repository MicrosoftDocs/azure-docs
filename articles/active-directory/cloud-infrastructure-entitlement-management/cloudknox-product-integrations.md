# Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management product integrations - introduction

The Integrations function in the Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management application allows you to view subsystems in one place, and to ensure all applications are functioning as one. This provides improved quality and performance as a whole.

## Authorization systems integrated into CloudKnox 

The following authorization systems are integrated into the CloudKnox application:

- **ServiceNow** - Manages digital workflows for enterprise operations, and the CloudKnox integration allows you to request and approve permissions through the ServiceNow ticketing workflow.
- **Splunk** - Searches, monitors, and analyzes machine-generated data, and the CloudKnox integration enables exporting usage analytics data, alerts, and logs.
- **HashiCorp Terraform** - CloudKnox enables the generation of least-privilege policies through the Hashi Terraform provider.
- **CloudKnox API** - The CloudKnox application programming interface (API) provides access to CloudKnox features.
- **Saviynt** - Enables you to view Identity entitlements and usage inside the Saviynt console.
- **Securonix** - Enables exporting usage analytics data, alerts, and logs.
