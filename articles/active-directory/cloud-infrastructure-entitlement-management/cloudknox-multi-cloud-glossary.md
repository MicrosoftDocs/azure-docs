| POD	                | Permissions on Demand     |
| Privilege Creep Index (PCI)	| A number from 0 to 100 that represents the incurred risk of users with access to high-risk privileges. PCI is a function of users who have access to high-risk privileges but aren't actively using them. For example, the capability to modify or delete contents within the authorization system. It's also a function of the number of resources a user has access to, also  known as their resource reach.</p> PCI measures the number of unused high-risk privileges that have been granted to all unique identities. It also takes into account the number of resources that an identity has access to but hasn't touched over the last 90 days.</p> PCI is an indicator of an organization's level of exposure to insider threat risks and their ability to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP). POLP is one of the most fundamental and essential concepts in security.</p> PCI scores of 100 represent the highest risk to the organization. They indicate a high percentage of identities with excessive high-risk privileges and broad access to cloud resources, some of which may be unnecessary to the user.  </p>A zero score represents the lowest risk.    |
| Public Cloud	        | Computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them.
