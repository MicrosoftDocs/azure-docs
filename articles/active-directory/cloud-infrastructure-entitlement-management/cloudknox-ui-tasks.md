This article describes the usage of the **CloudKnox Tasks** pane in CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox).

## Display active and completed tasks

1. In the CloudKnox home page, select **Tasks** (the timer icon).

    The **CloudKnox Tasks** pane appears on the right of the CloudKnox home page. It has two tabs:
    - **Active**: Displays a list of active tasks, a description of each task, and when the task was started.

         If there are no active tasks, the following message displays: **There are no active tasks**.
    - **Completed**: Displays a list of completed tasks, a description of each task, when the task was started and ended, and whether the task **Failed** or **Succeeded**.

         If there are no completed activities, the following message displays: **There are no recently completed tasks**.
1. To close the **CloudKnox Tasks** pane, click outside the pane.
