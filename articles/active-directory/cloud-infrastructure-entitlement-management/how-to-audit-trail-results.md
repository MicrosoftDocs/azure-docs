# Generate an on-demand report from a query

This article describes how you can generate an on-demand report from a query in the **Audit** dashboard in Permissions Management. You can:

- Run a report on-demand.
- Schedule and run a report as often as you want.
- Share a report with other members of your team and management.

## Generate a custom report on-demand

1. In the Permissions Management home page, select the **Audit** tab.

    Permissions Management displays the query options available to you.
1. In the **Audit** dashboard, select **Search** to run the query.
1. Select **Export**.

    Permissions Management generates the report and exports it in comma-separated values (**CSV**) format, portable document format (**PDF**), or Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet (**XLSX**) format.
