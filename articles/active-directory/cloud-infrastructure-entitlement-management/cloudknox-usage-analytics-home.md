# View analytic information with the Analytics dashboard

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) is currently in PREVIEW.
> Some information relates to a prerelease product that may be substantially modified before it's released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

This article provides a brief overview of the Analytics dashboard in CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox), and the type of analytic information it provides for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Display the Analytics dashboard

- From the CloudKnox home page, select the **Analytics** tab.

    The **Analytics** dashboard displays detailed information about: 

    - **Users**: Tracks assigned permissions and usage by users. For more information, see [View analytic information about users](cloudknox-usage-analytics-users.md).

    - **Groups**: Tracks assigned permissions and usage of the group and the group members.  For more information, see [View analytic information about groups](cloudknox-usage-analytics-groups.md).

    - **Active Resources**: Tracks resources that have been used in the last 90 days.  For more information, see [View analytic information about active resources](cloudknox-usage-analytics-active-resources.md).

    - **Active Tasks**: Tracks tasks that have been performed in the last 90 days.  For more information, see [View analytic information about active tasks](cloudknox-usage-analytics-active-tasks.md).

    - **Access Keys**: Tracks the permission usage of access keys for a given user.  For more information, see [View analytic information about access keys](cloudknox-usage-analytics-access-keys.md).

    - **Serverless Functions**: Tracks assigned permissions and usage of the serverless functions for AWS only.  For more information, see [View analytic information about serverless functions](cloudknox-usage-analytics-serverless-functions.md).

    System administrators can use this information to make decisions about granting permissions and reducing risk on unused permissions.
