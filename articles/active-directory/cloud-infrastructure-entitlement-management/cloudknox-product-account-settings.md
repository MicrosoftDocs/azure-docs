# Set personal information and preferences

The **Account settings** dashboard in Microsoft CloudKnox Permissions Management (CloudKnox) allows you to set personal information, passwords, and account preferences.

## Display the Account settings dashboard

- In the CloudKnox home page, select the down arrow to the right of the **User** (your initials) menu, and then select **Account settings**.

## Set personal information

1. On the **Account settings** dashboard, under **Personal information**, select **Edit**.

2. In the **First name** and **Last name** boxes, enter the user's name. 

     The **Email** field can't be modified because the CloudKnox account is linked to the email address used to register on the application.

## Set company information

1. On the **Account settings** dashboard, under **Company information**, select **Edit**.

2. In the **Company** box, enter the name of the company. 

     The company name appears in the top-left part of the application.

3. In the **Title** box, enter the user's title.

## Set account preferences

1. On the **Account settings** dashboard, under **Account preferences**, select **Edit**.

2. In the box next to **User session timeout (min)**, enter the number of minutes before you want a user session to time out.

## View information about your organizations

The **Organizations information** page displays the following information:

- **Name** - The organization name.
- **Title** - The user's title, if applicable.
- **Current** - A check mark displays here to indicate the user is current.
- **Primary** - A check mark displays here to indicate the user belongs to the primary organization.

If you're part of multiple organizations:

- You can switch to a particular organization. You'll be asked to sign in into that organization when you make the change.
- You can assign another organization as the primary organization. Next time you sign in, you'll sign in to your primary organization.

## Change the password for your account 

1. On the **Account settings** page, under **Change password**, enter the following details:

      - **Current password**
      - **New password**
      - **Confirm password**

2. Select **Change password**.
