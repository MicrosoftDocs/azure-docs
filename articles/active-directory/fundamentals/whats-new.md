## October 2019

### Deprecation of the identityRiskEvent API for Azure AD Identity Protection risk detections  

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Identity Protection  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

In response to developer feedback, Azure AD Premium P2 subscribers can now perform complex queries on Azure AD Identity Protection’s risk detection data by using the new riskDetection API for Microsoft Graph. The existing [identityRiskEvent](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/identityriskevent?view=graph-rest-beta) API beta version will stop returning data around **January 10, 2020**. If your organization is using the identityRiskEvent API, you should transition to the new riskDetection API.

For more information about the new riskDetection API, see the [Risk detection API reference documentation](https://aka.ms/RiskDetectionsAPI).

### Application Proxy support for the SameSite Attribute and Chrome 80

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** App Proxy  
**Product capability:** Access Control

A couple of weeks prior to the Chrome 80 browser release, we plan to update how Application Proxy cookies treat the **SameSite** attribute. With the release of Chrome 80, any cookie that doesn't specify the **SameSite** attribute will be treated as though it was set to `SameSite=Lax`.

To help avoid potentially negative impacts due to this change, we're updating Application Proxy access and session cookies by:

- Setting the default value for the **Use Secure Cookie** setting to **Yes**.

- Setting the default value for the **SameSite** attribute to **None**.

    >[!NOTE]
    > Application Proxy access cookies have always been transmitted exclusively over secure channels. These changes only apply to session cookies.

For more information about the Application Proxy cookie settings, see [Cookie settings for accessing on-premises applications in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-configure-cookie-settings).

### Users are no longer required to re-register during migration from per-user MFA to Conditional Access-based MFA

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

We've fixed a known issue whereby when users were required to re-register if they were disabled for per-user Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and then enabled for MFA through a Conditional Access policy.

To require users to re-register, you can select the **Required re-register MFA** option from the user's authentication methods in the Azure AD portal. For more information about migrating users from per-user MFA to Conditional Access-based MFA, see [Convert users from per-user MFA to Conditional Access based MFA](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted#convert-users-from-per-user-mfa-to-conditional-access-based-mfa).

### Office 365 groups expiration policy enhanced with autorenewal

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Group Management  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management

The Office 365 groups expiration policy has been enhanced to automatically renew groups that are actively in use by its members. Groups will be autorenewed based on user activity across all the Office 365 apps, including Outlook, SharePoint, and Teams.

This enhancement helps to reduce your group expiration notifications and helps to make sure that active groups continue to be available. If you already have an active expiration policy for your Office 365 groups, you don't need to do anything to turn on this new functionality.

For more information, see [Configure the expiration policy for Office 365 groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-lifecycle).

### Dynamic consent is now supported through a new admin consent endpoint

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

We've created a new admin consent endpoint to support dynamic consent, which is helpful for apps that want to use the dynamic consent model on the Microsoft Identity platform.

### New Azure AD Global Reader role

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** RBAC  
**Product capability:** Access Control

Starting on September 24, 2019, we're going to start rolling out a new Azure Active Directory (AD) role called Global Reader. This rollout will start with production and Global cloud customers (GCC), finishing up worldwide in October.

The Global Reader role is the read-only counterpart to Global Administrator. Users in this role can read settings and administrative information across Microsoft 365 services, but can't take management actions. We’ve created the Global Reader role to help reduce the number of Global Administrators in your organization. Because Global Administrator accounts are powerful and vulnerable to attack, we recommend that you have fewer than five Global Administrators. We recommend using the Global Reader role for planning, audits, or investigations. We also recommend using the Global Reader role in combination with other limited administrator roles, like Exchange Administrator, to help get work done without requiring the Global Administrator role.

The Global Reader role works with the new Microsoft 365 Admin Center, Exchange Admin Center, Teams Admin Center, Security Center, Compliance Center, Azure AD Admin Center, and the Device Management Admin Center.

>[!NOTE]
> At the start of public preview, the Global Reader role won't work with: SharePoint, Privileged Access Management, Customer Lockbox, sensitivity labels, Teams Lifecycle, Teams Reporting & Call Analytics, Teams IP Phone Device Management, and Teams App Catalog. All of these services are intended to work with the role in the future.

For more information, see [Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles).

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** RBAC  
**Product capability:** Access Control

Custom roles (available with an Azure AD P1 or P2 subscription) can now help provide you with fine-grained access, by letting you create role definitions with specific permissions and then to assign those roles to specific resources. Currently, you create custom roles by using permissions for managing app registrations and then assigning the role to a specific app. For more information about custom roles, see [Custom administrator roles in Azure Active Directory (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/roles-custom-overview).

If you need additional permissions or resources supported, which you don’t currently see, you can send feedback to our [Azure feedback site](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/169401-azure-active-directory?category_id=166032) and we’ll add your request to our update road map.

### ADAL.NET ignores the MSAL.NET shared cache for on-behalf-of scenarios

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Starting with Azure AD authentication library (ADAL.NET) version 5.0.0-preview, app developers must [serialize one cache per account for web apps and web APIs](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Token-cache-serialization#custom-token-cache-serialization-in-web-applications--web-api). Otherwise, some scenarios using the [on-behalf-of flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-web-api-call-api-app-configuration#on-behalf-of-flow), along with some specific use cases of `UserAssertion`, may result in an elevation of privilege. To avoid this vulnerability, ADAL.NET now ignores the Microsoft authentication library for dotnet (MSAL.NET) shared cache for on-behalf-of scenarios.

For more information about this issue, see [Azure Active Directory Authentication Library Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1258).

### Update your users to the new, enhanced security info experience

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:**  Authentications (Logins)   
**Product capability:** User Authentication

On September 25, 2019, we'll be turning off the old, non-enhanced security info experience for registering and managing user security info and only turning on the new, [enhanced version](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Active-Directory-Identity/Cool-enhancements-to-the-Azure-AD-combined-MFA-and-password/ba-p/354271). This means that your users will no longer be able to use the old experience.

For more information about the enhanced security info experience, see our [admin documentation](https://aka.ms/securityinfodocs) and our [user documentation](https://aka.ms/securityinfoguide).

#### To turn on this new experience, you must:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal as a Global Administrator or User Administrator.

2. Go to **Azure Active Directory > User settings > Manage settings for access panel preview features**.

3. In the **Users can use preview features for registering and managing security info - enhanced** area, select **Selected**, and then either choose a group of users or choose **All** to turn this feature on for all users in the tenant.

4. In the **Users can use preview features for registering and managing security **info**** area, select **None**.

5. Save your settings.

    After you save your settings you'll no longer have access to the old security info experience.

>[!Important]
>If you don't complete these steps before September 25, 2019, your Azure Active Directory tenant will be automatically enabled for the enhanced experience. If you have questions, please contact us at registrationpreview@microsoft.com.

### Authentication requests using POST logins will be more strictly validated

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Standards

Starting on September 2, 2019, authentication requests using the POST method will be more strictly validated against the HTTP standards. Specifically, spaces and double-quotes (") will no longer be removed from request form values. These changes aren't expected to break any existing clients, and will help to make sure that requests sent to Azure AD are reliably handled every time.

For more information, see the [Azure AD breaking changes notices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-breaking-changes#post-form-semantics-will-be-enforced-more-strictly---spaces-and-quotes-will-be-ignored).

## July 2019

### Plan for change: Application Proxy service update to support only TLS 1.2

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** App Proxy  
**Product capability:** Access Control

To help provide you with our strongest encryption, we're going to begin limiting Application Proxy service access to only TLS 1.2 protocols. This limitation will initially be rolled out to customers who are already using TLS 1.2 protocols, so you won't see the impact. Complete deprecation of the TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols will be complete on August 31, 2019. Customers still using TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 will receive advanced notice to prepare for this change.

To maintain the connection to the Application Proxy service throughout this change, we recommend that you make sure your client-server and browser-server combinations are updated to use TLS 1.2. We also recommend that you make sure to include any client systems used by your employees to access apps published through the Application Proxy service.

For more information, see [Add an on-premises application for remote access through Application Proxy in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application).

### Plan for change: Removal of the MFA server IP address from the Office 365 IP address

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

We're removing the MFA server IP address from the [Office 365 IP Address and URL Web service](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/office-365-ip-web-service). If you currently rely on these pages to update your firewall settings, you must make sure you're also including the list of IP addresses documented in the **Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server firewall requirements** section of the [Getting started with the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfaserver-deploy#azure-multi-factor-authentication-server-firewall-requirements) article.

### App-only tokens now require the client app to exist in the resource tenant

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

On July 26, 2019, we changed how we provide app-only tokens through the [client credentials grant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow). Previously, apps could get tokens to call other apps, regardless of whether the client app was in the tenant. We've updated this behavior so single-tenant resources, sometimes called Web APIs, can only be called by client apps that exist in the resource tenant.

If your app isn't located in the resource tenant, you'll get an error message that says, `The service principal named <app_name> was not found in the tenant named <tenant_name>. This can happen if the application has not been installed by the administrator of the tenant.` To fix this problem, you must create the client app service principal in the tenant, using either the [admin consent endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#using-the-admin-consent-endpoint) or [through PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell), which ensures your tenant has given the app permission to operate within the tenant.

For more information, see [What's new for authentication?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-breaking-changes#app-only-tokens-for-single-tenant-applications-are-only-issued-if-the-client-app-exists-in-the-resource-tenant).

> [!NOTE]
> Existing consent between the client and the API continues to not be required. Apps should still be doing their own authorization checks.

### New check for duplicate group names in the Azure AD portal

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Group Management  
**Product capability:** Collaboration

Now, when you create or update a group name from the Azure AD portal, we'll perform a check to see if you are duplicating an existing group name in your resource. If we determine that the name is already in use by another group, you'll be asked to modify your name.

For more information, see [Manage groups in the Azure AD portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal?context=azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/context/ugr-context).

### Azure AD now supports static query parameters in reply (redirect) URIs

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Azure AD apps can now register and use reply (redirect) URIs with static query parameters (for example, `https://contoso.com/oauth2?idp=microsoft`) for OAuth 2.0 requests. The static query parameter is subject to string matching for reply URIs, just like any other part of the reply URI. If there's no registered string that matches the URL-decoded redirect-uri, the request is rejected. If the reply URI is found, the entire string is used to redirect the user, including the static query parameter.

Dynamic reply URIs are still forbidden because they represent a security risk and can't be used to retain state information across an authentication request. For this purpose, use the `state` parameter.

Currently, the app registration screens of the Azure portal still block query parameters. However, you can manually edit the app manifest to add and test query parameters in your app. For more information, see [What's new for authentication?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-breaking-changes#redirect-uris-can-now-contain-query-string-parameters).
