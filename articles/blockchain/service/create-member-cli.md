# Quickstart: Create an Azure Blockchain Service using CLI

Azure Blockchain Service is a blockchain platform that you can execute your business logic within a smart contract. This quickstart shows you how to get started by creating a managed ledger using Azure CLI.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Create a managed ledger

Azure Blockchain Service is created with a defined set of compute and storage resources.

1. Use CLI.

## Clean up resources

You can use the member you created for the next quickstart or tutorial. When no longer needed, you can delete the resources by deleting the `myresourcegroup` resource group you created by the Azure Blockchain Service.

To delete the resource group:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Resource group** in the left navigation pane and select the resource group you want to delete.
2. Select **Delete resource group**. Verify deletion by entering the resource group name and select **Delete**.
