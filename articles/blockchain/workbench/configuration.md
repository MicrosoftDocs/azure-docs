# Azure Blockchain Workbench configuration reference

 Azure Blockchain Workbench applications are multi-party workflows defined by configuration metadata and smart contract code. Configuration metadata defines the high-level workflows and interaction model of the blockchain application. Smart contracts define the business logic of the blockchain application. Workbench uses configuration and smart contract code to generate blockchain application user experiences.

Configuration metadata specifies the following information for each blockchain application:

* Name and description of the blockchain application
* Unique roles for users who can act or participate within the blockchain application
* One or more workflows. Each workflow acts as a state machine to control the flow of the business logic. Workflows can be independent or interact with one another.

Each defined workflow specifies the following:

* Name and description of the workflow
* States of the workflow.  Each state is a stage in the business logic's control flow. 
* Actions to transition to the next state
* User roles permitted to initiate each action
* Smart contracts that represent business logic in code files

## Application

A blockchain application contains configuration metadata, workflows, and user roles who can act or participate within the application.

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|:--------:|
| ApplicationName | Unique application name. The corresponding smart contract must use the same **ApplicationName** for the applicable contract class.  | Yes |
| DisplayName | Friendly display name of the application. | Yes |
| Description | Description of the application. | No |
| ApplicationRoles | Collection of [ApplicationRoles](#application-roles). User roles who can act or participate within the application.  | Yes |
| Workflows | Collection of  [Workflows](#workflows). Each workflow acts as a state machine to control the flow of the business logic. | Yes |

For an example, see [configuration file example](#configuration-file-example).

## Workflows

An application's business logic may be modeled as a state machine where taking an action causes the flow of the business logic to move from one state to another. A workflow is a collection of such states and actions. Each workflow consists of one or more smart contracts, which represent the business logic in code files. An executable contract is an instance of a workflow.

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|:--------:|
| Name | Unique workflow name. The corresponding smart contract must use the same **Name** for the applicable contract class. | Yes |
| DisplayName | Friendly display name of the workflow. | Yes |
| Description | Description of the workflow. | No |
| Initiators | Collection of [ApplicationRoles](#application-roles). Roles that are assigned to users who are authorized to create contracts in the workflow. | Yes |
| StartState | Name of the initial state of the workflow. | Yes |
| Properties | Collection of [identifiers](#identifiers). Represents data that can be read off-chain or visualized in a user experience tool. | Yes |
| Constructor | Defines input parameters for creating an instance of the workflow. | Yes |
| Functions | A collection of [functions](#functions) that can be executed in the workflow. | Yes |
| States | A collection of workflow [states](#states). | Yes |

For an example, see [configuration file example](#configuration-file-example).

## Type

Supported data types.

| Type | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| address  | Blockchain address type, such as *contracts* or *users*. |
| array    | Single level array of type integer, bool, money, or time. Arrays can be static or dynamic. Use **ElementType** to specify the datatype of the elements within the array. See [example configuration](#example-configuration-of-type-array). |
| bool     | Boolean data type. |
| contract | Address of type contract. |
| enum     | Enumerated set of named values. When using the enum type, you also specify a list of EnumValues. Each value is limited to 255 characters. Valid value characters include upper and lower case letters (A-Z, a-z) and numbers (0-9). See [example configuration and use in Solidity](#example-configuration-of-type-enum). |
| int      | Integer data type. |
| money    | Money data type. |
| state    | Workflow state. |
| string  | String data type. 4000 character maximum. See [example configuration](#example-configuration-of-type-string). |
| user     | Address of type user. |
| time     | Time data type. |
|`[ Application Role Name ]`| Any name specified in application role. Limits users to be of that role type. |

### Example configuration of type array

```json
{
  "Name": "Quotes",
  "Description": "Market quotes",
  "DisplayName": "Quotes",
  "Type": {
    "Name": "array",
    "ElementType": {
        "Name": "int"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using a property of type array

If you define a property as type array in configuration, you need to include an explicit get function to return the public property of the array type in Solidity. For example:

```
function GetQuotes() public constant returns (int[]) {
     return Quotes;
}
```

### Example configuration of type string

``` json
{
  "Name": "description",
  "Description": "Descriptive text",
  "DisplayName": "Description",
  "Type": {
    "Name": "string"
  }
}
```

### Example configuration of type enum

``` json
{
  "Name": "PropertyType",
  "DisplayName": "Property Type",
  "Description": "The type of the property",
  "Type": {
    "Name": "enum",
    "EnumValues": ["House", "Townhouse", "Condo", "Land"]
  }
}
```

#### Using enumeration type in Solidity

Once an enum is defined in configuration, you can use enumeration types in Solidity. For example, you can define an enum called PropertyTypeEnum.

```
enum PropertyTypeEnum {House, Townhouse, Condo, Land} PropertyTypeEnum public PropertyType; 
```

The list of strings need to match between the configuration and smart contract to be valid and consistent declarations in Blockchain Workbench.

Assignment example:

```
PropertyType = PropertyTypeEnum.Townhouse;
```

Function parameter example: 

``` 
function AssetTransfer(string description, uint256 price, PropertyTypeEnum propertyType) public
{
    InstanceOwner = msg.sender;
    AskingPrice = price;
    Description = description;
    PropertyType = propertyType;
    State = StateType.Active;
    ContractCreated();
}

```

## Constructor

### States example

``` json
"States": [
    {

          "Function": "MakeOffer",
          "NextStates": [ "OfferPlaced" ],
          "DisplayName": "Make Offer"
        },
        {
          "AllowedRoles": [],
          "AllowedInstanceRoles": [ "InstanceOwner" ],
          "Description": "Modify attributes of this asset transfer instance",
          "Function": "Modify",
          "NextStates": [ "Active" ],
          "DisplayName": "Modify"
        }
      ]
    },

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|:--------:|
| AllowedRoles | List of applications roles allowed to initiate the transition. All users of the specified role may be able to perform the action. | No |
| AllowedInstanceRoles | List of user roles participating or specified in the smart contract allowed to initiate the transition. Instance roles are defined in **Properties** within workflows. AllowedInstanceRoles represent a user participating in an instance of a smart contract. AllowedInstanceRoles give you the ability to restrict taking an action to a user role in a contract instance.  For example, you may only want to allow the user who created the contract (InstanceOwner) to be able to terminate rather than all users in role type (Owner) if you specified the role in AllowedRoles. | No |

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|:--------:|
| Name | The unique name of the application role. The corresponding smart contract must use the same **Name** for the applicable role. Base type names are reserved. You cannot name an application role with the same name as [Type](#type)| Yes |
| Description | Description of the application role. | No |

### Application roles example

    "Description": "Describes the asset being sold",
    "Type": {
      "Name": "string"
    }
  }
]
```

## Configuration file example

Asset transfer is a smart contract scenario for buying and selling high value assets, which require an inspector and appraiser. Sellers can list their assets by instantiating an asset transfer smart contract. Buyers can make offers by taking an action on the smart contract, and other parties can take actions to inspect or appraise the asset. Once the asset is marked both inspected and appraised, the buyer and seller will confirm the sale again before the contract is set to complete. At each point in the process, all participants have visibility into the state of the contract as it is updated.
