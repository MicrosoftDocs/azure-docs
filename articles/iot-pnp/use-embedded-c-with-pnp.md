# Using IoT Plug and Play with the Embedded C SDK

## Overview

If you are developing for **constrained devices**, then you can use IoT Plug and Play with the [Embedded C SDK](https://aka.ms/embeddedcsdk). This page serves as a landing page for samples showcasing Azure IoT Plug and Play for various constrained scenarios.

### Introductory Embedded C SDK & IoT Plug and Play Samples

The Embedded C SDK repository contains [several samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/tree/1.0.0-preview.4/sdk/samples/iot#iot-hub-plug-and-play-sample) showcasing how to use Azure IoT Plug and Play. 

*Note that these samples are shown running on Windows and Linux for educational and debugging purposes-- in production these are intended for constrained devices only.*
