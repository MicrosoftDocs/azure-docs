# Resize a gateway SKU

This article helps you resize a VPN Gateway virtual network gateway SKU. Resizing a gateway SKU is a relatively fast process. You don't need to delete and recreate your existing VPN gateway to resize. However, there are certain limitations and restrictions for resizing and not all SKUs are available to resize.

[!INCLUDE [changing vs. resizing](../../includes/vpn-gateway-sku-about-change-resize.md)]

When using the portal to resize your SKU, notice that the dropdown list of available SKUs is based on the SKU you currently have. If you don't see the SKU you want to resize to, instead of resizing, you have to change to a new SKU. For more information, see [About VPN Gateway settings](vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateway-settings.md).

## Considerations

There are a number of things to consider when moving to a new gateway SKU. This section outlines the main items and also provides a table that helps you select the best method to use.
