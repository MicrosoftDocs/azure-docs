# Reset a VPN gateway or a connection

Resetting an Azure VPN gateway or gateway connection is helpful if you lose cross-premises VPN connectivity on one or more site-to-site VPN tunnels. In this situation, your on-premises VPN devices are all working correctly, but aren't able to establish IPsec tunnels with the Azure VPN gateways. This article helps you reset a VPN gateway or a gateway connection.

## Reset a VPN gateway

A VPN gateway is composed of two VM instances running in an active-active or active-standby configuration. When you reset the gateway, it reboots the gateway, and then reapplies the cross-premises configurations to it. The gateway keeps the public IP address it already has. This means you don't need to update the VPN router configuration with a new public IP address for Azure VPN gateway.

### Gateway reset behavior

Gateway reset behavior depends on the configuration of the VPN gateway.

* **Active-active mode gateway**: When you issue the command to reset the gateway in active-active setup, one of the active instances (the primary active instance) of the Azure VPN gateway is rebooted immediately. A brief connectivity disruption can be expected as the gateway instance gets rebooted.

* **Active-standby mode gateway**: When you issue the command to reset the gateway in active-standby setup, the current active instance of the Azure VPN gateway is rebooted immediately. A brief connectivity disruption can be expected during the failover from the active instance (being rebooted), to the standby instance.

If the connection isn't restored after the first reboot, the next steps might vary depending on whether the VPN gateway is configured as active-active or active-standby:

* If the VPN gateway is configured as **active-active**, the same instance gets rebooted when the reset gateway operation is issued again. You can use PowerShell or CLI to reset one or both of the instances using VIPs.
* If the VPN gateway is configured as **active-standby**, issue the same command again to reboot the second VM instance (the new active gateway).

### Key items to verify before resetting a gateway

Before you reset your gateway, verify the following key items listed for each IPsec site-to-site (S2S) VPN tunnel. Any mismatch in the items will result in the disconnect of S2S VPN tunnels. Verifying and correcting the configurations for your on-premises and Azure VPN gateways saves you from unnecessary reboots and disruptions for the other working connections on the gateways.

* The Internet IP addresses (VIPs) for both the Azure VPN gateway and the on-premises VPN gateway are configured correctly in both the Azure and the on-premises VPN policies.
* The preshared key must be the same on both Azure and on-premises VPN gateways.
* If you apply specific IPsec/IKE configuration, such as encryption, hashing algorithms, and PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy), ensure both the Azure and on-premises VPN gateways have the same configurations.

### Reset a gateway

The following sections describe how to reset a VPN gateway using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI. If the VPN gateway is configured as active-active and you want to reset each gateway instance separately, you can use PowerShell or CLI.

#### <a name="portal"></a>Azure portal

To reset a VPN gateway using the Azure portal, follow these steps:

[!INCLUDE [portal steps](../../includes/vpn-gateway-reset-gw-portal-include.md)]

#### <a name="ps"></a>PowerShell

The cmdlet for resetting a gateway is [Reset-AzVirtualNetworkGateway](/powershell/module/az.network/reset-azvirtualnetworkgateway). If the gateway is set up as active-active, you can use `-GatewayVip <string>` to reset each instance, one by one.

The following example resets a virtual network gateway named VNet1GW in the TestRG1 resource group:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name VNet1GW -ResourceGroupName TestRG1
Reset-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -VirtualNetworkGateway $gw
```

You can view the reset history of the gateway from [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by navigating to **'GatewayName' -> Resource Health**.

#### <a name="cli"></a>Azure CLI

To reset the gateway, use the [az network vnet-gateway reset](/cli/azure/network/vnet-gateway) command. If the gateway is set up as active-active, use `--gateway-vip <string>` to reset each instance, one by one.

The following example resets a virtual network gateway named VNet5GW in the TestRG5 resource group:

```azurecli-interactive
az network vnet-gateway reset -n VNet5GW -g TestRG5
```

You can view the reset history of the gateway from [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by navigating to **'GatewayName' -> Resource Health**.

### <a name="resetclassic"></a>Reset a classic gateway

The cmdlet for resetting a classic gateway is **Reset-AzureVNetGateway**. The Azure PowerShell cmdlets for Service Management must be installed locally on your desktop. You can't use Azure Cloud Shell. Before performing a reset, make sure you have the latest version of the [Service Management (SM) PowerShell cmdlets](/powershell/azure/servicemanagement/install-azure-ps#azure-service-management-cmdlets).

When using this command, make sure you're using the full name of the virtual network. Classic VNets that were created using the portal have a long name that is required for PowerShell. You can view the long name by using `Get-AzureVNetConfig -ExportToFile C:\Myfoldername\NetworkConfig.xml`.

The following example resets the gateway for a virtual network named "Group TestRG1 TestVNet1" (which shows as simply "TestVNet1" in the portal):

```powershell
Reset-AzureVNetGateway â€“VnetName 'Group TestRG1 TestVNet1'
```

Result:

```powershell
Error          :
HttpStatusCode : OK
Id             : f1600632-c819-4b2f-ac0e-f4126bec1ff8
Status         : Successful
RequestId      : 9ca273de2c4d01e986480ce1ffa4d6d9
StatusCode     : OK
```

## Reset a connection

When you reset a VPN gateway connection, the gateway doesn't reboot. Only the selected connection is reset and restored. You can reset a connection easily using the Azure portal.

1. Go to the **Connection** that you want to reset. You can find the connection resource either by locating it in **All resources**, or by going to the **'Gateway Name' -> Connections**.
1. From the list of connections for your gateway, click the connection that you want to reset to open the **Connection** page for that connection.
1. On the **Connection** page, in the left pane, scroll down to the **Support + Troubleshooting** section and select **Reset**.
1. On the **Reset** page, click **Reset** to reset the connection.
