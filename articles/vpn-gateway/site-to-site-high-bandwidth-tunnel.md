# Create a site-to-site high bandwidth tunnels in the Azure portal **(Preview)**

The Azure VPN Gateway High Bandwidth tunnels feature, part of the Advanced Connectivity capabilities, delivers enhanced tunnel throughput for high-performance IPsec connections between your on-premises network and Azure virtual network. These tunnels are established between your on-premises VPN device and the Azure VPN Gateway, with traffic transiting through ExpressRoute private peering. High Bandwidth tunnels use private IP addresses on-premises to establish a secure, encrypted overlay network between your on-premises infrastructure and Azure.

High Bandwidth tunnels provide end-to-end encryption to meet security compliance requirements and eliminate encryption bottlenecks. This feature enables you to establish up to four IPsec tunnels between the Azure VPN Gateway and your on-premises VPN device—organized as two Connections, each supporting two tunnels. Each tunnel can deliver up to 5 Gbps of encrypted throughput, for a combined maximum of 20 Gbps. The following network diagram illustrates this configuration:

:::image type="content" source="media/site-to-site-high-bandwidth-tunnel/transit-high-bandwidth-tunnels.png" alt-text="Diagram showing Transit High Bandwidth IPsec tunnels architecture.":::

## Prerequisites

To use VPN Gateway High Bandwidth tunnels, your ExpressRoute Connection must have FastPath enabled. FastPath is currently supported only on ExpressRoute Direct port pairs. As a result, your ExpressRoute circuit must be provisioned on an ExpressRoute Direct port pair to support this solution.

This article assumes that your Azure subscription already includes:
- An ExpressRoute circuit deployed on a Direct port pair with private peering.
- A virtual network with the address space `10.1.0.0/16` and a Gateway subnet of `10.1.0.0/26`.

The required Azure resources for this deployment are:

- **ExpressRoute Direct Port**
- **ExpressRoute Circuit**
- **ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway**
- **Connection between the ExpressRoute circuit and the virtual network gateway with FastPath enabled**
- **VPN Gateway (SKU: VpnGw5AZ) with Advanced Connectivity enabled**
- **VPN Local Network Gateway**
- (optional) **User Defined Route (UDR) to direct ExpressRoute traffic to the VPN Gateway**

## <a name="VNetGateway"></a>Create an ExpressRoute Gateway

The ExpressRoute Gateway must be deployed in the **GatewaySubnet** of your virtual network. When creating the ExpressRoute Gateway, choose one of the following supported SKUs:

- **UltraPerformance**
- **ErGw3AZ**
- **ERGwScale** (with at least 20 scale units)

These SKUs are required to support high bandwidth and advanced connectivity features.

:::image type="content" source="media/site-to-site-high-bandwidth-tunnel/expressroute-gateway.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing ExpressRoute gateway configuration options.":::

## <a name="VNetGateway"></a>Create an ExpressRoute Connection

The ExpressRoute connection links your ExpressRoute Gateway to the ExpressRoute circuit. To enable the FastPath feature on this connection, use the following PowerShell commands:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Connect-AzAccount
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId <your-subscription-id>

$connection = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name '<ER_CONNECTION_NAME>' -ResourceGroupName '<RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>'
$connection.ExpressRouteGatewayBypass = $true
Set-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -VirtualNetworkGatewayConnection $connection
```

After running these commands, verify that **$connection.ExpressRouteGatewayBypass** is set to **$true**.

You can also confirm FastPath is enabled in the Azure portal. Go to your ExpressRoute circuit, select **Connections**, then under **Settings > Configuration**, ensure that the FastPath setting is set to **Enable**.

:::image type="content" source="media/site-to-site-high-bandwidth-tunnel/expressroute-connection-fastpath.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing ExpressRoute Connection with FastPath enabled.":::

To enable support for High Bandwidth tunnels, you must activate the **EnablePrivateLinkFastPath** attribute on your ExpressRoute connection. Use the following PowerShell commands:

```azurepowershell-interactive

$connection.EnablePrivateLinkFastPath = $true
Set-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -VirtualNetworkGatewayConnection $connection
```

After you complete this step, your Azure virtual network will be connected to your on-premises networks, and ExpressRoute will be configured to support High Bandwidth tunnels.

## <a name="on-premises network"></a>Advertise on-premises network to ExpressRoute

When using IPsec tunnels that transit ExpressRoute private peering, you must advertise **only** the private IP addresses of your on-premises VPN devices from your edge routers to the Microsoft Enterprise Edge (MSEE) routers. Do **not** advertise other on-premises network prefixes over ExpressRoute, as this configuration can cause traffic to bypass the VPN Gateway and reach Azure unencrypted via the ExpressRoute gateway.

To ensure all traffic between Azure and your on-premises network is encrypted, configure routing so that only the VPN device tunnel IPs are advertised over ExpressRoute. The actual on-premises network prefixes should be routed through the VPN Gateway, either using static routes or BGP. This approach ensures that on-premises to Azure traffic is always encrypted inside the VPN tunnel before it enters the ExpressRoute data path.

If you advertise on-premises network prefixes to ExpressRoute through BGP, those routes can bypass the VPN Gateway, resulting in unencrypted traffic. To prevent this issue, use a user-defined route (UDR) on your Azure virtual network to direct traffic to the VPN Gateway as the next hop. This configuration guarantees that all traffic is encrypted before transiting ExpressRoute.

## <a name="VNetGateway"></a>Create a VPN gateway High Bandwidth tunnel

To create a VPN gateway with High Bandwidth tunnels for your virtual network, follow these steps. High Bandwidth tunnels are supported only on the **VpnGw5AZ** SKU.

In the Azure portal:

1. In the top search bar, enter **Virtual network gateway** and select it from the results.
1. Select **Create** to start configuring a new VPN gateway.
1. Use the following settings for the High Bandwidth configuration:

    :::image type="content" source="media/site-to-site-high-bandwidth-tunnel/vpn-gateway-high-bandwidth.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing VPN Gateway High Bandwidth tunnel configuration settings.":::

    - **Name**: `vpnHB`
    - **Gateway type**: `VPN`
    - **SKU**: `VpnGw5AZ`
    - **Generation**: `Generation 2`
    - **Enable Advanced Connectivity**: `Enabled`
    - **Virtual network**: `VNet1`
    - **Gateway subnet address range**: `10.1.0.0/26`
    - **Public IP address**: `Create new`
    - **Public IP address name**: `vpnHBT-pip1`
    - **Public IP address SKU**: `Standard`
    - **Assignment**: `Static`
    - **Second Public IP address**: `Create new`
    - **Second Public IP address name**: `vpnHBT-pip2`
    - **Public IP address SKU**: `Standard`
    - **Assignment**: `Static`
    - **Configure BGP**: `Disabled`

1. Review your settings and select **Review + create**. Then select **Create** to deploy the VPN gateway.

> [!NOTE]
> * To deploy a High Bandwidth VPN Gateway in the Azure portal, you must enable the **Enable Advanced Connectivity** option when creating the gateway. Selecting this option automatically configures the gateway in active-active mode.
> * High Bandwidth tunnels support both static routing and BGP, but are only available on route-based VPN Gateway SKUs.

Deployment of the gateway can take 45 minutes or longer. You can monitor progress on the gateway's **Overview** page in the Azure portal.

In a High Bandwidth VPN Gateway configuration, IPsec tunnel traffic flows through the private IP addresses assigned to the VPN Gateway instances. While two public IP addresses are still provisioned, their sole purpose is to support Azure control plane operations—they aren't used for IPsec tunnel establishment.

## <a name="LocalNetworkGateway"></a>Create a local network gateway

A local network gateway is an Azure resource that represents your on-premises site for routing traffic. When you create a local network gateway, you provide:

- A name for Azure to reference.
- The IP address of your on-premises VPN device.
- The address prefixes for your on-premises network that should be routed through the VPN gateway.

If your on-premises VPN device has multiple IP addresses you want to connect to, you must create a separate local network gateway for each IP address.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only create the local network gateways after you know the IP addresses assigned to the outbound interfaces of your on-premises VPN device.

:::image type="content" source="media/site-to-site-high-bandwidth-tunnel/vpn-on-premises-ip-addresses.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing IP addresses for VPN device on-premises configuration.":::

Create two local network gateways with the following settings:

**Local Network Gateway 1**

:::image type="content" source="media/site-to-site-high-bandwidth-tunnel/local-network-gateway-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Local Network Gateway 1 configuration.":::

- **Name**: `vpnLocalNetGw1`
- **Location**: `West US 2`
- **IP address**: `192.168.1.1` (on-premises VPN device)
- **Address space**: `10.10.0.0/16` (on-premises network)
- **BGP settings**: Not configured

**Local Network Gateway 2**

:::image type="content" source="media/site-to-site-high-bandwidth-tunnel/local-network-gateway-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Local Network Gateway 2 configuration.":::

- **Name**: `vpnLocalNetGw2`
- **Location**: `West US 2`
- **IP address**: `192.168.1.5` (on-premises VPN device)
- **Address space**: `10.10.0.0/16` (on-premises network)
- **BGP settings**: Not configured

After deploying both Local Network Gateways, you can proceed to create the VPN Connections between your Azure VPN Gateway and your on-premises VPN devices.

## <a name="CreateConnection"></a>Create VPN Connections

The High Bandwidth VPN Gateway supports up to two VPN Connections, with each connection capable of establishing two tunnels to your on-premises VPN device. To maximize throughput and redundancy, create two site-to-site VPN Connections using the following settings:

**Connection 1**

:::image type="content" source="media/site-to-site-high-bandwidth-tunnel/vpn-connection-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing VPN Connection 1 configuration.":::

- **Connection type**: Site-to-site
- **Name**: `vpnConn1`
- **Virtual network gateway**: `vpnHB`
- **Local network gateway**: `vpnLocalNetGw1`
- **Shared key (PSK)**: `abc123` (example; use a strong, matching key on both sides)

**Connection 2**

:::image type="content" source="media/site-to-site-high-bandwidth-tunnel/vpn-connection-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing VPN Connection 2 configuration.":::

- **Connection type**: Site-to-site
- **Name**: `vpnConn2`
- **Virtual network gateway**: `vpnHB`
- **Local network gateway**: `vpnLocalNetGw2`
- **Shared key (PSK)**: `abc123` (example; use a strong, matching key on both sides)

> [!NOTE]
> The shared key must be identical on both the Azure and on-premises VPN device configurations. Replace `abc123` with a secure key appropriate for your environment.

After you create both connections, each will establish two IPsec tunnels, for a total of four tunnels between Azure and your on-premises VPN device.

> [!NOTE]
> Only after the deployment of two VPN Connections, through the Azure portal you can discover the private IP addresses assigned to the VPN Gateway instances.

In the Azure portal, navigate to your VPN Gateway, then select **Settings** > **Connections**.

:::image type="content" source="media/site-to-site-high-bandwidth-tunnel/list-connections.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing VPN Connection List in the Azure portal.":::

The **Connections** view displays the private tunnel IP addresses assigned to the VPN Gateway and shows how each is paired with its corresponding Local Network Gateway. For a High Bandwidth VPN Gateway configuration, the tunnel IPs are mapped as follows:

- Tunnel IP `10.1.6` is paired with Local Network Gateway `vpnLocalNetGw1`
- Tunnel IP `10.1.8` is paired with Local Network Gateway `vpnLocalNetGw1`
- Tunnel IP `10.1.7` is paired with Local Network Gateway `vpnLocalNetGw2`
- Tunnel IP `10.1.9` is paired with Local Network Gateway `vpnLocalNetGw2`

This mapping illustrates how each tunnel IP address is associated with a specific local network gateway, enabling the establishment of multiple site-to-site VPN tunnels for increased bandwidth and redundancy.

## <a name="VPNDevice"></a>Configure your VPN device on-premises

Configuring your on-premises VPN device is the final step. At this stage, you should have all the necessary information to complete the device setup.

:::image type="content" source="media/site-to-site-high-bandwidth-tunnel/tunnel-ip-addresses.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing tunnel IP addresses for VPN Gateway configuration.":::

When configuring your VPN device, you need the following details:

- **Shared key (preshared key)**: This key is specified when you create your site-to-site VPN connections. While the examples use a simple key, we recommend generating a complex, secure key for production environments.
- **Private tunnel IP addresses of the Azure VPN Gateway**: Each VPN Gateway instance provides two private tunnel IPs, for a total of four IPsec tunnels in a High Bandwidth configuration. Many VPN devices support this setup using Virtual Tunnel Interfaces (VTIs), allowing each on-premises outbound interface IP to be associated with up to two VTIs.
- **Azure virtual network address space**: The address range assigned to your Azure virtual network.

:::image type="content" source="media/site-to-site-high-bandwidth-tunnel/site-to-site-tunnels-azure-on-premises.png" alt-text="Diagram showing IPsec tunnels between on-premises device and Azure VPN Gateway.":::

A sample configuration for your on-premises VPN device might look like:

```bash
interface 1
  ip address 192.168.1.1/32

interface 2
  ip address 192.168.1.5/32

interface tunnel  0
  ip address 192.168.10.1/32
  tunnel source 192.168.1.1
  tunnel destination 10.1.1.6

interface tunnel 1
  ip address 192.168.10.2/32
  source address 192.168.1.1
  destination address 10.1.1.8

interface tunnel 2
  ip address 192.168.10.5/32
  source address 192.168.1.5
  destination address 10.1.1.7

interface tunnel 3
  ip address 192.168.10.6/32
  source address 192.168.1.5
  destination address 10.1.1.9

static routing:
    10.1.0.0/24 next-hop: tunnel 0
    10.1.0.0/24 next-hop: tunnel 1
    10.1.0.0/24 next-hop: tunnel 2
    10.1.0.0/24 next-hop: tunnel 3
```

### <a name="configure-connect"></a>Configure custom encryption algorithms (optional)

In each VPN Connection, you can define a custom IKEv2 and IPsec policy to match the encryption requirements. For more information, see [Configure custom IPsec/IKE connection policies](ipsec-ike-policy-howto.md).

### <a name="additional"></a>More configuration considerations

You can customize site-to-site configurations in various ways. For more information, see the following articles:

* For information about BGP, see the [BGP overview](vpn-gateway-bgp-overview.md) and [How to configure BGP](vpn-gateway-bgp-resource-manager-ps.md).
* For information about how to limit network traffic to resources in a virtual network, see [Network security](../virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview.md).
* For information about how Azure routes traffic between Azure, on-premises, and internet resources, see [Virtual network traffic routing](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview.md).

## Clean up resources

If you no longer need the resources you created, you can delete them to avoid unnecessary charges.

1. In the Azure portal, enter the name of your resource group in the **Search** box at the top and select it from the results.
2. On the resource group page, select **Delete resource group**.
3. When prompted, type the name of the resource group to confirm, then select **Delete**.
This action permanently removes the resource group and all resources it contains.
