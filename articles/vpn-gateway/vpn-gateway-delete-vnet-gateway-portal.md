This article helps you delete a virtual network gateway. There are a couple of different approaches you can take when you want to delete a gateway.

* If you want to delete everything and start over, you can delete the resource group. When you delete a resource group, it deletes all the resources within the group. This method is only recommended if you don't want to keep any of the resources in the resource group. You can't selectively delete only a few resources using this approach.

* If you want to keep some of the resources in your resource group, deleting a virtual network gateway becomes slightly more complicated. Before you can delete the virtual network gateway, you must first delete any resources that are dependent on the gateway. The steps you follow depend on the type of connections that you created and the dependent resources for each connection.

To delete a virtual network gateway, you must first delete each resource that pertains to the virtual network gateway. Resources must be deleted in a certain order due to dependencies.
