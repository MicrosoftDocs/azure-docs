## <a name="configure-lng"></a>Local network gateway configuration

When you configure a local network gateway, you select either an IP address or a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) as the endpoint. The endpoint is the public IP address or FQDN of the VPN device to which you want to connect.

The following screenshot shows the **Configuration** page of a **local network gateway** resource. In this screenshot, **BGP Settings** is selected to reveal available settings.
