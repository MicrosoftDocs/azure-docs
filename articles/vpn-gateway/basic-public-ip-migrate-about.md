# About migrating a Basic SKU public IP address to Standard SKU

This article explains the migration process from a Basic SKU public IP address to a Standard SKU public IP address for VPN Gateway deployments. There are separate migration timelines, depending on the VPN Gateway SKU that your gateway is currently configured to use. For anticipated migration timelines, see the [VPN Gateway - What's new](whats-new.md) article.

## <a name="considerations"></a>Migration considerations

To migrate your gateway, you first need to validate whether your resource is capable of migration. Here are some common situations to be aware of:

* If your current gateway subnet is /28 or smaller, the migration tool may error out. You can use this to [add multiple prefixes for subnet](../virtual-network/how-to-multiple-prefixes-subnet.md) to /27 or larger before you can proceed with migration.

* Before your initiate migration for your VPN gateway, verify that your gateway subnet has at least *three* available IP addresses in your current prefix.

## FAQ

### How will my gateway SKU be impacted after the Basic SKU public IP address migration?

After you upgrade from a Basic SKU public IP address to a Standard SKU public IP address, your VPN gateway SKU VPNGW1-5 will be migrated to VPNGW1AZ-5. As a result, you might see the SKU changed from a Non-AZ to an AZ-SKU. For more information about SKU impact, see the [Gateway SKU migration](gateway-sku-consolidation.md) article.

### Will my VPN gateway IP address change after my public IP address is migrated?

* If you use the Microsoft-provided migration experience, your gateway IP address won't change.
* If you manually delete your current VPN gateway that has a Basic SKU public IP address and create a new VPN gateway using a Standard SKU public IP address, your gateway IP address changes.

### Will there be any downtime?

Up to 10 minutes of downtime is expected during the Microsoft-provided migration experience.

### Do I need to take any actions to migrate?

The Microsoft-provided migration experience is a customer-initiated migration. You'll need to initiate the migration process. The migration process is expected to take up to 10 minutes.

### Are there any migration prerequisites?

Ensure that your gateway subnet has right IP address space and subnet size. You'll need at least three available IP addresses in your current prefix before you perform the migration.

### Can I create a Basic SKU VPN gateway with a Basic SKU public IP address after March 31, 2025?

Yes, you can create a VPN gateway using the gateway Basic SKU and a Basic SKU public IP address until June 2025.

### When will I be able to create a Basic SKU VPN gateway with a Standard SKU public IP address?

The Standard SKU public IP address parameter for the VPN Gateway Basic SKU is currently being rolled out and will be completed in April 2025. After this date, you'll be able to create a Basic SKU VPN gateway with a Standard SKU public IP address.

### Can I change to a Standard SKU public IP address manually?

Yes, you can. If you choose to do this manually, you'll need to delete the old gateway and then create a new gateway in your virtual network. When you create a new gateway, your gateway will automatically use a Standard SKU public IP address. However, if you choose to use this process, you'll incur downtime while the old gateway is deleted and the new gateway is created.

### If I delete and re-create my gateway, will my IP address change?

Yes, the IP address changes with this approach. This means that you'll have to ensure the new IP address is updated in all of your internal tooling as needed.
