**Guidance**: Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark subscriptions using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It's your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.
