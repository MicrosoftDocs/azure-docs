# How to connect AWS and Azure using a BGP-enabled VPN gateway

This article walks you through the setup of a BGP-enabled connection between Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). You'll use an Azure VPN gateway with BGP and active-active enabled and an AWS virtual private gateway with two site-to-site connections.

## <a name="architecture"></a>Architecture

In this setup, you create the following resources:

Azure

* One virtual network
* One virtual network gateway with active-active and BGP enabled
* Four local network gateways
* Four site-to-site connections

AWS

* One virtual private cloud (VPC)
* One virtual private gateway
* Two customer gateways
* Two site-to-site connections, each with two tunnels (total of four tunnels)

A site-to-site connection on AWS has two tunnels, each with their own outside IP address and inside IPv4 CIDR (used for BGP APIPA). An active-passive VPN gateway only supports **one** custom BGP APIPA. You'll need to enable **active-active** on your Azure VPN gateway to connect to multiple AWS tunnels.

On the AWS side, you create a customer gateway and site-to-site connection for **each of the two Azure VPN gateway instances** (total of four outgoing tunnels). In Azure, you need to create four local network gateways and four connections to receive these four AWS tunnels.

## <a name="apipa-config"></a>Choosing BGP APIPA addresses

You can use the following values for your BGP APIPA configuration throughout the tutorial.

| **Tunnel** | **Azure Custom Azure APIPA BGP IP Address** | **AWS BGP Peer IP Address** | **AWS Inside IPv4 CIDR** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AWS Tunnel 1 to Azure Instance 0** | 169.254.21.2 | 169.254.21.1 | 169.254.21.0/30 |
| **AWS Tunnel 2 to Azure Instance 0** | 169.254.22.2 | 169.254.22.1 | 169.254.22.0/30 |
| **AWS Tunnel 1 to Azure Instance 1** | 169.254.21.6 | 169.254.21.5 | 169.254.21.4/30 |
| **AWS Tunnel 2 to Azure Instance 1** | 169.254.22.6 | 169.254.22.5 | 169.254.22.4/30 |

You can also set up your own custom APIPA addresses. AWS requires a /30 **Inside IPv4 CIDR** in the APIPA range of **169.254.0.0/16** for each tunnel. This CIDR must also be in the Azure-reserved APIPA range for VPN, which is from **169.254.21.0** to **169.254.22.255**. AWS uses the first IP address of your /30 inside CIDR and Azure uses the second. This means you need to reserve space for two IP addresses in your AWS /30 CIDR.

For example, if you set your AWS **Inside IPv4 CIDR** to be **169.254.21.0/30**, AWS uses the BGP IP address **169.254.21.1** and Azure uses the IP address **169.254.21.2**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > * Your APIPA addresses must not overlap between the on-premises VPN devices and all connected Azure VPN gateways.
   > * If you choose to configure multiple APIPA BGP peer addresses on the VPN gateway, you must also configure all Connection objects with their corresponding IP address of your choice. If you fail to do so, all connections use the first APIPA IP address in the list no matter how many IPs are present.

## Prerequisites

You must have both an Azure account and AWS account with an active subscription. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can activate your [MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) or sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## <a name ="part-1"></a> Part 1: Create an active-active VPN gateway in Azure

### Create a VNet

Create a virtual network. You can refer to the [Site-to-site Tutorial](tutorial-site-to-site-portal.md) for steps. 

For this exercise, we use the following example values:

* **Subscription**: If you have more than one subscription, verify that you're using the correct one.
* **Resource group**: TestRG1
* **Name**: VNet1
* **Location**: East US
* **IPv4 address space**: 10.1.0.0/16
* **Subnet name**: FrontEnd
* **Subnet address range**: 10.1.0.0/24

### Create an active-active VPN gateway with BGP

In this section, you create active-active VPN gateway. You can refer to the [Site-to-site Tutorial](tutorial-site-to-site-portal.md) for steps. 

For this exercise, we use the following example values:

* **Name**: VNet1GW
* **Region**: East US
* **Gateway type**: VPN
* **VPN type**: Route-based
* **SKU**: VpnGw2AZ
* **Generation**: Generation2
* **Virtual network**: VNet1
* **Gateway subnet address range**: 10.1.1.0/24
* **Public IP address**: Create new
* **Public IP address name**: VNet1GWpip
* **Availability zone**: Zone-redundant
* **Enable active-active mode**: Enabled
* **SECOND PUBLIC IP ADDRESS**: Create new
* **Public IP address 2 name**: VNet1GWpip2
* **Availability zone**: Zone-redundant
* **BGP values**: When you configure BGP, pay attention to the following settings:

  * Select **Enabled** for **Configure BGP** to show the BGP configuration section.
  * Fill in a **ASN (Autonomous System Number)**. This ASN must be different than the ASN used by AWS.

    * **Example:** 65000

  * Add two addresses to **Custom Azure APIPA BGP IP address**. Include the IP addresses for **AWS Tunnel 1 to Azure Instance 0** and **AWS Tunnel 2 to Azure Instance 0** from the [APIPA configuration you chose](#apipa-config). The second input will only appear after you add your first APIPA BGP IP address.

    * **Example:** 169.254.21.2, 169.254.22.2

  * Add two addresses to **Second Custom Azure APIPA BGP IP address**. Include the IP addresses for **AWS Tunnel 1 to Azure Instance 1** and **AWS Tunnel 2 to Azure Instance 1** from the [APIPA configuration you chose](#apipa-config). The second input will only appear after you add your first APIPA BGP IP address.

    * **Example:** 169.254.21.6, 169.254.22.6

Select **Review + create** to run validation. Once validation passes, select **Create** to deploy the VPN gateway. Creating a gateway can often take 45 minutes or more, depending on the selected gateway SKU. You can see the deployment status on the **Overview** page for your gateway.

To view the public IP addresses that are assigned to your gateway, go to your virtual network gateway in the portal and navigate to **Settings -> Properties**.

## <a name ="part-2"></a> Part 2: Connect to your VPN gateway from AWS

## <a name ="part-3"></a> Part 3: Connect to your AWS customer gateways from Azure

Next, you connect your AWS tunnels to Azure. For each of the four tunnels, you'll have both a local network gateway and a site-to-site connection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Repeat the following sections for **each of your four AWS tunnels**, using their respective **outside IP address**.

### <a name="create-local-network-gateways"></a> Create local network gateways

Repeat these instructions to create each local network gateway.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Local network gateway** resource from the Marketplace, and select **Create**.
1. Select the same **Subscription**, **Resource Group**, and **Region** you used to create your virtual network gateway.
1. Enter a name for your local network gateway.
1. Leave **IP Address** as the value for **Endpoint**.
1. For **IP Address**, enter the **Outside IP Address** (from AWS) for the tunnel you're creating.
1. Leave **Address Space** as blank and select **Advanced**.
1. On the **Advanced** tab, configure the following settings:

   * Select **Yes** for **Configure BGP settings**.
   * For **Autonomous system number (ASN)**, enter the ASN for your AWS Virtual Private Network. Use the ASN **64512** if you left your ASN as the AWS default value.
   * For **BGP peer IP address**, enter the AWS BGP Peer IP Address based on the [APIPA configuration you chose](#apipa-config).

### <a name ="create-azure-connections"></a> Create connections

Repeat these steps to create each of the required connections.

1. Open the page for your **virtual network gateway**, navigate to the **Connections** page.
1. On the **Connections page**, select **+ Add**.
1. On the **Basics** page, complete the following values:

   * **Connection type**: Site-to-site (IPsec)
   * **Name**: Enter a name for your connection. Example: AWSTunnel1toAzureInstance0.
1. On the **Settings** page, complete the following values:

   * **Virtual network gateway**: Select the VPN gateway.
   * **Local network gateway**: Select the local network gateway you created.
   * Enter the **Shared key (PSK)** that matches the preshared key you entered when making the AWS connections.
   * **Enable BGP**: Select to enable.
   * **Enable Custom BGP Addresses**: Select to enable.
1. Under **Custom BGP Addresses**:

     * Enter the Custom BGP Address based on the [APIPA configuration you chose](#apipa-config).
     * The **Custom BGP Address** (Inside IPv4 CIDR in AWS) must match with the **IP Address** (Outside IP Address in AWS) that you specified in the local network gateway you're using for this connection.
     * Only one of the two custom BGP addresses will be used, depending on the tunnel you're specifying it for.
     * For making a connection from AWS to the **first public IP address** of your VPN gateway (instance 0), **only the Primary Custom BGP Address** is used.
     * For making a connection from AWS to the **second public IP address** of your VPN gateway (instance 1), **only the Secondary Custom BGP Address** is used.
     * Leave the other **Custom BGP Address** as default.

    If you used the [default APIPA configuration](#apipa-config), you can use the following addresses.

    | Tunnel                           | Primary Custom BGP Address     | Secondary Custom BGP Address  |
    |----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
