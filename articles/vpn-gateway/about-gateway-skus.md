# About gateway SKUs

When you create a VPN Gateway virtual network gateway, you specify the gateway SKU that you want to use. This article describes the factors that you should take into consideration when selecting a gateway SKU. If you're looking for information about ExpressRoute gateway SKUs, see [Virtual network gateways for ExpressRoute](../expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways.md). For Virtual WAN gateways, see [Virtual WAN gateway settings](../virtual-wan/gateway-settings.md).

When you configure a virtual network gateway SKU, select the SKU that satisfies your requirements based on the types of workloads, throughput, features, and SLAs. The following sections show the relevant information that you should use when deciding.

> [!NOTE]
> We're simplifying our VPN Gateway SKU portfolio and will be transitioning all non availability zone (AZ) supported SKUs to AZ supported SKUs. For more information and timelines, see [VPN Gateway SKU consolidation and migration](gateway-sku-consolidation.md).

## <a name="benchmark"></a>Gateway SKUs by tunnel, connection, and throughput

[!INCLUDE [Aggregated throughput by SKU](../../includes/vpn-gateway-table-gwtype-aggtput-include.md)]

(*) If you need more than 100 S2S VPN tunnels, use [Virtual WAN](../virtual-wan/virtual-wan-about.md) instead of VPN Gateway.

**Additional information**

* Because Basic SKU public IP addresses are [announced to retire](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/upgrade-to-standard-sku-public-ip-addresses-in-azure-by-30-september-2025-basic-sku-will-be-retired/) September 30, 2025, we're no longer permitting new gateways to be created using Basic SKU public IP addresses. Starting December 1, 2023, when you create a new VPN gateway, you must use a Standard SKU public IP address. This limitation doesn't apply to new gateways that you create using the VPN Gateway Basic gateway SKU. You can still create a Basic SKU VPN gateway that uses a Basic SKU public IP address.
  
* The Basic gateway SKU doesn't support IPv6 and can only be configured using PowerShell or Azure CLI. Additionally, the Basic gateway SKU doesn't support RADIUS authentication.

* These connection limits are separate. For example, you can have 128 SSTP connections and also 250 IKEv2 connections on a VpnGw1 SKU.

* If you have numerous P2S connections, it can negatively impact your S2S connections. The Aggregate Throughput Benchmarks were tested by maximizing a combination of S2S and P2S connections. A single P2S or S2S connection can have a much lower throughput.

* See the [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/vpn-gateway) page for pricing information.

* See the [SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/vpn-gateway) page for SLA (Service Level Agreement) information.

* All benchmarks aren't guaranteed due to Internet traffic conditions and your application behaviors.

## <a name="performance"></a>Gateway SKUs by performance

[!INCLUDE [Performance by SKU](../../includes/vpn-gateway-table-sku-performance.md)]

## <a name="feature"></a>Gateway SKUs by feature set

| **SKU**| **Features**|
| ---    | ---         |
|**Basic** (**)   | **Route-based VPN**: 10 tunnels for S2S/connections; no RADIUS authentication for P2S; no IKEv2 for P2S<br>**Policy-based VPN**: (IKEv1): 1 S2S/connection tunnel; no P2S|
| **All Generation1 and Generation2 SKUs except Basic** | **Route-based VPN**: up to 100 tunnels (*), P2S, BGP, active-active, custom IPsec/IKE policy, ExpressRoute/VPN coexistence |

(*) You can configure "PolicyBasedTrafficSelectors" to connect a route-based VPN gateway to multiple on-premises policy-based firewall devices. Refer to [Connect VPN gateways to multiple on-premises policy-based VPN devices using PowerShell](vpn-gateway-connect-multiple-policybased-rm-ps.md) for details.

(\*\*) The Basic SKU has certain feature and performance limitations and shouldn't be used for production purposes. Verify that the feature that you need is supported before you use the Basic SKU. The Basic SKU doesn't support IPv6 and can only be configured using PowerShell or Azure CLI. Additionally, the Basic SKU doesn't support RADIUS authentication.

## <a name="workloads"></a>Gateway SKUs - Production vs. Dev-Test workloads

Due to the differences in SLAs and feature sets, we recommend the following SKUs for production vs. dev-test:

| **Workload**     | **SKUs**       |
| ---         | ---             |
| **Production, critical workloads** | All Generation1 and Generation2 SKUs, except Basic|
| **Dev-test or proof of concept**   | Basic (**)             |


(\*\*) The Basic SKU has certain feature and performance limitations and shouldn't be used for production purposes. Verify that the feature that you need is supported before you use the Basic SKU. The Basic SKU doesn't support IPv6 and can only be configured using PowerShell or Azure CLI. Additionally, the Basic SKU doesn't support RADIUS authentication.

If you're using the old SKUs (legacy), the production SKU recommendations are Standard and HighPerformance. For information and instructions for old SKUs, see [Gateway SKUs (legacy)](vpn-gateway-about-skus-legacy.md).

## About legacy SKUs

For information about working with the legacy gateway SKUs (Standard and High Performance), including SKU deprecation, see [Managing legacy gateway SKUs](vpn-gateway-about-skus-legacy.md).

## Specify a SKU

You specify the gateway SKU when you create your VPN Gateway. See the following article for steps:

* [Azure portal](tutorial-create-gateway-portal.md)
* [PowerShell - Basic SKU](create-gateway-basic-sku-powershell.md)
* [PowerShell](create-gateway-powershell.md)
* [Azure CLI](create-routebased-vpn-gateway-cli.md)

## <a name="resizechange"></a>Change or resize a SKU

> [!NOTE]
> If you're working with a legacy gateway SKU (Standard and High Performance), see [Managing Legacy gateway SKUs](vpn-gateway-about-skus-legacy.md).

### Considerations

There are many things to consider when moving to a new gateway SKU. This section outlines the main items and also provides a table that helps you select the best method to use.

[!INCLUDE [resize SKU restrictions](../../includes/vpn-gateway-sku-resize-restrictions.md)]

The following table helps you understand the required method to move from one SKU to another.
