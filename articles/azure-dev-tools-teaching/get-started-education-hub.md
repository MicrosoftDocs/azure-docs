# Quickstart: Get started with the Education Hub Start Page
The Education Hub Get Started page provides quick links upon first landing into the Education Hub. If
you want to set up your course, learn about different services through Microsoft Learn or easily deploy
your first services through Quickstart Templates. Every time hereafter landing in the Education Hub,
you will land on the Overview page by default.
