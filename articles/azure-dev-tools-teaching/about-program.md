# What is Azure Dev Tools for Teaching?

Microsoft Azure Dev Tools for Teaching puts professional developer tools, software, and services
in the hands of faculty and students with low-cost subscriptions from Microsoft. Students
receive developer tools from Microsoft at no cost—everything needed to create apps, games,
and websites—so they can chase their dreams, create the next big breakthrough in technology,
or get a head start on their career.

Formerly known as Microsoft Imagine, this subscription program has changed to Azure Dev
Tools for Teaching. All current Imagine subscriptions have automatically transitioned to Azure
Dev Tools for Teaching and provide access to the same software tools students have enjoyed with
Imagine.

Plus, students are now able to:

- Manage and access software through a centralized online location that eliminates the
need to maintain a WebStore or an internal site.

- Give academic users access to software, free training/learning materials, and the
Azure cloud platform through the same online portal.

<!---Avoid notes, tips, and important boxes. Readers tend to skip over them. Better to put that info directly into the article text.--->

<!---Screenshots and videos can add another way to show and tell the overview story. But don’t overdo them. Make sure that they offer value for the overview.
If users access your product/service via a web browser, the first screenshot should always include the full browser window in Chrome or Safari. This is to show users that the portal is browser-based - OS and browser agnostic.

## Common questions

### Why are you launching Azure Dev Tools for Teaching?

Developers increasingly harness the power of the cloud to innovate, build, and transform products and applications. We believe that giving students access to our cloud and dev tools in one location further enables them to seamlessly innovate and learn.

### Who can use Azure Dev Tools for Teaching?

We designed Azure Dev Tools for Teaching for STEM-focused instruction. Any course curriculum focused on science, technology, engineering, or mathematics is eligible to
use Azure Dev Tools for Teaching to help professors teach and students learn more effectively.

### Does this mean students can no longer download on-premises software?

No, students can still download on-premises software for their own learning.

### When do I renew my Azure Dev Tools for Teaching subscription?

You renew your subscription on the same renewal date as your previous Imagine subscription. The renewal process is very similar to your past experience. If you have multiple subscriptions and want to move to a single subscription, you renew on the same date you began your latest subscription.

### What happened to my internal WebStore?

Your internal WebStore will no longer allow students to successfully download software after the
launch of Azure Dev Tools for Teaching. If you want to retain your internal WebStore, you
can provide redirects to the new WebStore by using the Azure Dev Tools for Teaching [Sign In page](aka.ms/devtoolsforteaching).

### How do students access software?

All software is accessible through an Education Hub built into the Azure portal that houses all products and services available to academic users. Students access the software by simply logging
in to the Azure portal with the same credentials they use to access their Imagine subscription.

### Do students need to sign up for Azure?

No, students don't need to sign up for an Azure subscription to access their software benefits. However, Microsoft does offer USD$100 in Azure credit plus access to free Azure services for students. Students can also sign up for the Azure for Students offer without needing a credit card.

### Will this affect my access to Imagine Academy?

No, this will not impact how you access Imagine Academy.
