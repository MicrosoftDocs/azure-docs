# Service Bus messaging samples
The Service Bus messaging samples demonstrate key features in [Service Bus messaging](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/). Currently, you can find the samples in the following places:

| Programming language | SDK or samples location |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| .NET, Java, and Management | https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus/ |
| Node.js | https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/servicebus/service-bus/samples |
| Python | https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/servicebus/azure-servicebus |

## Service Bus Explorer

In addition, the [Service Bus Explorer](https://github.com/paolosalvatori/ServiceBusExplorer) is a sample hosted on GitHub that enables you to connect to a Service Bus service namespace and easily manage messaging entities. The tool provides advanced features such as import/export functionality, and the ability to test messaging entities and relay services. You can find the full Service Bus Explorer source and documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/paolosalvatori/ServiceBusExplorer).
