# Azure Monitor - Service Bus insights
Azure Service Bus insights provide a view of the overall performance, failures, capacity, and operational health of all your Service Bus resources in a unified interactive experience. This article will help you understand the benefits of this new monitoring experience, and how you can modify and adapt the experience to fit the unique needs of your organization.

## Introduction

Before diving into the experience, you should understand how it presents and visualizes information. 

It delivers:

* **At scale perspective** of your Service Bus resources across all your subscriptions in a single location, with the ability to selectively scope to only those subscriptions and resources you're interested in evaluating.

* **Drill down analysis** of a particular Service Bus resource to help diagnose issues or perform detailed analysis by category - utilization, failures, capacity, and operations. Selecting any one of those options provides an in-depth view of the relevant information.

* **Customizable** - This experience is built on top of Azure Monitor workbook templates allowing you to change what metrics are displayed, modify or set thresholds that align with your limits, and then save into a custom workbook. Charts in the workbooks can then be pinned to Azure dashboards.  

This feature doesn't require you to enable or configure anything, these Service Bus metrics are collected by default.

>[!NOTE]
>There is no charge to access this feature and you will only be charged for the Azure Monitor essential features you configure or enable, as described on the [Azure Monitor pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) page.

## View utilization and performance metrics for Service Bus

To view the utilization and performance of your Service Bus resources across all of your subscriptions, perform the following steps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Search for **Monitor** and select **Monitor**.

    ![Search box with the word "Monitor" and a dropdown that says Services "Monitor" with a speedometer style image](./media/service-bus-insights/search-monitor.png)

### Overview

On **Overview**, the table displays interactive Service Bus metrics. You can filter the results based on the options you select from the following drop-down lists:

* **Subscriptions** - only subscriptions that have a Service Bus resource are listed.  

* **Service Bus** - You can select all, a subset, or single Service Bus resource.

* **Time Range** - by default, displays the last 4 hours of information based on the corresponding selections made.

The counter tile under the drop-down lists rolls-up the total number of Service Bus resources are in the selected subscriptions. There's conditional color-coding or heatmaps for columns in the workbook that report transaction metrics. The deepest color has the highest value and a lighter color is based on the lowest values. 

The **Overview** page shows you the following values and also the timeline for active connections.

| Metric Name |  Description |
| ---------- | ---------- | 
|Active Connections| The number of active connections on a namespace and on an entity in the namespace. Value for this metric is a point-in-time value. Connections that were active immediately after that point-in-time may not be reflected in the metric. |
|Connections Opened | The number of open connections. |
|Connections Closed | The number of closed connections. |
|Successful Requests| The number of successful requests made to the Service Bus service over a specified period. |
|Throttled Requests| The number of requests that were throttled because the usage was exceeded. |  

For more information about these metrics, see [Service Bus metrics](monitor-service-bus-reference.md).

Selecting the Service Bus resource name highlighted in blue will take you to the default **Overview** for that resource. 

### Requests

Select **Requests** at the top of the page and the **Requests** portion of the workbook template opens.

## View from a Service Bus resource

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Service Bus**, and select any of your existing Service Bus namespaces.
2. On the **Service Bus Namespace** page, in the **Monitoring** section on the left menu, select **Insights (preview)** or **Workbooks** to do further analysis. You see the following page when you select **Insights (preview)**. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-insights/service-bus-overview.png" lightbox="./media/service-bus-insights/service-bus-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Service Bus Insights Overview.":::

You see the same tabs (**Overview**, **Requests**, and **Messages**) on this page, similar to the ones you see on the **Azure Monitor - Service Bus (Preview)** page. You'll see more information on these tabs compared to the ones on the Azure Monitor page though. 

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about metrics you see on this page, see [Service Bus metrics](monitor-service-bus-reference.md).

### Overview tab
You see the following information for the Service Bus **namespace** for the selected **time range**: number of active connections, connections opened, successful requests, throttled requests, and incoming messages.

You also see charts with the following information for the namespace over time in the selected time range: active connections, connections opened and closed, successful requests, throttled requests, and incoming & outgoing messages. For example, the **Active Connections** chart shows the number of active connections in the last 4 hours (selected time range).
