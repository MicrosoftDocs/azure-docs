# Azure security baseline for Service Bus

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Service Bus. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Service Bus. **Controls** not applicable to Service Bus, or for which the responsibility is Microsoft's, have been excluded.

To see how Service Bus completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Service Bus security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32074).

**Guidance**: The integration of Service Bus with the Azure Private Link service enables secure private access to messaging capabilities from workloads such as virtual machines that are bound to virtual networks. Create a private endpoint connection to your Service Bus namespace. The private endpoint uses a private IP address from your virtual network, effectively bringing the service into your virtual network. All traffic to the service can be routed through that private endpoint, so no gateways, NAT devices, ExpressRoute or VPN connections, or public IP addresses are needed.

You can also secure your Azure Service Bus namespace by using firewalls. Azure Service Bus supports IP-based access controls for inbound firewall support. You can set firewall rules by using the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager templates, or through the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32075).

**Guidance**: If using Azure virtual machines to access your Service Bus entities, enable network security group (NSG) flow logs and send logs into a storage account for traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations. 

Use Azure Security Center and follow network protection recommendations to help secure your Service Bus resources in Azure.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32081).

**Guidance**: Use Virtual Network Service Tags to define network access controls on Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall which filter traffic to and from Service Bus resources. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ServiceBus) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32082).

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network resources associated with your Azure Service Bus namespaces with Azure Policy. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.ServiceBus" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Service Bus namespaces. You may also make use of built-in policy definitions related to Azure Service Bus, such as:

- Service Bus should use a virtual network service endpoint
- Diagnostic logs in Service Bus should be enabled

You may also construct custom policy definitions if the built-in definitions do not fit your organization's needs.

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32083).

**Guidance**: Use tags for virtual networks and other resources related to network security and traffic flow that are associated with your Service Bus namespaces. For individual network security group rules, use the "Description" field to specify business need, duration, and other descriptive information for any rules that allow traffic to or from a network associated with your Service Bus namespaces. 

Use any of the built-in Azure policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources. 

You may use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look-up or perform actions on resources based on their Tags.

## Identity and Access Control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and Access Control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32095).

**Guidance**: Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) allows you to manage access to Azure resources through role assignments. You can assign these roles to users, groups service principals and managed identities. There are pre-defined built-in roles for Service Bus, these roles can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell or the Azure portal.

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32097).

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

Additionally, to help you keep track of dedicated administrative accounts, you may use recommendations from Azure Security Center or built-in Azure Policies, such as:

- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

You may also construct custom policy definitions if the built-in definitions do not fit your organization's needs.

### 3.4: Use Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO)

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32098).

**Guidance**: Microsoft Azure provides integrated access control management for resources and applications based on Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). A key advantage of using Azure AD with Azure Service Bus is that you don't need to store your credentials in the code anymore. Instead, you can request an OAuth 2.0 access token from the Microsoft Identity platform. The resource name to request a token is https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/. Azure AD authenticates the security principal (a user, group, or service principal) running the application. If the authentication succeeds, Azure AD returns an access token to the application, and the application can then use the access token to authorize request to Azure Service Bus resources.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32156).

**Guidance**: Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark subscriptions using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data. It's your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32157).

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32158).

**Guidance**: Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the continuous export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Continuous export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. You can use the Azure Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel.
