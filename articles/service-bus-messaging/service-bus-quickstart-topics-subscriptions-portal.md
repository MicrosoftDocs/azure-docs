# Use the Azure portal to create a Service Bus topic and subscriptions to the topic
In this quickstart, you use the Azure portal to create a Service Bus topic and then create subscriptions to that topic. 

## What are Service Bus topics and subscriptions?
Service Bus topics and subscriptions support a *publish/subscribe* messaging communication model. When you use topics and subscriptions, components of a distributed application don't communicate directly with each other; instead they exchange messages via a topic, which acts as an intermediary.

In contrast with Service Bus queues, in which each message is processed by a single consumer, topics and subscriptions provide a one-to-many form of communication, using a publish/subscribe pattern. It's possible to register multiple subscriptions to a topic. When a message is sent to a topic, it's then made available to each subscription to handle/process independently. A subscription to a topic resembles a virtual queue that receives copies of the messages that were sent to the topic. You can optionally register filter rules for a topic on subscriptions, which allows you to filter or restrict which messages to a topic are received by which topic subscriptions.

Service Bus topics and subscriptions enable you to scale to process a large number of messages across a large number of users and applications.

## Next steps
In this article, you created a Service Bus namespace, a topic in the namespace, and three subscriptions to the topic. To learn how to publish messages to the topic and subscribe for messages from a subscription, see one of the following quickstarts in the **Publish and subscribe for messages** section.
