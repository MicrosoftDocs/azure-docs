# Service Bus messaging exceptions (deprecated)

This article lists the .NET exceptions generated by .NET Framework APIs.

[!INCLUDE [service-bus-track-0-and-1-sdk-support-retirement](../../includes/service-bus-track-0-and-1-sdk-support-retirement.md)]

## Exception categories

The messaging APIs generate exceptions that can fall into the following categories, along with the associated action you can take to try to fix them. The meaning and causes of an exception can vary depending on the type of messaging entity:

1. User coding error ([System.ArgumentException](/dotnet/api/system.argumentexception), [System.InvalidOperationException](/dotnet/api/system.invalidoperationexception), [System.OperationCanceledException](/dotnet/api/system.operationcanceledexception), [System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationException](/dotnet/api/system.runtime.serialization.serializationexception)). General action: try to fix the code before proceeding.
2. Setup/configuration error ([Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.MessagingEntityNotFoundException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.messagingentitynotfoundexception), [System.UnauthorizedAccessException](/dotnet/api/system.unauthorizedaccessexception). General action: review your configuration and change if necessary.
3. Transient exceptions ([Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.MessagingException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingexception), [Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.ServerBusyException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.serverbusyexception), [Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.MessagingCommunicationException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingcommunicationexception)). General action: retry the operation or notify users. The `RetryPolicy` class in the client SDK can be configured to handle retries automatically. For more information, see [Retry guidance](/azure/architecture/best-practices/retry-service-specific#service-bus).
4. Other exceptions ([System.Transactions.TransactionException](/dotnet/api/system.transactions.transactionexception), [System.TimeoutException](/dotnet/api/system.timeoutexception), [Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.MessageLockLostException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.messagelocklostexception), [Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.SessionLockLostException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.sessionlocklostexception)). General action: specific to the exception type; refer to the table in the following section:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Azure Service Bus doesn't retry an operation when an exception occurs on the operation is in a transaction scope.
> - For retry guidance specific to Azure Service Bus, see [Retry guidance for Service Bus](/azure/architecture/best-practices/retry-service-specific#service-bus).


## Exception types

The following table lists messaging exception types, and their causes, and notes suggested action you can take.

| **Exception Type** | **Description/Cause/Examples** | **Suggested Action** | **Note on automatic/immediate retry** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [TimeoutException](/dotnet/api/system.timeoutexception) |The server didn't respond to the requested operation within the specified time, which is controlled by [OperationTimeout](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingfactorysettings). The server might have completed the requested operation. It can happen because of network or other infrastructure delays. |Check the system state for consistency and retry if necessary. See [time-out exceptions](#timeoutexception). |Retry might help in some cases; add retry logic to code. |
| [InvalidOperationException](/dotnet/api/system.invalidoperationexception) |The requested user operation isn't allowed within the server or service. See the exception message for details. For example, [Complete()](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.queueclient.completeasync) generates this exception if the message was received in [ReceiveAndDelete](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.receivemode) mode. |Check the code and the documentation. Make sure the requested operation is valid. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [OperationCanceledException](/dotnet/api/system.operationcanceledexception) |An attempt is made to invoke an operation on an object that has already been closed, aborted, or disposed. In rare cases, the ambient transaction is already disposed. |Check the code and make sure it doesn't invoke operations on a disposed object. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [UnauthorizedAccessException](/dotnet/api/system.unauthorizedaccessexception) |The [TokenProvider](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.tokenprovider) object couldn't acquire a token, the token is invalid, or the token doesn't contain the claims required to do the operation. |Make sure the token provider is created with the correct values. Check the configuration of the Access Control Service. |Retry might help in some cases; add retry logic to code. |
| [ArgumentException](/dotnet/api/system.argumentexception)<br /> [ArgumentNullException](/dotnet/api/system.argumentnullexception)<br />[ArgumentOutOfRangeException](/dotnet/api/system.argumentoutofrangeexception) |One or more arguments supplied to the method are invalid.<br /> The URI supplied to [NamespaceManager](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.namespacemanager) or [Create](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingfactory) contains path segments.<br /> The URI scheme supplied to [NamespaceManager](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.namespacemanager) or [Create](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingfactory) is invalid. <br />The property value is larger than 32 KB. |Check the calling code and make sure the arguments are correct. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [MessagingEntityNotFoundException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.messagingentitynotfoundexception) |Entity associated with the operation doesn't exist or it has been deleted. |Make sure the entity exists. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [MessageNotFoundException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagenotfoundexception) |Attempt to receive a message with a particular sequence number. This message isn't found. |Make sure the message hasn't been received already. Check the deadletter queue to see if the message has been deadlettered. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [MessagingCommunicationException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingcommunicationexception) |Client isn't able to establish a connection to Service Bus. |Make sure the supplied host name is correct and the host is reachable. <p>If your code runs in an environment with a firewall/proxy, ensure that the traffic to the Service Bus domain/IP address and ports isn't blocked.</p>|Retry might help if there are intermittent connectivity issues. |
| [ServerBusyException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.serverbusyexception) |Service isn't able to process the request at this time. |Client can wait for a period of time, then retry the operation. |Client might retry after certain interval. If a retry results in a different exception, check retry behavior of that exception. |
| [MessagingException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingexception) |Generic messaging exception that might be thrown in the following cases:<p>An attempt is made to create a [QueueClient](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.queueclient) using a name or path that belongs to a different entity type (for example, a topic).</p><p>An attempt is made to send a message larger than 256 KB. </p>The server or service encountered an error during processing of the request. See the exception message for details. It's usually a transient exception.</p><p>The request was terminated because the entity is being throttled. Error code: 50001, 50002, 50008. </p> | Check the code and ensure that only serializable objects are used for the message body (or use a custom serializer). <p>Check the documentation for the supported value types of the properties and only use supported types.</p><p> Check the [IsTransient](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingexception) property. If it's **true**, you can retry the operation. </p>| If the exception is due to throttling, wait for a few seconds and retry the operation again. Retry behavior is undefined and might not help in other scenarios.|
| [MessagingEntityAlreadyExistsException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingentityalreadyexistsexception) |Attempt to create an entity with a name that is already used by another entity in that service namespace. |Delete the existing entity or choose a different name for the entity to be created. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [QuotaExceededException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.quotaexceededexception) |The messaging entity has reached its maximum allowable size, or the maximum number of connections to a namespace has been exceeded. |Create space in the entity by receiving messages from the entity or its subqueues. See [QuotaExceededException](#quotaexceededexception). |Retry might help if messages have been removed in the meantime. |
| [RuleActionException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.ruleactionexception) |Service Bus returns this exception if you attempt to create an invalid rule action. Service Bus attaches this exception to a deadlettered message if an error occurs while processing the rule action for that message. |Check the rule action for correctness. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [FilterException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.filterexception) |Service Bus returns this exception if you attempt to create an invalid filter. Service Bus attaches this exception to a deadlettered message if an error occurred while processing the filter for that message. |Check the filter for correctness. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [SessionCannotBeLockedException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.sessioncannotbelockedexception) |Attempt to accept a session with a specific session ID, but the session is currently locked by another client. |Make sure the session is unlocked by other clients. |Retry might help if the session has been released in the interim. |
| [TransactionSizeExceededException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.transactionsizeexceededexception) |Too many operations are part of the transaction. |Reduce the number of operations that are part of this transaction. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [MessagingEntityDisabledException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.messagingentitydisabledexception) |Request for a runtime operation on a disabled entity. |Activate the entity. |Retry might help if the entity has been activated in the interim. |
| [NoMatchingSubscriptionException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.nomatchingsubscriptionexception) |Service Bus returns this exception if you send a message to a topic that has prefiltering enabled and none of the filters match. |Make sure at least one filter matches. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [MessageSizeExceededException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagesizeexceededexception) |A message payload exceeds the 256-KB limit. The 256-KB limit is the total message size, which can include system properties and any .NET overhead. |Reduce the size of the message payload, then retry the operation. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [TransactionException](/dotnet/api/system.transactions.transactionexception) |The ambient transaction (`Transaction.Current`) is invalid. It might have been completed or aborted. Inner exception might provide additional information. | |Retry doesn't help. |
| [TransactionInDoubtException](/dotnet/api/system.transactions.transactionindoubtexception) |An operation is attempted on a transaction that is in doubt, or an attempt is made to commit the transaction and the transaction becomes in doubt. |Your application must handle this exception (as a special case), as the transaction might have already been committed. |- |

## QuotaExceededException

[QuotaExceededException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.quotaexceededexception) indicates that a quota for a specific entity has been exceeded. 

> [!NOTE]
> For Service Bus quotas, see [Quotas](service-bus-quotas.md).

### Queues and topics

For queues and topics, it's often the size of the queue. The error message property contains further details, as in the following example:

```output
Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.QuotaExceededException
Message: The maximum entity size has been reached or exceeded for Topic: 'xxx-xxx-xxx'. 
    Size of entity in bytes:1073742326, Max entity size in bytes:
1073741824..TrackingId:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, TimeStamp:3/15/2013 7:50:18 AM
```

The message states that the topic exceeded its size limit, in this case 1 GB (the default size limit).

### Namespaces

For namespaces, [QuotaExceededException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.quotaexceededexception) can indicate that an application has exceeded the maximum number of connections to a namespace. For example:

```output
Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.QuotaExceededException: ConnectionsQuotaExceeded for namespace xxx.
<tracking-id-guid>_G12 ---> 
System.ServiceModel.FaultException`1[System.ServiceModel.ExceptionDetail]: 
ConnectionsQuotaExceeded for namespace xxx.
```

### Common causes

There are two common causes for this error: the dead-letter queue, and nonfunctioning message receivers.

1. **[Dead-letter queue](service-bus-dead-letter-queues.md)**
    A reader is failing to complete messages and the messages are returned to the queue/topic when the lock expires. It can happen if the reader encounters an exception that prevents it from calling [BrokeredMessage.Complete](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.complete). After a message has been read 10 times, it moves to the dead-letter queue by default. This behavior is controlled by the [QueueDescription.MaxDeliveryCount](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.queuedescription.maxdeliverycount) property and has a default value of 10. As messages pile up in the dead letter queue, they take up space.

    To resolve the issue, read and complete the messages from the dead-letter queue, as you would from any other queue. You can use the [FormatDeadLetterPath](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.entitynamehelper.formatdeadletterpath) method to help format the dead-letter queue path.
2. **Receiver stopped**. A receiver has stopped receiving messages from a queue or subscription. The way to identify it is to look at the [QueueDescription.MessageCountDetails](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagecountdetails) property, which shows the full breakdown of the messages. If the [ActiveMessageCount](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagecountdetails.activemessagecount) property is high or growing, then the messages aren't being read as fast as they're being written.

## TimeoutException

A [TimeoutException](/dotnet/api/system.timeoutexception) indicates that a user-initiated operation is taking longer than the operation time-out.

You should check the value of the [ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit](/dotnet/api/system.net.servicepointmanager.defaultconnectionlimit) property, as hitting this limit can also cause a [TimeoutException](/dotnet/api/system.timeoutexception).

Time-outs are expected to happen during or in-between maintenance operations such as Service Bus service updates (or) OS updates on resources that run the service. During OS updates, entities are moved around and nodes are updated or rebooted, which can cause time-outs. For service level agreement (SLA) details for the Azure Service Bus service, see [SLA for Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/service-bus/).

### Queues and topics

For queues and topics, the time-out is specified either in the [MessagingFactorySettings.OperationTimeout](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingfactorysettings) property, as part of the connection string, or through [ServiceBusConnectionStringBuilder](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.servicebusconnectionstringbuilder). The error message itself might vary, but it always contains the time-out value specified for the current operation.

## MessageLockLostException

### Cause

The **MessageLockLostException** is thrown when a message is received using the [PeekLock](message-transfers-locks-settlement.md#peeklock) Receive mode and the lock held by the client expires on the service side.

The lock on a message might expire due to various reasons:

  * The lock timer has expired before it was renewed by the client application.
  * The client application acquired the lock, saved it to a persistent store and then restarted. Once it restarted, the client application looked at the inflight messages and tried to complete these.

You might also receive this exception in the following scenarios:

* Service Update
* OS update
* Changing properties on the entity (queue, topic, subscription) while holding the lock.

### Resolution

When a client application receives **MessageLockLostException**, it can no longer process the message. The client application might optionally consider logging the exception for analysis, but the client *must* dispose off the message.

Since the lock on the message has expired, it would go back on the Queue (or Subscription) and can be processed by the next client application that calls receive.

If the MaxDeliveryCount has exceeded, then the message might be moved to the **DeadLetterQueue**.

## SessionLockLostException

### Cause

The **SessionLockLostException** is thrown when a session is accepted and the lock held by the client expires on the service side.

The lock on a session might expire due to various reasons:

  * The lock timer has expired before it was renewed by the client application.
  * The client application acquired the lock, saved it to a persistent store and then restarted. Once it restarted, the client application looked at the inflight sessions and tried to process the messages in those sessions.

You might also receive this exception in the following scenarios:

* Service Update
* OS update
* Changing properties on the entity (queue, topic, subscription) while holding the lock.

### Resolution

When a client application receives **SessionLockLostException**, it can no longer process the messages on the session. The client application might consider logging the exception for analysis, but the client *must* dispose off the message.

Since the lock on the session has expired, it would go back on the Queue (or Subscription) and can be locked by the next client application that accepts the session. Since the session lock is held by a single client application at any given time, the in-order processing is guaranteed.

## SocketException

### Cause

A **SocketException** is thrown in the following cases:

   * When a connection attempt fails because the host didn't properly respond after a specified time (TCP error code 10060).
   * An established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.
   * There was an error processing the message or the time-out is exceeded by the remote host.
   * Underlying network resource issue.

### Resolution

The **SocketException** errors indicate that the VM hosting the applications is unable to convert the name `<mynamespace>.servicebus.windows.net` to the corresponding IP address.

Check to see if the following command succeeds in mapping to an IP address.

```powershell
PS C:\> nslookup <mynamespace>.servicebus.windows.net
```

Which should provide an output like:

```bash
Name:    <cloudappinstance>.cloudapp.net
Address:  XX.XX.XXX.240
Aliases:  <mynamespace>.servicebus.windows.net
```

If the name **does not resolve** to an IP and the namespace alias, check with the network administrator to investigate further. Name resolution is done through a DNS server typically a resource in the customer network. If the DNS resolution is done by Azure DNS, contact Azure support.

If name resolution **works as expected**, check if connections to Azure Service Bus is allowed [here](service-bus-troubleshooting-guide.md#connectivity-certificate-or-timeout-issues).

## MessagingException

### Cause

**MessagingException** is a generic exception that might be thrown for various reasons. Some of the reasons are:

   * An attempt is made to create a **QueueClient** on a **Topic** or a **Subscription**.
   * The size of the message sent is greater than the limit for the given tier. Read more about the Service Bus [quotas and limits](service-bus-quotas.md).
   * Specific data plane request (send, receive, complete, abandon) was terminated due to throttling.
   * Transient issues caused due to service upgrades and restarts.

> [!NOTE]
> The list of exceptions isn't exhaustive.

### Resolution

The resolution steps depend on what caused the **MessagingException** to be thrown.

   * For **transient issues** (where ***isTransient*** is set to ***true***) or for **throttling issues**, retrying the operation might resolve it. The default retry policy on the SDK can be used.
   * For other issues, the details in the exception indicate the issue and resolution steps can be deduced from the same.

## StorageQuotaExceededException

### Cause

The **StorageQuotaExceededException** is generated when the total size of entities in a premium namespace exceeds the limit of 1 TB per [messaging unit](service-bus-premium-messaging.md).

### Resolution

- Increase the number of messaging units assigned to the premium namespace
- If you're already using maximum allowed messaging units for a namespace, create a separate namespace.
