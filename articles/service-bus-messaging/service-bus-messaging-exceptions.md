# Troubleshooting guide for Azure Service Bus
This article provides some of the .NET exceptions generated by Service Bus .NET Framework APIs and also other tips for troubleshooting issues. 

## Service Bus messaging exceptions
This section lists the .NET exceptions generated by .NET Framework APIs. 

### Exception categories
The messaging APIs generate exceptions that can fall into the following categories, along with the associated action you can take to try to fix them. The meaning and causes of an exception can vary depending on the type of messaging entity:

1. User coding error ([System.ArgumentException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.argumentexception.aspx), [System.InvalidOperationException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.invalidoperationexception.aspx), [System.OperationCanceledException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.operationcanceledexception.aspx), [System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.runtime.serialization.serializationexception.aspx)). General action: try to fix the code before proceeding.
2. Setup/configuration error ([Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.MessagingEntityNotFoundException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.messagingentitynotfoundexception), [System.UnauthorizedAccessException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.unauthorizedaccessexception.aspx). General action: review your configuration and change if necessary.
3. Transient exceptions ([Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.MessagingException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingexception), [Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.ServerBusyException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.serverbusyexception), [Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.MessagingCommunicationException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingcommunicationexception)). General action: retry the operation or notify users. The `RetryPolicy` class in the client SDK can be configured to handle retries automatically. For more information, see [Retry guidance](/azure/architecture/best-practices/retry-service-specific#service-bus).
4. Other exceptions ([System.Transactions.TransactionException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.transactions.transactionexception.aspx), [System.TimeoutException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.timeoutexception.aspx), [Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.MessageLockLostException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.messagelocklostexception), [Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.SessionLockLostException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.sessionlocklostexception)). General action: specific to the exception type; refer to the table in the following section: 

### Exception types
The following table lists messaging exception types, and their causes, and notes suggested action you can take.

| **Exception Type** | **Description/Cause/Examples** | **Suggested Action** | **Note on automatic/immediate retry** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [TimeoutException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.timeoutexception.aspx) |The server didn't respond to the requested operation within the specified time, which is controlled by [OperationTimeout](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingfactorysettings). The server may have completed the requested operation. It can happen because of network or other infrastructure delays. |Check the system state for consistency and retry if necessary. See [Timeout exceptions](#timeoutexception). |Retry might help in some cases; add retry logic to code. |
| [InvalidOperationException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.invalidoperationexception.aspx) |The requested user operation isn't allowed within the server or service. See the exception message for details. For example, [Complete()](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.queueclient.completeasync) generates this exception if the message was received in [ReceiveAndDelete](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.receivemode) mode. |Check the code and the documentation. Make sure the requested operation is valid. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [OperationCanceledException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.operationcanceledexception.aspx) |An attempt is made to invoke an operation on an object that has already been closed, aborted, or disposed. In rare cases, the ambient transaction is already disposed. |Check the code and make sure it doesn't invoke operations on a disposed object. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [UnauthorizedAccessException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.unauthorizedaccessexception.aspx) |The [TokenProvider](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.tokenprovider) object couldn't acquire a token, the token is invalid, or the token doesn't contain the claims required to do the operation. |Make sure the token provider is created with the correct values. Check the configuration of the Access Control Service. |Retry might help in some cases; add retry logic to code. |
| [ArgumentException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.argumentexception.aspx)<br /> [ArgumentNullException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.argumentnullexception.aspx)<br />[ArgumentOutOfRangeException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.argumentoutofrangeexception.aspx) |One or more arguments supplied to the method are invalid.<br /> The URI supplied to [NamespaceManager](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.namespacemanager) or [Create](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingfactory) contains path segment(s).<br /> The URI scheme supplied to [NamespaceManager](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.namespacemanager) or [Create](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingfactory) is invalid. <br />The property value is larger than 32 KB. |Check the calling code and make sure the arguments are correct. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [MessagingEntityNotFoundException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.messagingentitynotfoundexception) |Entity associated with the operation doesn't exist or it has been deleted. |Make sure the entity exists. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [MessageNotFoundException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagenotfoundexception) |Attempt to receive a message with a particular sequence number. This message isn't found. |Make sure the message hasn't been received already. Check the deadletter queue to see if the message has been deadlettered. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [MessagingCommunicationException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingcommunicationexception) |Client isn't able to establish a connection to Service Bus. |Make sure the supplied host name is correct and the host is reachable. |Retry might help if there are intermittent connectivity issues. |
| [ServerBusyException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.serverbusyexception) |Service isn't able to process the request at this time. |Client can wait for a period of time, then retry the operation. |Client may retry after certain interval. If a retry results in a different exception, check retry behavior of that exception. |
| [MessageLockLostException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.messagelocklostexception) |Lock token associated with the message has expired, or the lock token isn't found. |Dispose the message. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [SessionLockLostException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.sessionlocklostexception) |Lock associated with this session is lost. |Abort the [MessageSession](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagesession) object. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [MessagingException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingexception) |Generic messaging exception that may be thrown in the following cases:<br /> An attempt is made to create a [QueueClient](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.queueclient) using a name or path that belongs to a different entity type (for example, a topic).<br />  An attempt is made to send a message larger than 256 KB. The server or service encountered an error during processing of the request. See the exception message for details. It's usually a transient exception. |Check the code and ensure that only serializable objects are used for the message body (or use a custom serializer). Check the documentation for the supported value types of the properties and only use supported types. Check the [IsTransient](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingexception) property. If it's **true**, you can retry the operation. |Retry behavior is undefined and might not help. |
| [MessagingEntityAlreadyExistsException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingentityalreadyexistsexception) |Attempt to create an entity with a name that is already used by another entity in that service namespace. |Delete the existing entity or choose a different name for the entity to be created. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [QuotaExceededException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.quotaexceededexception) |The messaging entity has reached its maximum allowable size, or the maximum number of connections to a namespace has been exceeded. |Create space in the entity by receiving messages from the entity or its subqueues. See [QuotaExceededException](#quotaexceededexception). |Retry might help if messages have been removed in the meantime. |
| [RuleActionException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.ruleactionexception) |Service Bus returns this exception if you attempt to create an invalid rule action. Service Bus attaches this exception to a deadlettered message if an error occurs while processing the rule action for that message. |Check the rule action for correctness. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [FilterException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.filterexception) |Service Bus returns this exception if you attempt to create an invalid filter. Service Bus attaches this exception to a deadlettered message if an error occurred while processing the filter for that message. |Check the filter for correctness. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [SessionCannotBeLockedException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.sessioncannotbelockedexception) |Attempt to accept a session with a specific session ID, but the session is currently locked by another client. |Make sure the session is unlocked by other clients. |Retry might help if the session has been released in the interim. |
| [TransactionSizeExceededException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.transactionsizeexceededexception) |Too many operations are part of the transaction. |Reduce the number of operations that are part of this transaction. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [MessagingEntityDisabledException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.messagingentitydisabledexception) |Request for a runtime operation on a disabled entity. |Activate the entity. |Retry might help if the entity has been activated in the interim. |
| [NoMatchingSubscriptionException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.nomatchingsubscriptionexception) |Service Bus returns this exception if you send a message to a topic that has pre-filtering enabled and none of the filters match. |Make sure at least one filter matches. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [MessageSizeExceededException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagesizeexceededexception) |A message payload exceeds the 256-KB limit. The 256-KB limit is the total message size, which can include system properties and any .NET overhead. |Reduce the size of the message payload, then retry the operation. |Retry doesn't help. |
| [TransactionException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.transactions.transactionexception.aspx) |The ambient transaction (*Transaction.Current*) is invalid. It may have been completed or aborted. Inner exception may provide additional information. | |Retry doesn't help. |
| [TransactionInDoubtException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.transactions.transactionindoubtexception.aspx) |An operation is attempted on a transaction that is in doubt, or an attempt is made to commit the transaction and the transaction becomes in doubt. |Your application must handle this exception (as a special case), as the transaction may have already been committed. |- |

### QuotaExceededException
[QuotaExceededException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.quotaexceededexception) indicates that a quota for a specific entity has been exceeded.

#### Queues and topics
For queues and topics, it's often the size of the queue. The error message property contains further details, as in the following example:

```Output
Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.QuotaExceededException
Message: The maximum entity size has been reached or exceeded for Topic: ‘xxx-xxx-xxx’. 
    Size of entity in bytes:1073742326, Max entity size in bytes:
1073741824..TrackingId:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, TimeStamp:3/15/2013 7:50:18 AM
```

The message states that the topic exceeded its size limit, in this case 1 GB (the default size limit). 

#### Namespaces

For namespaces, [QuotaExceededException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.quotaexceededexception) can indicate that an application has exceeded the maximum number of connections to a namespace. For example:

```Output
Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging.QuotaExceededException: ConnectionsQuotaExceeded for namespace xxx.
<tracking-id-guid>_G12 ---> 
System.ServiceModel.FaultException`1[System.ServiceModel.ExceptionDetail]: 
ConnectionsQuotaExceeded for namespace xxx.
```

#### Common causes
There are two common causes for this error: the dead-letter queue, and non-functioning message receivers.

1. **[Dead-letter queue](service-bus-dead-letter-queues.md)**
    A reader is failing to complete messages and the messages are returned to the queue/topic when the lock expires. It can happen if the reader encounters an exception that prevents it from calling [BrokeredMessage.Complete](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.brokeredmessage.complete). After a message has been read 10 times, it moves to the dead-letter queue by default. This behavior is controlled by the [QueueDescription.MaxDeliveryCount](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.queuedescription.maxdeliverycount) property and has a default value of 10. As messages pile up in the dead letter queue, they take up space.
   
    To resolve the issue, read and complete the messages from the dead-letter queue, as you would from any other queue. You can use the [FormatDeadLetterPath](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.entitynamehelper.formatdeadletterpath) method to help format the dead-letter queue path.
2. **Receiver stopped**. A receiver has stopped receiving messages from a queue or subscription. The way to identify this is to look at the [QueueDescription.MessageCountDetails](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagecountdetails) property, which shows the full breakdown of the messages. If the [ActiveMessageCount](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagecountdetails.activemessagecount) property is high or growing, then the messages aren't being read as fast as they are being written.

### TimeoutException
A [TimeoutException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.timeoutexception.aspx) indicates that a user-initiated operation is taking longer than the operation timeout. 

You should check the value of the [ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.net.servicepointmanager.defaultconnectionlimit) property, as hitting this limit can also cause a [TimeoutException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.timeoutexception.aspx).

#### Queues and topics
For queues and topics, the timeout is specified either in the [MessagingFactorySettings.OperationTimeout](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.messagingfactorysettings) property, as part of the connection string, or through [ServiceBusConnectionStringBuilder](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.servicebusconnectionstringbuilder). The error message itself might vary, but it always contains the timeout value specified for the current operation. 

## Connectivity, certificate, or timeout issues
The following steps may help you with troubleshooting connectivity/certificate/timeout issues for all services under *.servicebus.windows.net. 

- Browse to or [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) `https://<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net/`. It helps with checking whether you have IP filtering or virtual network or certificate chain issues (most common when using java SDK).

    An example of successful message:
    
    ```xml
    <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"><title type="text">Publicly Listed Services</title><subtitle type="text">This is the list of publicly-listed services currently available.</subtitle><id>uuid:27fcd1e2-3a99-44b1-8f1e-3e92b52f0171;id=30</id><updated>2019-12-27T13:11:47Z</updated><generator>Service Bus 1.1</generator></feed>
    ```
    
    An example of failure error message:

    ```json
    <Error>
        <Code>400</Code>
        <Detail>
            Bad Request. To know more visit https://aka.ms/sbResourceMgrExceptions. . TrackingId:b786d4d1-cbaf-47a8-a3d1-be689cda2a98_G22, SystemTracker:NoSystemTracker, Timestamp:2019-12-27T13:12:40
        </Detail>
    </Error>
    ```
- Run the following command to check if any port is blocked on the firewall. Ports used are 443 (HTTPS), 5671 (AMQP) and 9354 (Net Messaging/SBMP). Depending on the library you use, other ports are also used. Here is the sample command that check whether the 5671 port is blocked. 

    ```powershell
    tnc <yournamespacename>.servicebus.windows.net -port 5671
    ```

    On Linux:

    ```shell
    telnet <yournamespacename>.servicebus.windows.net 5671
    ```
- When there are intermittent connectivity issues, run the following command to check if there are any dropped packets. This command will try to establish 25 different TCP connections every 1 second with the service. Then, you can check how many of them succeeded/failed and also see TCP connection latency. You can download the `psping` tool from [here](/sysinternals/downloads/psping).

    ```shell
    .\psping.exe -n 25 -i 1 -q <yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net:5671 -nobanner     
    ```
    You can use equivalent commands if you're using other tools such as `tnc`, `ping`, and so on. 
- Obtain a network trace if the previous steps don't help and analyze it using tools such as [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/). Contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/) if needed.
