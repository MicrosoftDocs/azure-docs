## How does password management fit into the Azure AD story?
Self-service has long been a key goal for IT departments across the world as a cost-reduction and labor-saving measure.  Indeed, the market is flooded with products that let you manage your on-premises groups, passwords, or user profiles from the cloud or on-premises.  

Azure AD sets itself apart from these offerings by providing some of the easiest to use and and most powerful self-service capabilities available today.

Read on to learn more about the Password Management story in Azure Active Directory.

## What is possible with Azure AD Password Management?
Here are some of the things you can do with Azure AD's password management capabilities.
- **Self-service password change** allows end users or administrators to change their expired or non-expired passwords without calling an administrator or helpdesk for support.
- **Self-service password reset** allows end users or administrators to reset their passwords automatically without calling an administrator or helpdesk for support. Self-service password reset requires Azure AD Premium or Basic. For more information, see Azure Active Directory Editions.
- **Administrator-initiated password reset** allows an administrator to reset an end user’s or another administrator’s password from within the Azure Management Portal.
- **Password management activity reports** give administrators insights into password reset and registration activity occurring in their organization. 
- **Password writeback** allows management of on-premises passwords from the cloud so all of the above scenarios can be performed by, or on the behalf of, federated or password synchronized users. Password writeback requires Azure AD Premium. For more information, see Getting started with Azure AD Premium.
