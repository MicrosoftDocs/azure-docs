# Certificate operations

The Key Vault (KV) Certificate Management service provides for management of your x509 Certificates and supports the following important behaviors.

- Allows a KV certificate owner to implement secure storage and management of X509 certificates without an application operator's interaction with private key material.
- Allows a certificate owner to create a policy that directs Key Vault to manage the life-cycle of a certificate.
- Allows certificate owners to set contacts for notification of life-cycle events such as expiration or renewal.
- Allows for automatic enrollment and renewal with a few selected issuers (partner X509 certificate providers/authorities)

For more information on Key Vault certificates, see [About keys, secrets, and certificates](about-keys--secrets-and-certificates.md).
