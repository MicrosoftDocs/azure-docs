# Quickstart: Create a HoloLens app with Spatial Anchors

[Spatial Anchors](spatial-anchors-overview.md) is a cross-platform developer service that makes it easy for you to create
Mixed Reality experiences.​ This quickstart shows how to create a HoloLens app using spatial anchors. When you're finished,
you'll have an HoloLens app that can save and recall a spatial anchor.
