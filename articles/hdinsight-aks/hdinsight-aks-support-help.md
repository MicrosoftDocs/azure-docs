Azure's preferred destination for community support, [Microsoft Q&A](/answers/products/azure), allows you to ask technical questions and engage with Azure engineers, Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs), partners, and customers. When you ask a question, make sure you use the `HDInsight` tag. You can also submit your own answers and help other community members with their questions.
