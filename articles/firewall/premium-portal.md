# Azure Firewall Premium in the Azure portal


 Azure Firewall Premium is a next generation firewall with capabilities that are required for highly sensitive and regulated environments. It includes the following features:

- **TLS inspection** - decrypts outbound traffic, processes the data, then encrypts the data and sends it to the destination.
- **IDPS** - A network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) allows you to monitor network activities for malicious activity, log information about this activity, report it, and optionally attempt to block it.
- **URL filtering** - extends Azure Firewallâ€™s FQDN filtering capability to consider an entire URL. For example, `www.contoso.com/a/c` instead of `www.contoso.com`.
- **Web categories** - administrators can allow or deny user access to website categories such as gambling websites, social media websites, and others.

For more information, see [Azure Firewall Premium features](premium-features.md).
