# Azure Firewall Premium in the Azure portal


Azure Firewall Premium is an advanced firewall designed for highly sensitive and regulated environments. It offers enhanced security features, including:

- **TLS inspection**: Decrypts outbound traffic, inspects it for threats, then re-encrypts the data before sending it to its destination.
- **IDPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention System)**: Monitors network activity for malicious behavior, logs and reports incidents, and can block threats in real time.
- **URL filtering**: Filters traffic based on the full URL path (for example, `www.contoso.com/a/c`), not just the domain name.
- **Web categories**: Lets administrators control access to websites by category, such as social media, gambling, and more.

For more information, see [Azure Firewall Premium features](premium-features.md).

## Deploy the firewall

Deploying Azure Firewall Premium follows the same steps as deploying a standard Azure Firewall:

For **Firewall tier**, choose **Premium**. For **Firewall policy**, either select an existing Premium policy or create a new one.

## Configure the Premium policy

Configuring a Premium firewall policy is similar to configuring a Standard firewall policy. However, with a Premium policy, you can enable advanced features such as TLS inspection, IDPS, URL filtering, and web categories to enhance your network security.
