# Using Azure Firewall Workbooks

Azure Firewall Workbook provides a flexible canvas for Azure Firewall data analysis. You can use it to create rich visual reports within the Azure portal. You can tap into multiple Firewalls deployed across Azure, and combine them into unified interactive experiences.

You can gain insights into Azure Firewall events, learn about your application and network rules, and see statistics for firewall activities across URLs, ports, and addresses. Azure Firewall Workbook allows you to filter your firewalls and resource groups, and dynamically filter per category with easy to read data sets when investigating an issue in your logs. 

## Prerequisites

Before you start, enable [Azure Structured Firewall Logs](firewall-structured-logs.md) through the Azure portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All the following sections are valid for Firewall structured logs only.
> 

If you want to use legacy logs, you can enable [diagnostic logging](firewall-diagnostics.md#enable-diagnostic-logging-through-the-azure-portal) using the Azure portal. Then go to [GitHub Workbook for Azure Firewall](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Network-Security/tree/master/Azure%20Firewall/Workbook%20-%20Azure%20Firewall%20Monitor%20Workbook) and follow the instructions on the page. 


 Also, read [Azure Firewall logs and metrics](logs-and-metrics.md) for an overview of the diagnostics logs and metrics available for Azure Firewall.

## Get started

Once you've set up Firewall structured logs, you're all set to use the Azure Firewall embedded workbooks using the following steps:

1. In the portal, navigate to your Azure Firewall resource.
2. Under **Monitoring**, select **Workbooks**.
3. In the Gallery, you can create new workbooks or use the existing Azure Firewall workbook as shown here:

## Workbook sections

The Azure Firewall workbook has seven tabs, each addressing distinct aspects of the service. The following sections describe each tab.

### Overview

The overview tab showcases graphs and statistics related to all types of firewall events aggregated from various logging categories. This includes network rules, application rules, DNS, Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS), Threat Intelligence, and more. The available widgets in Overview tab include:

- **Events, by time**: Displays event frequency over time.
- **Events, by firewall over time**: Shows event distribution across firewalls over time.
