# Deploy and configure Azure Firewall in a hybrid network by using the Azure portal

When you connect your on-premises network to an Azure virtual network to create a hybrid network, the ability to control access to your Azure network resources is an important part of an overall security plan.

You can use Azure Firewall to control network access in a hybrid network by using rules that define allowed and denied network traffic.

For this article, you create three virtual networks:

- **VNet-Hub**: The firewall is in this virtual network.
- **VNet-Spoke**: The spoke virtual network represents the workload located on Azure.
- **VNet-Onprem**: The on-premises virtual network represents an on-premises network. In an actual deployment, you can connect to it by using either a virtual private network (VPN) connection or an Azure ExpressRoute connection. For simplicity, this article uses a VPN gateway connection, and an Azure-located virtual network represents an on-premises network.

If you want to use Azure PowerShell instead to complete the procedures in this article, see [Deploy and configure Azure Firewall in a hybrid network by using Azure PowerShell](tutorial-hybrid-ps.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This article uses classic Azure Firewall rules to manage the firewall. The preferred method is to use an [Azure Firewall Manager policy](../firewall-manager/policy-overview.md). To complete this procedure by using an Azure Firewall Manager policy, see [Tutorial: Deploy and configure Azure Firewall and policy in a hybrid network using the Azure portal](tutorial-hybrid-portal-policy.md).

## Prerequisites

A hybrid network uses the hub-and-spoke architecture model to route traffic between Azure virtual networks and on-premises networks. The hub-and-spoke architecture has the following requirements:

- Set **Use this virtual network's gateway or Route Server** when you're peering **VNet-Hub** to **VNet-Spoke**. In a hub-and-spoke network architecture, a gateway transit allows the spoke virtual networks to share the VPN gateway in the hub, instead of deploying VPN gateways in every spoke virtual network.

   Additionally, routes to the gateway-connected virtual networks or on-premises networks automatically propagate to the routing tables for the peered virtual networks via the gateway transit. For more information, see [Configure VPN gateway transit for virtual network peering](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-peering-gateway-transit.md).

- Set **Use the remote virtual network's gateways or Route Server** when you peer **VNet-Spoke** to **VNet-Hub**. If **Use the remote virtual network's gateways or Route Server** is set and **Use this virtual network's gateway or Route Server** on remote peering is also set, the spoke virtual network uses gateways of the remote virtual network for transit.
- To route the spoke subnet traffic through the hub firewall, you can use a user-defined route (UDR) that points to the firewall with the **Virtual network gateway route propagation** option disabled. Disabling this option prevents route distribution to the spoke subnets, so learned routes can't conflict with your UDR. If you want to keep **Virtual network gateway route propagation** enabled, make sure that you define specific routes to the firewall to override routes that are published from on-premises over Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
- Configure a UDR on the hub gateway subnet that points to the firewall IP address as the next hop to the spoke networks. No UDR is required on the Azure Firewall subnet, because it learns routes from BGP.

The [Create the routes](#create-the-routes) section later in this article shows how to create these routes.

Azure Firewall must have direct internet connectivity. If your **AzureFirewallSubnet** subnet learns a default route to your on-premises network via BGP, you must override it by using a 0.0.0.0/0 UDR with the `NextHopType` value set as `Internet` to maintain direct internet connectivity.

> [!NOTE]
> You can configure Azure Firewall to support forced tunneling. For more information, see [Azure Firewall forced tunneling](forced-tunneling.md).

Traffic between directly peered virtual networks is routed directly, even if a UDR points to Azure Firewall as the default gateway. To send subnet-to-subnet traffic to the firewall in this scenario, a UDR must contain the target subnet network prefix explicitly on both subnets.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

1. For **Enable active-active mode**, select **Disabled**.
1. Accept the remaining defaults, and then select **Review + create**.
1. Review the configuration, and then select **Create**.

### Create the VPN connections

Now you can create the VPN connections between the hub and on-premises gateways.

In the following steps, you create the connection from the hub virtual network to the on-premises virtual network. The examples show a shared key, but you can use your own value for the shared key. The important thing is that the shared key must match for both connections. Creating a connection can take a short while to complete.

1. Open the **RG-fw-hybrid-test** resource group and select the **GW-hub** gateway.
1. Select **Connections** in the left column.
1. Select **Add**.
1. For the connection name, enter **Hub-to-Onprem**.
1. For **Connection type**, select **VNet-to-VNet** .
1. Select **Next**.
1. For **First virtual network gateway**, select **GW-hub**.
1. For **Second virtual network gateway**, select **GW-Onprem**.
1. For **Shared key (PSK)**, enter **AzureA1b2C3**.
1. Select **Review + Create**.
1. Select **Create**.

Create the virtual network connection between on-premises and the hub. The following steps are similar to the previous ones, except that you create the connection from **VNet-Onprem** to **VNet-Hub**. Make sure that the shared keys match. The connection is established after a few minutes.

1. Open the **RG-fw-hybrid-test** resource group and select the **GW-Onprem** gateway.
1. Select **Connections** in the left column.
1. Select **Add**.
1. For the connection name, enter **Onprem-to-Hub**.
1. For **Connection type**, select **VNet-to-VNet**.
1. Select **Next: Settings**.
1. For **First virtual network gateway**, select **GW-Onprem**.
1. For **Second virtual network gateway**, select **GW-hub**.
1. For **Shared key (PSK)**, enter **AzureA1b2C3**.
1. Select **Review + Create**.
1. Select **Create**.

### Verify the connections

After about five minutes, the status of both connections should be **Connected**.

## Peer the hub and spoke virtual networks

Now, peer the hub and spoke virtual networks:

1. Open the **RG-fw-hybrid-test** resource group and select the **VNet-Hub** virtual network.
1. In the left column, select **Peerings**.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Under **This virtual network**:

   |Setting name  |Setting  |
   |---------|---------|
   |**Peering link name**|Enter **HubtoSpoke**.|
   |**Traffic to remote virtual network**|Select **Allow**.|
   |**Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network**|Select **Allow**.|
   |**Virtual network gateway**|Select **Use this virtual network's gateway**.|

1. Under **Remote virtual network**:

   |Setting name  |Value  |
   |---------|---------|
   |**Peering link name**|Enter **SpoketoHub**.|
   |**Virtual network deployment model**|Select **Resource manager**.|
   |**Subscription**|Select your subscription.|
   |**Virtual network**|Select **VNet-Spoke**.|
   |**Traffic to remote virtual network**|Select **Allow**.|
   |**Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network**|Select **Allow**.|
   |**Virtual network gateway**|Select **Use the remote virtual network's gateway**.|

1. Select **Add**.

The following screenshot shows the settings to use when you peer hub and spoke virtual networks:

## Test the firewall

1. Note the private IP address for the **VM-Spoke-01** virtual machine.

1. On the Azure portal, connect to the **VM-Onprem** virtual machine.

1. Open a web browser on **VM-Onprem**, and browse to `http://<VM-Spoke-01 private IP>`.

   The **VM-Spoke-01** webpage should open.

   ![Screenshot that shows the webpage for the spoke virtual machine.](media/tutorial-hybrid-portal/VM-Spoke-01-web.png)

1. From the **VM-Onprem** virtual machine, open a remote access connection to **VM-Spoke-01** at the private IP address.

   Your connection should succeed, and you should be able to sign in.

Now that you've verified that the firewall rules are working, you can:

- Browse to the web server on the spoke virtual network.
- Connect to the server on the spoke virtual network by using RDP.

Next, change the action for the collection of firewall network rules to **Deny**, to verify that the firewall rules work as expected:

1. Select the **AzFW01** firewall.
2. Select **Rules (classic)**.
3. Select the **Network rule collection** tab, and select the **RCNet01** rule collection.
4. For **Action**, select **Deny**.
5. Select **Save**.

Close any existing remote access connections. Run the tests again to test the changed rules. They should all fail this time.

## Clean up resources

You can keep your firewall resources for further testing. If you no longer need them, delete the **RG-fw-hybrid-test** resource group to delete all firewall-related resources.
