# Copy data from Zoho using Azure Data Factory (Preview)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from Zoho. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is currently in preview. You can try it out and give us feedback. If you want to take a dependency on preview connectors in your solution, please contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/).

## Supported capabilities

This Zoho connector is supported for the following activities:

- [Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) with [supported source/sink matrix](copy-activity-overview.md)
- [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)


You can copy data from Zoho to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

This connector supports Xero access token authentication and OAuth 2.0 authentication.

Azure Data Factory provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Zoho connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Zoho linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Zoho** | Yes |
| connectionProperties | A group of properties that defines how to connect to Zoho. | Yes |
| ***Under `connectionProperties`:*** | | |
| endpoint | The endpoint of the Zoho server (`crm.zoho.com/crm/private`). | Yes |
| authenticationType | Allowed values are `OAuth_2.0` and `Access Token`. | Yes |
| clientId | The client ID associated with your Zoho application. | Yes for OAuth 2.0 authentication | 
| clientSecrect | The clientsecret associated with your Zoho application. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes for OAuth 2.0 authentication | 
| refreshToken | The OAuth 2.0 refresh token associated with your Zoho application, used to refresh the access token when it expires. Refresh token will never expire. To get a refresh token, you must request the `offline` access_type, learn more from [this article](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/auth-request.html). <br>Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md).| Yes for OAuth 2.0 authentication |
| accessToken | The access token for Zoho authentication. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| useEncryptedEndpoints | Specifies whether the data source endpoints are encrypted using HTTPS. The default value is true.  | No |
| useHostVerification | Specifies whether to require the host name in the server's certificate to match the host name of the server when connecting over TLS. The default value is true.  | No |
| usePeerVerification | Specifies whether to verify the identity of the server when connecting over TLS. The default value is true.  | No |

**Example: OAuth 2.0 authentication**

```json
{
    "name": "ZohoLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Zoho",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionProperties": { 
                "authenticationType":"OAuth_2.0", 
                "endpoint": "crm.zoho.com/crm/private", 
                "clientId": "<client ID>",

                    "type": "SecureString",
                    "value": "<client secret>"
                },
                "accessToken": {
                    "type": "SecureString",
                    "value": "<access token>"
                }, 
                "refreshToken": {
                    "type": "SecureString",
                    "value": "<refresh token>"
                }, 
                "useEncryptedEndpoints": true,
                "useHostVerification": true, 
                "usePeerVerification": true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Example: access token authentication**

```json
{
    "name": "ZohoLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Zoho",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionProperties": { 
                "authenticationType":"Access Token",

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Zoho dataset.

To copy data from Zoho, set the type property of the dataset to **ZohoObject**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **ZohoObject** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

    "properties": {
        "type": "ZohoObject",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],

    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Zoho source.

### Zoho as source

To copy data from Zoho, set the source type in the copy activity to **ZohoSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |

                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
