# Copy data from Zoho using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics (Preview)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from Zoho. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is currently in preview. You can try it out and give us feedback. If you want to take a dependency on preview connectors in your solution, please contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/).

## Supported capabilities

This Zoho connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

<small>*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*</small>

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks, see the [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores) table.

This connector supports Xero access token authentication and OAuth 2.0 authentication.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

## Create a linked service to Zoho using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to Zoho in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Create a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Create a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for Zoho and select the Zoho connector.

   :::image type="content" source="media/connector-zoho/zoho-connector.png" alt-text="Select the Zoho connector.":::    


1. Configure the service details, test the connection, and create the new linked service.

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Zoho connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Zoho linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Zoho** | Yes |
| connectionProperties | A group of properties that defines how to connect to Zoho. | Yes |
| ***Under `connectionProperties`:*** | | |
| endpoint | The endpoint of the Zoho server (`crm.zoho.com/crm/private`). | Yes |
| authenticationType | Allowed values are `OAuth_2.0` and `Access Token`. | Yes |
| clientId | The client ID associated with your Zoho application. | Yes for OAuth 2.0 authentication | 
| clientSecrect | The clientsecret associated with your Zoho application. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes for OAuth 2.0 authentication | 
| refreshToken | The OAuth 2.0 refresh token associated with your Zoho application, used to refresh the access token when it expires. Refresh token will never expire. To get a refresh token, you must request the `offline` access_type, learn more from [this article](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/auth-request.html). <br>Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md).| Yes for OAuth 2.0 authentication |
| accessToken | The access token for Zoho authentication. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| useEncryptedEndpoints | Specifies whether the data source endpoints are encrypted using HTTPS. The default value is true.  | No |
| useHostVerification | Specifies whether to require the host name in the server's certificate to match the host name of the server when connecting over TLS. The default value is true.  | No |
| usePeerVerification | Specifies whether to verify the identity of the server when connecting over TLS. The default value is true.  | No |

**Example: OAuth 2.0 authentication**
