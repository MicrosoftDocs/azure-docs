# Filter activity in Azure Data Factory and Synapse Analytics pipelines
You can use a Filter activity in a pipeline to apply a filter expression to an input array. 
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

## Syntax

```json
{
    "name": "MyFilterActivity",
    "type": "filter",
    "typeProperties": {
        "condition": "<condition>",
        "items": "<input array>"
    }
}
```
## Create a Filter activity with UI

To use a Filter activity in a pipeline, complete the following steps:

1. You can use any array type variable or [outputs from other activities](how-to-expression-language-functions.md#examples-of-using-parameters-in-expressions) as the input for your filter condition.  To create an array variable, select the background of the pipeline canvas and then select the **Variables** tab to add an array type variable as shown below.

1. Search for _Filter_ in the pipeline Activities pane, and drag a Filter activity to the pipeline canvas.
1. Select the new Filter activity on the canvas if it is not already selected, and its  **Settings** tab, to edit its details.

1. Select the **Items** field and then select the **Add dynamic content** link to open the dynamic content editor pane.

   :::image type="content" source="media/control-flow-filter-activity/add-dynamic-content-link.png" alt-text="Shows the &nbsp;Add dynamic content&nbsp; link for the Items property.":::

1. Select your input array to be filtered in the dynamic content editor.  In this example, we select the variable created in the first step.

   :::image type="content" source="media/control-flow-activities-common/add-dynamic-content-pane.png" alt-text="Shows the dynamic content editor with the variable created in the first step selected":::

1. Use the dynamic content editor again to specify a filter condition for the Condition property, as shown above.
1. You can use the output from the Filter activity as an input to other activities like the [ForEach activity](control-flow-for-each-activity.md).

## Type properties

Property | Description | Allowed values | Required
-------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------
name | Name of the `Filter` activity. | String | Yes
type | Must be set to **filter**. | String | Yes
condition | Condition to be used for filtering the input. | Expression | Yes
items | Input array on which filter should be applied. | Expression | Yes

## Example

In this example, the pipeline has two activities: **Filter** and **ForEach**. The Filter activity is configured to filter the input array for items with a value greater than 3. The ForEach activity then iterates over the filtered values and sets the variable **test** to the current value.
