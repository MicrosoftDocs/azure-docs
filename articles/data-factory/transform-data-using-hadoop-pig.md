# Transform data using Hadoop Pig activity in Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics


[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

The HDInsight Pig activity in a Data Factory [pipeline](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) executes Pig queries on [your own](compute-linked-services.md#azure-hdinsight-linked-service) or [on-demand](compute-linked-services.md#azure-hdinsight-on-demand-linked-service) HDInsight cluster. This article builds on the [data transformation activities](transform-data.md) article, which presents a general overview of data transformation and the supported transformation activities.

To learn more, read through the introduction to [Azure Data Factory](introduction.md) or [Synapse Analytics](../synapse-analytics/overview-what-is.md) and do the [Tutorial: transform data](tutorial-transform-data-spark-powershell.md) before reading this article. 

## Add an HDInsight Pig activity to a pipeline with UI

To use an HDInsight Pig activity to a pipeline, complete the following steps:

1. Search for _Pig_ in the pipeline Activities pane, and drag a Pig activity to the pipeline canvas.
1. Select the new Pig activity on the canvas if it is not already selected.
1. Select the  **HDI Cluster** tab to select or create a new linked service to an HDInsight cluster that will be used to execute the MapReduce activity.

1. Select the **Script** tab to select or create a new script linked service to an Azure Storage location where your script will be hosted.  Specify a class name to be executed there, and a file path within the storage location.  You can also configure advanced details including debugging configuration, and arguments and parameters to be passed to the script.

## Syntax details

| Property            | Description                              | Required |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------- |
| name                | Name of the activity                     | Yes      |
| description         | Text describing what the activity is used for | No       |
| type                | For Hive Activity, the activity type is HDinsightPig | Yes      |
| linkedServiceName   | Reference to the HDInsight cluster registered as a linked service. To learn about this linked service, see [Compute linked services](compute-linked-services.md) article. | Yes      |
| scriptLinkedService | Reference to an Azure Storage Linked Service used to store the Pig script to be executed. Only **[Azure Blob Storage](./connector-azure-blob-storage.md)** and **[ADLS Gen2](./connector-azure-data-lake-storage.md)** linked services are supported here. If you don't specify this Linked Service, the Azure Storage Linked Service defined in the HDInsight Linked Service is used. | No       |
| scriptPath          | Provide the path to the script file stored in the Azure Storage referred by scriptLinkedService. The file name is case-sensitive. | No       |
| getDebugInfo        | Specifies when the log files are copied to the Azure Storage used by HDInsight cluster (or) specified by scriptLinkedService. Allowed values: None, Always, or Failure. Default value: None. | No       |
| arguments           | Specifies an array of arguments for a Hadoop job. The arguments are passed as command-line arguments to each task. | No       |
| defines             | Specify parameters as key/value pairs for referencing within the Pig script. | No       |
