## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for use to define activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by the Amazon RDS for SQL Server source.

### Amazon RDS for SQL Server as a source

>[!TIP]
>To load data from Amazon RDS for SQL Server efficiently by using data partitioning, learn more from [Parallel copy from SQL database](#parallel-copy-from-sql-database).

To copy data from Amazon RDS for SQL Server, set the source type in the copy activity to **AmazonRdsForSqlServerSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity source section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to **AmazonRdsForSqlServerSource**. | Yes |
| sqlReaderQuery |Use the custom SQL query to read data. An example is `select * from MyTable`. |No |
| sqlReaderStoredProcedureName |This property is the name of the stored procedure that reads data from the source table. The last SQL statement must be a SELECT statement in the stored procedure. |No |
| storedProcedureParameters |These parameters are for the stored procedure.<br/>Allowed values are name or value pairs. The names and casing of parameters must match the names and casing of the stored procedure parameters. |No |
| isolationLevel | Specifies the transaction locking behavior for the SQL source. The allowed values are: **ReadCommitted**, **ReadUncommitted**, **RepeatableRead**, **Serializable**, **Snapshot**. If not specified, the database's default isolation level is used. Refer to [this doc](/dotnet/api/system.data.isolationlevel) for more details. | No |
| partitionOptions | Specifies the data partitioning options used to load data from Amazon RDS for SQL Server. <br>Allowed values are: **None** (default), **PhysicalPartitionsOfTable**, and **DynamicRange**.<br>When a partition option is enabled (that is, not `None`), the degree of parallelism to concurrently load data from Amazon RDS for SQL Server is controlled by the [`parallelCopies`](copy-activity-performance-features.md#parallel-copy) setting on the copy activity. | No |
| partitionSettings | Specify the group of the settings for data partitioning. <br>Apply when the partition option isn't `None`. | No |
| ***Under `partitionSettings`:*** | | |
| partitionColumnName | Specify the name of the source column **in integer or  date/datetime type** (`int`, `smallint`, `bigint`, `date`, `smalldatetime`, `datetime`, `datetime2`, or `datetimeoffset`) that will be used by range partitioning for parallel copy. If not specified, the index or the primary key of the table is auto-detected and used as the partition column.<br>Apply when the partition option is `DynamicRange`. If you use a query to retrieve the source data, hook  `?DfDynamicRangePartitionCondition ` in the WHERE clause. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from SQL database](#parallel-copy-from-sql-database) section. | No |
| partitionUpperBound | The maximum value of the partition column for partition range splitting. This value is used to decide the partition stride, not for filtering the rows in table. All rows in the table or query result will be partitioned and copied. If not specified, copy activity auto detect the value.  <br>Apply when the partition option is `DynamicRange`. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from SQL database](#parallel-copy-from-sql-database) section. | No |
| partitionLowerBound | The minimum value of the partition column for partition range splitting. This value is used to decide the partition stride, not for filtering the rows in table. All rows in the table or query result will be partitioned and copied. If not specified, copy activity auto detect the value.<br>Apply when the partition option is `DynamicRange`. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from SQL database](#parallel-copy-from-sql-database) section. | No |

**Note the following points:**

- If **sqlReaderQuery** is specified for **AmazonRdsForSqlServerSource**, the copy activity runs this query against the Amazon RDS for SQL Server source to get the data. You also can specify a stored procedure by specifying **sqlReaderStoredProcedureName** and **storedProcedureParameters** if the stored procedure takes parameters.
- When using stored procedure in source to retrieve data, note if your stored procedure is designed as returning different schema when different parameter value is passed in, you may encounter failure or see unexpected result when importing schema from UI or when copying data to SQL database with auto table creation.

**Example: Use SQL query**

## Parallel copy from SQL database

The Amazon RDS for SQL Server connector in copy activity provides built-in data partitioning to copy data in parallel. You can find data partitioning options on the **Source** tab of the copy activity.

:::image type="content" source="./media/connector-amazon-rds-for-sql-server/connector-amazon-rds-for-sql-partition-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of partition options":::

When you enable partitioned copy, copy activity runs parallel queries against your Amazon RDS for SQL Server source to load data by partitions. The parallel degree is controlled by the [`parallelCopies`](copy-activity-performance-features.md#parallel-copy) setting on the copy activity. For example, if you set `parallelCopies` to four, the service concurrently generates and runs four queries based on your specified partition option and settings, and each query retrieves a portion of data from your Amazon RDS for SQL Server.

You are suggested to enable parallel copy with data partitioning especially when you load large amount of data from your Amazon RDS for SQL Server. The following are suggested configurations for different scenarios. When copying data into file-based data store, it's recommended to write to a folder as multiple files (only specify folder name), in which case the performance is better than writing to a single file.

| Scenario                                                     | Suggested settings                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Full load from large table, with physical partitions.        | **Partition option**: Physical partitions of table. <br><br/>During execution, the service automatically detects the physical partitions, and copies data by partitions. <br><br/>To check if your table has physical partition or not, you can refer to [this query](#sample-query-to-check-physical-partition). |
| Full load from large table, without physical partitions, while with an integer or datetime column for data partitioning. | **Partition options**: Dynamic range partition.<br>**Partition column** (optional): Specify the column used to partition data. If not specified, the primary key column is used.<br/>**Partition upper bound** and **partition lower bound** (optional): Specify if you want to determine the partition stride. This is not for filtering the rows in table, all rows in the table will be partitioned and copied. If not specified, copy activity auto detects the values and it can take long time depending on MIN and MAX values. It is recommended to provide upper bound and lower bound. <br><br>For example, if your partition column "ID" has values range from 1 to 100, and you set the lower bound as 20 and the upper bound as 80, with parallel copy as 4, the service retrieves data by 4 partitions - IDs in range <=20, [21, 50], [51, 80], and >=81, respectively. |
| Load a large amount of data by using a custom query, without physical partitions, while with an integer or date/datetime column for data partitioning. | **Partition options**: Dynamic range partition.<br>**Query**: `SELECT * FROM <TableName> WHERE ?DfDynamicRangePartitionCondition AND <your_additional_where_clause>`.<br>**Partition column**: Specify the column used to partition data.<br>**Partition upper bound** and **partition lower bound** (optional): Specify if you want to determine the partition stride. This is not for filtering the rows in table, all rows in the query result will be partitioned and copied. If not specified, copy activity auto detect the value.<br><br>For example, if your partition column "ID" has values range from 1 to 100, and you set the lower bound as 20 and the upper bound as 80, with parallel copy as 4, the service retrieves data by 4 partitions- IDs in range <=20, [21, 50], [51, 80], and >=81, respectively. <br><br>Here are more sample queries for different scenarios:<br> 1. Query the whole table: <br>`SELECT * FROM <TableName> WHERE ?DfDynamicRangePartitionCondition`<br> 2. Query from a table with column selection and additional where-clause filters: <br>`SELECT <column_list> FROM <TableName> WHERE ?DfDynamicRangePartitionCondition AND <your_additional_where_clause>`<br> 3. Query with subqueries: <br>`SELECT <column_list> FROM (<your_sub_query>) AS T WHERE ?DfDynamicRangePartitionCondition AND <your_additional_where_clause>`<br> 4. Query with partition in subquery: <br>`SELECT <column_list> FROM (SELECT <your_sub_query_column_list> FROM <TableName> WHERE ?DfDynamicRangePartitionCondition) AS T`

1. Choose distinctive column as partition column (like primary key or unique key) to avoid data skew. 
2. If the table has built-in partition, use partition option "Physical partitions of table" to get better performance.    
3. If you use Azure Integration Runtime to copy data, you can set larger "[Data Integration Units (DIU)](copy-activity-performance-features.md#data-integration-units)" (>4) to utilize more computing resource. Check the applicable scenarios there.
4. "[Degree of copy parallelism](copy-activity-performance-features.md#parallel-copy)" control the partition numbers, setting this number too large sometime hurts the performance, recommend setting this number as (DIU or number of Self-hosted IR nodes) * (2 to 4).

**Example: full load from large table with physical partitions**

```json
"source": {
    "type": "AmazonRdsForSqlServerSource",
    "partitionOption": "PhysicalPartitionsOfTable"
}
```

**Example: query with dynamic range partition**

```json
"source": {
    "type": "AmazonRdsForSqlServerSource",
    "query": "SELECT * FROM <TableName> WHERE ?DfDynamicRangePartitionCondition AND <your_additional_where_clause>",
    "partitionOption": "DynamicRange",
    "partitionSettings": {
        "partitionColumnName": "<partition_column_name>",
        "partitionUpperBound": "<upper_value_of_partition_column (optional) to decide the partition stride, not as data filter>",
        "partitionLowerBound": "<lower_value_of_partition_column (optional) to decide the partition stride, not as data filter>"
    }
}
```

### Sample query to check physical partition

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT s.name AS SchemaName, t.name AS TableName, pf.name AS PartitionFunctionName, c.name AS ColumnName, iif(pf.name is null, 'no', 'yes') AS HasPartition
FROM sys.tables AS t
LEFT JOIN sys.objects AS o ON t.object_id = o.object_id
LEFT JOIN sys.schemas AS s ON o.schema_id = s.schema_id
LEFT JOIN sys.indexes AS i ON t.object_id = i.object_id 
LEFT JOIN sys.index_columns AS ic ON ic.partition_ordinal > 0 AND ic.index_id = i.index_id AND ic.object_id = t.object_id 
LEFT JOIN sys.columns AS c ON c.object_id = ic.object_id AND c.column_id = ic.column_id 
LEFT JOIN sys.partition_schemes ps ON i.data_space_id = ps.data_space_id 
LEFT JOIN sys.partition_functions pf ON pf.function_id = ps.function_id 
WHERE s.name='[your schema]' AND t.name = '[your table name]'
```

If the table has physical partition, you would see "HasPartition" as "yes" like the following.

## Using Always Encrypted

When you copy data from/to Amazon RDS for SQL Server with [Always Encrypted](/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-database-engine), follow below steps: 

1. Store the [Column Master Key (CMK)](/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/create-and-store-column-master-keys-always-encrypted?view=sql-server-ver15&preserve-view=true) in an [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview). Learn more on [how to configure Always Encrypted by using Azure Key Vault](/azure/azure-sql/database/always-encrypted-azure-key-vault-configure?tabs=azure-powershell)

2. Make sure to grant access to the key vault where the [Column Master Key (CMK)](/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/create-and-store-column-master-keys-always-encrypted?view=sql-server-ver15&preserve-view=true) is stored. Refer to this [article](/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/create-and-store-column-master-keys-always-encrypted?view=sql-server-ver15&preserve-view=true#key-vaults) for required permissions.

3. Create linked service to connect to your SQL database and enable 'Always Encrypted' function by using either managed identity or service principal. 

## Troubleshoot connection issues

1. Configure your Amazon RDS for SQL Server instance to accept remote connections. Start **Amazon RDS for SQL Server Management Studio**, right-click **server**, and select **Properties**. Select **Connections** from the list, and select the **Allow remote connections to this server** check box.

    :::image type="content" source="media/copy-data-to-from-sql-server/AllowRemoteConnections.png" alt-text="Enable remote connections":::

    For detailed steps, see [Configure the remote access server configuration option](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-remote-access-server-configuration-option).

2. Start **Amazon RDS for SQL Server Configuration Manager**. Expand **Amazon RDS for SQL Server Network Configuration** for the instance you want, and select **Protocols for MSSQLSERVER**. Protocols appear in the right pane. Enable TCP/IP by right-clicking **TCP/IP** and selecting **Enable**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/copy-data-to-from-sql-server/EnableTCPProptocol.png" alt-text="Enable TCP/IP":::

    For more information and alternate ways of enabling TCP/IP protocol, see [Enable or disable a server network protocol](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-or-disable-a-server-network-protocol).

3. In the same window, double-click **TCP/IP** to launch the **TCP/IP Properties** window.
4. Switch to the **IP Addresses** tab. Scroll down to see the **IPAll** section. Write down the **TCP Port**. The default is **1433**.
5. Create a **rule for the Windows Firewall** on the machine to allow incoming traffic through this port. 
6. **Verify connection**: To connect to Amazon RDS for SQL Server by using a fully qualified name, use Amazon RDS for SQL Server Management Studio from a different machine. An example is `"<machine>.<domain>.corp.<company>.com,1433"`.

## Upgrade the Amazon RDS for SQL Server version

To upgrade the Amazon RDS for SQL Server version, in **Edit linked service** page, select **Recommended** under **Version** and configure the linked service by referring to [Linked service properties for the recommended version](#recommended-version).

## Differences between the recommended and the legacy version

The table below shows the differences between Amazon RDS for SQL Server using the recommended and the legacy version.

| Recommended version | Legacy version | 
|:--- |:--- |
| Support TLS 1.3 via `encrypt` as `strict`. | TLS 1.3 is not supported.|
