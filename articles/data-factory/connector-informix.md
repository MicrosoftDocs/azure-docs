# Copy data from and to IBM Informix using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from an IBM Informix data store. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This Informix connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/sink)|&#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.


## Prerequisites

To use this Informix connector, you need to:

- Set up a Self-hosted Integration Runtime. See [Self-hosted Integration Runtime](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md) article for details.
- Download the 64-bit Client SDK for Informix to create an ODBC connection for the data store on the Integration Runtime machine. For SDK download and setup, refer this [article](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/informix-client-software-development-kit-client-sdk-and-informix-connect-system-requirements) for details, or contact IBM support team for driver installation guidance.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

## Create a linked service to Informix using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to Informix in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for Informix and select the Informix connector.

1. Configure the service details, test the connection, and create the new linked service.

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Informix connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Informix linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Informix** | Yes |
| connectionString | The ODBC connection string excluding the credential portion. You can specify the connection string or use the system DSN (Data Source Name) you set up on the Integration Runtime machine (you need still specify the credential portion in linked service accordingly). <br> You can also put a password in Azure Key Vault and pull the `password` configuration out of the connection string. Refer to [Store credentials in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md) with more details.| Yes |
| authenticationType | Type of authentication used to connect to the Informix data store.<br/>Allowed values are: **Basic** and **Anonymous**. | Yes |
| userName | Specify user name if you are using Basic authentication. | No |
| password | Specify password for the user account you specified for the userName. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | No |
| credential | The access credential portion of the connection string specified in driver-specific property-value format. Mark this field as a SecureString. | No |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. A Self-hosted Integration Runtime is required as mentioned in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites). |Yes |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "InformixLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Informix",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "<Informix connection string or DSN>",

            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Informix dataset.

To copy data from Informix, the following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
