# Copy data from Magento using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics(Preview)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from Magento. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is currently in preview. You can try it out and give us feedback. If you want to take a dependency on preview connectors in your solution, please contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/).

## Supported capabilities

This Magento connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

<small>*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*</small>

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks, see the [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores) table.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

## Create a linked service to Magento using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to Magento in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for Magento and select the Magento connector.

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Magento connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Magento linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Magento** | Yes |
| host | The URL of the Magento instance. (that is, 192.168.222.110/magento3)  | Yes |
| accessToken | The access token from Magento. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| useEncryptedEndpoints | Specifies whether the data source endpoints are encrypted using HTTPS. The default value is true.  | No |
| useHostVerification | Specifies whether to require the host name in the server's certificate to match the host name of the server when connecting over TLS. The default value is true.  | No |
| usePeerVerification | Specifies whether to verify the identity of the server when connecting over TLS. The default value is true.  | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "MagentoLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Magento",
        "typeProperties": {
            "host" : "192.168.222.110/magento3",
            "accessToken": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<accessToken>"
            },
            "useEncryptedEndpoints" : true,
            "useHostVerification" : true,
            "usePeerVerification" : true
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Magento dataset.

To copy data from Magento, set the type property of the dataset to **MagentoObject**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **MagentoObject** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "MagentoDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "MagentoObject",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Magento linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Magento source.

### Magento as source

To copy data from Magento, set the source type in the copy activity to **MagentoSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **MagentoSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM Customers"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromMagento",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Magento input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "MagentoSource",

                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
