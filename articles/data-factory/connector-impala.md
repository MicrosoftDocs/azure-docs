# Copy data from Impala using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from Impala. It builds on the [Copy Activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of the copy activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Impala connector version 2.0 (Preview) provides improved native Impala support. If you are using the Impala connector version 1.0 in your solution, please [upgrade your Impala connector](#upgrade-the-impala-connector) before **September 30, 2025**. Refer to this [section](#differences-between-impala-version-20-and-version-10) for details on the difference between version 2.0 (Preview) and version 1.0.

## Supported capabilities

This Impala connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources or sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity. Therefore, you don't need to manually install a driver to use this connector.

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [Datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by the Impala dataset.

To copy data from Impala, set the type property of the dataset to **ImpalaObject**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |

## Data type mapping for Impala

When you copy data from and to Impala, the following interim data type mappings are used within the service. To learn about how the copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink, see [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md).

| Impala data type | Interim service data type (for version 2.0 (Preview)) | Interim service data type (for version 1.0) |
