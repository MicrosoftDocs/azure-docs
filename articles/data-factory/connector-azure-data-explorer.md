# Copy data to or from Azure Data Explorer using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article describes how to use the copy activity in Azure Data Factory and Synapse Analytics pipelines to copy data to or from [Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview). It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article, which offers a general overview of copy activity.

>[!TIP]
>To learn more about Azure Data Explorer integration with the service generally read [Integrate Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/data-factory-integration).

## Supported capabilities

This Azure Data Explorer connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/sink)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Mapping data flow](concepts-data-flow-overview.md) (source/sink)|&#9312; |
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

You can copy data from any supported source data store to Azure Data Explorer. You can also copy data from Azure Data Explorer to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that the copy activity supports as sources or sinks, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

>[!NOTE]
>Copying data to or from Azure Data Explorer through an on-premises data store by using self-hosted integration runtime is supported in version 3.14 and later.

With the Azure Data Explorer connector, you can do the following:

* Copy data by using Microsoft Entra application token authentication with a **service principal**.
* As a source, retrieve data by using a KQL (Kusto) query.
* As a sink, append data to a destination table.

## Getting started

>[!TIP]
>For a walkthrough of Azure Data Explorer connector, see [Copy data to/from Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/data-factory-load-data) and [Bulk copy from a database to Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/data-factory-template).

    :::image type="content" source="media/connector-azure-data-explorer/configure-azure-data-explorer-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of linked service configuration for Azure Data Explorer.":::

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define entities specific to Azure Data Explorer connector.

## Linked service properties

The Azure Data Explorer connector supports the following authentication types. See the corresponding sections for details:

- [Service principal authentication](#service-principal-authentication)
- [System-assigned managed identity authentication](#managed-identity)
- [User-assigned managed identity authentication](#user-assigned-managed-identity-authentication)

### Service principal authentication

To use service principal authentication, follow these steps to get a service principal and to grant permissions:

1. Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform. To learn how, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](../active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app.md). Make note of these values, which you use to define the linked service:

    - Application ID
    - Application key
    - Tenant ID

2. Grant the service principal the correct permissions in Azure Data Explorer. See [Manage Azure Data Explorer database permissions](/azure/data-explorer/manage-database-permissions) for detailed information about roles and permissions and about managing permissions. In general, you must:

    - **As source**, grant at least the **Database viewer** role to your database
    - **As sink**, grant at least the **Database user** role to your database

>[!NOTE]
>When you use the UI to author, by default your login user account is used to list Azure Data Explorer clusters, databases, and tables. You can choose to list the objects using the service principal by clicking the dropdown next to the refresh button, or manually enter the name if you don't have permission for these operations.

The following properties are supported for the Azure Data Explorer linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The **type** property must be set to **AzureDataExplorer**. | Yes |
| endpoint | Endpoint URL of the Azure Data Explorer cluster, with the format as `https://<clusterName>.<regionName>.kusto.windows.net`. | Yes |
| database | Name of database. | Yes |
| tenant | Specify the tenant information (domain name or tenant ID) under which your application resides. This is known as "Authority ID" in [Kusto connection string](/azure/kusto/api/connection-strings/kusto#application-authentication-properties). Retrieve it by hovering the mouse pointer in the upper-right corner of the Azure portal. | Yes |
| servicePrincipalId | Specify the application's client ID. This is known as "Microsoft Entra application client ID" in [Kusto connection string](/azure/kusto/api/connection-strings/kusto#application-authentication-properties). | Yes |
| servicePrincipalKey | Specify the application's key. This is known as "Microsoft Entra application key" in [Kusto connection string](/azure/kusto/api/connection-strings/kusto#application-authentication-properties). Mark this field as a **SecureString** to store it securely, or [reference secure data stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| connectVia | The [integration runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. You can use the Azure integration runtime or a self-hosted integration runtime if your data store is in a private network. If not specified, the default Azure integration runtime is used. |No |

**Example: using service principal key authentication**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureDataExplorerLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzureDataExplorer",
        "typeProperties": {

            }
        ]
    }
]
```

## Mapping data flow properties

When transforming data in mapping data flow, you can read from and write to tables in Azure Data Explorer. For more information, see the [source transformation](data-flow-source.md) and [sink transformation](data-flow-sink.md) in mapping data flows. You can choose to use an Azure Data Explorer dataset or an [inline dataset](data-flow-source.md#inline-datasets) as source and sink type.

### Source transformation

The below table lists the properties supported by Azure Data Explorer source. You can edit these properties in the **Source options** tab.

| Name | Description | Required | Allowed values | Data flow script property |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Table | If you select Table as input, data flow will fetch all the data from the table specified in the Azure Data Explorer dataset or in the source options when using inline dataset. | No | String | *(for inline dataset only)*<br>tableName |
| Query | A read-only request given in a [KQL format](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/). Use the custom KQL query as a reference.  | No | String | query |
| Timeout | The wait time before the query request times out. Default is '172000' (2 days)  | No | Integer | timeout |

#### Azure Data Explorer source script examples

When you use Azure Data Explorer dataset as source type, the associated data flow script is:

```
source(allowSchemaDrift: true,
	validateSchema: false,
	query: 'table | take 10',
	format: 'query') ~> AzureDataExplorerSource

```

If you use inline dataset, the associated data flow script is:

```
source(allowSchemaDrift: true,
    validateSchema: false,
    format: 'query',
    query: 'table | take 10',
    store: 'azuredataexplorer') ~> AzureDataExplorerSource

```

### Sink transformation

The below table lists the properties supported by Azure Data Explorer sink. You can edit these properties in the **Settings** tab. When using inline dataset, you will see additional settings, which are the same as the properties described in [dataset properties](#dataset-properties) section. 

| Name | Description | Required | Allowed values | Data flow script property |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Table action | Determines whether to recreate or remove all rows from the destination table prior to writing.<br>- **None**: No action will be done to the table.<br>- **Recreate**: The table will get dropped and recreated. Required if creating a new table dynamically.<br>- **Truncate**: All rows from the target table will get removed. | No | `true` or `false` | recreate<br/>truncate |
| Pre and Post SQL scripts | Specify multiple [Kusto control commands](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/#control-commands) scripts that will execute before (pre-processing) and after (post-processing) data is written to your sink database. | No | String | preSQLs; postSQLs |
| Timeout | The wait time before the query request times out. Default is '172000' (2 days) | No | Integer | timeout |


#### Azure Data Explorer sink script examples

When you use Azure Data Explorer dataset as sink type, the associated data flow script is:

```
IncomingStream sink(allowSchemaDrift: true,
	validateSchema: false,
	format: 'table',
	preSQLs:['pre SQL scripts'],
	postSQLs:['post SQL script'],
	skipDuplicateMapInputs: true,
	skipDuplicateMapOutputs: true) ~> AzureDataExplorerSink

```

If you use inline dataset, the associated data flow script is:

```
IncomingStream sink(allowSchemaDrift: true,
    validateSchema: false,
    format: 'table',
    store: 'azuredataexplorer',
    skipDuplicateMapInputs: true,
    skipDuplicateMapOutputs: true) ~> AzureDataExplorerSink

```
