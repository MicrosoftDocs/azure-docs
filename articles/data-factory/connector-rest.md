# Copy and transform data from and to a REST endpoint by using Azure Data Factory
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from and to a REST endpoint. The article builds on [Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory](copy-activity-overview.md), which presents a general overview of Copy Activity.

The difference among this REST connector, [HTTP connector](connector-http.md), and the [Web table connector](connector-web-table.md) are:

- **REST connector** specifically supports copying data from RESTful APIs.
- **HTTP connector** is generic to retrieve data from any HTTP endpoint, for example, to download file. Before this REST connector you may happen to use HTTP connector to copy data from RESTful APIs, which is supported but less functional comparing to REST connector.
- **Web table connector** extracts table content from an HTML webpage.

## Supported capabilities

This REST connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/sink)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Mapping data flow](concepts-data-flow-overview.md) (source/sink)|&#9312; |

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks, see [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores).

Specifically, this generic REST connector supports:

- Copying data from a REST endpoint by using the **GET** or **POST** methods and copying data to a REST endpoint by using the **POST**, **PUT** or **PATCH** methods.
- Copying data by using one of the following authentications: **Anonymous**, **Basic**, **Service Principal**, **OAuth2 Client Credential**, **System Assigned Managed Identity** and **User Assigned Managed Identity**.
- **[Pagination](#pagination-support)** in the REST APIs.
- For REST as source, copying the REST JSON response [as-is](#export-json-response-as-is) or parse it by using [schema mapping](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md#schema-mapping). Only response payload in **JSON** is supported.

> [!TIP]
> To test a request for data retrieval before you configure the REST connector in Data Factory, learn about the API specification for header and body requirements. You can use tools like Visual Studio, PowerShell's Invoke-RestMethod or a web browser to validate.

#### Save the service principal certificate in Azure Key Vault

You have two options to save the service principal certificate in Azure Key Vault:

- **Option 1**

    1. Convert the service principal certificate to a base64 string. Learn more from this [article](https://blog.tekspace.io/convert-certificate-from-pfx-to-base64-with-powershell/).

    
    2. Save the base64 string as a secret in Azure Key Vault.

       :::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/secret-value.png" alt-text="Screenshot of secret value.":::

- **Option 2**
	
    If you can't download the certificate from Azure Key Vault, you can use this [template](https://supportability.visualstudio.com/256c8350-cb4b-49c9-ac6e-a012aeb312d1/_apis/git/repositories/da6cf5d9-0dc5-4ba9-a5e2-6e6a93adf93c/Items?path=/AzureDataFactory/.attachments/ConvertCertToBase64StringInAKVPipeline-47f8e507-e7ef-4343-a73b-733b9a7f8e4e.zip&download=false&resolveLfs=true&%24format=octetStream&api-version=5.0-preview.1&sanitize=true&includeContentMetadata=true&versionDescriptor.version=master) to save the converted service principal certificate as a secret in Azure Key Vault.

            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

This section provides a list of properties that the REST dataset supports. 

For a full list of sections and properties that are available for defining datasets, see [Datasets and linked services](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md). 

To copy data from REST, the following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The **type** property of the dataset must be set to **RestResource**. | Yes |
| relativeUrl | A relative URL to the resource that contains the data. When this property isn't specified, only the URL that's specified in the linked service definition is used. The HTTP connector copies data from the combined URL: `[URL specified in linked service]/[relative URL specified in dataset]`. | No |

If you were setting `requestMethod`, `additionalHeaders`, `requestBody` and `paginationRules` in dataset, it is still supported as-is, while you are suggested to use the new model in activity going forward.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "RESTDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "RestResource",
        "typeProperties": {
            "relativeUrl": "<relative url>"
        },
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<REST linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy Activity properties

This section provides a list of properties supported by the REST source and sink.

For a full list of sections and properties that are available for defining activities, see [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md). 

### REST as source

The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The **type** property of the copy activity source must be set to **RestSource**. | Yes |
| requestMethod | The HTTP method. Allowed values are **GET** (default) and **POST**. | No |
| additionalHeaders | Additional HTTP request headers. | No |
| requestBody | The body for the HTTP request. | No |
| paginationRules | The pagination rules to compose next page requests. Refer to [pagination support](#pagination-support) section on details. | No |
| httpRequestTimeout | The timeout (the **TimeSpan** value) for the HTTP request to get a response. This value is the timeout to get a response, not the timeout to read response data. The default value is **00:01:40**.  | No |
| requestInterval | The time to wait before sending the request for next page. The default value is **00:00:01** |  No |

>[!NOTE]
>REST connector ignores any "Accept" header specified in `additionalHeaders`. As REST connector only support response in JSON, it will auto generate a header of `Accept: application/json`. <br>
>The array of object as the response body is not supported in pagination.

**Example 1: Using the Get method with pagination**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromREST",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<REST input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [

                },
                "paginationRules": {
                    "AbsoluteUrl": "$.paging.next"
                },
                "httpRequestTimeout": "00:01:00"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

**Example 2: Using the Post method**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromREST",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<REST input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "RestSource",
                "requestMethod": "Post",
                "requestBody": "<body for POST REST request>",
                "httpRequestTimeout": "00:01:00"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

### REST as sink

The following properties are supported in the copy activity **sink** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The **type** property of the copy activity sink must be set to **RestSink**. | Yes |
| requestMethod | The HTTP method. Allowed values are **POST** (default), **PUT**, and **PATCH**. | No |
| additionalHeaders | Additional HTTP request headers. | No |
| httpRequestTimeout | The timeout (the **TimeSpan** value) for the HTTP request to get a response. This value is the timeout to get a response, not the timeout to write the data. The default value is **00:01:40**.  | No |
| requestInterval | The interval time between different requests in millisecond. Request interval value should be a number between [10, 60000]. |  No |
| httpCompressionType | HTTP compression type to use while sending data with Optimal Compression Level. Allowed values are **none** and **gzip**. | No |
| writeBatchSize | Number of records to write to the REST sink per batch. The default value is 10000. | No |

REST connector as sink works with the REST APIs that accept JSON. The data will be sent in JSON with the following pattern. As needed, you can use the copy activity [schema mapping](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md#schema-mapping) to reshape the source data to conform to the expected payload by the REST API.

```json
[
    { <data object> },
    { <data object> },
    ...
]
```

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyToREST",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],

## Mapping data flow properties

REST is supported in data flows for both integration datasets and inline datasets.

### Source transformation

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| requestMethod | The HTTP method. Allowed values are **GET** and **POST**. | Yes |
| relativeUrl | A relative URL to the resource that contains the data. When this property isn't specified, only the URL that's specified in the linked service definition is used. The HTTP connector copies data from the combined URL: `[URL specified in linked service]/[relative URL specified in dataset]`. | No |
| additionalHeaders | Additional HTTP request headers. | No |
| httpRequestTimeout | The timeout (the **TimeSpan** value) for the HTTP request to get a response. This value is the timeout to get a response, not the timeout to write the data. The default value is **00:01:40**.  | No |
| requestInterval | The interval time between different requests in millisecond. Request interval value should be a number between [10, 60000]. |  No |
| QueryParameters.*request_query_parameter* OR QueryParameters['request_query_parameter'] | "request_query_parameter" is user-defined, which references one query parameter name in the next HTTP request URL. | No |

### Sink transformation

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| additionalHeaders | Additional HTTP request headers. | No |
| httpRequestTimeout | The timeout (the **TimeSpan** value) for the HTTP request to get a response. This value is the timeout to get a response, not the timeout to write the data. The default value is **00:01:40**.  | No |
| requestInterval | The interval time between different requests in millisecond. Request interval value should be a number between [10, 60000]. |  No |
| httpCompressionType | HTTP compression type to use while sending data with Optimal Compression Level. Allowed values are **none** and **gzip**. | No |
| writeBatchSize | Number of records to write to the REST sink per batch. The default value is 10000. | No |

You can set the delete, insert, update, and upsert methods as well as the relative row data to send to the REST sink for CRUD operations.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-flow/data-flow-sink.png" alt-text="Data flow REST sink":::

## Sample data flow script

Notice the use of an alter row transformation prior to the sink to instruct ADF what type of action to take with your REST sink. I.e. insert, update, upsert, delete.

```
AlterRow1 sink(allowSchemaDrift: true,
	validateSchema: false,
	deletable:true,
	insertable:true,
	updateable:true,
	upsertable:true,
	rowRelativeUrl: 'periods',
	insertHttpMethod: 'PUT',
	deleteHttpMethod: 'DELETE',
	upsertHttpMethod: 'PUT',
	updateHttpMethod: 'PATCH',
	timeout: 30,
	requestFormat: ['type' -> 'json'],
	skipDuplicateMapInputs: true,
	skipDuplicateMapOutputs: true) ~> sink1
```
>[!NOTE]
> Data Flow generates a total of N+1 API calls when processing N pages. This includes one initial call to infer the schema, followed by N calls corresponding to the number of pages fetched from the source.


## Pagination support

When you copy data from REST APIs, normally, the REST API limits its response payload size of a single request under a reasonable number; while to return large amount of data, it splits the result into multiple pages and requires callers to send consecutive requests to get next page of the result. Usually, the request for one page is dynamic and composed by the information returned from the response of previous page.

This generic REST connector supports the following pagination patterns: 

* Next request’s absolute or relative URL = property value in current response body
* Next request’s absolute or relative URL = header value in current response headers
* Next request’s query parameter = property value in current response body
* Next request’s query parameter = header value in current response headers
* Next request’s header = property value in current response body
* Next request’s header = header value in current response headers

**Pagination rules** are defined as a dictionary in dataset, which contains one or more case-sensitive key-value pairs. The configuration will be used to generate the request starting from the second page. The connector will stop iterating when it gets HTTP status code 204 (No Content), or any of the JSONPath expressions in "paginationRules" returns null.

**Supported keys** in pagination rules:

| Key | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| AbsoluteUrl | Indicates the URL to issue the next request. It can be **either absolute URL or relative URL**. |
| QueryParameters.*request_query_parameter* OR QueryParameters['request_query_parameter'] | "request_query_parameter" is user-defined, which references one query parameter name in the next HTTP request URL. |
| Headers.*request_header* OR Headers['request_header'] | "request_header" is user-defined, which references one header name in the next HTTP request. |
| EndCondition:*end_condition* | "end_condition" is user-defined, which indicates the condition that will end the pagination loop in the next HTTP request. |
| MaxRequestNumber | Indicates the maximum pagination request number. Leave it as empty means no limit. |
| SupportRFC5988 | By default, this is set to true if no pagination rule is defined. You can disable this rule by setting `supportRFC5988` to false or remove this property from script. |

**Supported values** in pagination rules:

| Value | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| Headers.*response_header* OR Headers['response_header'] | "response_header" is user-defined, which references one header name in the current HTTP response, the value of which will be used to issue next request. |
| A JSONPath expression starting with "$" (representing the root of the response body) | The response body should contain only one JSON object and the array of object as the response body is not supported. The JSONPath expression should return a single primitive value, which will be used to issue next request. |

>[!NOTE]
> The pagination rules in mapping data flows is different from it in copy activity in the following aspects:
>1. Range is not supported in mapping data flows.
>2. `['']` is not supported in mapping data flows. Instead, use `{}` to escape special character. For example, `body.{@odata.nextLink}`, whose JSON node `@odata.nextLink` contains special character `.` .
>3. The end condition is supported in mapping data flows, but the condition syntax is different from it in copy activity. `body` is used to indicate the response body instead of `$`. `header` is used to indicate the response header instead of `headers`. Here are two examples showing this difference:  
>    - Example 1:  
>      Copy activity: **"EndCondition:$.data": "Empty"**  
>      Mapping data flows: **"EndCondition:body.data": "Empty"**  
>    - Example 2:  
>      Copy activity: **"EndCondition:headers.complete": "Exist"**  
>      Mapping data flows: **"EndCondition:header.complete": "Exist"**  

### Pagination rules examples

This section provides a list of examples for pagination rules settings.

#### Example 1: Variables in QueryParameters

This example provides the configuration steps to send multiple requests whose variables are in QueryParameters.

**Multiple requests:**
```
baseUrl/api/now/table/incident?sysparm_limit=1000&sysparm_offset=0,
baseUrl/api/now/table/incident?sysparm_limit=1000&sysparm_offset=1000,
...... 
baseUrl/api/now/table/incident?sysparm_limit=1000&sysparm_offset=10000
```

*Step 1*: Input `sysparm_offset={offset}` either in **Base URL** or **Relative URL** as shown in the following screenshots:
        
:::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-1-rest-linked-service-base-url.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing one configuration to send multiple requests whose variables are in Query Parameters.":::  
    
or

:::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-1-rest-linked-service-relative-url.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing another configuration to send multiple requests whose variables are in Query Parameters."::: 
        
*Step 2*: Set **Pagination rules** as either option 1 or option 2：
            
- Option1: **"QueryParameters.{offset}" : "RANGE:0:10000:1000"**
            
- Option2: **"AbsoluteUrl.{offset}" : "RANGE:0:10000:1000"**


#### Example 2：Variables in AbsoluteUrl

This example provides the configuration steps to send multiple requests whose variables are in AbsoluteUrl.

**Multiple requests:**
```
BaseUrl/api/now/table/t1
BaseUrl/api/now/table/t2
...... 
BaseUrl/api/now/table/t100
```

*Step 1*: Input `{id}` either in **Base URL** in the linked service configuration page or **Relative URL** in the dataset connection pane.
    
:::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-2-rest-linked-service-base-url.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing one configuration to send multiple requests whose variables are in Absolute Url."::: 

or

:::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-2-rest-linked-service-relative-url.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing another configuration to send multiple requests whose variables are in Absolute Url."::: 

*Step 2*: Set **Pagination rules** as **"AbsoluteUrl.{id}" :"RANGE:1:100:1"**.

#### Example 3：Variables in Headers

This example provides the configuration steps to send multiple requests whose variables are in Headers.

**Multiple requests:**<br/>
RequestUrl: *https://example/table*<br/> 
Request 1: `Header(id->0)`<br/>
Request 2: `Header(id->10)`<br/>
......<br/>
Request 100: `Header(id->100)`<br/>

*Step 1*: Input `{id}` in **Additional headers**.
    
*Step 2*: Set **Pagination rules** as **"Headers.{id}" : "RANGE:0:100:10"**.

:::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the pagination rule to send multiple requests whose variables are in Headers."::: 

#### Example 4：Variables are in AbsoluteUrl/QueryParameters/Headers, the end variable is not pre-defined and the end condition is based on the response

This example provides configuration steps to send multiple requests whose variables are in AbsoluteUrl/QueryParameters/Headers but the end variable is not defined. For different responses, different end condition rule settings are shown in Example 4.1-4.6.

**Multiple requests:**

```
Request 1: baseUrl/api/now/table/incident?sysparm_limit=1000&sysparm_offset=0, 
Request 2: baseUrl/api/now/table/incident?sysparm_limit=1000&sysparm_offset=1000,
Request 3: baseUrl/api/now/table/incident?sysparm_limit=1000&sysparm_offset=2000,
...... 
```

Two responses encountered in this example:<br/>

Response 1：

```json
{
    Data: [
        {key1: val1, key2: val2
        },
        {key1: val3, key2: val4
        }
    ]
}
```

Response 2：

```json
{
    Data: [
        {key1: val5, key2: val6
        },
        {key1: val7, key2: val8
        }
    ]
}
```
    
*Step 1*: Set the range of **Pagination rules** as [Example 1](#example-1-variables-in-queryparameters) and leave the end of range empty as **"AbsoluteUrl.{offset}": "RANGE:0::1000"**.

*Step 2*: Set different end condition rules according to different last responses. See below examples:

- **Example 4.1: The pagination ends when the value of the specific node in response is empty** 

    The REST API returns the last response in the following structure:
        
    ```json
    {
        Data: []
    }
    ```
    Set the end condition rule as **"EndCondition:$.data": "Empty"** to end the pagination when the value of the specific node in response is empty.

    :::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-4-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the End Condition setting for Example 4.1."::: 

- **Example 4.2: The pagination ends when the value of the specific node in response does not exist** 

    The REST API returns the last response in the following structure:

    ```json
    {}
    ```
    Set the end condition rule as **"EndCondition:$.data": "NonExist"** to end the pagination when the value of the specific node in response does not exist.
        
    :::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-4-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the End Condition setting for Example 4.2."::: 

- **Example 4.3: The pagination ends when the value of the specific node in response exists**
    
    The REST API returns the last response in the following structure:

    ```json
    {
        Data: [
            {key1: val991, key2: val992
            },
            {key1: val993, key2: val994
            }
        ],
                Complete: true
    }
    ```
    Set the end condition rule as **"EndCondition:$.Complete": "Exist"** to end the pagination when the value of the specific node in response exists.

    :::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-4-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the End Condition setting for Example 4.3."::: 

- **Example 4.4: The pagination ends when the value of the specific node in response is a user-defined const value**

    The REST API returns the response in the following structure:
    ```json
    {
        Data: [
            {key1: val1, key2: val2
            },
            {key1: val3, key2: val4
            }
        ],
                Complete: false
    }
    ```
    ......

    And the last response is in the following structure:

    ```json
    {
        Data: [
            {key1: val991, key2: val992
            },
            {key1: val993, key2: val994
            }
        ],
                Complete: true
    }
    ```
    Set the end condition rule as **"EndCondition:$.Complete": "Const:true"** to end the pagination when the value of the specific node in response is a user-defined const value.
        
    :::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-4-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the End Condition setting for Example 4.4."::: 

- **Example 4.5: The pagination ends when the value of the header key in response equals to user-defined const value**

    The header keys in REST API responses are shown in the structure below:

    Response header 1: `header(Complete->0)`<br/>
    ......<br/>
    Last Response header: `header(Complete->1)`<br/>
        
    Set the end condition rule as **"EndCondition:headers.Complete": "Const:1"** to end the pagination when the value of the header key in response is equal to user-defined const value.
        
    :::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-4-5.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the End Condition setting for Example 4.5."::: 

- **Example 4.6: The pagination ends when the key exists in the response header**

    The header keys in REST API responses are shown in the structure below:

    Response header 1: `header()`<br/>
    ......<br/>
    Last Response header: `header(CompleteTime->20220920)`<br/>
        
    Set the end condition rule as **"EndCondition:headers.CompleteTime": "Exist"** to end the pagination when the key exists in the response header.

    :::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-4-6.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the End Condition setting for Example 4.6."::: 

#### Example 5：Set end condition to avoid endless requests when range rule is not defined

This example provides the configuration steps to send multiple requests when the range rule is not used. The end condition can be set refer to Example 4.1-4.6 to avoid endless requests. The REST API returns response in the following structure, in which case next page's URL is represented in ***paging.next***.

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "created_time": "2017-12-12T14:12:20+0000",
            "name": "album1",
            "id": "1809938745705498_1809939942372045"
        },
        {
            "created_time": "2017-12-12T14:14:03+0000",
            "name": "album2",
            "id": "1809938745705498_1809941802371859"
        },
        {
            "created_time": "2017-12-12T14:14:11+0000",
            "name": "album3",
            "id": "1809938745705498_1809941879038518"
        }
    ],
    "paging": {
        "cursors": {
            "after": "MTAxNTExOTQ1MjAwNzI5NDE=",
            "before": "NDMyNzQyODI3OTQw"
        },
        "previous": "https://graph.facebook.com/me/albums?limit=25&before=NDMyNzQyODI3OTQw",
        "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/me/albums?limit=25&after=MTAxNTExOTQ1MjAwNzI5NDE="
    }
}
...
```
The last response is:

```json
{
    "data": [],
    "paging": {
        "cursors": {
            "after": "MTAxNTExOTQ1MjAwNzI5NDE=",
            "before": "NDMyNzQyODI3OTQw"
        },
        "previous": "https://graph.facebook.com/me/albums?limit=25&before=NDMyNzQyODI3OTQw",
        "next": "Same with Last Request URL"
    }
}
```

*Step 1*: Set **Pagination rules** as **"AbsoluteUrl": "$.paging.next"**.
   
*Step 2*: If `next` in the last response is always same with the last request URL and not empty, endless requests will be sent. The end condition can be used to avoid endless requests. Therefore, set the end condition rule refer to Example 4.1-4.6.

#### Example 6：Set the max request number to avoid endless request

Set **MaxRequestNumber** to avoid endless request as shown in the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-6.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Max Request Number setting for Example 6."::: 

#### Example 7：The RFC 5988 pagination rule is supported by default

The backend will automatically get the next URL based on the RFC 5988 style links in the header.  

:::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-7-http-header.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing samples of the http header that complies with R F C 5988."::: 

> [!TIP]
> If you don't want to enable this default pagination rule, you can set `supportRFC5988` to `false` or just delete it in the script.

#### Example 8a: The next request URL is in the response body when using pagination in mapping data flows

This example states how to set the pagination rule and the end condition rule in mapping data flows when the next request URL is from the response body.

The response schema is shown below:

:::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-8-response-schema.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the response schema of Example 8."::: 

The pagination rules should be set as the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-8.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to set the pagination rule for Example 8."::: 

By default, the pagination will stop when body.{@odata.nextLink}** is null or empty. 

But if the value of **@odata.nextLink** in the last response body is equal to the last request URL, then it will lead to the endless loop. To avoid this condition, define end condition rules.

- If **Value** in the last response is **Empty**, then the end condition rule can be set as below: 

    :::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-8-end-condition-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing setting the end condition rule when the last response is empty."::: 
    
- If the value of the complete key in the response header equals to true indicates the end of pagination, then the end condition rule can be set as below: 

    :::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-8-end-condition-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing setting the end condition rule when the complete key in the response header equals to true indicates the end of pagination."::: 

#### Example 8b: The next request URL is in the response body when using pagination in copy activity

This example demonstrates how to set the pagination rule in a copy activity when the next request URL is contained within the response body.

The response schema is shown below:

:::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-8-response-schema.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the response schema of Example 8b."::: 

The pagination rules should be set as shown in the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-8b.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to set the pagination rule for Example 8b."::: 

#### Example 9: The response format is XML and the next request URL is from the response body when use pagination in mapping data flows

This example states how to set the pagination rule in mapping data flows when the response format is XML and the next request URL is from the response body. As shown in the following screenshot, the first URL is *https://\<user\>.dfs.core.windows.NET/bugfix/test/movie_1.xml*


:::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-9-situation.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the response format is X M L and the next request U R L is from the response body."::: 


The response schema is shown below:

:::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-9-response-schema.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the response schema of Example 9."::: 

The pagination rule syntax is the same as in Example 8 and should be set as below in this example:

:::image type="content" source="media/connector-rest/pagination-rule-example-9.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing setting the pagination rule for Example 9."::: 

## Export JSON response as-is

You can use this REST connector to export REST API JSON response as-is to various file-based stores. To achieve such schema-agnostic copy, skip the "structure" (also called *schema*) section in dataset and schema mapping in copy activity.

## Schema mapping

To copy data from REST endpoint to tabular sink, refer to [schema mapping](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md#schema-mapping).
