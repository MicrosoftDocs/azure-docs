# Copy data from Spark using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from Spark. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This Spark connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Prerequisites

## Create a linked service to Spark using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to Spark in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for Spark and select the Spark connector.

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Spark dataset.

To copy data from Spark, set the type property of the dataset to **SparkObject**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **SparkObject** | Yes |
| schema | Name of the schema. |No (if "query" in activity source is specified)  |
| table | Name of the table. |No (if "query" in activity source is specified)  |
| tableName | Name of the table with schema. This property is supported for backward compatibility. Use `schema` and `table` for new workload. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "SparkDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SparkObject",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Spark linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Spark source.

### Spark as source

To copy data from Spark, set the source type in the copy activity to **SparkSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **SparkSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromSpark",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Spark input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],

            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Data type mapping for Spark

When you copy data from and to Spark, the following interim data type mappings are used within the service. To learn about how the copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink, see [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md).

|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| BooleanType  | Boolean  | Boolean  | 
| ByteType  | Sbyte  | Int16  | 
| ShortType  | Int16  | Int16  | 
| IntegerType  | Int32  | Int32  | 
| LongType  | Int64  | Int64  | 
| FloatType  | Single  | Single  |

## Upgrade the Spark connector

1. In **Edit linked service** page, select 2.0 for version and configure the linked service by referring to [Linked service properties version 2.0 (Preview)](#version-20-preview).

1. The data type mapping for the Spark linked service version 2.0 (Preview) is different from that for the version 1.0. To learn the latest data type mapping, see [Data type mapping for Spark](#data-type-mapping-for-spark).

## Differences between Spark version 2.0 (Preview) and version 1.0

The Spark connector version 2.0 (Preview) offers new functionalities and is compatible with most features of version 1.0. The following table shows the feature differences between version 2.0 (Preview) and version 1.0.

| Version 2.0 (Preview)  | Version 1.0  | 
|:--- |:--- |
| SharkServer and SharkServer2 are not supported for `serverType`. | Support SharkServer and SharkServer2 for `serverType`. | 
| Binary and SASL are not supported for `thriftTransportProtocl`. | Support Binary and SASL for `thriftTransportProtocl`. | 
| Username authentication type is not supported. | Support Username authentication type. |
| The default value of `enableSSL` is true. `trustedCertPath`, `useSystemTrustStore`, `allowHostNameCNMismatch` and `allowSelfSignedServerCert` are not supported.| The default value of `enableSSL` is false. Additionally, support `trustedCertPath`, `useSystemTrustStore`, `allowHostNameCNMismatch` and `allowSelfSignedServerCert`.	 |  
| The following mappings are used from Spark data types to interim service data types used by the service internally.<br><br>TimestampType -> DateTimeOffset <br>YearMonthIntervalType -> String<br>DayTimeIntervalType -> String | The following mappings are used from Spark data types to interim service data types used by the service internally.<br><br>TimestampType -> DateTime<br>Other mappings supported by version 2.0 (Preview) listed left are not supported by version 1.0. |
