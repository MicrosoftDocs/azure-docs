# Copy data from Marketo using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics (Preview)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is at [End of Support stage](connector-deprecation-plan.md). You are recommended to migrate to [ODBC connector](connector-odbc.md) by installing a driver.

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from Marketo. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This Marketo connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks, see the [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores) table.

Currently, Marketo instance which is integrated with external CRM is not supported.

>[!NOTE]
>This Marketo connector is built on top of the Marketo REST API. Be aware that the Marketo has [concurrent request limit](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/) on service side. If you hit errors saying "Error while attempting to use REST API: Max rate limit '100' exceeded with in '20' secs (606)" or "Error while attempting to use REST API: Concurrent access limit '10' reached (615)", consider to reduce the concurrent copy activity runs to reduce the number of requests to the service.

## Getting started

## Create a linked service to Marketo using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to Marketo in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for Marketo and select the Marketo connector.

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Marketo connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Marketo linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Marketo** | Yes |
| endpoint | The endpoint of the Marketo server. (i.e. 123-ABC-321.mktorest.com)  | Yes |
| clientId | The client ID of your Marketo service.  | Yes |
| clientSecret | The client secret of your Marketo service. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| useEncryptedEndpoints | Specifies whether the data source endpoints are encrypted using HTTPS. The default value is true.  | No |
| useHostVerification | Specifies whether to require the host name in the server's certificate to match the host name of the server when connecting over TLS. The default value is true.  | No |
| usePeerVerification | Specifies whether to verify the identity of the server when connecting over TLS. The default value is true.  | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "MarketoLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Marketo",
        "typeProperties": {
            "endpoint" : "123-ABC-321.mktorest.com",
            "clientId" : "<clientId>",
            "clientSecret": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<clientSecret>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Marketo dataset.

To copy data from Marketo, set the type property of the dataset to **MarketoObject**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **MarketoObject** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "MarketoDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "MarketoObject",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Marketo linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Marketo source.

### Marketo as source

To copy data from Marketo, set the source type in the copy activity to **MarketoSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **MarketoSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM Activity_Types"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromMarketo",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {

                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
