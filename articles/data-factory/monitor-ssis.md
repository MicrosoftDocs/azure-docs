# Monitor SSIS operations with Azure Monitor

To lift & shift your SSIS workloads, you can [provision SSIS IR in ADF](./tutorial-deploy-ssis-packages-azure.md) that supports:

- Running packages deployed into SSIS catalog (SSISDB) hosted by Azure SQL Database server/Managed Instance (Project Deployment Model)
- Running packages deployed into file system, Azure Files, or SQL Server database (MSDB) hosted by Azure SQL Managed Instance (Package Deployment Model)

Once provisioned, you can [check SSIS IR operational status using Azure PowerShell or on the **Monitor** hub of ADF portal](./monitor-integration-runtime.md#azure-ssis-integration-runtime). With Project Deployment Model, SSIS package execution logs are stored in SSISDB internal tables or views, so you can query, analyze, and visually present them using designated tools like SSMS. With Package Deployment Model, SSIS package execution logs can be stored in file system or Azure Files as CSV files that you still need to parse and process using other designated tools before you can query, analyze, and visually present them.

Now with [Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/data-platform.md) integration, you can query, analyze, and visually present all metrics and logs generated from SSIS IR operations and SSIS package executions on Azure portal. Additionally, you can also raise alerts on them.

## Configure diagnostic settings and workspace for SSIS operations

To send all metrics and logs generated from SSIS IR operations and SSIS package executions to Azure Monitor, you need to [configure diagnostics settings and workspace for your ADF](monitor-configure-diagnostics.md).

## SSIS operational metrics

SSIS operational [metrics](../azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics.md) are performance counters or numerical values that describe the status of SSIS IR start and stop operations, as well as SSIS package executions at a particular point in time. They're part of [ADF metrics in Azure Monitor](monitor-metrics-alerts.md).

When you configure diagnostic settings and workspace for your ADF on Azure Monitor, selecting the _AllMetrics_ check box will make SSIS operational metrics available for [interactive analysis using Azure metrics explorer](../azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics.md), [presentation on Azure dashboard](../azure-monitor/app/tutorial-app-dashboards.md), and [near-real time alerts](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-metric.md).

## SSIS operational alerts

To raise alerts on SSIS operational metrics from ADF portal, [select the **Alerts & metrics** page of ADF **Monitor** hub and follow the step-by-step instructions provided](./monitor-visually.md#alerts).

## SSIS operational logs

SSIS operational [logs](../azure-monitor/logs/data-platform-logs.md) are events generated by SSIS IR operations and SSIS package executions that provide enough context on any identified issues and are useful for root cause analysis. 

When you configure diagnostic settings and workspace for your ADF on Azure Monitor, you can select the relevant SSIS operational logs and send them to Log Analytics that's based on Azure Data Explorer. In there, they'll be made available for [analysis using rich query language](../azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview.md), [presentation on Azure dashboard](../azure-monitor/app/overview-dashboard.md#create-custom-kpi-dashboards-using-application-insights), and [near-real time alerts](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-log.md).

The schemas and content of SSIS package execution logs in Azure Monitor and Log Analytics are similar to the schemas of SSISDB internal tables or views.

| Azure Monitor log categories          | Log Analytics tables                     | SSISDB internal tables/views              |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `SSISIntegrationRuntimeLogs`          | `ADFSSISIntegrationRuntimeLogs`          |                                           |
| `SSISPackageEventMessageContext`      | `ADFSSISPackageEventMessageContext`      | `[internal].[event_message_context]`      |
| `SSISPackageEventMessages`            | `ADFSSISPackageEventMessages`            | `[internal].[event_messages]`             |
| `SSISPackageExecutableStatistics`     | `ADFSSISPackageExecutableStatistics`     | `[internal].[executable_statistics]`      |
| `SSISPackageExecutionComponentPhases` | `ADFSSISPackageExecutionComponentPhases` | `[internal].[execution_component_phases]` |
| `SSISPackageExecutionDataStatistics`  | `ADFSSISPackageExecutionDataStatistics`  | `[internal].[execution_data_statistics]`  |

For more info on SSIS operational log attributes/properties, see [Azure Monitor and Log Analytics schemas for ADF](monitor-schema-logs-events.md).

Your selected SSIS package execution logs are always sent to Log Analytics regardless of their invocation methods. For example, you can invoke package executions on Azure-enabled SSDT, via T-SQL on SSMS, SQL Server Agent, or other designated tools, and as triggered or debug runs of Execute SSIS Package activities in ADF pipelines.

When querying SSIS IR operation logs on Logs Analytics, you can use **OperationName** and **ResultType** properties that are set to `Start/Stop/Maintenance/Heartbeat` and `Started/InProgress/Succeeded/Failed/Healthy/Unhealthy`, respectively.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-factory-monitor-oms/log-analytics-query.png" alt-text="Querying SSIS IR operation logs on Log Analytics":::

To query SSIS IR node status, you can set the **OperationName** property to `Heartbeat`. Each node normally sends one `Heartbeat` record per minute to Log Analytics with the **ResultType** property reflecting its status, which is `Healthy` when it's available for package executions and `Unhealthy` when it isn't. For example, if your SSIS IR has two available nodes, you'll always see two `Heartbeat` records with the **ResultType** property set to `Healthy` within any one-minute period.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-factory-monitor-oms/log-analytics-query-3.png" alt-text="Querying SSIS IR heartbeats on Log Analytics":::

You can query the following patterns to detect the unavailability of your SSIS IR node(s):

* There are missing `Heartbeat` records in many one-minute periods when your SSIS IR is still running.
* There are `Heartbeat` records with the **ResultType** property set to `Unhealthy` in many one-minute periods when your SSIS IR is still running.

You can turn the above queries into [alerts](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log.md) and go to your [SSIS IR monitoring page](monitor-integration-runtime.md#monitor-the-azure-ssis-integration-runtime-in-azure-portal) to confirm when you receive those alerts.

When querying SSIS package execution logs on Logs Analytics, you can join them using **OperationId**/**ExecutionId**/**CorrelationId** properties. **OperationId**/**ExecutionId** are always set to `1` for all operations/executions related to packages **not** stored in SSISDB/invoked via T-SQL.
