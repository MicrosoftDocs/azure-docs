# Copy data from and to ODBC data stores using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from and to an ODBC data store. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This ODBC connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/sink)|&#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks, see the [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores) table.

Specifically, this ODBC connector supports copying data from/to **any ODBC-compatible data stores** using **Basic** or **Anonymous** authentication. A **64-bit ODBC driver** is required. For ODBC sink, the service support ODBC version 2.0 standard.

## Prerequisites

To use this ODBC connector, you need to:

- Set up a Self-hosted Integration Runtime. See [Self-hosted Integration Runtime](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md) article for details.
- Install the 64-bit ODBC driver for the data store on the Integration Runtime machine.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

## Create a linked service to an ODBC data store using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to an ODBC data store in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for ODBC and select the ODBC connector.

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to ODBC connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for ODBC linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Odbc** | Yes |
| connectionString | The connection string excluding the credential portion. You can specify the connection string with pattern like `Driver={SQL Server};Server=Server.database.windows.net; Database=TestDatabase;`, or use the system DSN (Data Source Name) you set up on the Integration Runtime machine with `DSN=<name of the DSN on IR machine>;` (you need still specify the credential portion in linked service accordingly).<br>You can also put a password in Azure Key Vault and pull the `password` configuration out of the connection string. Refer to [Store credentials in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md) with more details.| Yes |
| authenticationType | Type of authentication used to connect to the ODBC data store.<br/>Allowed values are: **Basic** and **Anonymous**. | Yes |
| userName | Specify user name if you are using Basic authentication. | No |
| password | Specify password for the user account you specified for the userName. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | No |
| credential | The access credential portion of the connection string specified in driver-specific property-value format. Example: `"RefreshToken=<secret refresh token>;"`. Mark this field as a SecureString. | No |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. A Self-hosted Integration Runtime is required as mentioned in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites). |Yes |

**Example 1: using Basic authentication**

```json
{
    "name": "ODBCLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Odbc",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "<connection string>",
            "authenticationType": "Basic",
            "userName": "<username>",
            "password": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<password>"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example 2: using Anonymous authentication**

```json
{
    "name": "ODBCLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Odbc",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "<connection string>",
            "authenticationType": "Anonymous",
            "credential": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "RefreshToken=<secret refresh token>;"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by ODBC dataset.

To copy data from/to ODBC-compatible data store, the following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **OdbcTable** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table in the ODBC data store. | No for source (if "query" in activity source is specified);<br/>Yes for sink |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "ODBCDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "OdbcTable",
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<ODBC linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "typeProperties": {
            "tableName": "<table name>"
        }
    }
}
```

If you were using `RelationalTable` typed dataset, it is still supported as-is, while you are suggested to use the new one going forward.

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by ODBC source.

### ODBC as source

To copy data from ODBC-compatible data store, the following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **OdbcSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromODBC",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<ODBC input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "OdbcSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM MyTable"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

If you were using `RelationalSource` typed source, it is still supported as-is, while you are suggested to use the new one going forward.

### ODBC as sink

To copy data to ODBC-compatible data store, set the sink type in the copy activity to **OdbcSink**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **sink** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity sink must be set to: **OdbcSink** | Yes |
| writeBatchTimeout |Wait time for the batch insert operation to complete before it times out.<br/>Allowed values are: timespan. Example: "00:30:00" (30 minutes). |No |
| writeBatchSize |Inserts data into the SQL table when the buffer size reaches writeBatchSize.<br/>Allowed values are: integer (number of rows). |No (default is 0 - auto detected) |
| preCopyScript |Specify a SQL query for Copy Activity to execute before writing data into data store in each run. You can use this property to clean up the pre-loaded data. |No |

> [!NOTE]
> For "writeBatchSize", if it's not set (auto-detected), copy activity first detects whether the driver supports batch operations, and set it to 10000 if it does, or set it to 1 if it doesn't. If you explicitly set the value other than 0, copy activity honors the value and fails at runtime if the driver doesn't support batch operations.

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyToODBC",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<ODBC output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "<source type>"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "OdbcSink",
                "writeBatchSize": 100000
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Lookup activity properties

To learn details about the properties, check [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md).

## Troubleshoot connectivity issues
