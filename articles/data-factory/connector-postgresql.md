This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from a PostgreSQL database. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This PostgreSQL connector is supported for the following activities:

- [Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) with [supported source/sink matrix](copy-activity-overview.md)
- [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)

You can copy data from PostgreSQL database to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Specifically, this PostgreSQL connector supports PostgreSQL **version 7.4 and above**.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-integration-runtime-requirements](../../includes/data-factory-v2-integration-runtime-requirements.md)]

The Integration Runtime provides a built-in PostgreSQL driver starting from version 3.7, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to PostgreSQL connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for PostgreSQL linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **PostgreSql** | Yes |
| connectionString | An ODBC connection string to connect to Azure Database for PostgreSQL. <br/>You can also put password in Azure Key Vault and pull the `password` configuration out of the connection string. Refer to the following samples and [Store credentials in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md) article with more details. | Yes |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. Learn more from [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. If not specified, it uses the default Azure Integration Runtime. |No |

A typical connection string is `Server=<server>;Database=<database>;Port=<port>;UID=<username>;Password=<Password>`. More properties you can set per your case:

| Property | Description | Options | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| EncryptionMethod (EM)| The method the driver uses to encrypt data sent between the driver and the database server. E.g.,  `EncryptionMethod=<0/1/6>;`| 0 (No Encryption) **(Default)** / 1 (SSL) / 6 (RequestSSL) | No |
| ValidateServerCertificate (VSC) | Determines whether the driver validates the certificate that is sent by the database server when SSL encryption is enabled (Encryption Method=1). E.g.,  `ValidateServerCertificate=<0/1>;`| 0 (Disabled) **(Default)** / 1 (Enabled) | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "PostgreSqlLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "PostgreSql",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "Server=<server>;Database=<database>;Port=<port>;UID=<username>;Password=<Password>"
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example: store password in Azure Key Vault**

```json
{
    "name": "PostgreSqlLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "PostgreSql",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "Server=<server>;Database=<database>;Port=<port>;UID=<username>;",
            "password": { 
                "type": "AzureKeyVaultSecret", 
                "store": { 
                    "referenceName": "<Azure Key Vault linked service name>", 
                    "type": "LinkedServiceReference" 
                }, 
                "secretName": "<secretName>" 
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

If you were using PostgreSQL linked service with the following payload, it is still supported as-is, while you are suggested to use the new one going forward.

**Previous payload:**

```json
{
    "name": "PostgreSqlLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "PostgreSql",
        "typeProperties": {
            "server": "<server>",
            "database": "<database>",
            "username": "<username>",
            "password": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<password>"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by PostgreSQL dataset.

To copy data from PostgreSQL, the following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **PostgreSqlTable** | Yes |
| schema | Name of the schema. |No (if "query" in activity source is specified)  |
| table | Name of the table. |No (if "query" in activity source is specified)  |
| tableName | Name of the table with schema. This property is supported for backward compatibility. Use `schema` and `table` for new workload. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "PostgreSQLDataset",
    "properties":
    {
        "type": "PostgreSqlTable",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<PostgreSQL linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

If you were using `RelationalTable` typed dataset, it's still supported as-is, while you are suggested to use the new one going forward.

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by PostgreSQL source.

### PostgreSQL as source

To copy data from PostgreSQL, the following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **PostgreSqlSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"query": "SELECT * FROM \"MySchema\".\"MyTable\""`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

> [!NOTE]
> Schema and table names are case-sensitive. Enclose them in `""` (double quotes) in the query.

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromPostgreSQL",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<PostgreSQL input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "PostgreSqlSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM \"MySchema\".\"MyTable\""
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

If you were using `RelationalSource` typed source, it is still supported as-is, while you are suggested to use the new one going forward.
