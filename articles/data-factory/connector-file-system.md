## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory and Synapse pipeline entities specific to file system.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for file system linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **FileServer**. | Yes |
| host | Specifies the root path of the folder that you want to copy. Use the escape character "\" for special characters in the string. See [Sample linked service and dataset definitions](#sample-linked-service-and-dataset-definitions) for examples. | Yes |
| userId | Specify the ID of the user who has access to the server. | Yes |
| password | Specify the password for the user (userId). Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. Learn more from [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. If not specified, it uses the default Azure Integration Runtime. |No |

### Sample linked service and dataset definitions

| Scenario | "host" in linked service definition | "folderPath" in dataset definition |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| Remote shared folder: <br/><br/>Examples: \\\\myserver\\share\\\* or \\\\myserver\\share\\folder\\subfolder\\* |In JSON: `\\\\myserver\\share`<br/>On UI: `\\myserver\share` |In JSON: `.\\` or `folder\\subfolder`<br/>On UI: `.\` or `folder\subfolder` |

>[!NOTE]
>When authoring via UI, you don't need to input double backslash (`\\`) to escape like you do via JSON, specify single backslash.

>[!NOTE]
>Copying files from local machine is not supported under Azure Integration Runtime.<br>
>Refer to the command line from [here](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md#set-up-an-existing-self-hosted-ir-via-local-powershell) to enable the access to the local machine under Self-hosted integration runtime. By default, it's disabled.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "FileLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "FileServer",
        "typeProperties": {
            "host": "<host>",
            "userId": "<domain>\\<user>",
            "password": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<password>"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [Datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. 

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-file-formats](includes/data-factory-v2-file-formats.md)] 

The following properties are supported for file system under `location` settings in format-based dataset:

| Property   | Description                                                  | Required |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| type       | The type property under `location` in dataset must be set to **FileServerLocation**. | Yes      |
| folderPath | The path to folder. If you want to use wildcard to filter folder, skip this setting and specify in activity source settings. You need to set up the file share location in your Windows or Linux environment to expose the folder for sharing. | No       |
| fileName   | The file name under the given folderPath. If you want to use wildcard to filter files, skip this setting and specify in activity source settings. | No       |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "DelimitedTextDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "DelimitedText",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<File system linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"

            "quoteChar": "\"",
            "firstRowAsHeader": true,
            "compressionCodec": "gzip"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by file system source and sink.

### File system as source

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-file-formats](includes/data-factory-v2-file-formats.md)] 

The following properties are supported for file system under `storeSettings` settings in format-based copy source:

| Property                 | Description                                                  | Required                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| type                     | The type property under `storeSettings` must be set to **FileServerReadSettings**. | Yes                                           |
| ***Locate the files to copy:*** |  |  |
| OPTION 1: static path<br> | Copy from the given folder/file path specified in the dataset. If you want to copy all files from a folder, additionally specify `wildcardFileName` as `*`. |  |
| OPTION 2: server side filter<br>- fileFilter  | File server side native filter, which provides better performance than OPTION 3 wildcard filter. Use `*` to match zero or more characters and `?` to match zero or single character. Learn more about the syntax and notes from the **Remarks** under [this section](/dotnet/api/system.io.directory.getfiles#system-io-directory-getfiles(system-string-system-string-system-io-searchoption)). | No                                                          |
| OPTION 3: client side filter<br>- wildcardFolderPath | The folder path with wildcard characters to filter source folders. Such filter happens within the service, which enumerates the folders/files under the given path then apply the wildcard filter.<br>Allowed wildcards are: `*` (matches zero or more characters) and `?` (matches zero or single character); use `^` to escape if your actual folder name has wildcard or this escape char inside. <br>See more examples in [Folder and file filter examples](#folder-and-file-filter-examples). | No                                            |
| OPTION 3: client side filter<br>- wildcardFileName | The file name with wildcard characters under the given folderPath/wildcardFolderPath to filter source files. Such filter happens within the service, which enumerates the files under the given path then apply the wildcard filter.<br>Allowed wildcards are: `*` (matches zero or more characters) and `?` (matches zero or single character); use `^` to escape if your actual file name has wildcard or this escape char inside.<br>See more examples in [Folder and file filter examples](#folder-and-file-filter-examples). | Yes |
| OPTION 3: a list of files<br>- fileListPath | Indicates to copy a given file set. Point to a text file that includes a list of files you want to copy, one file per line, which is the relative path to the path configured in the dataset.<br/>When using this option, don't specify file name in dataset. See more examples in [File list examples](#file-list-examples). |No |
| ***Additional settings:*** |  | |
| recursive | Indicates whether the data is read recursively from the subfolders or only from the specified folder. When recursive is set to true and the sink is a file-based store, an empty folder or subfolder isn't copied or created at the sink. <br>Allowed values are **true** (default) and **false**.<br>This property doesn't apply when you configure `fileListPath`. |No |
| deleteFilesAfterCompletion | Indicates whether the binary files will be deleted from source store after successfully moving to the destination store. The file deletion is per file, so when copy activity fails, you'll see some files have already been copied to the destination and deleted from source, while others are still remaining on source store. <br/>This property is only valid in binary files copy scenario. The default value: false. |No |
| modifiedDatetimeStart    | Files filter based on the attribute: Last Modified. <br>The files are selected if their last modified time is greater than or equal to `modifiedDatetimeStart` and less than `modifiedDatetimeEnd`. The time is applied to UTC time zone in the format of "2018-12-01T05:00:00Z". <br> The properties can be NULL, which means no file attribute filter is applied to the dataset.  When `modifiedDatetimeStart` has datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeEnd` is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is greater than or equal with the datetime value are selected.  When `modifiedDatetimeEnd` has datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeStart` is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is less than the datetime value are selected.<br/>This property doesn't apply when you configure `fileListPath`. | No                                            |
| modifiedDatetimeEnd      | Same as above.                                               | No                                            |
| enablePartitionDiscovery | For files that are partitioned, specify whether to parse the partitions from the file path and add them as extra source columns.<br/>Allowed values are **false** (default) and **true**. | No                                            |
| partitionRootPath | When partition discovery is enabled, specify the absolute root path in order to read partitioned folders as data columns.<br/><br/>If it isn't specified, by default,<br/>- When you use file path in dataset or list of files on source, partition root path is the path configured in dataset.<br/>- When you use wildcard folder filter, partition root path is the subpath before the first wildcard.<br/><br/>For example, assuming you configure the path in dataset as "root/folder/year=2020/month=08/day=27":<br/>- If you specify partition root path as "root/folder/year=2020", copy activity generates two more columns `month` and `day` with value "08" and "27" respectively, in addition to the columns inside the files.<br/>- If partition root path isn't specified, no extra column is generated. | No                                            |
| maxConcurrentConnections |The upper limit of concurrent connections established to the data store during the activity run. Specify a value only when you want to limit concurrent connections.| No                                            |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromFileSystem",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {

                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

### File system as sink

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-file-sink-formats](includes/data-factory-v2-file-sink-formats.md)]

The following properties are supported for file system under `storeSettings` settings in format-based copy sink:

| Property                 | Description                                                  | Required |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| type                     | The type property under `storeSettings` must be set to **FileServerWriteSettings**. | Yes      |
| copyBehavior             | Defines the copy behavior when the source is files from a file-based data store.<br/><br/>Allowed values are:<br/><b>- PreserveHierarchy (default)</b>: Preserves the file hierarchy in the target folder. The relative path of source file to source folder is identical to the relative path of target file to target folder.<br/><b>- FlattenHierarchy</b>: All files from the source folder are in the first level of the target folder. The target files have autogenerated names. <br/><b>- MergeFiles</b>: Merges all files from the source folder to one file. If the file name is specified, the merged file name is the specified name. Otherwise, it's an autogenerated file name. | No       |
| maxConcurrentConnections |The upper limit of concurrent connections established to the data store during the activity run. Specify a value only when you want to limit concurrent connections.| No       |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyToFileSystem",

## Legacy models

>[!NOTE]
>The following models are still supported as-is for backward compatibility. You are suggested to use the new model mentioned in above sections going forward, and the authoring UI has switched to generating the new model.

### Legacy dataset model

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **FileShare** |Yes |
| folderPath | Path to the folder. Wildcard filter is supported, allowed wildcards are: `*` (matches zero or more characters) and `?` (matches zero or single character); use `^` to escape if your actual folder name has wildcard or this escape char inside. <br/><br/>Examples: rootfolder/subfolder/, see more examples in [Sample linked service and dataset definitions](#sample-linked-service-and-dataset-definitions) and [Folder and file filter examples](#folder-and-file-filter-examples). |No |
| fileName | **Name or wildcard filter** for the files under the specified "folderPath". If you don't specify a value for this property, the dataset points to all files in the folder. <br/><br/>For filter, allowed wildcards are: `*` (matches zero or more characters) and `?` (matches zero or single character).<br/>- Example 1: `"fileName": "*.csv"`<br/>- Example 2: `"fileName": "???20180427.txt"`<br/>Use `^` to escape if your actual file name has wildcard or this escape char inside.<br/><br/>When fileName isn't specified for an output dataset and **preserveHierarchy** isn't specified in the activity sink, the copy activity automatically generates the file name with the following pattern: "*Data.[activity run ID GUID].[GUID if FlattenHierarchy].[format if configured].[compression if configured]*", for example "Data.0a405f8a-93ff-4c6f-b3be-f69616f1df7a.txt.gz"; if you copy from tabular source using table name instead of query, the name pattern is "*[table name].[format].[compression if configured]*", for example "MyTable.csv". |No |
| modifiedDatetimeStart | Files filter based on the attribute: Last Modified. The files are selected if their last modified time is greater than or equal to `modifiedDatetimeStart` and less than `modifiedDatetimeEnd`. The time is applied to UTC time zone in the format of "2018-12-01T05:00:00Z". <br/><br/> Be aware the overall performance of data movement are impacted by enabling this setting when you want to do file filter from huge amounts of files. <br/><br/> The properties can be NULL, which means no file attribute filter is applied to the dataset.  When `modifiedDatetimeStart` has datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeEnd` is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is greater than or equal with the datetime value are selected.  When `modifiedDatetimeEnd` has datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeStart` is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is less than the datetime value will be selected.| No |
| modifiedDatetimeEnd | Files filter based on the attribute: Last Modified. The files are selected if their last modified time is greater than or equal to `modifiedDatetimeStart` and less than `modifiedDatetimeEnd`. The time is applied to UTC time zone in the format of "2018-12-01T05:00:00Z". <br/><br/> Be aware the overall performance of data movement are impacted by enabling this setting when you want to do file filter from huge amounts of files. <br/><br/> The properties can be NULL, which means no file attribute filter is applied to the dataset.  When `modifiedDatetimeStart` has datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeEnd` is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is greater than or equal with the datetime value are selected.  When `modifiedDatetimeEnd` has datetime value but `modifiedDatetimeStart` is NULL, it means the files whose last modified attribute is less than the datetime value are selected.| No |
| format | If you want to **copy files as-is** between file-based stores (binary copy), skip the format section in both input and output dataset definitions.<br/><br/>If you want to parse or generate files with a specific format, the following file format types are supported: **TextFormat**, **JsonFormat**, **AvroFormat**, **OrcFormat**, **ParquetFormat**. Set the **type** property under format to one of these values. For more information, see [Text Format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#text-format), [Json Format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#json-format), [Avro Format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#avro-format), [Orc Format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#orc-format), and [Parquet Format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#parquet-format) sections. |No (only for binary copy scenario) |
| compression | Specify the type and level of compression for the data. For more information, see [Supported file formats and compression codecs](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs-legacy.md#compression-support).<br/>Supported types are: **GZip**, **Deflate**, **BZip2**, and **ZipDeflate**.<br/>Supported levels are: **Optimal** and **Fastest**. |No |

>[!TIP]
>To copy all files under a folder, specify **folderPath** only.<br>To copy a single file with a given name, specify **folderPath** with folder part and **fileName** with file name.<br>To copy a subset of files under a folder, specify **folderPath** with folder part and **fileName** with wildcard filter.

>[!NOTE]
>If you were using "fileFilter" property for file filter, it is still supported as-is, while you are suggested to use the new filter capability added to "fileName" going forward.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "FileSystemDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "FileShare",
        "linkedServiceName":{
            "referenceName": "<file system linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "typeProperties": {
            "folderPath": "folder/subfolder/",
            "fileName": "*",
            "modifiedDatetimeStart": "2018-12-01T05:00:00Z",
            "modifiedDatetimeEnd": "2018-12-01T06:00:00Z",
            "format": {
                "type": "TextFormat",
                "columnDelimiter": ",",
                "rowDelimiter": "\n"
            },
            "compression": {
                "type": "GZip",
                "level": "Optimal"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Legacy copy activity source model

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **FileSystemSource** |Yes |
| recursive | Indicates whether the data is read recursively from the subfolders or only from the specified folder. Note when recursive is set to true and sink is file-based store, empty folder/sub-folder won't be copied/created at sink.<br/>Allowed values are: **true** (default), **false** | No |
| maxConcurrentConnections |The upper limit of concurrent connections established to the data store during the activity run. Specify a value only when you want to limit concurrent connections.| No |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromFileSystem",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<file system input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "FileSystemSource",
                "recursive": true
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

### Legacy copy activity sink model

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity sink must be set to: **FileSystemSink** |Yes |
| copyBehavior | Defines the copy behavior when the source is files from file-based data store.<br/><br/>Allowed values are:<br/><b>- PreserveHierarchy (default)</b>: preserves the file hierarchy in the target folder. The relative path of source file to source folder is identical to the relative path of target file to target folder.<br/><b>- FlattenHierarchy</b>: all files from the source folder are in the first level of target folder. The target files have autogenerated name. <br/><b>- MergeFiles</b>: merges all files from the source folder to one file. No record deduplication is performed during the merge. If the File Name is specified, the merged file name would be the specified name; otherwise, would be autogenerated file name. | No |
| maxConcurrentConnections |The upper limit of concurrent connections established to the data store during the activity run. Specify a value only when you want to limit concurrent connections.| No |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyToFileSystem",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<file system output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "<source type>"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "FileSystemSink",
                "copyBehavior": "PreserveHierarchy"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
