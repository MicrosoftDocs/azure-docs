## How to use

Before using the Connector upgrade advisor, it is recommended to **save** or **discard all** pending changes.

1. To access the **Connector upgrade advisor**, navigate to the **Manage** pane in your data factory. Under the **General** section, locate and select **Connector upgrade advisor**.

2. Once you select the **Connector upgrade advisor**, it scans your data factory and identifies all existing pipelines using outdated connectors along with the number of dependencies on outdated versions.

3. In the **Connector upgrade advisor** home page, choose the pipelines you want to upgrade and click **Upgrade**.

4. If a selected pipeline references an outdated dataset shared with other unselected pipelines, a **Select upgrade methods** dialog appears listing all the pipelines sharing datasets.

    If you want to upgrade all pipelines using the same dataset simultaneously, choose **Include listed pipelines to upgrade together**. Otherwise, if you just want to upgrade the selected pipeline separately, select **Create new datasets for selected pipelines**. Click **OK** to confirm your selection.

5. The next window **Map outdated linked services to new linked services** list all outdated linked services. Select an equivalent V2 linked service from the dropdown menu or create a new one that supports the V2 format by clicking **New**. Once configured, click **Next**.

6. The **Update pipeline queries** page (if applicable) appears only if your selected pipelines use **Salesforce**, **Salesforce Service Cloud**, or **ServiceNow** connectors in the **Copy** activity with a query.

    Due to query format differences between V1 and V2: 

    - Salesforce queries are pre-populated as V1 (SQL) and V2 (SOQL) share common syntax. 

    - ServiceNow queries require manual adjustments, as the structure has changed. 

    Once modifications are complete, click **Next**.

7. Review and finalize changes using the **Review** page. It provides a summary of all modifications made by the advisor tool. Click **Open and review** to exit the wizard and navigate to the authoring page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/connector-upgrade-advisor/review-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the review page." lightbox="media/connector-upgrade-advisor/review-page.png":::

    Review all modified connectors, then **Save all** or **Publish all** the changes as needed.

    :::image type="content" source="media/connector-upgrade-advisor/save-publish.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the save or publish page." lightbox="media/connector-upgrade-advisor/save-publish.png":::

This process ensures a smooth transition from outdated connectors to the latest supported versions.
