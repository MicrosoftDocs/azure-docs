# Copy data from Amazon Redshift using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory and Synapse Analytics pipelines to copy data from an Amazon Redshift. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This Amazon Redshift connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources or sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Specifically, this Amazon Redshift connector supports retrieving data from Redshift using query or built-in Redshift UNLOAD support.

The connector supports the Windows versions in this [article](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md#prerequisites).

> [!TIP]
> To achieve the best performance when copying large amounts of data from Redshift, consider using the built-in Redshift UNLOAD through Amazon S3. See [Use UNLOAD to copy data from Amazon Redshift](#use-unload-to-copy-data-from-amazon-redshift) section for details.

## Prerequisites

* If you are copying data to an on-premises data store using [Self-hosted Integration Runtime](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md), grant Integration Runtime (use IP address of the machine) the access to Amazon Redshift cluster. See [Authorize access to the cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/rs-gsg-authorize-cluster-access.html) for instructions.
* If you are copying data to an Azure data store, see [Azure Data Center IP Ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653) for the Compute IP address and SQL ranges used by the Azure data centers.

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Amazon Redshift connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Amazon Redshift linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **AmazonRedshift** | Yes |
| server |IP address or host name of the Amazon Redshift server. |Yes |
| port |The number of the TCP port that the Amazon Redshift server uses to listen for client connections. |No, default is 5439 |
| database |Name of the Amazon Redshift database. |Yes |
| username |Name of user who has access to the database. |Yes |
| password |Password for the user account. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). |Yes |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. You can use Azure Integration Runtime or Self-hosted Integration Runtime (if your data store is located in private network). If not specified, it uses the default Azure Integration Runtime. |No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "AmazonRedshiftLinkedService",
    "properties":
    {
        "type": "AmazonRedshift",
        "typeProperties":
        {
            "server": "<server name>",
            "database": "<database name>",
            "username": "<username>",
            "password": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<password>"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Amazon Redshift dataset.

To copy data from Amazon Redshift, the following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **AmazonRedshiftTable** | Yes |
| schema | Name of the schema. |No (if "query" in activity source is specified)  |
| table | Name of the table. |No (if "query" in activity source is specified)  |
| tableName | Name of the table with schema. This property is supported for backward compatibility. Use `schema` and `table` for new workload. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "AmazonRedshiftDataset",
    "properties":
    {
        "type": "AmazonRedshiftTable",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Amazon Redshift linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

If you were using `RelationalTable` typed dataset, it is still supported as-is, while you are suggested to use the new one going forward.

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Amazon Redshift source.

### Amazon Redshift as source

To copy data from Amazon Redshift, set the source type in the copy activity to **AmazonRedshiftSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **AmazonRedshiftSource** | Yes |
| query |Use the custom query to read data. For example: select * from MyTable. |No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |
| redshiftUnloadSettings | Property group when using Amazon Redshift UNLOAD. | No |
| s3LinkedServiceName | Refers to an Amazon S3 to-be-used as an interim store by specifying a linked service name of "AmazonS3" type. | Yes if using UNLOAD |
| bucketName | Indicate the S3 bucket to store the interim data. If not provided, the service generates it automatically.  | Yes if using UNLOAD |

**Example: Amazon Redshift source in copy activity using UNLOAD**

```json
"source": {
    "type": "AmazonRedshiftSource",
    "query": "<SQL query>",
    "redshiftUnloadSettings": {
        "s3LinkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Amazon S3 linked service>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "bucketName": "bucketForUnload"
    }
}
```

Learn more on how to use UNLOAD to copy data from Amazon Redshift efficiently from next section.

## Use UNLOAD to copy data from Amazon Redshift

[UNLOAD](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_UNLOAD.html) is a mechanism provided by Amazon Redshift, which can unload the results of a query to one or more files on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). It is the way recommended by Amazon for copying large data set from Redshift.

**Example: copy data from Amazon Redshift to Azure Synapse Analytics using UNLOAD, staged copy and PolyBase**

For this sample use case, copy activity unloads data from Amazon Redshift to Amazon S3 as configured in "redshiftUnloadSettings", and then copy data from Amazon S3 to Azure Blob as specified in "stagingSettings", lastly use PolyBase to load data into Azure Synapse Analytics. All the interim format is handled by copy activity properly.
