# Change data capture resource overview
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-xxx-md](includes/appliesto-adf-xxx-md.md)]

Adapting to the cloud-first big data world can be incredibly challenging for data engineers who are responsible for building complex data integration and ETL pipelines. 

Azure Data Factory is introducing a new mechanism to make the life of a data engineer easier. 

By automatically detecting data changes at the source without requiring complex designing or coding, ADF is making it a breeze to scale these processes. Change Data Capture will now exist as a **new native top-level resource** in the Azure Data Factory studio where data engineers can quickly configure continuously running jobs to process big data at scale with extreme efficiency. 

The new Change Data Capture resource in ADF allows for full fidelity change data capture that continuously runs in near real-time through a guided configuration experience.

For more information on known limitations and troubleshooting assistance, please reference [this troubleshooting guide](change-data-capture-troubleshoot.md).

## Azure Synapse Analytics as Target
When using Azure Synapse Analytics as target, the **Staging Settings** is available on the main table canvas. Enabling staging is mandatory when selecting Azure Synapse Analytics as the target. This significantly enhances write performance by utilizing performant bulk loading capability such as COPY INTO command. **Staging Settings** can be configured in two ways: utilizing **Factory settings** or opting for a **Custom settings**. **Factory settings** apply at the factory level. For the first time, if these settings aren't configured, you'll be directed to the global staging setting section for configuration. Once set, all CDC top-level resources will adopt this configuration. **Custom settings** is scoped only for the CDC resource for which it is configured and overrides the **Factory settings**.

> [!NOTE]
> As we utilize the COPY INTO command to transfer data from the staging location to Azure Synapse Analytics, it is advisable to ensure that all required permissions are pre-configured within Azure Synapse Analytics.


> [!NOTE]
> We always use the last published configuration when starting a CDC. For running CDCs, while your data is being processed, you will be billed 4 v-cores of General Purpose Data Flows.
