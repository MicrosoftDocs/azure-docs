# Copy and transform data from Hive using Azure Data Factory 
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from Hive. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This Hive connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Mapping data flow](concepts-data-flow-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; |
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

The connector supports the Windows versions in this [article](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md#prerequisites).

## Create a linked service to Hive using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to Hive in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Create a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Create a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for Hive and select the Hive connector.

    :::image type="content" source="media/connector-hive/hive-connector.png" alt-text="Select the Hive connector.":::    

1. Configure the service details, test the connection, and create the new linked service.

## Connector configuration details



The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Hive connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Hive linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |

        "typeProperties": {
            "host" : "<cluster>.azurehdinsight.net",
            "port" : "<port>",
            "authenticationType" : "WindowsAzureHDInsightService",

                "value": "<password>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Hive dataset.

To copy data from Hive, set the type property of the dataset to **HiveObject**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **HiveObject** | Yes |
| schema | Name of the schema. |No (if "query" in activity source is specified)  |
| table | Name of the table. |No (if "query" in activity source is specified)  |
| tableName | Name of the table including schema part. This property is supported for backward compatibility. For new workload, use `schema` and `table`. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "HiveDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "HiveObject",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Hive linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Hive source.

### HiveSource as source

To copy data from Hive, set the source type in the copy activity to **HiveSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **HiveSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromHive",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Hive input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "HiveSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM MyTable"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Mapping data flow properties

The hive connector is supported as an [inline dataset](data-flow-source.md#inline-datasets) source in mapping data flows. Read using a query or directly from a Hive table in HDInsight. Hive data gets staged in a storage account as parquet files before getting transformed as part of a data flow. 

### Source properties

The below table lists the properties supported by a hive source. You can edit these properties in the **Source options** tab.

| Name | Description | Required | Allowed values | Data flow script property |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Store | Store must be `hive` | yes |  `hive` | store | 
| Format | Whether you are reading from a table or query | yes | `table` or `query` | format |
| Schema name | If reading from a table, the schema of the source table |  yes, if format is `table` | String | schemaName |
| Table name | If reading from a table, the table name |   yes, if format is `table` | String | tableName |
| Query | If format is `query`, the source query on the Hive linked service | yes, if format is `query` | String | query |
| Staged | Hive table will always be staged. | yes | `true` | staged |
| Storage Container | Storage container used to stage data before reading from Hive or writing to Hive. The hive cluster must have access to this container. | yes | String | storageContainer |
| Staging database | The schema/database where the user account specified in the linked service has access to. It is used to create external tables during staging and dropped afterwards | no | `true` or `false` | stagingDatabaseName |
| Pre SQL Scripts | SQL code to run on the Hive table before reading the data | no | String | preSQLs |

#### Source example

Below is an example of a Hive source configuration:

:::image type="content" source="media/data-flow/hive-source.png" alt-text="Hive source example":::

These settings translate into the following data flow script:

```
source(
    allowSchemaDrift: true,
    validateSchema: false,
    ignoreNoFilesFound: false,
    format: 'table',
    store: 'hive',
    schemaName: 'default',
    tableName: 'hivesampletable',
    staged: true,
    storageContainer: 'khive',
    storageFolderPath: '',
    stagingDatabaseName: 'default') ~> hivesource
```
### Known limitations

* Complex types such as arrays, maps, structs, and unions are not supported for read. 
* Hive connector only supports Hive tables in Azure HDInsight of version 4.0 or greater (Apache Hive 3.1.0)
* By default, Hive driver provides "tableName.columnName" in sink. If you do not wish to see the table name in the column name, then there are two ways to fix this.
  a. Check the setting "hive.resultset.use.unique.column.names" in Hive server side and set it to false.
  b. Use column mapping to rename the column name.

## Lookup activity properties

To learn details about the properties, check [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md).
