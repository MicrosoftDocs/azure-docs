# Troubleshoot the file system connector in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article provides suggestions to troubleshoot common problems with the file system connector in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse.

## Error code: AccessToOnPremFileSystemDenied

- **Message**: `Access to '%path;' is not allowed.`

- **Cause**: Copying files from local machine is not supported under Azure Integration Runtime. For Self-hosted Integration Runtime (versions >= 5.22.8297.1) , Azure Data Factory is introducing a new security control to allow or disallow local SHIR file system access through the connector.  By default, it's disabled.

- **Recommendation**: Using command line from [Set up an existing self-hosted IR via local PowerShell](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md#set-up-an-existing-self-hosted-ir-via-local-powershell) , you could allow or disallow local SHIR file system access.
