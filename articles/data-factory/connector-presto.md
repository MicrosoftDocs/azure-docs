# Copy data from Presto using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from Presto. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Presto connector version 2.0 provides improved native Presto support. If you are using Presto connector version 1.0 in your solution, please [upgrade the Presto connector](#upgrade-the-presto-connector) before **August 31, 2025**. Refer to this [section](#differences-between-presto-connector-version-20-and-version-10) for details on the difference between version 2.0 and version 1.0.

## Supported capabilities

This Presto connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

## Create a linked service to Presto using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to Presto in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for Presto and select the Presto connector.

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Presto dataset.

To copy data from Presto, set the type property of the dataset to **PrestoObject**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **PrestoObject** | Yes |
| schema | Name of the schema. |No (if "query" in activity source is specified)  |
| table | Name of the table. |No (if "query" in activity source is specified)  |
| tableName | Name of the table with schema. This property is supported for backward compatibility. Use `schema` and `table` for new workload. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "PrestoDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "PrestoObject",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Presto linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Presto source.

### Presto as source

To copy data from Presto, set the source type in the copy activity to **PrestoSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **PrestoSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

        "name": "CopyFromPresto",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {

## Data type mapping for Presto

When you copy data from Presto, the following mappings apply from Presto's data types to the internal data types used by the service. To learn about how the copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink, see [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md).

| DECIMAL (Precision >= 28) | Decimal | String |
| DOUBLE | Double | Double |
| INTEGER | Int32 | Int32 |
| INTERVAL_DAY_TO_SECOND | TimeSpan | Not supported. |
| INTERVAL_YEAR_TO_MONTH | String | Not supported. |

## Upgrade the Presto connector

Here are steps that help you upgrade the Presto connector:

1. In **Edit linked service** page, select version 2.0 and configure the linked service by referring to [linked service version 2.0 properties](#version-20).

2. The data type mapping for the Presto linked service version 2.0 is different from that for the version 1.0. To learn the latest data type mapping, see [Data type mapping for Presto](#data-type-mapping-for-presto).

## Differences between Presto connector version 2.0 and version 1.0

The Presto connector version 2.0 offers new functionalities and is compatible with most features of version 1.0. The following table shows the feature differences between version 2.0 and version 1.0.

| The default value of `port` is 8443. | The default value of `port` is 8080. |
| The default value of `enableSSL` is true.<br><br> `enableServerCertificateValidation` is supported. <br><br>`trustedCertPath`, `useSystemTrustStore`, `allowHostNameCNMismatch` and `allowSelfSignedServerCert` are not supported.| The default value of `enableSSL` is false.<br><br>`enableServerCertificateValidation` is not supported. <br><br> `trustedCertPath`, `useSystemTrustStore`, `allowHostNameCNMismatch` and `allowSelfSignedServerCert` is supported. |
| The default value of `timeZoneID` is the Presto system time zone. | The default value of `timeZoneID` is the Azure Data Factory time zone. |
| The following mappings are used from Presto data types to interim service data type.<br><br>DATE -> Date <br>DECIMAL (Precision >= 28) -> Decimal <br>INTERVAL_DAY_TO_SECOND -> TimeSpan <br>INTERVAL_YEAR_TO_MONTH -> String<br>IPADDRESS -> String<br>TIME -> Time<br>TIMESTAMPWITHTIMEZONE -> Datetimeoffset<br>TINYINT -> SByte<br>UUID -> Guid| The following mappings are used from Presto data types to interim service data type.<br><br>DATE -> Datetime <br>DECIMAL (Precision >= 28) -> String <br>TIME -> TimeSpan<br>TINYINT -> Int16<br> Other mappings supported by version 2.0 listed left are not supported by version 1.0. |
