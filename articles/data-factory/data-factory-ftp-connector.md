# Move data from an FTP server using Azure Data Factory
This article explains how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to move data from an FTP server. It builds on the [Data Movement Activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article, which presents a general overview of data movement with the copy activity.

You can copy data from an FTP server to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores supported as sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table. Data factory currently supports only moving data from an FTP server to other data stores, but not for moving data from other data stores to an FTP server. It supports both on-premises and cloud FTP servers.

## Enabling connectivity
If you are moving data from an **on-premises** FTP server to a cloud data store (example: Azure Blob Storage), install and use Data Management Gateway. The Data Management Gateway is a client agent that is installed on your on-premises machine, which allows cloud services to connect to on-premises resource. See [Data Management Gateway](data-factory-data-management-gateway.md) for details on the gateway. See [moving data between on-premises locations and cloud](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md) article for step-by-step instructions on setting up the gateway and using it. You use the gateway to connect to an FTP server even if the server is on an Azure IaaS virtual machine (VM).

You can install the gateway on the same on-premises machine or the Azure IaaS VM as the FTP server. However, we recommend that you install the gateway on a separate machine or a separate Azure IaaS VM to avoid resource contention and for better performance. When you install the gateway on a separate machine, the machine should be able to access the FTP server.

## Getting started
You can create a pipeline with a copy activity that moves data from an FTP source by using different tools/APIs.

The easiest way to create a pipeline is to use the **Copy Wizard**. See [Tutorial: Create a pipeline using Copy Wizard](data-factory-copy-data-wizard-tutorial.md) for a quick walkthrough on creating a pipeline using the Copy data wizard.

You can also use the following tools to create a pipeline: **Azure portal**, **Visual Studio**, **Azure PowerShell**, **Azure Resource Manager template**, **.NET API**, and **REST API**. See [Copy activity tutorial](data-factory-copy-data-from-azure-blob-storage-to-sql-database.md) for step-by-step instructions to create a pipeline with a copy activity.

Whether you use the tools or APIs, you perform the following steps to create a pipeline that moves data from a source data store to a sink data store:

1. Create **linked services** to link input and output data stores to your data factory.
2. Create **datasets** to represent input and output data for the copy operation.
3. Create a **pipeline** with a copy activity that takes a dataset as an input and a dataset as an output.

When you use the wizard, JSON definitions for these Data Factory entities (linked services, datasets, and the pipeline) are automatically created for you. When you use tools/APIs (except .NET API), you define these Data Factory entities by using the JSON format.  For a sample with JSON definitions for Data Factory entities that are used to copy data from an FTP data store, see [JSON example: Copy data from FTP server to Azure blob](#json-example-copy-data-from-ftp-server-to-azure-blob) section of this article.

The following sections provide details about JSON properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to FTP:

## Linked service properties
The following table provides description for JSON elements specific to FTP linked service.

| Property | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| type |The type property must be set to FtpServer |Yes |&nbsp; |
| host |Name or IP address of the FTP Server |Yes |&nbsp; |
| authenticationType |Specify authentication type |Yes |Basic, Anonymous |
| username |User who has access to the FTP server |No |&nbsp; |
| password |Password for the user (username) |No |&nbsp; |
| encryptedCredential |Encrypted credential to access the FTP server |No |&nbsp; |
| gatewayName |Name of the Data Management Gateway gateway to connect to an on-premises FTP server |No |&nbsp; |
| port |Port on which the FTP server is listening |No |21 |
| enableSsl |Specify whether to use FTP over SSL/TLS channel |No |true |
| enableServerCertificateValidation |Specify whether to enable server SSL certificate validation when using FTP over SSL/TLS channel |No |true |

### Using Anonymous authentication

```JSON
{
    "name": "FTPLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "FtpServer",
        "typeProperties": {        
            "authenticationType": "Anonymous",
              "host": "myftpserver.com"
        }
    }
}
```

### Using username and password in plain text for basic authentication

```JSON
{
    "name": "FTPLinkedService",
      "properties": {
    "type": "FtpServer",
        "typeProperties": {
            "host": "myftpserver.com",
            "authenticationType": "Basic",
            "username": "Admin",
            "password": "123456"
        }
      }
}
```

### Using port, enableSsl, enableServerCertificateValidation

```JSON
{
    "name": "FTPLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "FtpServer",
        "typeProperties": {
            "host": "myftpserver.com",
            "authenticationType": "Basic",    
            "username": "Admin",
            "password": "123456",
            "port": "21",
            "enableSsl": true,
            "enableServerCertificateValidation": true
        }
    }
}
```

### Using encryptedCredential for authentication and gateway

```JSON
{
    "name": "FTPLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "FtpServer",
        "typeProperties": {
            "host": "myftpserver.com",
            "authenticationType": "Basic",
            "encryptedCredential": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "gatewayName": "mygateway"
        }
      }
}
```

## Dataset properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining datasets, see the [Creating datasets](data-factory-create-datasets.md) article. Sections such as structure, availability, and policy of a dataset JSON are similar for all dataset types.

The **typeProperties** section is different for each type of dataset. It provides information that is specific to the dataset type. The typeProperties section for a dataset of type **FileShare** dataset has the following properties:

| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| folderPath |Sub path to the folder. Use escape character ‘ \ ’ for special characters in the string. See [Sample linked service and dataset definitions](#sample-linked-service-and-dataset-definitions) for examples.<br/><br/>You can combine this property with **partitionBy** to have folder paths based on slice start/end date-times. |Yes |
| fileName |Specify the name of the file in the **folderPath** if you want the table to refer to a specific file in the folder. If you do not specify any value for this property, the table points to all files in the folder.<br/><br/>When fileName is not specified for an output dataset, the name of the generated file would be in the following this format: <br/><br/>Data.<Guid>.txt (Example: Data.0a405f8a-93ff-4c6f-b3be-f69616f1df7a.txt |No |
| fileFilter |Specify a filter to be used to select a subset of files in the folderPath rather than all files.<br/><br/>Allowed values are: `*` (multiple characters) and `?` (single character).<br/><br/>Examples 1: `"fileFilter": "*.log"`<br/>Example 2: `"fileFilter": 2014-1-?.txt"`<br/><br/> fileFilter is applicable for an input FileShare dataset. This property is not supported with HDFS. |No |
| partitionedBy |partitionedBy can be used to specify a dynamic folderPath, filename for time series data. For example, folderPath parameterized for every hour of data. |No |
| format | The following format types are supported: **TextFormat**, **JsonFormat**, **AvroFormat**, **OrcFormat**, **ParquetFormat**. Set the **type** property under format to one of these values. For more information, see [Text Format](data-factory-supported-file-and-compression-formats.md#text-format), [Json Format](data-factory-supported-file-and-compression-formats.md#json-format), [Avro Format](data-factory-supported-file-and-compression-formats.md#avro-format), [Orc Format](data-factory-supported-file-and-compression-formats.md#orc-format), and [Parquet Format](data-factory-supported-file-and-compression-formats.md#parquet-format) sections. <br><br> If you want to **copy files as-is** between file-based stores (binary copy), skip the format section in both input and output dataset definitions. |No |
| compression | Specify the type and level of compression for the data. Supported types are: **GZip**, **Deflate**, **BZip2**, and **ZipDeflate**; and supported levels are: **Optimal** and **Fastest**. For more information, see [File and compression formats in Azure Data Factory](data-factory-supported-file-and-compression-formats.md#compression-support). |No |
| useBinaryTransfer |Specify whether use Binary transfer mode. True for binary mode and false ASCII. Default value: True. This property can only be used when associated linked service type is of type: FtpServer. |No |

> [!NOTE]
> filename and fileFilter cannot be used simultaneously.

### Using partionedBy property
As mentioned in the previous section, you can specify a dynamic folderPath and filename for time series data with the **partitionedBy** property, [Data Factory functions, and the system variables](data-factory-functions-variables.md).

To learn about time series datasets, scheduling, and slices, See [Creating Datasets](data-factory-create-datasets.md), [Scheduling & Execution](data-factory-scheduling-and-execution.md), and [Creating Pipelines](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) articles.

#### Sample 1:

```json
"folderPath": "wikidatagateway/wikisampledataout/{Slice}",
"partitionedBy":
[
    { "name": "Slice", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "yyyyMMddHH" } },
],
```
In this example {Slice} is replaced with the value of Data Factory system variable SliceStart in the format (YYYYMMDDHH) specified. The SliceStart refers to start time of the slice. The folderPath is different for each slice. Example: wikidatagateway/wikisampledataout/2014100103 or wikidatagateway/wikisampledataout/2014100104.

#### Sample 2:

```json
"folderPath": "wikidatagateway/wikisampledataout/{Year}/{Month}/{Day}",
"fileName": "{Hour}.csv",
"partitionedBy":
 [
    { "name": "Year", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "yyyy" } },
    { "name": "Month", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "MM" } },
    { "name": "Day", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "dd" } },
    { "name": "Hour", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "hh" } }
],
```
In this example, year, month, day, and time of SliceStart are extracted into separate variables that are used by folderPath and fileName properties.

## Copy activity properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining activities, see the [Creating Pipelines](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) article. Properties such as name, description, input and output tables, and policies are available for all types of activities.

Properties available in the typeProperties section of the activity on the other hand vary with each activity type. For Copy activity, the type properties vary depending on the types of sources and sinks.

In Copy Activity, when source is of type **FileSystemSource**, the following properties are available in typeProperties section:

| Property | Description | Allowed values | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| recursive |Indicates whether the data is read recursively from the sub folders or only from the specified folder. |True, False (default) |No |

## Supported file and compression formats
See [File and compression formats in Azure Data Factory](data-factory-supported-file-and-compression-formats.md) article on details.

## JSON example: Copy data from FTP server to Azure blob
This sample shows how to copy data from an FTP server to an Azure Blob Storage. However, data can be copied **directly** to any of the sinks stated [here](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) using the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory.  

The following examples provide sample JSON definitions that you can use to create a pipeline by using [Azure portal](data-factory-copy-activity-tutorial-using-azure-portal.md) or [Visual Studio](data-factory-copy-activity-tutorial-using-visual-studio.md) or [Azure PowerShell](data-factory-copy-activity-tutorial-using-powershell.md).

* A linked service of type [FtpServer](#linked-service-properties).
* A linked service of type [AzureStorage](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#linked-service-properties).
* An input [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [FileShare](#dataset-properties).
* An output [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureBlob](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#dataset-properties).
* A [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) with Copy Activity that uses [FileSystemSource](#copy-activity-properties) and [BlobSink](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#copy-activity-properties).

The sample copies data from an FTP server to an Azure blob every hour. The JSON properties used in these samples are described in sections following the samples.

**FTP linked service:**
This example uses the basic authentication with user name and password in plain text. You can also use one of the following ways:

* Anonymous authentication
* Basic authentication with encrypted credentials
* FTP over SSL/TLS (FTPS)

See [FTP linked service](#linked-service-properties) section for different types of authentication you can use.

```JSON
{
    "name": "FTPLinkedService",
    "properties": {
    "type": "FtpServer",
    "typeProperties": {
        "host": "myftpserver.com",           
        "authenticationType": "Basic",
        "username": "Admin",
        "password": "123456"
    }
  }
}
```
**Azure Storage linked service:**

```JSON
{
  "name": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
  "properties": {
    "type": "AzureStorage",
    "typeProperties": {
      "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
    }
  }
}
```
**FTP input dataset:**
This dataset refers to the FTP folder `mysharedfolder` and file `test.csv`. The pipeline copies the file to the destination.

Setting "external": "true" informs the Data Factory service that the dataset is external to the data factory and is not produced by an activity in the data factory.

```JSON
{
  "name": "FTPFileInput",
  "properties": {
    "type": "FileShare",
    "linkedServiceName": "FTPLinkedService",
    "typeProperties": {
      "folderPath": "mysharedfolder",
      "fileName": "test.csv",
      "useBinaryTransfer": true
    },
    "external": true,
    "availability": {
      "frequency": "Hour",
      "interval": 1
    }
  }
}
```

**Azure Blob output dataset**

Data is written to a new blob every hour (frequency: hour, interval: 1). The folder path for the blob is dynamically evaluated based on the start time of the slice that is being processed. The folder path uses year, month, day, and hours parts of the start time.

```JSON
{
    "name": "AzureBlobOutput",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzureBlob",
        "linkedServiceName": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
        "typeProperties": {
            "folderPath": "mycontainer/ftp/yearno={Year}/monthno={Month}/dayno={Day}/hourno={Hour}",
            "format": {
                "type": "TextFormat",
                "rowDelimiter": "\n",
                "columnDelimiter": "\t"
            },
            "partitionedBy": [
                {
                    "name": "Year",
                    "value": {
                        "type": "DateTime",
                        "date": "SliceStart",
                        "format": "yyyy"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "name": "Month",
                    "value": {
                        "type": "DateTime",
                        "date": "SliceStart",
                        "format": "MM"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "name": "Day",
                    "value": {
                        "type": "DateTime",
                        "date": "SliceStart",
                        "format": "dd"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "name": "Hour",
                    "value": {
                        "type": "DateTime",
                        "date": "SliceStart",
                        "format": "HH"
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        "availability": {
            "frequency": "Hour",
            "interval": 1
        }
    }
}
```


**A copy activity in a pipeline with File System source and Blob sink:**

The pipeline contains a Copy Activity that is configured to use the input and output datasets and is scheduled to run every hour. In the pipeline JSON definition, the **source** type is set to **FileSystemSource** and **sink** type is set to **BlobSink**.

```JSON
{
    "name": "pipeline",
    "properties": {
        "activities": [{
            "name": "FTPToBlobCopy",
            "inputs": [{
                "name": "FtpFileInput"
            }],
            "outputs": [{
                "name": "AzureBlobOutput"
            }],
            "type": "Copy",
            "typeProperties": {
                "source": {
                    "type": "FileSystemSource"
                },
                "sink": {
                    "type": "BlobSink"
                }
            },
            "scheduler": {
                "frequency": "Hour",
                "interval": 1
            },
            "policy": {
                "concurrency": 1,
                "executionPriorityOrder": "NewestFirst",
                "retry": 1,
                "timeout": "00:05:00"
            }
        }],
        "start": "2016-08-24T18:00:00Z",
        "end": "2016-08-24T19:00:00Z"
    }
}
