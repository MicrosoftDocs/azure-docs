# Copy data from or to MongoDB using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory Synapse Analytics pipelines to copy data from and to a MongoDB database. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The new MongoDB connector provides improved native MongoDB support. If you are using the legacy MongoDB connector in your solution, supported as-is for backward compatibility only, refer to [MongoDB connector (legacy)](connector-mongodb-legacy.md) article.


## Supported capabilities

This MongoDB connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/sink)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks, see the [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores) table.

Specifically, this MongoDB connector supports **versions up to 4.2**. If your work requires versions newer than 4.2, consider using MongoDB Atlas with the [MongoDB Atlas connector](connector-mongodb-atlas.md), which provides more comprehensive support and features.

            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```


## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by MongoDB source and sink.

### MongoDB as source

The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **MongoDbV2Source** | Yes |
| filter | Specifies selection filter using query operators. To return all documents in a collection, omit this parameter or pass an empty document ({}). | No |
| cursorMethods.project | Specifies the fields to return in the documents for projection. To return all fields in the matching documents, omit this parameter. | No |
| cursorMethods.sort | Specifies the order in which the query returns matching documents. Refer to [cursor.sort()](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.sort/#cursor.sort). | No |
| cursorMethods.limit |	Specifies the maximum number of documents the server returns. Refer to [cursor.limit()](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.limit/#cursor.limit).  | No |
| cursorMethods.skip | Specifies the number of documents to skip and from where MongoDB begins to return results. Refer to [cursor.skip()](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.skip/#cursor.skip). | No |
| batchSize | Specifies the number of documents to return in each batch of the response from MongoDB instance. In most cases, modifying the batch size will not affect the user or the application. Azure Cosmos DB limits each batch cannot exceed 40 MB in size, which is the sum of the batchSize number of documents' size, so decrease this value if your document size being large. | No<br/>(the default is **100**) |

>[!TIP]
>The service supports consuming BSON document in **Strict mode**. Make sure your filter query is in Strict mode instead of Shell mode. More description can be found at [MongoDB manual](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongodb-extended-json/index.html).

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromMongoDB",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<MongoDB input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "MongoDbV2Source",
                "filter": "{datetimeData: {$gte: ISODate(\"2018-12-11T00:00:00.000Z\"),$lt: ISODate(\"2018-12-12T00:00:00.000Z\")}, _id: ObjectId(\"5acd7c3d0000000000000000\") }",
                "cursorMethods": {
                    "project": "{ _id : 1, name : 1, age: 1, datetimeData: 1 }",
                    "sort": "{ age : 1 }",
                    "skip": 3,
                    "limit": 3
                }
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

### MongoDB as sink

The following properties are supported in the Copy Activity **sink** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The **type** property of the Copy Activity sink must be set to **MongoDbV2Sink**. |Yes |
| writeBehavior |Describes how to write data to MongoDB. Allowed values: **insert** and **upsert**.<br/><br/>The behavior of **upsert** is to replace the document if a document with the same `_id` already exists; otherwise, insert the document.<br /><br />**Note**: The service automatically generates an `_id` for a document if an `_id` isn't specified either in the original document or by column mapping. This means that you must ensure that, for **upsert** to work as expected, your document has an ID. |No<br />(the default is **insert**) |
| writeBatchSize | The **writeBatchSize** property controls the size of documents to write in each batch. You can try increasing the value for **writeBatchSize** to improve performance and decreasing the value if your document size being large. |No<br />(the default is **10,000**) |
| writeBatchTimeout | The wait time for the batch insert operation to finish before it times out. The allowed value is timespan. | No<br/>(the default is **00:30:00** - 30 minutes) |

>[!TIP]
>To import JSON documents as-is, refer to [Import or export JSON documents](#import-and-export-json-documents) section; to copy from tabular-shaped data, refer to [Schema mapping](#schema-mapping).

**Example**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyToMongoDB",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Document DB output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "<source type>"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "MongoDbV2Sink",
                "writeBehavior": "upsert"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Import and export JSON documents

You can use this MongoDB connector to easily:

* Copy documents between two MongoDB collections as-is.
* Import JSON documents from various sources to MongoDB, including from Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Blob storage, Azure Data Lake Store, and other supported file-based stores.
* Export JSON documents from a MongoDB collection to various file-based stores.

To achieve such schema-agnostic copy, skip the "structure" (also called *schema*) section in dataset and schema mapping in copy activity.


## Schema mapping

To copy data from MongoDB to tabular sink or reversed, refer to [schema mapping](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md#schema-mapping).

## Upgrade the MongoDB linked service

Here are steps that help you upgrade your linked service and related queries:

1. Create a new MongoDB linked service and configure it by referring to [Linked service properties](#linked-service-properties).
1. If you use SQL queries in your pipelines that refer to the old MongoDB linked service, replace them with the equivalent MongoDB queries. See the following table for the replacement examples:

    | SQL query | Equivalent MongoDB query | 
    |:--- |:--- |
    | `SELECT * FROM users` | `db.users.find({})` |
    | `SELECT username, age FROM users` |`db.users.find({}, {username: 1, age: 1})` |
    | `SELECT username AS User, age AS Age, statusNumber AS Status, CASE WHEN Status = 0 THEN "Pending" CASE WHEN Status = 1 THEN "Finished" ELSE "Unknown" END AS statusEnum LastUpdatedTime + interval '2' hour AS NewLastUpdatedTime FROM users` | `db.users.aggregate([{ $project: { _id: 0, User: "$username", Age: "$age", Status: "$statusNumber", statusEnum: { $switch: { branches: [ { case: { $eq: ["$Status", 0] }, then: "Pending" }, { case: { $eq: ["$Status", 1] }, then: "Finished" } ], default: "Unknown" } }, NewLastUpdatedTime: { $add: ["$LastUpdatedTime", 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000] } } }])`|
    | `SELECT employees.name, departments.name AS department_name FROM employees LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;`|`db.employees.aggregate([ { $lookup: { from: "departments", localField: "department_id", foreignField: "_id", as: "department" } }, { $unwind: "$department" }, { $project: { _id: 0, name: 1, department_name: "$department.name" } } ])` |
