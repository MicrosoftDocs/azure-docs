# Copy data from Azure Blob storage to a SQL Database by using the Copy Data tool

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

In this tutorial, you use the Azure portal to create a data factory. Then you use the Copy Data tool to create a pipeline that copies data from Azure Blob storage to a SQL Database.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're new to Azure Data Factory, see [Introduction to Azure Data Factory](introduction.md).

In this tutorial, you perform the following steps:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a data factory.
> * Use the Copy Data tool to create a pipeline.
> * Monitor the pipeline and activity runs.

## Prerequisites

* **Azure subscription**: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* **Azure Storage account**: Use Blob storage as the _source_ data store. If you don't have an Azure Storage account, see the instructions in [Create a storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md).
* **Azure SQL Database**: Use a SQL Database as the _sink_ data store. If you don't have a SQL Database, see the instructions in [Create a SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart).

### Prepare the SQL database

Allow Azure services to access the logical SQL Server of your Azure SQL Database.

1. Verify that the setting **Allow Azure services and resources to access this server** is enabled for your server that's running SQL Database. This setting lets Data Factory write data to your database instance. To verify and turn on this setting, go to logical SQL server > Security > Firewalls and virtual networks > set the **Allow Azure services and resources to access this server** option to **ON**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The option to **Allow Azure services and resources to access this server** enables network access to your SQL Server from any Azure resource, not just those in your subscription. It may not be appropriate for all environments, but is appropriate for this limited tutorial. For more information, see [Azure SQL Server Firewall rules](/azure/azure-sql/database/firewall-configure). Instead, you can use [Private endpoints](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md) to connect to Azure PaaS services without using public IPs.

### Create a blob and a SQL table

Prepare your Blob storage and your SQL Database for the tutorial by performing these steps.

#### Create a source blob

1. Launch **Notepad**. Copy the following text and save it in a file named **inputEmp.txt** on your disk:

   ```text
   FirstName|LastName
   John|Doe
   Jane|Doe
   ```

1. Create a container named **adfv2tutorial** and upload the inputEmp.txt file to the container. You can use the Azure portal or various tools like [Azure Storage Explorer](https://storageexplorer.com/) to perform these tasks.

#### Create a sink SQL table

1. Use the following SQL script to create a table named `dbo.emp` in your SQL Database:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE dbo.emp
   (
       ID int IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
       FirstName varchar(50),
       LastName varchar(50)
   )
   GO
   CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_emp_ID ON dbo.emp (ID);
   ```


## Create a data factory

1. On the left menu, select **Create a resource** > **Integration** > **Data Factory**:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/doc-common-process/new-azure-data-factory-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New data factory creation.":::

1. On the **New data factory** page, under **Name**, enter **ADFTutorialDataFactory**.

   The name for your data factory must be _globally unique_. You might receive the following error message:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/doc-common-process/name-not-available-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New data factory error message for duplicate name.":::

   If you receive an error message about the name value, enter a different name for the data factory. For example, use the name _**yourname**_**ADFTutorialDataFactory**. For the naming rules for Data Factory artifacts, see [Data Factory naming rules](naming-rules.md).

1. Select the Azure **subscription** in which to create the new data factory.

1. For **Resource Group**, take one of the following steps:

   a. Select **Use existing**, and select an existing resource group from the drop-down list.

   b. Select **Create new**, and enter the name of a resource group.

   To learn about resource groups, see [Use resource groups to manage your Azure resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md).

1. Under **version**, select **V2** for the version.

1. Under **location**, select the location for the data factory. Only supported locations are displayed in the drop-down list. The data stores (for example, Azure Storage and SQL Database) and computes (for example, Azure HDInsight) that are used by your data factory can be in other locations and regions.

1. Select **Create**.

1. After creation is finished, the **Data Factory** home page is displayed.

   :::image type="content" source="~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/media/data-factory/data-factory-home-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Home page for the Azure Data Factory, with the Open Azure Data Factory Studio tile.":::

1. To launch the Azure Data Factory user interface (UI) in a separate tab, select **Open** on the **Open Azure Data Factory Studio** tile.

## Use the Copy Data tool to create a pipeline

1. On the home page of Azure Data Factory, select the **Ingest** tile to launch the Copy Data tool.
