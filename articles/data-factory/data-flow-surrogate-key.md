# Surrogate key transformation in mapping data flow

Use the surrogate key transformation to add an incrementing key value to each row of data. This is useful when designing dimension tables in a star schema analytical data model. In a star schema, each member in your dimension tables requires a unique key that is a non-business key.

## Configuration

**Key column:** The name of the generated surrogate key column.

**Start value:** The lowest key value that will be generated.

## Increment keys from existing sources

To start your sequence from a value that exists in a source, we recommend to use a cache sink to save that value and use a derived column transformation to add the two values together. Use a cached lookup to get the output and append it to the generated key. For more information, learn about [cache sinks](data-flow-sink.md#cache-sink) and [cached lookups](concepts-data-flow-expression-builder.md#cached-lookup).

### Increment from existing maximum value

To seed the key value with the previous max, there are two techniques that you can use based on where your source data is.

#### Database sources

Use a SQL query option to select MAX() from your source. For example, `Select MAX(<surrogateKeyName>) as maxval from <sourceTable>`.

#### File sources

If your previous max value is in a file, use the `max()` function in the aggregate transformation to get the previous max value:

In both cases, you will need to write to a cache sink and lookup the value. 


## Data flow script

### Syntax

```
<incomingStream> 
    keyGenerate(
        output(<surrogateColumnName> as long),
        startAt: <number>L
    ) ~> <surrogateKeyTransformationName>
```

### Example

:::image type="content" source="media/data-flow/surrogate.png" alt-text="Surrogate Key Transform":::

The data flow script for the above surrogate key configuration is in the code snippet below.

```
AggregateDayStats
    keyGenerate(
        output(key as long),
        startAt: 1L
    ) ~> SurrogateKey1
```
