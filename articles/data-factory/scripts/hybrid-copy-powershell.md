# Use PowerShell to create a data factory pipeline to copy data from SQL Server to Azure

This sample PowerShell script creates a pipeline in Azure Data Factory that copies data from a SQL Server database to an Azure Blob Storage.

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/updated-for-az.md)]

[!INCLUDE [sample-powershell-install](../../../includes/sample-powershell-install-no-ssh-az.md)]

## Prerequisites

- **SQL Server**. You use a SQL Server database as a **source** data store in this sample.
- **Azure Storage account**. You use Azure blob storage as a **destination/sink** data store in this sample. if you don't have an Azure storage account, see the [Create a storage account](../../storage/common/storage-account-create.md) article for steps to create one.
- **Self-hosted integration runtime**. Download MSI file from the [download center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717) and run it to install a self-hosted integration runtime on your machine.  

### Create sample database in SQL Server
1. In the SQL Server database, create a table named **emp** by using the following SQL script:

   ```sql   
     CREATE TABLE dbo.emp
     (
         ID int IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
         FirstName varchar(50),
         LastName varchar(50),
         CONSTRAINT PK_emp PRIMARY KEY (ID)
     )
     GO
   ```

2. Insert some sample data into the table:

   ```sql
     INSERT INTO emp VALUES ('John', 'Doe')
     INSERT INTO emp VALUES ('Jane', 'Doe')
   ```

## Sample script

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script creates JSON files that define Data Factory entities (linked service, dataset, and pipeline) on your hard drive in the c:\ folder.

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/data-factory/copy-from-onprem-sql-server-to-azure-blob/copy-from-onprem-sql-server-to-azure-blob.ps1 "Copy from SQL Server -> Azure Blob Storage")]


## Clean up deployment

After you run the sample script, you can use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it:

```powershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName
```
To remove the data factory from the resource group, run the following command:

```powershell
Remove-AzDataFactoryV2 -Name $dataFactoryName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands:

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [New-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [Set-AzDataFactoryV2](/powershell/module/az.datafactory/set-Azdatafactoryv2) | Create a data factory. |
| [New-AzDataFactoryV2LinkedServiceEncryptCredential](/powershell/module/az.datafactory/new-Azdatafactoryv2linkedserviceencryptedcredential) | Encrypts credentials in a linked service and generates a new linked service definition with the encrypted credential.
| [Set-AzDataFactoryV2LinkedService](/powershell/module/az.datafactory/Set-Azdatafactoryv2linkedservice) | Creates a linked service in the data factory. A linked service links a data store or compute to a data factory. |
| [Set-AzDataFactoryV2Dataset](/powershell/module/az.datafactory/Set-Azdatafactoryv2dataset) | Creates a dataset in the data factory. A dataset represents input/output for an activity in a pipeline. |
| [Set-AzDataFactoryV2Pipeline](/powershell/module/az.datafactory/Set-Azdatafactoryv2pipeline) | Creates a pipeline in the data factory. A pipeline contains one or more activities that performs a certain operation. In this pipeline, a copy activity copies data from one location to another location in an Azure Blob Storage. |
| [Invoke-AzDataFactoryV2Pipeline](/powershell/module/az.datafactory/Invoke-Azdatafactoryv2pipeline) | Creates a run for the pipeline. In other words, runs the pipeline. |
| [Get-AzDataFactoryV2ActivityRun](/powershell/module/az.datafactory/get-Azdatafactoryv2activityrun) | Gets details about the run of the activity (activity run) in the pipeline.
| [Remove-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
