# PowerShell script - deploy Azure-SSIS integration runtime

This sample PowerShell script creates an Azure-SSIS integration runtime that can run your SSIS packages in Azure.  

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/updated-for-az.md)]

[!INCLUDE [sample-powershell-install](../../../includes/sample-powershell-install-no-ssh-az.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/data-factory/deploy-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/deploy-azure-ssis-integration-runtime.ps1 "Deploy Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime")]

## Clean up deployment

After you run the sample script, you can use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it:

```powershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName
```
To remove the data factory from the resource group, run the following command: 

```powershell
Remove-AzDataFactoryV2 -Name $dataFactoryName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName
```
