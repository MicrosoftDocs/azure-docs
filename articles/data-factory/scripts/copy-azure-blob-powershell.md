# Use PowerShell to create a data factory pipeline to copy data in the cloud

This sample PowerShell script creates a pipeline in Azure Data Factory that copies data from one location to another location in an Azure Blob Storage.

[!INCLUDE [sample-powershell-install](../../../includes/sample-powershell-install-no-ssh.md)]

## Prerequisites
* **Azure Storage account**. You use the blob storage as both the **source** and **sink** data stores. If you don't have an Azure storage account, see the [Create a storage account](../../storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account.md) on creating one. 
* Create a **blob container** in Blob Storage, create an input **folder** in the container, and upload some files to the folder. You can use tools such as [Azure Storage explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) to connect to Azure Blob storage, create a blob container, upload input file, and verify the output file.

## Sample script

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script creates JSON files that define Data Factory entities (linked service, dataset, and pipeline) on your hard drive in the c:\ folder.

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/data-factory/copy-from-azure-blob-to-blob/copy-from-azure-blob-to-blob.ps1 "Copy from Blob Storage -> Blob Storage")]


## Clean up deployment

After you run the sample script, you can use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it:

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName
```
To remove the data factory from the resource group, run the following command: 

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmDataFactoryV2 -Name $dataFactoryName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands: 

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [New-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermresourcegroup) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [Set-AzureRmDataFactoryV2](/powershell/module/azurerm.datafactoryv2/set-azurermdatafactoryv2) | Create a data factory. |
| [Set-AzureRmDataFactoryV2LinkedService](/powershell/module/azurerm.datafactoryv2/Set-azurermdatafactoryv2linkedservice) | Creates a linked service in the data factory. A linked service links a data store or compute to a data factory. |
| [Set-AzureRmDataFactoryV2Dataset](/powershell/module/azurerm.datafactoryv2/Set-azurermdatafactoryv2dataset) | Creates a dataset in the data factory. A dataset represents input/output for an activity in a pipeline. | 
| [Set-AzureRmDataFactoryV2Pipeline](/powershell/module/azurerm.datafactoryv2/Set-azurermdatafactoryv2pipeline) | Creates a pipeline in the data factory. A pipeline contains one or more activities that performs a certain operation. In this pipeline, a copy activity copies data from one location to another location in an Azure Blob Storage. |
| [Invoke-AzureRmDataFactoryV2Pipeline](/powershell/module/azurerm.datafactoryv2/Invoke-azurermdatafactoryv2pipeline) | Creates a run for the pipeline. In other words, runs the pipeline. |
| [Get-AzureRmDataFactoryV2ActivityRun](/powershell/module/azurerm.datafactoryv2/get-azurermdatafactoryv2activityrun) | Gets details about the run of the activity (activity run) in the pipeline. 
| [Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/remove-azurermresourcegroup) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
