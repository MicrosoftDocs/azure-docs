# Copy data from SharePoint Online List by using Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse Analytics
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse pipelines to copy data from SharePoint Online List. The article builds on [Copy Activity](copy-activity-overview.md), which presents a general overview of Copy Activity.

## Supported capabilities

This SharePoint Online List connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources or sinks, see the [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores) table.


Specifically, this SharePoint List Online connector uses service principal authentication and retrieves data via OData protocol.

> [!TIP]
> This connector supports copying data from SharePoint Online **List** but not file. Learn how to copy file from [Copy file from SharePoint Online](#copy-file-from-sharepoint-online) section.

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties you can use to define entities that are specific to SharePoint Online List connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for a SharePoint Online List linked service:

| **Property**        | **Description**                                              | **Required** |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| type                | The type property must be set to:â€¯**SharePointOnlineList**.  | Yes          |
| siteUrl             | The SharePoint Online site url, e.g. `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/siteName`. | Yes          |
| servicePrincipalId  | The Application (client) ID of the application registered in Microsoft Entra ID. | Yes          |

| servicePrincipalEmbeddedCert | Specify the base64 encoded certificate of your application registered in Microsoft Entra ID, and ensure the certificate content type is **PKCS #12**. Mark this field as a **SecureString** to store it securely, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). You need to configure the permission settings referring this [article](/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread).| No |
| servicePrincipalEmbeddedCertPassword | Specify the password of your certificate if your certificate is secured with a password. Mark this field as a **SecureString** to store it securely, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | No |
| ***For ServicePrincipalKey*** | | |
| servicePrincipalKey | The application's key. Mark this field as a **SecureString** to store it securely, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). Refer to this [section](#grant-permission-for-using-service-principal-key) for more details including the permission settings.| No          |
|  |  |  |
| tenantId            | The tenant ID under which your application resides.          | Yes          |
| connectVia          | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to use to connect to the data store. If not specified, the default Azure Integration Runtime is used. | No           |

>[!Note]
>If you are using service principal key authentication, which is based on Azure ACS (Access Control Services), we recommend switching to the **service principal certificate authentication** due to the [ACS retirement plan](/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/retirement-announcement-for-azure-acs).

**Example 1: Using service principal key authentication**

```json
{
    "name": "SharePointOnlineList",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SharePointOnlineList",
        "typeProperties": {
            "siteUrl": "<site URL>",
            "servicePrincipalId": "<service principal id>",
            "servicePrincipalCredentialType":  "ServicePrincipalKey",
            "servicePrincipalKey": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<service principal key>"
            },
            "tenantId": "<tenant ID>"
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example 2: Using service principal certificate authentication**

{
    "name": "SharePointOnlineList",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SharePointOnlineList",
        "typeProperties": {
            "siteUrl": "<site URL>",
            "servicePrincipalId": "<service principal id>",
            "servicePrincipalCredentialType": "ServicePrincipalCert",
            "servicePrincipalEmbeddedCert": { 
                "type": "SecureString", 
                "value": "<base64 encoded string of (.pfx) certificate data>"
            },
            "servicePrincipalEmbeddedCertPassword": {

        }
    }
}
```

### Grant permission for using service principal key

The SharePoint List Online connector uses service principal authentication to connect to SharePoint. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform. To learn how, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](../active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app.md). Make note of these values, which you use to define the linked service:

    - Application ID
    - Application key
    - Tenant ID

2. Grant SharePoint Online site permission to your registered application by following the steps below. To do this, you need a site admin role.

    1. Open your SharePoint Online site link. For example, the URL in the format `https://<your-site-url>/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx` where the placeholder `<your-site-url>` is your site.
    2. Search the application ID you registered, fill the empty fields, and click "Create".

        - App Domain: `contoso.com`
        - Redirect URL: `https://www.contoso.com`
        - Permission Request XML:  

            ```xml
            <AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">
                <AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/sitecollection/web" Right="Read"/>
            </AppPermissionRequests>
            ```

            :::image type="content" source="media/connector-sharepoint-online-list/sharepoint-online-grant-permission-admin.png" alt-text="Grant SharePoint Online site permission to your registered application when you have site admin role.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > In the context of configuring the SharePoint connector, the "App Domain" and "Redirect URL" refer to the SharePoint app that you have registered in Microsoft Entra ID to allow access to your SharePoint data. The "App Domain" is the domain where your SharePoint site is hosted. For example, if your SharePoint site is located at "https://contoso.sharepoint.com", then the "App Domain" would be "contoso.sharepoint.com". The "Redirect URL" is the URL that the SharePoint app will redirect to after the user has authenticated and granted permissions to the app. This URL should be a page on your SharePoint site that the app has permission to access. For example, you could use the URL of a page that displays a list of files in a library, or a page that displays the contents of a document.

    3. Click "Trust It" for this app.

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties that are available for defining datasets, see [Datasets and linked services](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md). The following section provides a list of the properties supported by the SAP table dataset.

| Property | Description | Required |

## Copy file from SharePoint Online

You can copy file from SharePoint Online by using **Web activity** to authenticate and grab access token from SPO, then passing to subsequent **Copy activity** to copy data with **HTTP connector as source**.

:::image type="content" source="media/connector-sharepoint-online-list/sharepoint-online-copy-file-flow.png" alt-text="sharepoint copy file flow":::

1. Follow the [Grant permission for using service principal key](#grant-permission-for-using-service-principal-key) section to create Microsoft Entra application and grant permission to SharePoint Online. 

2. Create a **Web Activity** to get the access token from SharePoint Online:

    - **URL**: `https://accounts.accesscontrol.windows.net/[Tenant-ID]/tokens/OAuth/2`. Replace the tenant ID.
    - **Method**: POST
    - **Headers**:
        - Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    - **Body**:  `grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=[Client-ID]@[Tenant-ID]&client_secret=[Client-Secret]&resource=00000003-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000/[Tenant-Name].sharepoint.com@[Tenant-ID]`. Replace the client ID (application ID), client secret (application key), tenant ID, and tenant name (of the SharePoint tenant).

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Set the Secure Output option to true in Web activity to prevent the token value from being logged in plain text. Any further activities that consume this value should have their Secure Input option set to true.

3. Chain with a **Copy activity** with HTTP connector as source to copy SharePoint Online file content:

    - HTTP linked service:
        - **Base URL**: `https://[site-url]/_api/web/GetFileByServerRelativeUrl('[relative-path-to-file]')/$value`. Replace the site URL and relative path to file. Make sure to include the SharePoint site URL along with the Domain name, such as `https://[sharepoint-domain-name].sharepoint.com/sites/[sharepoint-site]/_api/web/GetFileByServerRelativeUrl('/sites/[sharepoint-site]/[relative-path-to-file]')/$value`.
        - **Authentication type:** Anonymous *(to use the Bearer token configured in copy activity source later)*
    - Dataset: choose the format you want. To copy file as-is, select "Binary" type.
    - Copy activity source:
        - **Request method**: GET
        - **Additional header**: use the following expression`@{concat('Authorization: Bearer ', activity('<Web-activity-name>').output.access_token)}`, which uses the Bearer token generated by the upstream Web activity as authorization header. Replace the Web activity name.
    - Configure the copy activity sink for any supported sink destination.

> [!NOTE]
> Even if a Microsoft Entra application has `FullControl` permissions on SharePoint Online, you can't copy files from document libraries with IRM enabled.

## Lookup activity properties
