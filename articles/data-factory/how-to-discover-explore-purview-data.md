- Understand the data based on metadata, lineage, annotations 
- Connect those data to your data factory with linked services or datasets 

## Prerequisites 

- [Microsoft Purview account](../purview/create-catalog-portal.md) 
- [Data Factory](./quickstart-create-data-factory-portal.md) 
- [Connect a Microsoft Purview Account into Data Factory](./connect-data-factory-to-azure-purview.md)
