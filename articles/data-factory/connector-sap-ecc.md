# Copy data from SAP ECC using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the copy activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from SAP Enterprise Central Component (ECC). For more information, see [Copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md).

>[!TIP]
>To learn the overall support on SAP data integration scenario, see [SAP data integration using Azure Data Factory whitepaper](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-DataFactory/blob/master/whitepaper/SAP%20Data%20Integration%20using%20Azure%20Data%20Factory.pdf) with detailed introduction on each SAP connector, comparison and guidance.

## Supported capabilities

This SAP ECC connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources or sinks, see the [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores) table.

Specifically, this SAP ECC connector supports:

- Copying data from SAP ECC on SAP NetWeaver version 7.0 and later.
- Copying data from any objects exposed by SAP ECC OData services, such as:

  - SAP tables or views.
  - Business Application Programming Interface [BAPI] objects.
  - Data extractors.
  - Data or intermediate documents (IDOCs) sent to SAP Process Integration (PI) that can be received as OData via relative adapters.

- Copying data by using basic authentication.

The version 7.0 or later refers to SAP NetWeaver version instead of SAP ECC version. For example,â€¯SAP ECC 6.0 EHP 7 in general has NetWeaver version >=7.4. In case you are unsure about your environment, here are the steps to confirm the version from your SAP system:

1. Use SAP GUI to connect to the SAP System. 
2. Go to **System** -> **Status**. 
3. Check the release of the SAP_BASIS, ensure it is equal to or larger than 701.

>[!TIP]
>To copy data from SAP ECC via an SAP table or view, use the [SAP table](connector-sap-table.md) connector, which is faster and more scalable.

## Prerequisites

To use this SAP ECC connector, you need to expose the SAP ECC entities via OData services through SAP Gateway. More specifically:

- **Set up SAP Gateway**. For servers with SAP NetWeaver versions later than 7.4, SAP Gateway is already installed. For earlier versions, you must install the embedded SAP Gateway or the SAP Gateway hub system before exposing SAP ECC data through OData services. To set up SAP Gateway, see the [installation guide](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_gateway20sp12/helpdata/en/c3/424a2657aa4cf58df949578a56ba80/frameset.htm).

- **Activate and configure the SAP OData service**. You can activate the OData service through TCODE SICF in seconds. You can also configure which objects need to be exposed. For more information, see the [step-by-step guidance](https://blogs.sap.com/2012/10/26/step-by-step-guide-to-build-an-odata-service-based-on-rfcs-part-1/).

            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Data type mappings for SAP ECC

When you're copying data from SAP ECC, the following mappings are used from OData data types for SAP ECC data to interim data types the service uses internally. To learn how the copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink, see [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md).

| OData data type | Interim service data type |
|:--- |:--- |
| `Edm.Binary` | `String` |
| `Edm.Boolean` | `Bool` |
| `Edm.Byte` | `String` |
| `Edm.DateTime` | `DateTime` |
| `Edm.Decimal` | `Decimal` |
| `Edm.Double` | `Double` |
| `Edm.Single` | `Single` |
| `Edm.Guid` | `String` |
| `Edm.Int16` | `Int16` |
| `Edm.Int32` | `Int32` |
| `Edm.Int64` | `Int64` |
| `Edm.SByte` | `Int16` |
| `Edm.String` | `String` |
| `Edm.Time` | `TimeSpan` |
| `Edm.DateTimeOffset` | `DateTimeOffset` |
