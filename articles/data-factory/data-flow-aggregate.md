# Aggregate transformation in mapping data flow

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

[!INCLUDE[data-flow-preamble](includes/data-flow-preamble.md)]

The Aggregate transformation defines aggregations of columns in your data streams. Using the Expression Builder, you can define different types of aggregations such as SUM, MIN, MAX, and COUNT grouped by existing or computed columns.

## Group by

Select an existing column or create a new computed column to use as a group by clause for your aggregation. To use an existing column, select it from the dropdown. To create a new computed column, hover over the clause and click **Computed column**. This opens the [data flow expression builder](concepts-data-flow-expression-builder.md). Once you create your computed column, enter the output column name under the **Name as** field. If you wish to add an additional group by clause, hover over an existing clause and click the plus icon.

A group by clause is optional in an Aggregate transformation.

## Aggregate columns

Go to the **Aggregates** tab to build aggregation expressions. You can either overwrite an existing column with an aggregation, or create a new field with a new name. The aggregation expression is entered in the right-hand box next to the column name selector. To edit the expression, click on the text box and open the expression builder. To add more aggregate columns, click on **Add** above the column list or the plus icon next to an existing aggregate column. Choose either **Add column** or **Add column pattern**. Each aggregation expression must contain at least one aggregate function.

> [!NOTE]
> In Debug mode, the expression builder cannot produce data previews with aggregate functions. To view data previews for aggregate transformations, close the expression builder and view the data via the 'Data Preview' tab.

### Column patterns

Use [column patterns](concepts-data-flow-column-pattern.md) to apply the same aggregation to a set of columns. This is useful if you wish to persist many columns from the input schema as they are dropped by default. Use a heuristic such as `first()` to persist input columns through the aggregation.

## Reconnect rows and columns

Aggregate transformations are similar to SQL aggregate select queries. Columns that aren't included in your group by clause or aggregate functions won't flow through to the output of your aggregate transformation. If you wish to include other columns in your aggregated output, do one of the following methods:

* Use an aggregate function such as `last()` or `first()` to include that additional column.
* Rejoin the columns to your output stream using the [self join pattern](https://mssqldude.wordpress.com/2018/12/20/adf-data-flows-self-join/).

## Removing duplicate rows

A common use of the aggregate transformation is removing or identifying duplicate entries in source data. This process is known as deduplication. Based upon a set of group by keys, use a heuristic of your choosing to determine which duplicate row to keep. Common heuristics are `first()`, `last()`, `max()`, and `min()`. Use [column patterns](concepts-data-flow-column-pattern.md) to apply the rule to every column except for the group by columns.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-flow/agg-dedupe.png" alt-text="Deduplication":::

In the above example, columns `ProductID` and `Name` are being use for grouping. If two rows have the same values for those two columns, they're considered duplicates. In this aggregate transformation, the values of the first row matched will be kept and all others will be dropped. Using column pattern syntax, all columns whose names aren't `ProductID` and `Name` are mapped to their existing column name and given the value of the first matched rows. The output schema is the same as the input schema.

For data validation scenarios, the `count()` function can be used to count how many duplicates there are.

## Data flow script

### Syntax

```
<incomingStream>
    aggregate(
           groupBy(
                <groupByColumnName> = <groupByExpression1>,
                <groupByExpression2>
               ),
           <aggregateColumn1> = <aggregateExpression1>,
           <aggregateColumn2> = <aggregateExpression2>,
           each(
                match(matchExpression),
                <metadataColumn1> = <metadataExpression1>,
                <metadataColumn2> = <metadataExpression2>
               )
          ) ~> <aggregateTransformationName>
```

### Example

The below example takes an incoming stream `MoviesYear` and groups rows by column `year`. The transformation creates an aggregate column `avgrating` that evaluates to the average of column `Rating`. This aggregate transformation is named `AvgComedyRatingsByYear`.

In the UI, this transformation looks like the below image:

:::image type="content" source="media/data-flow/agg-script1.png" alt-text="Group by example":::

:::image type="content" source="media/data-flow/agg-script2.png" alt-text="Aggregate example":::

The data flow script for this transformation is in the snippet below.

```
MoviesYear aggregate(
                groupBy(year),
                avgrating = avg(toInteger(Rating))
            ) ~> AvgComedyRatingByYear
```

:::image type="content" source="media/data-flow/aggdfs1.png" alt-text="Aggregate data flow script":::

```MoviesYear```: Derived Column defining year and title columns
```AvgComedyRatingByYear```: Aggregate transformation for average rating of comedies grouped by year
```avgrating```: Name of new column being created to hold the aggregated value

```
MoviesYear aggregate(groupBy(year),
	avgrating = avg(toInteger(Rating))) ~> AvgComedyRatingByYear
```
