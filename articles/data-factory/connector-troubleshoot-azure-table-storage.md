# Troubleshoot the Azure Table Storage connector in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article provides suggestions to troubleshoot common problems with the Azure Table Storage connector in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse.

## Error code: AzureTableDuplicateColumnsFromSource

- **Message**: `Duplicate columns with same name '%name;' are detected from source. This is NOT supported by Azure Table Storage sink.`

- **Cause**: Duplicated source columns might occur for one of the following reasons:
   * You're using the database as a source and applied table joins.
   * You have unstructured CSV files with duplicated column names in the header row.

- **Recommendation**:  Double-check and fix the source columns, as necessary.
