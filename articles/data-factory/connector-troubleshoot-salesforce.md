# Troubleshoot the Salesforce and Salesforce Service Cloud connectors in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article provides suggestions to troubleshoot common problems with the Salesforce and Salesforce Service Cloud connectors in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse.

## Error code: SalesforceOauth2ClientCredentialFailure

- **Cause**: You encounter this error code as you don't complete the Salesforce Connected App configuration.

- **Recommendation**: <br/>To configure your Salesforce Connected App, follow these steps:
    1. Create your connected app, and complete its [basic information](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create_basics.htm&type=5) and [OAuth settings](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create_api_integration.htm&type=5) for the connected app.
        1. Configure the **Connected App Name**, **API Name** and **Contact Email**.
        1. Select **Enable OAuth Settings**.
        1. Callback url can be random as Client Credential Flow don't need callback, for example: `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/callback` 
        1. Setup OAuth access token scope, it's better to set up "**Full access**" for Azure Data Factory in case of permission issue.
        <br/>If you want to keep the mini scope, at least the "**Manage user data via APIs (api)**" should be added.
        <br/>If you don't set proper scope, you may get following similar message like: **Unauthorized, This session is not valid for use with the REST API**
        1. Select **Enable Client Credentials Flow**.

    1. Get Client ID and Secret through **Manage Consumer Details**.

        :::image type="content" source="media/connector-salesforce/manage-consumer-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the manage consumer details.":::

    1. Copy the client ID and secret to a txt file for Azure Data Factory linked service.

    1. Create a user who has the API Only User permission.

        1. Set up a permission set which only has API only permission.
        :::image type="content" source="media/connector-salesforce/set-up-a-permission.png" alt-text="Screenshot of setting system permissions.":::
        1. Specify the **API Enabled** and **Api Only User**.
        :::image type="content" source="media/connector-salesforce/system-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the system permissions.":::
    
    1. Create a new user and link the permission set in the user detail page: **Permission Set Assignments**.
        :::image type="content" source="media/connector-salesforce/permission-set-assignments.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the permission set assignments.":::

    1. From the connected app detail page, click Manage, click **Edit Policies**. For **Run As**, select an execution user who has the API Only User permission. For **Timeout Value**, you can select a proper value or remain default None.
