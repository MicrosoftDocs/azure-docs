# Move data from Sybase using Azure Data Factory 

This article outlines how you can use the Copy Activity in an Azure data factory to move data from Sybase to another data store. This article builds on the [data movement activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article which presents a general overview of data movement with copy activity and supported data store combinations.

Data Factory service supports connecting to on-premises Sybase sources using the Data Management Gateway. See [moving data between on-premises locations and cloud](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md) article to learn about Data Management Gateway and step-by-step instructions on setting up the gateway. 

**Note:** You need to leverage the gateway to connect to Sybase even if it is hosted in Azure IaaS VMs. If you are trying to connect to an instance of Sybase hosted in cloud, you can also install the gateway instance in the IaaS VM.

Data factory currently supports only moving data from Sybase to other data stores, not from other data stores to Sybase.

## Installation

For Data Management Gateway to connect to the Sybase Database, you need to install the [data provider for Sybase](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=324846) on the same system as the Data Management Gateway.

> [AZURE.NOTE] See [Gateway Troubleshooting](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md#gateway-troubleshooting) for tips on troubleshooting connection/gateway related issues. 

## Sample: Copy data from Sybase to Azure Blob
This sample shows how to copy data from a Sybase database to an Azure Blob Storage. However, data can be copied **directly** to any of the sinks stated [here](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md#supported-data-stores) using the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory.  
 
The sample has the following data factory entities:

1.	A linked service of type [OnPremisesSybase](data-factory-onprem-sybase-connector.md#sybase-linked-service-properties).
2.	A liked service of type [AzureStorage](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-storage-linked-service-properties).
3.	An input [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [RelationalTable](data-factory-onprem-sybase-connector.md#sybase-dataset-type-properties).
4.	An output [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureBlob](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-dataset-type-properties).
4.	The [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) with Copy Activity that uses [RelationalSource](data-factory-onprem-sybase-connector.md#sybase-copy-activity-type-properties) and [BlobSink](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-copy-activity-type-properties).

The sample copies data from a query result in Sybase database to a blob every hour. The JSON properties used in these samples are described in sections following the samples. 

As a first step, please setup the data management gateway as per the instructions in the [moving data between on-premises locations and cloud](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md) article.

**Sybase linked service:**

	{
	    "name": "OnPremSybaseLinkedService",
	    "properties": {
	        "type": "OnPremisesSybase",
	        "typeProperties": {
	            "server": "<server>",
	            "database": "<database>",
	            "schema": "<schema>",
	            "authenticationType": "<authentication type>",
	            "username": "<username>",
	            "password": "<password>",
	            "gatewayName": "<gatewayName>"
	        }
	    }
	}

**Azure Blob storage linked service:**

	{
	    "name": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
	    "properties": {
	        "type": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
			"typeProperties": {
	        	"connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<AccountName>;AccountKey=<AccountKey>"
			}
	    }
	}


**Sybase input dataset:**

The sample assumes you have created a table “MyTable” in Sybase and it contains a column called “timestamp” for time series data.

Setting “external”: true and specifying externalData policy tells data factory that this is a table that is external to the data factory and not produced by an activity in the data factory. Note that the **type** of the linked service is set to: **RelationalTable**. 
	
	{
	    "name": "SybaseDataSet",
	    "properties": {
	        "type": "RelationalTable",
	        "linkedServiceName": "OnPremSybaseLinkedService",
	        "typeProperties": {},
	        "availability": {
	            "frequency": "Hour",
	            "interval": 1
	        },
			"external": true,
	        "policy": {
	            "externalData": {
	                "retryInterval": "00:01:00",
	                "retryTimeout": "00:10:00",
	                "maximumRetry": 3
	            }
	        }
	    }
	}


**Azure Blob output dataset:**

Data is written to a new blob every hour (frequency: hour, interval: 1). The folder path for the blob is dynamically evaluated based on the start time of the slice that is being processed. The folder path uses year, month, day, and hours parts of the start time.

	            "partitionedBy": [
	                {
	                    "name": "Year",
	                    "value": {
	                        "type": "DateTime",
	                        "date": "SliceStart",
	                        "format": "yyyy"
	                    }
	                },
	                {
	                    "name": "Month",
	                    "value": {
	                        "type": "DateTime",
	                        "date": "SliceStart",
	                        "format": "%M"
	                    }
	                },
	                {
	                    "name": "Day",
	                    "value": {
	                        "type": "DateTime",
	                        "date": "SliceStart",
	                        "format": "%d"
	                    }
	                },
	                {
	                    "name": "Hour",
	                    "value": {
	                        "type": "DateTime",
	                        "date": "SliceStart",
	                        "format": "%H"
	                    }
	                }
	            ]
	        },
	        "availability": {
	            "frequency": "Hour",
	            "interval": 1
	        }
	    }
	}


**Pipeline with Copy activity:**

The pipeline contains a Copy Activity that is configured to use the above input and output datasets and is scheduled to run every hour. In the pipeline JSON definition, the **source** type is set to **RelationalSource** and **sink** type is set to **BlobSink**. The SQL query specified for the **query** property selects the data from the DBA.Orders table in the database.

## Type mapping for Sybase

As mentioned in the data movement activities article Copy activity performs automatic type conversions from automatic type conversions from source types to sink types with the following 2 step approach:

1. Convert from native source types to .NET type
2. Convert from .NET type to native sink type

Sybase supports T-SQL and T-SQL types. For a mapping table from sql types to .NET type, see  [Azure SQL Connector](data-factory-azure-sql-connector.md) article.
