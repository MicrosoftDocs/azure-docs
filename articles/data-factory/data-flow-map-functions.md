# Map functions in mapping data flow

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

[!INCLUDE[data-flow-preamble](includes/data-flow-preamble.md)]

The following articles provide details about map functions supported by Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics in mapping data flows.

## Map function list

  Map functions perform operations on map data types

| Map function | Task |
|----|----|
| [associate](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#associate) | Creates a map of key/values. All the keys & values should be of the same type. If no items are specified, it's defaulted to a map of string to string type. Same as a ```[ -> ]``` creation operator. Keys and values should alternate with each other.|
| [keyValues](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#keyValues) | Creates a map of key/values. The first parameter is an array of keys and second is the array of values. Both arrays should have equal length.|
| [mapAssociation](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#mapAssociation) | Transforms a map by associating the keys to new values. Returns an array. It takes a mapping function where you can address the item as #key and current value as #value. |
| [reassociate](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#reassociate) | Transforms a map by associating the keys to new values. It takes a mapping function where you can address the item as #key and current value as #value.  |
