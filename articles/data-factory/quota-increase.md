1. On  the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) menu, select **Help + support**.

1. Review your [Azure support plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/?WT.mc_id=Support_Plan_510979/).

   * **Billing, quota, and subscription management** support are available at all support levels.
   * **Break-fix** support is provided through [Developer](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/developer/), [Standard](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/standard/), [Professional Direct](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/prodirect/), or [Premier](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/premier/) support. Break-fix issues are problems experienced by customers while using Azure where there is a reasonable expectation that Microsoft caused the problem.
   * **Developer mentoring** and **advisory services** are available at the [Professional Direct](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/prodirect/) and [Premier](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/premier/) support levels.

   If you have a Premier support plan, you can also report Azure Data Factory issues on the [Microsoft Premier online portal](https://www.microsoft.com/unifiedsupport/premier). See [Azure support plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/?WT.mc_id=Support_Plan_510979/) to learn more about the various support plans, including scope, response times, pricing, etc.  For frequently asked questions about Azure support, see [Azure support FAQs](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/faq/).

1. For **Issue type**, select the appropriate issue type. For break-fix problems, select **Technical**. For quota increase requests, select **Service and subscription limits (quotas)**.

If you select **Technical**, you are asked to provide a summary and then identify a problem type by selecting **Select problem type**. You may see solutions to help resolve your issue. If the solutions presented do not resolve your issue, select **Next:Details** and complete the form to submit the support ticket.
