# Troubleshoot the SAP Table, SAP Business Warehouse Open Hub, and SAP ODP connectors in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article provides suggestions to troubleshoot common problems with the SAP Table, SAP Business Warehouse Open Hub, and SAP ODP connectors in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse. 

## Error code: SapRfcDestinationAddFailed

- **Message**: `Get or create destination '%destination; failed.`

- **Cause**: Unable to connect to SAP server, which may be caused by the connection issue between the machine with an integration runtime installed and SAP server, or wrong credentials.  

- **Recommendation**: If the error messages are like `'<serverName>:3300' not reached`, test connection in the machine with an integration runtime installed first by following the PowerShell command below:

    ```powershell
    
    Test-NetConnection <sap server> -port 3300  
    
    ```
