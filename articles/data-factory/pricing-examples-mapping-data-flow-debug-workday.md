# Pricing example: Using mapping data flow debug for a normal workday

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-xxx-md](includes/appliesto-adf-xxx-md.md)]

This example shows mapping data flow debug costs for a typical workday for a data engineer.

The prices used in this example below are hypothetical and are not intended to imply exact actual pricing.  Read/write and monitoring costs are not shown since they are typically negligible and will not impact overall costs significantly.  Activity runs are also rounded to the nearest 1000 in pricing calculator estimates.

Refer to the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) for more specific scenarios and to estimate your future costs to use the service.

## Azure Data Factory engineer

A data factory engineer is responsible for designing, building, and testing mapping data flows every day. The engineer logs into the ADF UI in the morning and enables the Debug mode for Data Flows. The default TTL for Debug sessions is 60 minutes. The engineer works throughout the day for 8 hours, so the Debug session never expires. Therefore, Sam's charges for the day will be:

**8 (hours) x 8 (compute-optimized cores) x $0.193 = $12.35**
