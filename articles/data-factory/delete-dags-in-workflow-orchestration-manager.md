# Delete files in Workflow Orchestration Manager

> [!NOTE]
> Workflow Orchestration Manager is powered by Apache Airflow.

This article walks you through the steps to delete directed acyclic graph (DAG) files in Workflow Orchestration Manager environment.

## Prerequisites

- **Azure subscription**: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- **Azure Data Factory**: Create or select an existing [Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/data-factory#get-started) instance in a [region where the Workflow Orchestration Manager preview is supported](concepts-workflow-orchestration-manager.md#region-availability-public-preview).

## Delete DAGs by using Git sync

When you use the Git sync feature, it isn't possible to delete DAGs in Workflow Orchestration Manager because all your Git source files are synchronized with Workflow Orchestration Manager. We recommend removing the file from your source code repository so that your commit syncs with runtime.

## Delete DAGs by using Azure Blob Storage

1. In this example, you want to delete the DAG named `adf.py`.
