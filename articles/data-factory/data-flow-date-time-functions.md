# Date and time functions in mapping data flow

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

[!INCLUDE[data-flow-preamble](includes/data-flow-preamble.md)]

The following articles provide details about date and time functions supported by Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics in mapping data flows.

## Expression functions list

In Data Factory and Synapse pipelines, use date and time functions to express datetime values and manipulate them.

| Expression function | Task |
|-----|-----|
| [add](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#add) | Adds a pair of strings or numbers. Adds a date to a number of days. Adds a duration to a timestamp. Appends one array of similar type to another. Same as the + operator.  |
| [addDays](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#addDays) | Add days to a date or timestamp. Same as the + operator for date.  |
| [addMonths](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#addMonths) | Add months to a date or timestamp. You can optionally pass a timezone.  |
| [between](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#between) | Checks if the first value is in between two other values inclusively. Numeric, string and datetime values can be compared  |
| [currentDate](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#currentDate) | Gets the current date when this job starts to run. You can pass an optional timezone in the form of 'GMT', 'PST', 'UTC', 'America/Cayman'. The local timezone is used as the default. Refer to Java's `SimpleDateFormat` class for available formats. [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html). |
| [currentTimestamp](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#currentTimestamp) | Gets the current timestamp when the job starts to run with local time zone.  |
| [currentUTC](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#currentUTC) | Gets the current timestamp as UTC. If you want your current time to be interpreted in a different timezone than your cluster time zone, you can pass an optional timezone in the form of 'GMT', 'PST', 'UTC', or 'America/Cayman'. It's defaulted to the current timezone. Refer to Java's `SimpleDateFormat` class for available formats. [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html). To convert the UTC time to a different timezone, use `fromUTC()`.  |
| [dayOfMonth](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#dayOfMonth) | Gets the day of the month given a date.  |
| [dayOfWeek](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#dayOfWeek) | Gets the day of the week given a date. 1 - Sunday, 2 - Monday ..., 7 - Saturday.  |
| [dayOfYear](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#dayOfYear) | Gets the day of the year given a date.  |
| [days](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#days) | Duration in milliseconds for number of days.  |
| [fromUTC](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#fromUTC) | Converts to the timestamp from UTC. You can optionally pass the timezone in the form of 'GMT', 'PST', 'UTC', 'America/Cayman'. It's defaulted to the current timezone. Refer to Java's `SimpleDateFormat` class for available formats. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html.  |
| [hour](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#hour) | Gets the hour value of a timestamp. You can pass an optional timezone in the form of 'GMT', 'PST', 'UTC', 'America/Cayman'. The local timezone is used as the default. Refer to Java's `SimpleDateFormat` class for available formats. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html.  |
| [hours](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#hours) | Duration in milliseconds for number of hours.  |
| [isDate](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#isDate) | Checks if the input date string is a date using an optional input date format. Refer to Java's SimpleDateFormat for available formats. If the input date format is omitted, default format is ``yyyy-[M]M-[d]d``. Accepted formats are ``[ yyyy, yyyy-[M]M, yyyy-[M]M-[d]d, yyyy-[M]M-[d]dT* ]``|
| [isTimestamp](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#isTimestamp) | Checks if the input date string is a timestamp using an optional input timestamp format. Refer to Java's SimpleDateFormat for available formats. If the timestamp is omitted the default pattern ``yyyy-[M]M-[d]d hh:mm:ss[.f...]`` is used. You can pass an optional timezone in the form of 'GMT', 'PST', 'UTC', 'America/Cayman'. Timestamp supports up to millisecond accuracy with value of 999 Refer to Java's SimpleDateFormat for available formats.|
| [lastDayOfMonth](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#lastDayOfMonth) | Gets the last date of the month given a date.  |
| [millisecond](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#millisecond) | Gets the millisecond value of a date. You can pass an optional timezone in the form of 'GMT', 'PST', 'UTC', 'America/Cayman'. The local timezone is used as the default. Refer to Java's `SimpleDateFormat` class for available formats. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html.  |
| [milliseconds](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#milliseconds) | Duration in milliseconds for number of milliseconds.  |
| [minus](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#minus) | Subtracts numbers. Subtract number of days from a date. Subtract duration from a timestamp. Subtract two timestamps to get difference in milliseconds. Same as the - operator.  |
| [minute](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#minute) | Gets the minute value of a timestamp. You can pass an optional timezone in the form of 'GMT', 'PST', 'UTC', 'America/Cayman'. The local timezone is used as the default. Refer to Java's `SimpleDateFormat` class for available formats. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html.  |

| [subMonths](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#subMonths) | Subtract months from a date or timestamp.  |
| [toDate](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#toDate) | Converts input date string to date using an optional input date format. Refer to Java's `SimpleDateFormat` class for available formats. If the input date format is omitted, default format is yyyy-[M]M-[d]d. Accepted formats are :[ yyyy, yyyy-[M]M, yyyy-[M]M-[d]d, yyyy-[M]M-[d]dT* ].  |
| [toTimestamp](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#toTimestamp) | Converts a string to a timestamp given an optional timestamp format. If the timestamp is omitted the default pattern yyyy-[M]M-[d]d hh:mm:ss[.f...] is used. You can pass an optional timezone in the form of 'GMT', 'PST', 'UTC', 'America/Cayman'.
