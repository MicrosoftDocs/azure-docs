# Monitor an integration runtime in Azure Data Factory

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-xxx-md](includes/appliesto-adf-xxx-md.md)]
  
**Integration runtime** is the compute infrastructure used by Azure Data Factory (ADF) to provide various data integration capabilities across different network environments. There are three types of integration runtimes offered by Data Factory:

- Azure integration runtime
- Self-hosted integration runtime
- Azure-SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) integration runtime

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/updated-for-az.md)]

To get the status of an instance of integration runtime (IR), run the following PowerShell command: 

```powershell
Get-AzDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntime -DataFactoryName MyDataFactory -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroup -Name MyAzureIR -Status
``` 

The cmdlet returns different information for different types of integration runtime. This article explains the properties and statuses for each type of integration runtime.  

## Azure integration runtime

The compute resource for an Azure integration runtime is fully managed elastically in Azure. The following table provides descriptions for properties returned by the **Get-AzDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntime** command:

### Properties

The following table provides descriptions of properties returned by the cmdlet for an Azure integration runtime:

| Property | Description |
-------- | ------------- | 
| Name | Name of the Azure integration runtime. |  
| State | Status of the Azure integration runtime. | 
| Location | Location of the Azure integration runtime. For details about location of an Azure integration runtime, see [Introduction to integration runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md). |
| DataFactoryName | Name of the data factory that the Azure integration runtime belongs to. | 
| ResourceGroupName | Name of the resource group that the data factory belongs to.  |
| Description | Description of the integration runtime.  |

### Status

The following table provides possible statuses of an Azure integration runtime:

| Status | Comments/Scenarios | 
| ------ | ------------------ |
| Online | The Azure integration runtime is online and ready to be used. | 
| Offline | The Azure integration runtime is offline due to an internal error. |

## Self-hosted integration runtime

This section provides descriptions for properties returned by the Get-AzDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntime cmdlet. 

> [!NOTE] 
> The returned properties and status contain information about overall self-hosted integration runtime and each node in the runtime.  

### Properties

The following table provides descriptions of monitoring Properties for **each node**:

| Property | Description | 
| -------- | ----------- | 
| Name | Name of the self-hosted integration runtime and nodes associated with it. Node is an on-premises Windows machine that has the self-hosted integration runtime installed on it. |  
| Status | The status of the overall self-hosted integration runtime and each node. Example: Online/Offline/Limited/etc. For information about these statuses, see the next section. | 
| Version | The version of self-hosted integration runtime and each node. The version of the self-hosted integration runtime is determined based on version of majority of nodes in the group. If there are nodes with different versions in the self-hosted integration runtime setup, only the nodes with the same version number as the logical self-hosted integration runtime function properly. Others are in the limited mode and need to be manually updated (only in case auto-update fails). | 
| Available memory | Available memory on a self-hosted integration runtime node. This value is a near real-time snapshot. | 
| CPU utilization | CPU utilization of a self-hosted integration runtime node. This value is a near real-time snapshot. |
| Networking (In/Out) | Network utilization of a self-hosted integration runtime node. This value is a near real-time snapshot. | 
| Concurrent Jobs (Running/ Limit) | **Running**. Number of jobs or tasks running on each node. This value is a near real-time snapshot. <br/><br/>**Limit**. Limit signifies the maximum concurrent jobs for each node. This value is defined based on the machine size. You can increase the limit to scale up concurrent job execution in advanced scenarios, when activities are timing out even when CPU, memory, or network is under-utilized. This capability is also available with a single-node self-hosted integration runtime. |
| Role | There are two types of roles in a multi-node self-hosted integration runtime - dispatcher and worker. All nodes are workers, which means they can all be used to execute jobs. There is only one dispatcher node, which is used to pull tasks/jobs from cloud services and dispatch them to different worker nodes. The dispatcher node is also a worker node. |

Some settings of the properties make more sense when there are two or more nodes in the self-hosted integration runtime (that is, in a scale out scenario).

#### Concurrent jobs limit

The default value of the concurrent jobs limit is set based on the machine size. The factors used to calculate this value depend on the amount of RAM and the number of CPU cores of the machine. So the more cores and the more memory, the higher the default limit of concurrent jobs.

You scale out by increasing the number of nodes. When you increase the number of nodes, the concurrent jobs limit is the sum of the concurrent job limit values of all the available nodes.  For example, if one node lets you run a maximum of twelve concurrent jobs, then adding three more similar nodes lets you run a maximum of  48 concurrent jobs (that is, 4 x 12). We recommend that you increase the concurrent jobs limit only when you see low resource usage with the default values on each node.

You can override the calculated default value in the Azure portal. Select Author > Connections > Integration Runtimes > Edit > Nodes > Modify concurrent job value per node. You can also use the PowerShell [update-Azdatafactoryv2integrationruntimenode](/powershell/module/az.datafactory/update-Azdatafactoryv2integrationruntimenode#examples) command.
  
### Status (per node)

The following table provides possible statuses of a self-hosted integration runtime node:

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ------------------ | 
| Online | Node is connected to the Data Factory service. |
| Offline | Node is offline. |
| Upgrading | The node is being auto-updated. |
| Limited | Due to a connectivity issue. May be due to HTTP port 8060 issue, service bus connectivity issue, or a credential sync issue. |
| Inactive | Node is in a configuration different from the configuration of other majority nodes. |

A node can be inactive when it cannot connect to other nodes.

### Status (overall self-hosted integration runtime)

The following table provides possible statuses of a self-hosted integration runtime. This status depends on statuses of all nodes that belong to the runtime. 

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- | 
| Need Registration | No node is registered to this self-hosted integration runtime yet. |
| Online | All nodes are online. |
| Offline | No node is online. |
| Limited | Not all nodes in this self-hosted integration runtime are in a healthy state. This status is a warning that some nodes might be down. This status could be due to a credential sync issue on dispatcher/worker node. |

Use the **Get-AzDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntimeMetric** cmdlet to fetch the JSON payload containing the detailed self-hosted integration runtime properties, and their snapshot values during the time of execution of the cmdlet.

```powershell
Get-AzDataFactoryV2IntegrationRuntimeMetric -name $integrationRuntimeName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -DataFactoryName $dataFactoryName | ConvertTo-Json 
```

Sample output (assumes that there are two nodes associated with this self-hosted integration runtime):

```json
{
	"IntegrationRuntimeName":  "<Name of your integration runtime>",
    "ResourceGroupName":  "<Resource Group Name>",
    "DataFactoryName":  "<Data Factory Name>",
    "Nodes":  [
		{
			"NodeName":  "<Node Name>",
			"AvailableMemoryInMB":  <Value>,
			"CpuUtilization":  <Value>,
			"ConcurrentJobsLimit":  <Value>,
			"ConcurrentJobsRunning":  <Value>,
			"MaxConcurrentJobs":  <Value>,
			"SentBytes":  <Value>,
			"ReceivedBytes":  <Value>
		},
		{
			"NodeName":  "<Node Name>",
			"AvailableMemoryInMB":  <Value>,
			"CpuUtilization":  <Value>,
			"ConcurrentJobsLimit":  <Value>,
			"ConcurrentJobsRunning":  <Value>,
			"MaxConcurrentJobs":  <Value>,
			"SentBytes":  <Value>,
			"ReceivedBytes":  <Value>
		}

	]
} 
```

## Azure-SSIS integration runtime

Azure-SSIS IR is a fully managed cluster of Azure virtual machines (VMs or nodes) dedicated to run your SSIS packages. You can invoke SSIS package executions on Azure-SSIS IR using various methods, for example via Azure-enabled SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), AzureDTExec command line utility, T-SQL on SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)/SQL Server Agent, and Execute SSIS Package activities in ADF pipelines. Azure-SSIS IR doesn't run any other ADF activities. Once provisioned, you can monitor its overall/node-specific properties and statuses via Azure PowerShell, Azure portal, and Azure Monitor.

### Monitor the Azure-SSIS integration runtime with Azure PowerShell

Use the following Azure PowerShell cmdlet to monitor the overall/node-specific properties and statuses of Azure-SSIS IR.

### Monitor the Azure-SSIS integration runtime in Azure portal

To monitor your Azure-SSIS IR in Azure portal, go to the **Integration runtimes** page of **Monitor** hub on ADF UI, where you can see all of your integration runtimes.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-integration-runtime/monitor-integration-runtimes.png" alt-text="Monitor all integration runtimes":::

Next, select the name of your Azure-SSIS IR to open its monitoring page, where you can see its overall/node-specific properties and statuses. On this page, depending on how you configure the general, deployment, and advanced settings of your Azure-SSIS IR, you'll find various informational/functional tiles.

The **TYPE** and **REGION** informational tiles show the type and region of your Azure-SSIS IR, respectively.

The **NODE SIZE** informational tile shows the SKU (SSIS edition_VM tier_VM series), number of CPU cores, and size of RAM per node for your Azure-SSIS IR. 

The **RUNNING / REQUESTED NODE(S)** informational tile compares the number of nodes currently running to the total number of nodes previously requested for your Azure-SSIS IR.

The **DUAL STANDBY PAIR / ROLE** informational tile shows the name of your dual standby Azure-SSIS IR pair that works in sync with Azure SQL Managed Instance failover group for business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) and the current primary/secondary role of your Azure-SSIS IR. When SSISDB failover occurs, your primary and secondary Azure-SSIS IRs will swap roles (see [Configuring your Azure-SSIS IR for BCDR](./configure-bcdr-azure-ssis-integration-runtime.md)).

The functional tiles are described in more details below.
