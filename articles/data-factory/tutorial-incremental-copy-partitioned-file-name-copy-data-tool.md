# Incrementally copy new files based on time partitioned file name by using the Copy Data tool

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

In this tutorial, you use the Azure portal to create a data factory. Then, you use the Copy Data tool to create a pipeline that incrementally copies new files based on time partitioned file name from Azure Blob storage to Azure Blob storage.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're new to Azure Data Factory, see [Introduction to Azure Data Factory](introduction.md).

In this tutorial, you perform the following steps:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a data factory.
> * Use the Copy Data tool to create a pipeline.
> * Monitor the pipeline and activity runs.

## Prerequisites

* **Azure subscription**: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* **Azure storage account**: Use Blob storage as the _source_  and _sink_ data store. If you don't have an Azure storage account, see the instructions in [Create a storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md).

### Create two containers in Blob storage

Prepare your Blob storage for the tutorial by performing these steps.

1. Create a container named **source**.  Create a folder path as **2021/07/15/06** in your container. Create an empty text file, and name it as **file1.txt**. Upload the file1.txt to the folder path **source/2021/07/15/06** in your storage account.  You can use various tools to perform these tasks, such as [Azure Storage Explorer](https://storageexplorer.com/).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Please adjust the folder name with your UTC time.  For example, if the current UTC time is 6:10 AM on July 15, 2021, you can create the folder path as **source/2021/07/15/06/** by the rule of **source/{Year}/{Month}/{Day}/{Hour}/**.

2. Create a container named **destination**. You can use various tools to perform these tasks, such as [Azure Storage Explorer](https://storageexplorer.com/).

## Create a data factory

1. On the left menu, select **Create a resource** > **Integration** > **Data Factory**:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/doc-common-process/new-azure-data-factory-menu.png" alt-text="Data Factory selection in the &quot;New&quot; pane":::

2. On the **New data factory** page, under **Name**, enter **ADFTutorialDataFactory**.

    The name for your data factory must be _globally unique_. You might receive the following error message:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/doc-common-process/name-not-available-error.png" alt-text="New data factory error message for duplicate name.":::

   If you receive an error message about the name value, enter a different name for the data factory. For example, use the name _**yourname**_**ADFTutorialDataFactory**. For the naming rules for Data Factory artifacts, see [Data Factory naming rules](naming-rules.md).
3. Select the Azure **subscription** in which to create the new data factory.
4. For **Resource Group**, take one of the following steps:

    a. Select **Use existing**, and select an existing resource group from the drop-down list.

    b. Select **Create new**, and enter the name of a resource group. 
         
    To learn about resource groups, see [Use resource groups to manage your Azure resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md).

5. Under **version**, select **V2** for the version.
6. Under **location**, select the location for the data factory. Only supported locations are displayed in the drop-down list. The data stores (for example, Azure Storage and SQL Database) and computes (for example, Azure HDInsight) that are used by your data factory can be in other locations and regions.
7. Select **Create**.
8. After creation is finished, the **Data Factory** home page is displayed.
9. To launch the Azure Data Factory user interface (UI) in a separate tab, select **Open** on the **Open Azure Data Factory Studio** tile.

7. On the **Deployment** page, select **Monitor** to monitor the pipeline (task).
    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-incremental-copy-partitioned-file-name-copy-data-tool/deployment-page.png" alt-text="Deployment page":::

8. Notice that the **Monitor** tab on the left is automatically selected.  You need wait for the pipeline run when it is triggered automatically (about after one hour). When it runs, select the pipeline name link **DeltaCopyFromBlobPipeline** to view activity run details or rerun the pipeline. Select **Refresh** to refresh the list.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-incremental-copy-partitioned-file-name-copy-data-tool/monitor-pipeline-runs-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Pipeline runs pane.":::
9. There's only one activity (copy activity) in the pipeline, so you see only one entry. Adjust the column width of the **Source** and **Destination** columns (if necessary) to display more details, you can see the source file (file1.txt) has been copied from  *source/2021/07/15/06/* to *destination/2021/07/15/06/* with the same file name. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-incremental-copy-partitioned-file-name-copy-data-tool/monitor-pipeline-runs2.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows pipeline run details.":::

    You can also verify the same by using Azure Storage Explorer (https://storageexplorer.com/) to scan the files.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-incremental-copy-partitioned-file-name-copy-data-tool/monitor-pipeline-runs3.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows pipeline run details for the destination.":::

10. Create another empty text file with the new name as **file2.txt**. Upload the file2.txt file to the folder path **source/2021/07/15/07** in your storage account. You can use various tools to perform these tasks, such as [Azure Storage Explorer](https://storageexplorer.com/).

    > [!NOTE]
    > You might be aware that a new folder path is required to be created. Please adjust the folder name with your UTC time.  For example, if the current UTC time is 7:30 AM on July. 15th, 2021, you can create the folder path as **source/2021/07/15/07/** by the rule of **{Year}/{Month}/{Day}/{Hour}/**.

11. To go back to the **Pipeline runs** view, select **All pipelines runs**, and wait for the same pipeline being triggered again automatically after another one hour.  

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-incremental-copy-partitioned-file-name-copy-data-tool/monitor-pipeline-runs5.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the All pipeline runs link to return to that page.":::

12. Select the new **DeltaCopyFromBlobPipeline** link for the second pipeline run when it comes, and do the same to review details. You will see the source file (file2.txt) has been copied from  **source/2021/07/15/07/**  to **destination/2021/07/15/07/** with the same file name. You can also verify the same by using Azure Storage Explorer (https://storageexplorer.com/) to scan the files in **destination** container.
