# Copy data from MariaDB using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from MariaDB. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This MariaDB connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

This connector currently supports MariaDB of version 10.0 to 10.5.

## Create a linked service to MariaDB using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to MariaDB in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for Maria and select the MariaDB connector.

1. Configure the service details, test the connection, and create the new linked service.

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to MariaDB connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for MariaDB linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **MariaDB** | Yes |
| connectionString | An ODBC connection string to connect to MariaDB. <br/>You can also put password in Azure Key Vault and pull the `pwd` configuration out of the connection string. Refer to the following samples and [Store credentials in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md) article with more details. | Yes |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. Learn more from [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. If not specified, it uses the default Azure Integration Runtime. |No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "MariaDBLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "MariaDB",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "Server=<host>;Port=<port>;Database=<database>;UID=<user name>;PWD=<password>"
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example: store password in Azure Key Vault**

```json
{
    "name": "MariaDBLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "MariaDB",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "Server=<host>;Port=<port>;Database=<database>;UID=<user name>;",
            "pwd": { 
                "type": "AzureKeyVaultSecret", 
                "store": { 
                    "referenceName": "<Azure Key Vault linked service name>", 
                    "type": "LinkedServiceReference" 
                }, 
                "secretName": "<secretName>" 
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by MariaDB dataset.

To copy data from MariaDB, set the type property of the dataset to **MariaDBTable**. There is no additional type-specific property in this type of dataset.

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "MariaDBDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "MariaDBTable",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<MariaDB linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by MariaDB source.

### MariaDB as source

To copy data from MariaDB, set the source type in the copy activity to **MariaDBSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **MariaDBSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromMariaDB",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<MariaDB input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "MariaDBSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM MyTable"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
