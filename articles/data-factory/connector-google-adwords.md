# Copy data from Google Ads using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]


This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from Google Ads. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!Important]
> Please kindly [upgrade your Google Ads driver version](#upgrade-the-google-ads-driver-version) before **February 18, 2024**. If not, connection will start to fail with an [error](connector-troubleshoot-google-ads.md#error-code-deprecatedgoogleadslegacydriverversion) because of the deprecation of the legacy driver.

## Supported capabilities

This Google Ads connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks, see the [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores) table.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Google Ads source.

### Google Ads as source

To copy data from Google Ads set the source type in the copy activity to **GoogleAdWordsSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **GoogleAdWordsSource** | Yes |

                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Lookup activity properties

To learn details about the properties, check [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md).

## Upgrade the Google Ads driver version

To upgrade your Google Ads driver version, you need update your linked service and learn how to migrate from SQL to Google Ads Query Language (GAQL).

### Update the linked service configuration

In **Edit linked service** page, select **Recommended** under **Driver version** and configure the linked service by referring to [Linked service properties](#linked-service-properties). 

### Migrate from SQL to GAQL

Convert your query statements and field names when migrating from SQL to GAQL. 

#### Query statements

If you use SQL query in the copy activity source or the lookup activity that refers to the legacy Google Ads linked service, you need to update them to GAQL query.

In contrast to SQL, the query in GAQL is made up of six kinds of clauses:

- `SELECT`
- `FROM`
- `WHERE`
- `ORDER BY`
- `LIMIT`
- `PARAMETERS`

Go to [Google Ads Query Language Grammar](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/query/grammar) for the introduction of GAQL.

Take the following SQL statement as an example:

`SELECT *|FieldName FROM ResourceName WHERE FieldName Operator Value`

You can follow the guidance below to convert the SQL statement to the corresponding GAQL statement:

1. If `*` (asterisk) is used after the `SELECT` clause, then you need to specify all the required fields in place of the asterisk as GAQL doesn't support `SELECT *`. Go to this [article](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v14/ad_group) to see all the selectable fields in the specific resource.
2. If the field name is used after the `SELECT` clause, then you need to convert the name to the corresponding field name in GAQL as they have different naming conventions. For example, the field name `campaign_id` in SQL query statement should be converted to `campaign.id` in GAQL. See [Field name](#field-name) for more details on field name conversion.
3. The resource name can be left as it is unless its case is inconsistent with what is specified [here](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v14/overview#list-of-all-resources).
4. `WHERE` clause should be updated according to the [GAQL grammar](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/query/grammar) as the operators supported by GAQL are not consistent with SQL, and field name should also be converted as described in the second point.

Here are two very useful tools offered by Google and they are highly recommended when building the corresponding GAQL query statements:

- [Interactive GAQL query builder](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v14/overview_query_builder) 
- [GAQL query validator](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v14/query_validator) 

#### Field name

The field name used in SQL is not aligned with GAQL. You also need to learn the conversion rules from field names in SQL to field names in GAQL. The conversion rule can be summarized as follows:

- If the field name belongs to a resource, the underscore (`_`) in SQL will be changed to dot (`.`) in GAQL. And for the words between the dot, the camelCase type statement used in SQL will be changed to standalone words with added underscores in between. The first string of type PascalCase in SQL will be changed to the corresponding resource name in GAQL.

- If the field name belongs to segments or metrics, the prefix `segments.` or `metrics.` should be added in GAQL, then follow the same rule as described in the first point to convert the name.

Here are the concrete examples of the field name conversion:

| Category | Field names in SQL | Field names in GAQL | 
|---------| --------|---------| 
| Resource fields | `Campaign_startDate` | `campaign.start_date` | 
| Resource fields | `Customer_conversionTrackingSetting_conversionTrackingStatus` | `customer.conversion_tracking_setting.conversion_tracking_status` | 
| Segments | `DayOfWeek` | `segments.day_of_week` | 
| Metrics | `VideoViews` | `metrics.video_views` |

|Selecting a table in a dataset is not supported.|Support selecting a table in a dataset and querying the table in copy activities.|
|Support GAQL syntax as the query language.|Support SQL syntax as the query language.|
|The output column names are the same as the field names defined in Google Ads.|The output column names don't match the field names defined in Google Ads.|
|The following mappings are used from Google Ads data types to interim data types used by the service internally.<br><br>float -> float <br>int32 -> int <br>int64 -> long |The following mappings are used from Google Ads data types to interim data types used by the service internally. <br><br>float -> string <br>int32 -> string <br>int64 -> string |

## Upgrade Google AdWords connector to Google Ads connector 

Upgrade your Google AdWords linked service to the latest Google Ads linked service following the steps below:

1. Select **Recommended** as driver version to create a new Google Ads linked service and configure it by referring to [Linked service properties](connector-google-adwords.md#linked-service-properties). 
1. Update your pipelines that refer to the legacy Google AdWords linked service. Considering that the Google Ads linked service only supports using query to copy data, so:
    1. If your pipeline is directly retrieving data from the report of Google AdWords, find the corresponding resource name of Google Ads in the table below and use this [tool](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v15/overview_query_builder) to build the query.
