# Copy data from HubSpot using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from HubSpot. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The HubSpot connector version 2.0 (Preview) provides improved native HubSpot support. If you are using HubSpot connector version 1.0 in your solution, please [upgrade the HubSpot connector](#upgrade-the-hubspot-connector-from-version-10-to-version-20) before **October 22, 2025**. Refer to this [section](#hubspot-connector-lifecycle-and-upgrade) for details on the difference between version 2.0 (Preview) and version 1.0.

## Supported capabilities

This HubSpot connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks , see the [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores) table.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

The connector supports the Windows versions in this [article](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md#prerequisites).

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

## Create a linked service to HubSpot using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to HubSpot in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Create a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

## Data type mapping for HubSpot

When you copy data from HubSpot, the following mappings apply from HubSpot's data types to the internal data types used by the service. To learn about how the copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink, see [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md).

| HubSpot data type    | Interim service data type (for version 2.0 (Preview)) | Interim service data type (for version 1.0) |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| bool                | Boolean                                               | Boolean                                     |

## HubSpot connector lifecycle and upgrade

The following table shows the release stage and change logs for different versions of the HubSpot connector:

| Version  | Release stage | Change log |  
| :----------- | :------- |:------- |
| Version 1.0 | End of support announced | / |  
| Version 2.0 (Preview)| Public Preview |• The `tableName` value is `<HubSpot Category>.<Sub Category>.<Object Name>`, for example: `CRM.Commerce.Payments`. <br><br>• date is read as DateTime data type. <br><br>• object is read as String data type.<br><br>•`useEncryptedEndpoints`, `useHostVerification`, `usePeerVerification` are not supported in the linked service. <br><br>  • `query` is not supported. |

### <a name="upgrade-the-hubspot-connector-from-version-10-to-version-20"></a> Upgrade the HubSpot connector from version 1.0 to version 2.0 (Preview)

1. In **Edit linked service** page, select version 2.0 (Preview) and configure the linked service by referring to [Linked service properties version 2.0 (Preview)](#version-20).

2. The data type mapping for the HubSpot linked service version 2.0 (Preview) is different from that for the version 1.0. To learn the latest data type mapping, see [Data type mapping for HubSpot](#data-type-mapping-for-hubspot).

3. `query` is only supported in version 1.0. You should use the `tableName` instead of `query` in version 2.0 (Preview).
