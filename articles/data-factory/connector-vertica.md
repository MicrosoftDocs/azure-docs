# Copy data from Vertica using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from Vertica. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This Vertica connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; (only for version 1.0) &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; (only for version 1.0) &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

For version 2.0 (Preview), you need to [install a Vertica ODBC driver](#install-vertica-odbc-driver-for-the-version-20-preview) manually. For version 1.0, the service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver. 

## Prerequisites

If your data store is located inside an on-premises network, an Azure virtual network, or Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, you need to configure a [self-hosted integration runtime](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md) to connect to it. If you use the version 2.0 (Preview), your self-hosted integration runtime version should be 5.44.8984.1 or above.

For more information about the network security mechanisms and options supported by Data Factory, see [Data access strategies](data-access-strategies.md).

### For version 1.0

If your data store is a managed cloud data service, you can use the Azure Integration Runtime. If the access is restricted to IPs that are approved in the firewall rules, you can add [Azure Integration Runtime IPs](azure-integration-runtime-ip-addresses.md) to the allowlist.

 You can also use the [managed virtual network integration runtime](tutorial-managed-virtual-network-on-premise-sql-server.md) feature in Azure Data Factory to access the on-premises network without installing and configuring a self-hosted integration runtime.


### Install Vertica ODBC driver for the version 2.0 (Preview)

To use Vertica connector with version 2.0 (Preview), install the Vertica ODBC driver on the machine running the self-hosted Integration runtime by following these steps:

1. Download the Vertica client setup for ODBC driver from [Client Drivers | OpenText™ Vertica™](https://www.vertica.com/download/vertica/client-drivers/). Take Windows system setup as an example:

1. Open the downloaded .exe to begin the installation process. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/connector-vertica/install.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the installation process.":::

1. Select **ODBC driver** under Vertica Component List, then select **Next** to start the installation.

   :::image type="content" source="media/connector-vertica/select-odbc-driver.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting ODBC driver.":::

1. After the installation process is successfully completed, you can go to  Start -> ODBC Data Source Administrator to confirm the successful installation.

## Getting started

You can create a pipeline with copy activity using .NET SDK, Python SDK, Azure PowerShell, REST API, or Azure Resource Manager template. See [Copy activity tutorial](quickstart-create-data-factory-dot-net.md) for step-by-step instructions to create a pipeline with a copy activity.

## Create a linked service to Vertica using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to Vertica in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for Vertica and select the Vertica connector.

   :::image type="content" source="media/connector-vertica/vertica-connector.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Vertica connector.":::    


1. Configure the service details, test the connection, and create the new linked service.

```

## Lookup activity properties

To learn details about the properties, check [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md).

## Upgrade the Vertica version 

Here are steps that help you upgrade your Vertica version: 

1. Install a Vertica ODBC driver by following the steps in [Prerequisites](#install-vertica-odbc-driver-for-the-version-20-preview). 
1. In **Edit linked service page**, select **2.0 (Preview)** under **Version** and configure the linked service by referring to [Linked service properties](#linked-service-properties). 
1. Apply a self-hosted integration runtime with version 5.44.8984.1 or above. Azure integration runtime is not supported by version 2.0 (Preview).
