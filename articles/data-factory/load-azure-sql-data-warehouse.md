# Load data into Azure Synapse Analytics using Azure Data Factory or a Synapse pipeline

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

[Azure Synapse Analytics](../synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-overview-what-is.md) is a cloud-based, scale-out database that's capable of processing massive volumes of data, both relational and non-relational. Azure Synapse Analytics is built on the massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture that's optimized for enterprise data warehouse workloads. It offers cloud elasticity with the flexibility to scale storage and compute independently.

Getting started with Azure Synapse Analytics is now easier than ever. Azure Data Factory and  its equivalent pipelines feature within Azure Synapse itself provide a fully managed cloud-based data integration service. You can use the service to populate an Azure Synapse Analytics with data from your existing system and save time when building your analytics solutions.

Azure Data Factory and Synapse pipelines offer the following benefits for loading data into Azure Synapse Analytics:

* **Easy to set up**: An intuitive 5-step wizard with no scripting required.
* **Rich data store support**: Built-in support for a rich set of on-premises and cloud-based data stores. For a detailed list, see the table of [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats).
* **Secure and compliant**: Data is transferred over HTTPS or ExpressRoute. The global service presence ensures that your data never leaves the geographical boundary.
* **Unparalleled performance by using PolyBase**: Polybase is the most efficient way to move data into Azure Synapse Analytics. Use the staging blob feature to achieve high load speeds from all types of data stores, including Azure Blob storage and Data Lake Store. (Polybase supports Azure Blob storage and Azure Data Lake Store by default.) For details, see [Copy activity performance](copy-activity-performance.md).

This article shows you how to use the Copy Data tool to _load data from Azure SQL Database into Azure Synapse Analytics_. You can follow similar steps to copy data from other types of data stores.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information, see [Copy data to or from Azure Synapse Analytics](connector-azure-sql-data-warehouse.md).

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* Azure Synapse Analytics: The data warehouse holds the data that's copied over from the SQL database. If you don't have an Azure Synapse Analytics, see the instructions in [Create an Azure Synapse Analytics](../synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/load-data-from-azure-blob-storage-using-copy.md).
* Azure SQL Database: This tutorial copies data from the Adventure Works LT sample dataset in Azure SQL Database. You can create this sample database in SQL Database by following the instructions in [Create a sample database in Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart).
* Azure storage account: Azure Storage is used as the _staging_ blob in the bulk copy operation. If you don't have an Azure storage account, see the instructions in [Create a storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md).

## Create a data factory

1. If you have not created your data factory yet, follow the steps in [Quickstart: Create a data factory by using the Azure portal and Azure Data Factory Studio](quickstart-create-data-factory-portal.md) to create one.  After creating it, browse to the data factory in the Azure portal.
