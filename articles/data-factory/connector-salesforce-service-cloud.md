# Copy data from and to Salesforce Service Cloud V2 using Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse Analytics


[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse pipelines to copy data from and to Salesforce Service Cloud. It builds on the [Copy Activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of the copy activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [Salesforce Service Cloud V2 connector](connector-salesforce-service-cloud.md) provides improved native Salesforce Service Cloud support. If you are using the [Salesforce Service Cloud V1 connector](connector-salesforce-service-cloud-legacy.md) in your solution, you are recommended to [upgrade your Salesforce Service Cloud connector](#upgrade-the-salesforce-service-cloud-linked-service) at your earliest convenience. Refer to this [section](#differences-between-salesforce-service-cloud-and-salesforce-service-cloud-legacy) for details on the difference between V2 and V1. 

## Supported capabilities

This Salesforce Service Cloud connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/sink)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources or sinks, see the [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores) table.

Specifically, this Salesforce Service Cloud connector supports:

- Salesforce Developer, Professional, Enterprise, or Unlimited editions.
- Copying data from and to custom domain (Custom domain can be configured in both production and sandbox environments).

You can explicitly set the API version used to read/write data via [`apiVersion` property](#linked-service-properties) in linked service. When copying data to Salesforce Service Cloud, the connector uses BULK API 2.0.


## Prerequisites

- API permission must be enabled in Salesforce.
- You need configure the Connected Apps in Salesforce portal referring to this [official doc](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_client_credentials_setup.htm&type=5) or our step by step guideline in the recommendation in this [article](connector-troubleshoot-salesforce.md#error-code-salesforceoauth2clientcredentialfailure).

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > - The execution user must have the API Only permission.
    > - Access Token expire time could be changed through session policies instead of the refresh token.

## Salesforce Bulk API 2.0 Limits

We use Salesforce Bulk API 2.0 to query and ingest data. In Bulk API 2.0, batches are created for you automatically. You can submit up to **15,000** batches per rolling 24-hour period. If batches exceed the limit, you will see failures.

In Bulk API 2.0, only ingest jobs consume batches. Query jobs don't. For details, see [How Requests Are Processed in the Bulk API 2.0 Developer Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/how_requests_are_processed.htm).

For more information, see the "General Limits" section in [Salesforce developer limits](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet.meta/salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet/salesforce_app_limits_platform_bulkapi.htm).

| writeBatchSize | The row count of data written to Salesforce Service Cloud in each batch. Suggest set this value from 10,000 to 200,000. Too few rows in each batch will reduce the copy performance. Too many rows in each batch may cause API timeout. | No (default is 100,000) |
| ignoreNullValues | Indicates whether to ignore NULL values from input data during a write operation.<br/>Allowed values are **true** and **false**.<br>- **True**: Leave the data in the destination object unchanged when you do an upsert or update operation. Insert a defined default value when you do an insert operation.<br/>- **False**: Update the data in the destination object to NULL when you do an upsert or update operation. Insert a NULL value when you do an insert operation. | No (default is false) |
| maxConcurrentConnections |The upper limit of concurrent connections established to the data store during the activity run. Specify a value only when you want to limit concurrent connections.| No |

                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "<source type>"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "SalesforceServiceCloudV2Sink",
                "writeBehavior": "Upsert",

                "ignoreNullValues": true
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Data type mapping for Salesforce Service Cloud

When you copy data from Salesforce Service Cloud, the following mappings are used from Salesforce Service Cloud data types to interim data types within the service internally. To learn about how the copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink, see [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md).

| Salesforce Service Cloud data type | Service interim data type |
|:--- |:--- |
| Auto Number |String |
| Checkbox |Boolean |
| Currency |Decimal |
| Date |DateTime |
| Date/Time |DateTime |
| Email |String |
| ID |String |
| Lookup Relationship |String |
| Multi-Select Picklist |String |
| Number |Decimal |
| Percent |Decimal |
| Phone |String |
| Picklist |String |
| Text |String |
| Text Area |String |
| Text Area (Long) |String |
| Text Area (Rich) |String |
| Text (Encrypted) |String |
| URL |String |

> [!Note]
> Salesforce Service Cloud Number type is mapping to Decimal type in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse pipelines as a service interim data type. Decimal type honors the defined precision and scale. For data whose decimal places exceeds the defined scale, its value will be rounded off in preview data and copy. To avoid getting such precision loss in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse pipelines, consider increasing the decimal places to a reasonably large value in **Custom Field Definition Edit** page of Salesforce Service Cloud. 

## Lookup activity properties

To learn details about the properties, check [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md).

## <a name="upgrade-the-salesforce-service-cloud-linked-service"></a> Upgrade the Salesforce Service Cloud connector

Here are steps that help you upgrade your Salesforce Service Cloud connector:

1. Configure the connected apps in Salesforce portal by referring to [Prerequisites](connector-salesforce-service-cloud.md#prerequisites).

1. Create a new Salesforce Service Cloud linked service and configure it by referring to [Linked service properties](connector-salesforce-service-cloud.md#linked-service-properties).  

1. If you use SQL query in the copy activity source or the lookup activity that refers to the V1 linked service, you need to convert them to the SOQL query. Learn more about SOQL query from [Salesforce Service Cloud as a source type](connector-salesforce-service-cloud.md#salesforce-service-cloud-as-a-source-type) and [Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL)](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql.htm).

1. readBehavior is replaced with includeDeletedObjects in the copy activity source or the lookup activity. For the detailed configuration, see [Salesforce Service Cloud as a source type](connector-salesforce-service-cloud.md#salesforce-service-cloud-as-a-source-type).

## <a name="differences-between-salesforce-service-cloud-and-salesforce-service-cloud-legacy"></a> Differences between Salesforce Service Cloud V2 and V1

The Salesforce Service Cloud V2 connector offers new functionalities and is compatible with most features of Salesforce Service Cloud V1 connector. The table below shows the feature differences between V2 and V1.

|Salesforce Service Cloud V2 |Salesforce Service Cloud V1|
|:---|:---|
|Support SOQL within [Salesforce Bulk API 2.0](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/queries.htm#SOQL%20Considerations). <br>For SOQL queries:  <br>• GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, OFFSET, or TYPEOF clauses aren't supported. <br>• Aggregate Functions such as COUNT() aren't supported, you can use Salesforce reports to implement them. <br>• Date functions in GROUP BY clauses aren't supported, but they're supported in the WHERE clause. <br>• Compound address fields or compound geolocation fields aren't supported. As an alternative, query the individual components of compound fields.  <br>• Parent-to-child relationship queries aren't supported, whereas child-to-parent relationship queries are supported. |Support both SQL and SOQL syntax. |
| Objects that contain binary fields aren't supported when specifying query. | Objects that contain binary fields are supported when specifying query.|
| Support objects within Bulk API when specifying query. | Support objects that are unsupported with Bulk API when specifying query.|
|Support report by selecting a report ID.|Support report query syntax, like `{call "<report name>"}`.|
