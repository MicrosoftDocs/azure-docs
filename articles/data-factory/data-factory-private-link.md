# Azure Private Link for Azure Data Factory

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-xxx-md.md)]

By using Azure Private Link, you can connect to various platform as a service (PaaS) deployments in Azure via a private endpoint. A private endpoint is a private IP address within a specific virtual network and subnet. For a list of PaaS deployments that support Private Link functionality, see [Private Link documentation](../private-link/index.yml).

## Secure communication between customer networks and Data Factory

You can set up an Azure virtual network as a logical representation of your network in the cloud. Doing so provides the following benefits:

* You help protect your Azure resources from attacks in public networks.
* You let the networks and data factory securely communicate with each other.

You can also connect an on-premises network to your virtual network. Set up an Internet Protocol security VPN connection, which is a site-to-site connection. Or set up an Azure ExpressRoute connection. which is a private peering connection.

You can also install a self-hosted integration runtime (IR) on an on-premises machine or a virtual machine in the virtual network. Doing so lets you:

* Run copy activities between a cloud data store and a data store in a private network.
* Dispatch transform activities against compute resources in an on-premises network or an Azure virtual network.

Several communication channels are required between Azure Data Factory and the customer virtual network, as shown in the following table:

| Domain | Port | Description |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- |
| `adf.azure.com` | 443 | The Data Factory portal is required by Data Factory authoring and monitoring. |
| `*.{region}.datafactory.azure.net` | 443 | Required by the self-hosted IR to connect to Data Factory. |
| `*.servicebus.windows.net` | 443 | Required by the self-hosted IR for interactive authoring. |
| `download.microsoft.com` | 443 | Required by the self-hosted IR for downloading the updates. |

> [!NOTE]
> Disabling public network access applies only to the self-hosted IR, not to Azure IR and SQL Server Integration Services IR.

The communications to Data Factory go through Private Link and help provide secure private connectivity.

Enabling Private Link for each of the preceding communication channels offers the following functionality:

- **Supported**:
   - You can author and monitor in the Data Factory portal from your virtual network, even if you block all outbound communications. If you create a private endpoint for the portal, others can still access the Data Factory portal through the public network.
   - The command communications between the self-hosted IR and Data Factory can be performed securely in a private network environment. The traffic between the self-hosted IR and Data Factory goes through Private Link.
- **Not currently supported**:
   - Interactive authoring that uses a self-hosted IR, such as test connection, browse folder list and table list, get schema, and preview data, goes through Private Link.
   Please notice that the traffic goes through private link if the self-contained interactive authoring is enabled. See [Self-contained Interactive Authoring](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md#self-contained-interactive-authoring-preview).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Both "Get IP" and "Send log" are not supported when self-contained interactive authoring is enabled.

   - The new version of the self-hosted IR that can be automatically downloaded from Microsoft Download Center if you enable auto-update isn't supported at this time.

   For functionality that isn't currently supported, you need to configure the previously mentioned domain and port in the virtual network or your corporate firewall.

   Connecting to Data Factory via private endpoint is only applicable to self-hosted IR in Data Factory. It isn't supported for Azure Synapse Analytics.

> [!WARNING]
> If you enable Private Link Data Factory and block public access at the same time, store your credentials in Azure Key Vault to ensure they're secure.

## Configure private endpoint for communication between self-hosted IR and Data Factory

This section describes how to configure the private endpoint for communication between self-hosted IR and Data Factory.

### Create a private endpoint and set up a private link for Data Factory

The private endpoint is created in your virtual network for the communication between self-hosted IR and Data Factory. Follow the steps in [Set up a private endpoint link for Data Factory](#set-up-a-private-endpoint-link-for-data-factory).

### Make sure the DNS configuration is correct

Follow the instructions in [DNS changes for private endpoints](#dns-changes-for-private-endpoints) to check or configure your DNS settings.

### Put FQDNs of Azure Relay and Download Center into the allowed list of your firewall

If your self-hosted IR is installed on the virtual machine in your virtual network, allow outbound traffic to below FQDNs in the NSG of your virtual network.

If your self-hosted IR is installed on the machine in your on-premises environment, allow outbound traffic to below FQDNs in the firewall of your on-premises environment and NSG of your virtual network.

| Domain | Port | Description |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- |
| `*.servicebus.windows.net` | 443 | Required by the self-hosted IR for interactive authoring |
| `download.microsoft.com` | 443 | Required by the self-hosted IR for downloading the updates |

If you don't allow the preceding outbound traffic in the firewall and NSG, self-hosted IR is shown with a **Limited** status. But you can still use it to execute activities. Only interactive authoring and auto-update don't work.

> [!NOTE]
> If one data factory (shared) has a self-hosted IR and the self-hosted IR is shared with other data factories (linked), you only need to create a private endpoint for the shared data factory. Other linked data factories can leverage this private link for the communications between self-hosted IR and Data Factory.

> [!NOTE]
> We do not currently support establishing a private link between a self-hosted integration runtime and a Synapse Analytics workspace. And the self-hosted integration runtime can still communicate with Synapse even when data exfiltration protection is enabled on the Synapse workspace.

## DNS changes for private endpoints

When you create a private endpoint, the DNS CNAME resource record for the data factory is updated to an alias in a subdomain with the prefix *privatelink*. By default, we also create a [private DNS zone](../dns/private-dns-overview.md), corresponding to the *privatelink* subdomain, with the DNS A resource records for the private endpoints.

When you resolve the data factory endpoint URL from outside the virtual network with the private endpoint, it resolves to the public endpoint of Data Factory. When resolved from the virtual network hosting the private endpoint, the storage endpoint URL resolves to the private endpoint's IP address.

For the preceding illustrated example, the DNS resource records for the data factory called DataFactoryA, when resolved from outside the virtual network hosting the private endpoint, will be:

| Name | Type | Value |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- |
| DataFactoryA.{region}.datafactory.azure.net |	CNAME	| < Data Factory public endpoint > |
| < Data Factory public endpoint >	| A | < Data Factory public IP address > |

The DNS resource records for DataFactoryA, when resolved in the virtual network hosting the private endpoint, will be:

| Name | Type | Value |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- |
| DataFactoryA.{region}.datafactory.azure.net | CNAME	| DataFactoryA.{region}.privatelink.datafactory.azure.net |
| DataFactoryA.{region}.privatelink.datafactory.azure.net	| A | < private endpoint IP address > |

If you're using a custom DNS server on your network, clients must be able to resolve the FQDN for the data factory endpoint to the private endpoint IP address. You should configure your DNS server to delegate your Private Link subdomain to the private DNS zone for the virtual network. Or you can configure the A records for DataFactoryA.{region}.datafactory.azure.net with the private endpoint IP address.

- [DNS configuration for private endpoints](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md#dns-configuration)

 > [!NOTE]
   > Currently, there's only one Data Factory portal endpoint, so there's only one private endpoint for the portal in a DNS zone. Attempting to create a second or subsequent portal private endpoint overwrites the previously created private DNS entry for portal.

## Set up a private endpoint link for Data Factory

In this section, you'll set up a private endpoint link for Data Factory.

You can choose whether to connect your self-hosted IR to Data Factory by selecting **Public endpoint** or **Private endpoint** during the Data Factory creation step, shown here:

:::image type="content" source="./media/data-factory-private-link/disable-public-access-shir.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows blocking public access of self-hosted IR.":::

You can change the selection any time after creation from the Data Factory portal page on the **Networking** pane. After you enable **Private endpoint** there, you must also add a private endpoint to the data factory.

A private endpoint requires a virtual network and subnet for the link. In this example, a virtual machine within the subnet is used to run the self-hosted IR, which connects via the private endpoint link.

### Create a virtual network

If you don't have an existing virtual network to use with your private endpoint link, you must create one and assign a subnet.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In the upper-left corner of the screen, select **Create a resource** > **Networking** > **Virtual network** or search for **Virtual network** in the search box.

1. In **Create virtual network**, enter or select this information on the **Basics** tab:

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. Select **Create**.

## Restrict access for Data Factory resources by using Private Link

If you want to restrict access for Data Factory resources in your subscriptions by Private Link, follow the steps in [Use portal to create a private link for managing Azure resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/create-private-link-access-portal.md?source=docs).

## Known issue

You're unable to access each PaaS resource when both sides are exposed to Private Link and a private endpoint. This issue is a known limitation of Private Link and private endpoints.

For example, customer A is using a private link to access the portal of data factory A in virtual network A. When data factory A doesn't block public access, customer B can access the portal of data factory A in virtual network B via public. But when customer B creates a private endpoint against data factory B in virtual network B, then customer B can't access data factory A via public in virtual network B anymore.
