# Copy data to or from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 by using Azure Data Factory
> [!div class="op_single_selector" title1="Select the version of Data Factory service you are using:"]
> * [Version 1](v1/data-factory-azure-datalake-connector.md)
> * [Current version](connector-azure-data-lake-store.md)

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data to and from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 (previously known as Azure Data Lake Store). It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

You can copy data from any supported source data store to Azure Data Lake Store, or copy data from Azure Data Lake Store to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources or sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Specifically, this Azure Data Lake Store connector supports:

- Copying files using **service principal** or **managed identities for Azure resources** authentication.
- Copying files as-is, or parsing/generating files with the [supported file formats and compression codecs](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you copy data using Self-hosted Integration Runtime, configure the corporate firewall to allow outbound traffic to `<ADLS account name>.azuredatalakestore.net` and `login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/oauth2/token` on port 443. The latter is Azure Security Token Service (STS) that IR need communicate with to get access token.

## Get started

> [!TIP]
> For a walkthrough of using Azure Data Lake Store connector, see [Load data into Azure Data Lake Store](load-azure-data-lake-store.md).

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

>[!NOTE]
>When you use Copy Data Tool to author copy pipeline or use ADF UI to perform testing connection/navigating folders during authoring, it requires the permission of service principal or MSI being granted at root level. While, copy activity execution can work as long as the permission is granted to the data to be copied. You may skip the authoring operations if you need limit the permission.

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Azure Data lake Store.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Azure Data Lake Store linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to **AzureDataLakeStore**. | Yes |
| dataLakeStoreUri | Information about the Azure Data Lake Store account. This information takes one of the following formats: `https://[accountname].azuredatalakestore.net/webhdfs/v1` or `adl://[accountname].azuredatalakestore.net/`. | Yes |
| subscriptionId | Azure subscription ID to which the Data Lake Store account belongs. | Required for sink |
| resourceGroupName | Azure resource group name to which the Data Lake Store account belongs. | Required for sink |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. You can use Azure Integration Runtime or Self-hosted Integration Runtime (if your data store is located in private network). If not specified, it uses the default Azure Integration Runtime. |No |

Refer to the following sections on more properties and JSON samples for different authentication types respectively:

- [Using service principal authentication](#using-service-principal-authentication)
- [Using managed identities for Azure resources authentication](#managed-identity)

### Using service principal authentication

To use service principal authentication, register an application entity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and grant it access to Data Lake Store. For detailed steps, see [Service-to-service authentication](../data-lake-store/data-lake-store-authenticate-using-active-directory.md). Make note of the following values, which you use to define the linked service:

- Application ID
- Application key
- Tenant ID

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you grant the service principal proper permission in Azure Data Lake Store:
>- **As source**, in Data explorer -> Access, grant at least **Read + Execute** permission to list and copy the files in folder/subfolders, or **Read** permission to copy a single file; and choose to add to **This folder and all children** for recursive and add as **an access permission and a default permission entry**. No requirement on account level access control (IAM).
>- **As sink**, in Data explorer -> Access, grant at least **Write + Execute** permission to create child items in the folder, and choose to add to **This folder and all children** for recursive and add as **an access permission and a default permission entry**. If you use Azure IR to copy (both source and sink are in cloud), in Access control (IAM), grant at least **Reader** role in order to let Data Factory detect Data Lake Store's region. If you want to avoid this IAM role, explicitly [create an Azure IR](create-azure-integration-runtime.md#create-azure-ir) with the location of your Data Lake Store, and associate in the Data Lake Store linked service as the following example.

The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| servicePrincipalId | Specify the application's client ID. | Yes |
| servicePrincipalKey | Specify the application's key. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| tenant | Specify the tenant information (domain name or tenant ID) under which your application resides. You can retrieve it by hovering the mouse in the upper-right corner of the Azure portal. | Yes |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureDataLakeStoreLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzureDataLakeStore",
        "typeProperties": {
            "dataLakeStoreUri": "https://<accountname>.azuredatalakestore.net/webhdfs/v1",
            "servicePrincipalId": "<service principal id>",
            "servicePrincipalKey": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<service principal key>"
            },
            "tenant": "<tenant info, e.g. microsoft.onmicrosoft.com>",
            "subscriptionId": "<subscription of ADLS>",
            "resourceGroupName": "<resource group of ADLS>"
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

### <a name="managed-identity"></a> Using managed identities for Azure resources authentication

A data factory can be associated with a [managed identity for Azure resources](data-factory-service-identity.md), which represents this specific data factory. You can directly use this service identity for Data Lake Store authentication similar to using your own service principal. It allows this designated factory to access and copy data from/to your Data Lake Store.

To use managed identities for Azure resources authentication:

1. [Retrieve data factory service identity](data-factory-service-identity.md#retrieve-service-identity) by copying the value of "SERVICE IDENTITY APPLICATION ID" generated along with your factory.
2. Grant the service identity access to Data Lake Store the same way you do for service principal following below notes.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you grant the data factory service identity proper permission in Azure Data Lake Store:
>- **As source**, in Data explorer -> Access, grant at least **Read + Execute** permission to list and copy the files in folder/subfolders, or **Read** permission to copy a single file; and choose to add to **This folder and all children** for recursive and add as **an access permission and a default permission entry**. No requirement on account level access control (IAM).
>- **As sink**, in Data explorer -> Access, grant at least **Write + Execute** permission to create child items in the folder, and choose to add to **This folder and all children** for recursive and add as **an access permission and a default permission entry**. If you use Azure IR to copy (both source and sink are in cloud), in Access control (IAM), grant at least **Reader** role in order to let Data Factory detect Data Lake Store's region. If you want to avoid this IAM role, explicitly [create an Azure IR](create-azure-integration-runtime.md#create-azure-ir) with the location of your Data Lake Store, and associate in the Data Lake Store linked service as the following example.

In Azure Data Factory, you don't need to specify any properties besides the general Data Lake Store information in linked service.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "AzureDataLakeStoreLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzureDataLakeStore",
        "typeProperties": {
            "dataLakeStoreUri": "https://<accountname>.azuredatalakestore.net/webhdfs/v1",
            "subscriptionId": "<subscription of ADLS>",
            "resourceGroupName": "<resource group of ADLS>"
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the datasets article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Azure Data Lake Store dataset.

To copy data to/from Azure Data Lake Store, set the type property of the dataset to **AzureDataLakeStoreFile**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **AzureDataLakeStoreFile** |Yes |
| folderPath | Path to the folder in the Data Lake Store. Wildcard filter is not supported. Example: rootfolder/subfolder/ |Yes |
| fileName | **Name or wildcard filter** for the file(s) under the specified "folderPath". If you don't specify a value for this property, the dataset points to all files in the folder. <br/><br/>For filter, allowed wildcards are: `*` (matches zero or more characters) and `?` (matches zero or single character).<br/>- Example 1: `"fileName": "*.csv"`<br/>- Example 2: `"fileName": "???20180427.txt"`<br/>Use `^` to escape if your actual file name has wildcard or this escape char inside.<br/><br/>When fileName isn't specified for an output dataset and **preserveHierarchy** isn't specified in the activity sink, the copy activity automatically generates the file name with the following format: "*Data.[activity run id GUID].[GUID if FlattenHierarchy].[format if configured].[compression if configured]*". An example is "Data.0a405f8a-93ff-4c6f-b3be-f69616f1df7a.txt.gz". |No |
| format | If you want to **copy files as-is** between file-based stores (binary copy), skip the format section in both input and output dataset definitions.<br/><br/>If you want to parse or generate files with a specific format, the following file format types are supported: **TextFormat**, **JsonFormat**, **AvroFormat**, **OrcFormat**, **ParquetFormat**. Set the **type** property under format to one of these values. For more information, see [Text Format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md#text-format), [Json Format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md#json-format), [Avro Format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md#avro-format), [Orc Format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md#orc-format), and [Parquet Format](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md#parquet-format) sections. |No (only for binary copy scenario) |
| compression | Specify the type and level of compression for the data. For more information, see [Supported file formats and compression codecs](supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs.md#compression-support).<br/>Supported types are: **GZip**, **Deflate**, **BZip2**, and **ZipDeflate**.<br/>Supported levels are: **Optimal** and **Fastest**. |No |

>[!TIP]
>To copy all files under a folder, specify **folderPath** only.<br>To copy a single file with a given name, specify **folderPath** with folder part and **fileName** with file name.<br>To copy a subset of files under a folder, specify **folderPath** with folder part and **fileName** with wildcard filter. 

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "ADLSDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "AzureDataLakeStoreFile",
        "linkedServiceName":{
            "referenceName": "<ADLS linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "typeProperties": {
            "folderPath": "datalake/myfolder/",
            "fileName": "myfile.csv.gz",
            "format": {
                "type": "TextFormat",
                "columnDelimiter": ",",
                "rowDelimiter": "\n"
            },
            "compression": {
                "type": "GZip",
                "level": "Optimal"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Azure Data Lake source and sink.

### Azure Data Lake Store as source

To copy data from Azure Data Lake Store, set the source type in the copy activity to **AzureDataLakeStoreSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **AzureDataLakeStoreSource** |Yes |
| recursive | Indicates whether the data is read recursively from the sub folders or only from the specified folder. Note when recursive is set to true and sink is file-based store, empty folder/sub-folder will not be copied/created at sink.<br/>Allowed values are: **true** (default), **false** | No |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromADLS",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<ADLS input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "AzureDataLakeStoreSource",
                "recursive": true
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

### Azure Data Lake Store as sink

To copy data to Azure Data Lake Store, set the sink type in the copy activity to **AzureDataLakeStoreSink**. The following properties are supported in the **sink** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity sink must be set to: **AzureDataLakeStoreSink** |Yes |
| copyBehavior | Defines the copy behavior when the source is files from file-based data store.<br/><br/>Allowed values are:<br/><b>- PreserveHierarchy (default)</b>: preserves the file hierarchy in the target folder. The relative path of source file to source folder is identical to the relative path of target file to target folder.<br/><b>- FlattenHierarchy</b>: all files from the source folder are in the first level of target folder. The target files have auto generated name. <br/><b>- MergeFiles</b>: merges all files from the source folder to one file. If the File/Blob Name is specified, the merged file name would be the specified name; otherwise, would be auto-generated file name. | No |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyToADLS",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<ADLS output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "<source type>"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "AzureDataLakeStoreSink",
                "copyBehavior": "PreserveHierarchy"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

### recursive and copyBehavior examples

This section describes the resulting behavior of the Copy operation for different combinations of recursive and copyBehavior values.
