# Copy data from Netezza by using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipelines to copy data from Netezza. The article builds on [Copy Activity](copy-activity-overview.md), which presents a general overview of Copy Activity.

>[!TIP]
>For data migration scenario from Netezza to Azure, learn more from [Migrate data from on-premises Netezza server to Azure](data-migration-guidance-netezza-azure-sqldw.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Netezza connector version 2.0 provides improved native Netezza support. If you are using the Netezza connector version 1.0 in your solution, please [upgrade your Netezza connector](#upgrade-the-netezza-connector) before **September 30, 2025**. Refer to this [section](#differences-between-netezza-version-20-and-version-10) for details on the difference between version 2.0 and version 1.0.

## Supported capabilities

This Netezza connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; (only for version 1.0) &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; (only for version 1.0) &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that Copy Activity supports as sources and sinks, see [Supported data stores and formats](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats).

This Netezza connector supports:

- Parallel copying from source. See the [Parallel copy from Netezza](#parallel-copy-from-netezza) section for details.
- Netezza Performance Server version 11.
- Windows versions in this [article](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md#prerequisites).

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity. You don't need to manually install any driver to use this connector.

For version 2.0, you need to [install a IBM Netezza ODBC driver](#install-netezza-odbc-driver-for-the-version-20) manually. For version 1.0, the service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity. You don't need to manually install any driver to use this connector.

## Prerequisites

If your data store is located inside an on-premises network, an Azure virtual network, or Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, you need to configure a [self-hosted integration runtime](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md) to connect to it.

For more information about the network security mechanisms and options supported by Data Factory, see [Data access strategies](data-access-strategies.md).

### For version 1.0

If your data store is a managed cloud data service, you can use the Azure Integration Runtime. If the access is restricted to IPs that are approved in the firewall rules, you can add [Azure Integration Runtime IPs](azure-integration-runtime-ip-addresses.md) to the allow list. 

You can also use the [managed virtual network integration runtime](tutorial-managed-virtual-network-on-premise-sql-server.md) feature in Azure Data Factory to access the on-premises network without installing and configuring a self-hosted integration runtime.

### <a name="install-netezza-odbc-driver-for-the-version-20"></a> Install Netezza ODBC driver for the version 2.0

To use Netezza connector with version 2.0, [install the IBM Netezza ODBC driver](https://knowledge.informatica.com/s/article/HOW-TO-Download-the-Netezza-ODBC-driver?language=en_US) version 11.02.02 or higher on the machine running the self-hosted Integration runtime.

## Get started

You can create a pipeline that uses a copy activity by using the .NET SDK, the Python SDK, Azure PowerShell, the REST API, or an Azure Resource Manager template. See the [Copy Activity tutorial](quickstart-create-data-factory-dot-net.md)for step-by-step instructions to create a pipeline with a copy activity.

This section provides a list of properties that the Netezza source supports.

For a full list of sections and properties that are available for defining activities, see [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md).

### Netezza as source

>[!TIP]
>To load data from Netezza efficiently by using data partitioning, learn more from [Parallel copy from Netezza](#parallel-copy-from-netezza) section.

To copy data from Netezza, set the **source** type in Copy Activity to **NetezzaSource**. The following properties are supported in the Copy Activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The **type** property of the Copy Activity source must be set to **NetezzaSource**. | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. Example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"` | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |
| partitionOptions | Specifies the data partitioning options used to load data from Netezza. <br>Allow values are: **None** (default), **DataSlice**, and **DynamicRange**.<br>When a partition option is enabled (that is, not `None`), the degree of parallelism to concurrently load data from a Netezza database is controlled by [`parallelCopies`](copy-activity-performance-features.md#parallel-copy) setting on the copy activity. | No |
| partitionSettings | Specify the group of the settings for data partitioning. <br>Apply when partition option isn't `None`. | No |
| partitionColumnName | Specify the name of the source column **in integer type** that will be used by range partitioning for parallel copy. If not specified, the primary key of the table is autodetected and used as the partition column. <br>Apply when the partition option is `DynamicRange`. If you use a query to retrieve the source data, hook `?AdfRangePartitionColumnName` in WHERE clause. See example in [Parallel copy from Netezza](#parallel-copy-from-netezza) section. | No |
| partitionUpperBound | The maximum value of the partition column to copy data out. <br>Apply when partition option is `DynamicRange`. If you use query to retrieve source data, hook `?AdfRangePartitionUpbound` in the WHERE clause. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from Netezza](#parallel-copy-from-netezza) section. | No |
| partitionLowerBound | The minimum value of the partition column to copy data out. <br>Apply when the partition option is `DynamicRange`. If you use a query to retrieve the source data, hook `?AdfRangePartitionLowbound` in the WHERE clause. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from Netezza](#parallel-copy-from-netezza) section. | No |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromNetezza",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Netezza input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "NetezzaSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM MyTable"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Parallel copy from Netezza

The Data Factory Netezza connector provides built-in data partitioning to copy data from Netezza in parallel. You can find data partitioning options on the **Source** table of the copy activity.

:::image type="content" source="./media/connector-netezza/connector-netezza-partition-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of partition options":::

When you enable partitioned copy, the service runs parallel queries against your Netezza source to load data by partitions. The parallel degree is controlled by the [`parallelCopies`](copy-activity-performance-features.md#parallel-copy) setting on the copy activity. For example, if you set `parallelCopies` to four, the service concurrently generates and runs four queries based on your specified partition option and settings, and each query retrieves a portion of data from your Netezza database.

You are suggested to enable parallel copy with data partitioning especially when you load large amount of data from your Netezza database. The following are suggested configurations for different scenarios. When copying data into file-based data store, it's recommended to write to a folder as multiple files (only specify folder name), in which case the performance is better than writing to a single file.

| Scenario                                                     | Suggested settings                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Full load from large table.                                   | **Partition option**: Data Slice. <br><br/>During execution, the service automatically partitions the data based on [Netezza's built-in data slices](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/psfa/7.1.0?topic=hardware-manage-data-slices), and copies data by partitions. |
| Load large amount of data by using a custom query.                 | **Partition option**: Data Slice.<br>**Query**: `SELECT * FROM <TABLENAME> WHERE mod(datasliceid, ?AdfPartitionCount) = ?AdfDataSliceCondition AND <your_additional_where_clause>`.<br>During execution, the service replaces `?AdfPartitionCount` (with parallel copy number set on copy activity) and `?AdfDataSliceCondition` with the data slice partition logic, and sends to Netezza. |
| Load large amount of data by using a custom query, having an integer column with evenly distributed value for range partitioning. | **Partition options**: Dynamic range partition.<br>**Query**: `SELECT * FROM <TABLENAME> WHERE ?AdfRangePartitionColumnName <= ?AdfRangePartitionUpbound AND ?AdfRangePartitionColumnName >= ?AdfRangePartitionLowbound AND <your_additional_where_clause>`.<br>**Partition column**: Specify the column used to partition data. You can partition against the column with integer data type.<br>**Partition upper bound** and **partition lower bound**: Specify if you want to filter against the partition column to retrieve data only between the lower and upper range.<br><br>During execution, the service replaces `?AdfRangePartitionColumnName`, `?AdfRangePartitionUpbound`, and `?AdfRangePartitionLowbound` with the actual column name and value ranges for each partition, and sends to Netezza. <br>For example, if your partition column "ID" set with the lower bound as 1 and the upper bound as 80, with parallel copy set as 4, the service retrieves data by 4 partitions. Their IDs are between [1,20], [21, 40], [41, 60], and [61, 80], respectively. |

**Example: query with data slice partition**

```json
"source": {
    "type": "NetezzaSource",
    "query": "SELECT * FROM <TABLENAME> WHERE mod(datasliceid, ?AdfPartitionCount) = ?AdfDataSliceCondition AND <your_additional_where_clause>",
    "partitionOption": "DataSlice"
}
```

**Example: query with dynamic range partition**

```json
"source": {
    "type": "NetezzaSource",
    "query": "SELECT * FROM <TABLENAME> WHERE ?AdfRangePartitionColumnName <= ?AdfRangePartitionUpbound AND ?AdfRangePartitionColumnName >= ?AdfRangePartitionLowbound AND <your_additional_where_clause>",
    "partitionOption": "DynamicRange",
    "partitionSettings": {
        "partitionColumnName": "<dynamic_range_partition_column_name>",
        "partitionUpperBound": "<upper_value_of_partition_column>",
        "partitionLowerBound": "<lower_value_of_partition_column>"
    }
}
```

## Data type mapping for Netezza

When you copy data from Netezza, the following mappings apply from Netezza's data types to the internal data types used by the service. To learn about how the copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink, see [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md).

| Netezza data type | Interim service data type (for version 2.0) | Interim service data type (for version 1.0) |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| BOOLEAN | Boolean | Boolean |
| CHAR | String | String |
| VARCHAR | String | String |
| NCHAR | String | String |
| NVARCHAR | String | String |
| DATE | Date | DateTime |
| TIMESTAMP | DateTime | DateTime |
| TIME | Time | TimeSpan |
| INTERVAL | Not Supported | TimeSpan |
| TIME WITH TIME ZONE | String | String |
| NUMERIC(p,s) | Decimal | Decimal |
| REAL | Single | Single |
| DOUBLE PRECISION | Double | Double |
| INTEGER | Int32 | Int32 |
