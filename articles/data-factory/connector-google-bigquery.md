# Copy data from Google BigQuery V2 using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory and Synapse Analytics pipelines to copy data from Google BigQuery. It builds on the [Copy Activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of the copy activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [Google BigQuery V2 connector](connector-google-bigquery.md) provides improved native Google BigQuery support. If you are using the [Google BigQuery V1 connector](connector-google-bigquery-legacy.md) in your solution, please [upgrade your Google BigQuery connector](#upgrade-the-google-bigquery-linked-service) as V1 is at [End of Support stage](connector-deprecation-plan.md). Refer to this [section](#differences-between-google-bigquery-and-google-bigquery-legacy) for details on the difference between V2 and V1.

## Supported capabilities

This Google BigQuery connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources or sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity. Therefore, you don't need to manually install a driver to use this connector.

>[!NOTE]
>This Google BigQuery connector is built on top of the BigQuery APIs. Be aware that BigQuery limits the maximum rate of incoming requests and enforces appropriate quotas on a per-project basis, refer to [Quotas & Limits - API requests](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quotas#api_requests). Make sure you do not trigger too many concurrent requests to the account.

## Get started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

## Create a linked service to Google BigQuery using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to Google BigQuery in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for Google BigQuery and select the connector.
