# Move data to or from Azure Blob Storage using Azure Data Factory
This article explains how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to move data to/from Azure Blob Storage. It builds on the [Data Movement Activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article, which presents a general overview of data movement with the copy activity.

You can copy data from any supported source data store to Azure Blob Storage or from Azure Blob Storage to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores supported as sources or sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Copy Activity supports copying data from/to both general-purpose Azure Storage accounts and Hot/Cool Blob storage. The activity supports **reading from block, append, or page blobs**, but supports **writing to only block blobs**. Azure Premium Storage is not supported as a sink because it is backed by page blobs.
>

## Getting started
You can create a pipeline with a copy activity that moves data to/from an Azure Blob Storage by using different tools/APIs.

The easiest way to create a pipeline is to use the **Copy Wizard**. See [Tutorial: Create a pipeline using Copy Wizard](data-factory-copy-data-wizard-tutorial.md) for a quick walkthrough on creating a pipeline using the Copy data wizard.

You can also use the following tools to create a pipeline: **Azure portal**, **Visual Studio**, **Azure PowerShell**, **Azure Resource Manager template**, **.NET API**, and **REST API**. See [Copy activity tutorial](data-factory-copy-data-from-azure-blob-storage-to-sql-database.md) for step-by-step instructions to create a pipeline with a copy activity.

Whether you use the tools or APIs, you perform the following steps to create a pipeline that moves data from a source data store to a sink data store:

1. Create **linked services** to link input and output data stores to your data factory.
2. Create **datasets** to represent input and output data for the copy operation.
3. Create a **pipeline** with a copy activity that takes a dataset as an input and a dataset as an output.

When you use the wizard, JSON definitions for these Data Factory entities (linked services, datasets, and the pipeline) are automatically created for you. When you use tools/APIs (except .NET API), you define these Data Factory entities by using the JSON format.  For samples with JSON definitions for Data Factory entities that are used to copy data to/from an Azure Blob Storage, see [JSON examples](#json-examples) section of this article.

The following sections provide details about JSON properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Azure Blob Storage:

## Linked service properties
There are two types of linked services you can use to link an Azure Storage to an Azure data factory. They are: **AzureStorage** linked service and **AzureStorageSas** linked service. The Azure Storage linked service provides the data factory with global access to the Azure Storage. Whereas, The Azure Storage SAS (Shared Access Signature) linked service provides the data factory with restricted/time-bound access to the Azure Storage. There are no other differences between these two linked services. Choose the linked service that suits your needs. The following sections provide more details on these two linked services.

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-azure-storage-linked-services](../../includes/data-factory-azure-storage-linked-services.md)]

## Dataset properties
To specify a dataset to represent input or output data in an Azure Blob Storage, you set the type property of the dataset to: **AzureBlob**. Set the **linkedServiceName** property of the dataset to the name of the Azure Storage or Azure Storage SAS linked service.  The type properties of the dataset specify the **blob container** and the **folder** in the blob storage.

For a full list of JSON sections & properties available for defining datasets, see the [Creating datasets](data-factory-create-datasets.md) article. Sections such as structure, availability, and policy of a dataset JSON are similar for all dataset types (Azure SQL, Azure blob, Azure table, etc.).

Data factory supports the following CLS-compliant .NET based type values for providing type information in “structure” for schema-on-read data sources like Azure blob: Int16, Int32, Int64, Single, Double, Decimal, Byte[], Bool, String, Guid, Datetime, Datetimeoffset, Timespan. Data Factory automatically performs type conversions when moving data from a source data store to a sink data store.

The **typeProperties** section is different for each type of dataset and provides information about the location, format etc., of the data in the data store. The typeProperties section for dataset of type **AzureBlob** dataset has the following properties:

| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| folderPath |Path to the container and folder in the blob storage. Example: myblobcontainer\myblobfolder\ |Yes |
| fileName |Name of the blob. fileName is optional and case-sensitive.<br/><br/>If you specify a filename, the activity (including Copy) works on the specific Blob.<br/><br/>When fileName is not specified, Copy includes all Blobs in the folderPath for input dataset.<br/><br/>When fileName is not specified for an output dataset, the name of the generated file would be in the following this format: Data.<Guid>.txt (for example: : Data.0a405f8a-93ff-4c6f-b3be-f69616f1df7a.txt |No |
| partitionedBy |partitionedBy is an optional property. You can use it to specify a dynamic folderPath and filename for time series data. For example, folderPath can be parameterized for every hour of data. See the [Using partitionedBy property section](#using-partitionedBy-property) for details and examples. |No |
| format | The following format types are supported: **TextFormat**, **JsonFormat**, **AvroFormat**, **OrcFormat**, **ParquetFormat**. Set the **type** property under format to one of these values. For more information, see [Text Format](data-factory-supported-file-and-compression-formats.md#text-format), [Json Format](data-factory-supported-file-and-compression-formats.md#json-format), [Avro Format](data-factory-supported-file-and-compression-formats.md#avro-format), [Orc Format](data-factory-supported-file-and-compression-formats.md#orc-format), and [Parquet Format](data-factory-supported-file-and-compression-formats.md#parquet-format) sections. <br><br> If you want to **copy files as-is** between file-based stores (binary copy), skip the format section in both input and output dataset definitions. |No |
| compression | Specify the type and level of compression for the data. Supported types are: **GZip**, **Deflate**, **BZip2**, and **ZipDeflate**. Supported levels are: **Optimal** and **Fastest**. For more information, see [File and compression formats in Azure Data Factory](data-factory-supported-file-and-compression-formats.md#compression-support). |No |

### Using partitionedBy property
As mentioned in the previous section, you can specify a dynamic folderPath and filename for time series data with the **partitionedBy** property, [Data Factory functions, and the system variables](data-factory-functions-variables.md).

For more information on time series datasets, scheduling, and slices, see [Creating Datasets](data-factory-create-datasets.md) and [Scheduling & Execution](data-factory-scheduling-and-execution.md) articles.

#### Sample 1

```json
"folderPath": "wikidatagateway/wikisampledataout/{Slice}",
"partitionedBy":
[
    { "name": "Slice", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "yyyyMMddHH" } },
],
```

In this example, {Slice} is replaced with the value of Data Factory system variable SliceStart in the format (YYYYMMDDHH) specified. The SliceStart refers to start time of the slice. The folderPath is different for each slice. For example: wikidatagateway/wikisampledataout/2014100103 or wikidatagateway/wikisampledataout/2014100104

#### Sample 2

```json
"folderPath": "wikidatagateway/wikisampledataout/{Year}/{Month}/{Day}",
"fileName": "{Hour}.csv",
"partitionedBy":
 [
    { "name": "Year", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "yyyy" } },
    { "name": "Month", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "MM" } },
    { "name": "Day", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "dd" } },
    { "name": "Hour", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "hh" } }
],
```

In this example, year, month, day, and time of SliceStart are extracted into separate variables that are used by folderPath and fileName properties.

## Copy activity properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining activities, see the [Creating Pipelines](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) article. Properties such as name, description, input and output datasets, and policies are available for all types of activities. Whereas, properties available in the **typeProperties** section of the activity vary with each activity type. For Copy activity, they vary depending on the types of sources and sinks. If you are moving data from an Azure Blob Storage, you set the source type in the copy activity to **BlobSource**. Similarly, if you are moving data to an Azure Blob Storage, you set the sink type in the copy activity to **BlobSink**. This section provides a list of properties supported by BlobSource and BlobSink.

**BlobSource** supports the following properties in the **typeProperties** section:

| Property | Description | Allowed values | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| recursive |Indicates whether the data is read recursively from the sub folders or only from the specified folder. |True (default value), False |No |

**BlobSink** supports the following properties **typeProperties** section:

| Property | Description | Allowed values | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| copyBehavior |Defines the copy behavior when the source is BlobSource or FileSystem. |<b>PreserveHierarchy</b>: preserves the file hierarchy in the target folder. The relative path of source file to source folder is identical to the relative path of target file to target folder.<br/><br/><b>FlattenHierarchy</b>: all files from the source folder are in the first level of target folder. The target files have auto generated name. <br/><br/><b>MergeFiles (default):</b> merges all files from the source folder to one file. If the File/Blob Name is specified, the merged file name would be the specified name; otherwise, would be auto-generated file name. |No |

**BlobSource** also supports these two properties for backward compatibility.

* **treatEmptyAsNull**: Specifies whether to treat null or empty string as null value.
* **skipHeaderLineCount** - Specifies how many lines need be skipped. It is applicable only when input dataset is using TextFormat.

Similarly, **BlobSink** supports the following property for backward compatibility.

* **blobWriterAddHeader**: Specifies whether to add a header of column definitions while writing to an output dataset.

Datasets now support the following properties that implement the same functionality: **treatEmptyAsNull**, **skipLineCount**, **firstRowAsHeader**.

The following table provides guidance on using the new dataset properties in place of these blob source/sink properties.

| Copy Activity property | Dataset property |
|:--- |:--- |
| skipHeaderLineCount on BlobSource |skipLineCount and firstRowAsHeader. Lines are skipped first and then the first row is read as a header. |
| treatEmptyAsNull on BlobSource |treatEmptyAsNull on input dataset |
| blobWriterAddHeader on BlobSink |firstRowAsHeader on output dataset |

See [Specifying TextFormat](data-factory-supported-file-and-compression-formats.md#text-format) section for detailed information on these properties.    

### recursive and copyBehavior examples
This section describes the resulting behavior of the Copy operation for different combinations of recursive and copyBehavior values.

| recursive | copyBehavior | Resulting behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| true |preserveHierarchy |For a source folder Folder1 with the following structure: <br/><br/>Folder1<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File1<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File2<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subfolder1<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File3<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File4<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File5<br/><br/>the target folder Folder1 is created with the same structure as the source<br/><br/>Folder1<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File1<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File2<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subfolder1<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File3<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File4<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File5. |

## Supported file and compression formats
See [File and compression formats in Azure Data Factory](data-factory-supported-file-and-compression-formats.md) article on details.

## JSON examples
The following examples provide sample JSON definitions that you can use to create a pipeline by using [Azure portal](data-factory-copy-activity-tutorial-using-azure-portal.md) or [Visual Studio](data-factory-copy-activity-tutorial-using-visual-studio.md) or [Azure PowerShell](data-factory-copy-activity-tutorial-using-powershell.md). They show how to copy data to and from Azure Blob Storage and Azure SQL Database. However, data can be copied **directly** from any of sources to any of the sinks stated [here](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) using the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory.

## Example: Copy data from Blob Storage to SQL Database
The following sample shows:

1. A linked service of type [AzureSqlDatabase](data-factory-azure-sql-connector.md#linked-service-properties).
2. A linked service of type [AzureStorage](#linked-service-properties).
3. An input [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureBlob](#dataset-properties).
4. An output [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureSqlTable](data-factory-azure-sql-connector.md#dataset-properties).
5. A [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) with a Copy activity that uses [BlobSource](#copy-activity-properties) and [SqlSink](data-factory-azure-sql-connector.md#copy-activity-properties).

The sample copies time-series data from an Azure blob to an Azure SQL table hourly. The JSON properties used in these samples are described in sections following the samples.

**Azure SQL linked service:**

```json
{
  "name": "AzureSqlLinkedService",
  "properties": {
    "type": "AzureSqlDatabase",
    "typeProperties": {
      "connectionString": "Server=tcp:<servername>.database.windows.net,1433;Database=<databasename>;User ID=<username>@<servername>;Password=<password>;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;Connection Timeout=30"
    }
  }
}
```
**Azure Storage linked service:**

```json
{
  "name": "StorageLinkedService",
  "properties": {
    "type": "AzureStorage",
    "typeProperties": {
      "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
    }
  }
}
```
Azure Data Factory supports two types of Azure Storage linked services: **AzureStorage** and **AzureStorageSas**. For the first one, you specify the connection string that includes the account key and for the later one, you specify the Shared Access Signature (SAS) Uri. See [Linked Services](#linked-service-properties) section for details.  

**Azure Blob input dataset:**

Data is picked up from a new blob every hour (frequency: hour, interval: 1). The folder path and file name for the blob are dynamically evaluated based on the start time of the slice that is being processed. The folder path uses year, month, and day part of the start time and file name uses the hour part of the start time. “external”: “true” setting informs Data Factory that the table is external to the data factory and is not produced by an activity in the data factory.

```json
{
  "name": "AzureBlobInput",
  "properties": {
    "type": "AzureBlob",
    "linkedServiceName": "StorageLinkedService",
    "typeProperties": {
      "folderPath": "mycontainer/myfolder/yearno={Year}/monthno={Month}/dayno={Day}/",
      "fileName": "{Hour}.csv",
      "partitionedBy": [
        {
          "name": "Year",
          "value": {
            "type": "DateTime",
            "date": "SliceStart",
            "format": "yyyy"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "Month",
          "value": {
            "type": "DateTime",
            "date": "SliceStart",
            "format": "MM"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "Day",
          "value": {
            "type": "DateTime",
            "date": "SliceStart",
            "format": "dd"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "Hour",
          "value": {
            "type": "DateTime",
            "date": "SliceStart",
            "format": "HH"
          }
        }
      ],
      "format": {
        "type": "TextFormat",
        "columnDelimiter": ",",
        "rowDelimiter": "\n"
      }
    },
    "external": true,
    "availability": {
      "frequency": "Hour",
      "interval": 1
    },
    "policy": {
      "externalData": {
        "retryInterval": "00:01:00",
        "retryTimeout": "00:10:00",
        "maximumRetry": 3
      }
    }
  }
}
```
**Azure SQL output dataset:**

The sample copies data to a table named “MyTable” in an Azure SQL database. Create the table in your Azure SQL database with the same number of columns as you expect the Blob CSV file to contain. New rows are added to the table every hour.

```json
{
  "name": "AzureSqlOutput",
  "properties": {
    "type": "AzureSqlTable",
    "linkedServiceName": "AzureSqlLinkedService",
    "typeProperties": {
      "tableName": "MyOutputTable"
    },
    "availability": {
      "frequency": "Hour",
      "interval": 1
    }
  }
}
```
**A copy activity in a pipeline with Blob source and SQL sink:**

The pipeline contains a Copy Activity that is configured to use the input and output datasets and is scheduled to run every hour. In the pipeline JSON definition, the **source** type is set to **BlobSource** and **sink** type is set to **SqlSink**.

```json
{  
    "name":"SamplePipeline",
    "properties":{  
    "start":"2014-06-01T18:00:00",
    "end":"2014-06-01T19:00:00",
    "description":"pipeline with copy activity",
    "activities":[  
      {
        "name": "AzureBlobtoSQL",
        "description": "Copy Activity",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
          {
            "name": "AzureBlobInput"
          }
        ],
        "outputs": [
          {
            "name": "AzureSqlOutput"
          }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
          "source": {
            "type": "BlobSource"
          },
          "sink": {
            "type": "SqlSink"
          }
        },
       "scheduler": {
          "frequency": "Hour",
          "interval": 1
        },
        "policy": {
          "concurrency": 1,
          "executionPriorityOrder": "OldestFirst",
          "retry": 0,
          "timeout": "01:00:00"
        }
      }
      ]
   }
}
```
## Example: Copy data from Azure SQL to Azure Blob
The following sample shows:

1. A linked service of type [AzureSqlDatabase](data-factory-azure-sql-connector.md#linked-service-properties).
2. A linked service of type [AzureStorage](#linked-service-properties).
3. An input [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureSqlTable](data-factory-azure-sql-connector.md#dataset-properties).
4. An output [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureBlob](#dataset-properties).
5. A [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) with Copy activity that uses [SqlSource](data-factory-azure-sql-connector.md#copy-activity-properties) and [BlobSink](#copy-activity-properties).

The sample copies time-series data from an Azure SQL table to an Azure blob hourly. The JSON properties used in these samples are described in sections following the samples.

**Azure SQL linked service:**

```json
{
  "name": "AzureSqlLinkedService",
  "properties": {
    "type": "AzureSqlDatabase",
    "typeProperties": {
      "connectionString": "Server=tcp:<servername>.database.windows.net,1433;Database=<databasename>;User ID=<username>@<servername>;Password=<password>;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;Connection Timeout=30"
    }
  }
}
```
**Azure Storage linked service:**

```json
{
  "name": "StorageLinkedService",
  "properties": {
    "type": "AzureStorage",
    "typeProperties": {
      "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
    }
  }
}
```
Azure Data Factory supports two types of Azure Storage linked services: **AzureStorage** and **AzureStorageSas**. For the first one, you specify the connection string that includes the account key and for the later one, you specify the Shared Access Signature (SAS) Uri. See [Linked Services](#linked-service-properties) section for details.  

**Azure SQL input dataset:**

The sample assumes you have created a table “MyTable” in Azure SQL and it contains a column called “timestampcolumn” for time series data.

Setting “external”: ”true” informs Data Factory service that the table is external to the data factory and is not produced by an activity in the data factory.

```json
{
  "name": "AzureSqlInput",
  "properties": {
    "type": "AzureSqlTable",
    "linkedServiceName": "AzureSqlLinkedService",
    "typeProperties": {
      "tableName": "MyTable"
    },
    "external": true,
    "availability": {
      "frequency": "Hour",
      "interval": 1
    },
    "policy": {
      "externalData": {
        "retryInterval": "00:01:00",
        "retryTimeout": "00:10:00",
        "maximumRetry": 3
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Azure Blob output dataset:**

Data is written to a new blob every hour (frequency: hour, interval: 1). The folder path for the blob is dynamically evaluated based on the start time of the slice that is being processed. The folder path uses year, month, day, and hours parts of the start time.

```json
{
  "name": "AzureBlobOutput",
  "properties": {
    "type": "AzureBlob",

**A copy activity in a pipeline with SQL source and Blob sink:**

The pipeline contains a Copy Activity that is configured to use the input and output datasets and is scheduled to run every hour. In the pipeline JSON definition, the **source** type is set to **SqlSource** and **sink** type is set to **BlobSink**. The SQL query specified for the **SqlReaderQuery** property selects the data in the past hour to copy.
