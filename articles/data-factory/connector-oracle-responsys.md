# Copy data from Oracle Responsys using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics (Preview)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is at [End of Support stage](connector-deprecation-plan.md). You are recommended to migrate to [ODBC connector](connector-odbc.md) by installing a driver.

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from Oracle Responsys. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This Oracle Responsys connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks, see the [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores) table.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Getting started

You can create a pipeline with copy activity using .NET SDK, Python SDK, Azure PowerShell, REST API, or Azure Resource Manager template. See [Copy activity tutorial](quickstart-create-data-factory-dot-net.md) for step-by-step instructions to create a pipeline with a copy activity.

## Create a linked service to Oracle Responsys using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to Oracle Responsys in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for Oracle and select the Oracle Responsys connector.

1. Configure the service details, test the connection, and create the new linked service.

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Oracle Responsys connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Oracle Responsys linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Responsys** | Yes |
| endpoint | The endpoint of the Respopnsys server  | Yes |
| clientId | The client ID associated with the Responsys application.  | Yes |
| clientSecret | The client secret associated with the Responsys application. You can choose to mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in the service, or store password in Azure Key Vault and let the service copy activity pull from there when performing data copy - learn more from [Store credentials in Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| useEncryptedEndpoints | Specifies whether the data source endpoints are encrypted using HTTPS. The default value is true.  | No |
| useHostVerification | Specifies whether to require the host name in the server's certificate to match the host name of the server when connecting over TLS. The default value is true.  | No |
| usePeerVerification | Specifies whether to verify the identity of the server when connecting over TLS. The default value is true.  | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "OracleResponsysLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Responsys",
        "typeProperties": {
            "endpoint" : "<endpoint>",
            "clientId" : "<clientId>",
            "clientSecret": {
                 "type": "SecureString",
                 "value": "<clientSecret>"
            },
            "useEncryptedEndpoints" : true,
            "useHostVerification" : true,
            "usePeerVerification" : true
        }
    }
}

```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Oracle Responsys dataset.

To copy data from Oracle Responsys, set the type property of the dataset to **ResponsysObject**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **ResponsysObject** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "OracleResponsysDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "ResponsysObject",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Oracle Responsys linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}

```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Oracle Responsys source.

### Oracle Responsys as source

To copy data from Oracle Responsys, set the source type in the copy activity to **ResponsysSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **ResponsysSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromOracleResponsys",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Oracle Responsys input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
