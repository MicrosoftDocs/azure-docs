# Transform data by running a Databricks job

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-xxx-md.md)]

The Azure Databricks Job Activity (Preview) in a [pipeline](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) runs Databricks jobs in your Azure Databricks workspace, including serverless jobs. This article builds on the [data transformation activities](transform-data.md) article, which presents a general overview of data transformation and the supported transformation activities. Azure Databricks is a managed platform for running Apache Spark.

You can create a Databricks job directly through the Azure Data Factory Studio user interface.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure Databricks Jobs activity is currently in preview. This information relates to a pre-release product that may be substantially modified before it's released. Microsoft makes no warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

## Add a Job activity for Azure Databricks to a pipeline with UI

To use a Job activity for Azure Databricks in a pipeline, complete the following steps:

1. Search for _Job_ in the pipeline Activities pane, and drag a Job activity to the pipeline canvas.
1. Select the new Job activity on the canvas if it isn't already selected.
1. Select the **Azure Databricks** tab to select or create a new Azure Databricks linked service.

   > [!Note]
   > The Azure Databricks Job activity automatically runs on serverless clusters, so you don't need to specify a cluster in your linked service configuration.

1. Select the **Settings** tab and specify the job to be executed on Azure Databricks, optional base parameters to be passed to the job, and any other libraries to be installed on the cluster to execute the job.
