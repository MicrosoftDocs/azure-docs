# Copy data from and to Oracle by using Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse Analytics

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the copy activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from and to an Oracle database. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md).

## Supported capabilities

This Oracle connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/sink)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Script activity](transform-data-using-script.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources or sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Specifically, this Oracle connector supports:

- The following versions of an Oracle database:
    - Oracle 19c R1 (19.1) and higher
    - Oracle 18c R1 (18.1) and higher
    - Oracle 12c R1 (12.1) and higher
    - Oracle 11g R1 (11.1) and higher
    - Oracle 10g R1 (10.1) and higher
    - Oracle 9i R2 (9.2) and higher
    - Oracle 8i R3 (8.1.7) and higher
    - Oracle Database Cloud Exadata Service
- Parallel copying from an Oracle source. See the [Parallel copy from Oracle](#parallel-copy-from-oracle) section for details.

> [!Note]
> Oracle proxy server isn't supported.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-integration-runtime-requirements](includes/data-factory-v2-integration-runtime-requirements.md)] 

The integration runtime provides a built-in Oracle driver. Therefore, you don't need to manually install a driver when you copy data from and to Oracle.

## Get started

## Create a linked service to Oracle using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to Oracle in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for Oracle and select the Oracle connector.

    :::image type="content" source="media/connector-oracle/oracle-connector.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Oracle connector.":::    

1. Configure the service details, test the connection, and create the new linked service.

    :::image type="content" source="media/connector-oracle/configure-oracle-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of linked service configuration for Oracle.":::

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define entities specific to the Oracle connector.

## Linked service properties

The Oracle linked service supports the following properties:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to **Oracle**. | Yes |
| connectionString | Specifies the information needed to connect to the Oracle Database instance. <br/>You can also put a password in Azure Key Vault, and pull the `password` configuration out of the connection string. Refer to the following samples and [Store credentials in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md) with more details. <br><br>**Supported connection type**: You can use **Oracle SID** or **Oracle Service Name** to identify your database:<br>- If you use SID: `Host=<host>;Port=<port>;Sid=<sid>;User Id=<username>;Password=<password>;`<br>- If you use Service Name: `Host=<host>;Port=<port>;ServiceName=<servicename>;User Id=<username>;Password=<password>;`<br>For advanced Oracle native connection options, you can choose to add an entry in [TNSNAMES.ORA](http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/Tnsnames.ora) file on the machine where the self-hosted integration runtime is installed, and in Oracle linked service, choose to use Oracle Service Name connection type and configure the corresponding service name. | Yes |
| connectVia | The [integration runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. Learn more from [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. If not specified, the default Azure Integration Runtime is used. |No |

>[!TIP]
>If you get an error, "ORA-01025: UPI parameter out of range", and your Oracle version is 8i, add `WireProtocolMode=1` to your connection string. Then try again.

If you have multiple Oracle instances for failover scenario, you can create Oracle linked service and fill in the primary host, port, user name, password, etc., and add a new "**Additional connection properties**" with property name as `AlternateServers` and value as `(HostName=<secondary host>:PortNumber=<secondary port>:ServiceName=<secondary service name>)` - do not miss the brackets and pay attention to the colons (`:`) as separator. As an example, the following value of alternate servers defines two alternate database servers for connection failover:
`(HostName=AccountingOracleServer:PortNumber=1521:SID=Accounting,HostName=255.201.11.24:PortNumber=1522:ServiceName=ABackup.NA.MyCompany)`.

More connection properties you can set in connection string per your case:

| Property | Description | Allowed values |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| ArraySize |The number of bytes the connector can fetch in a single network round trip. E.g., `ArraySize=‭10485760‬`.<br/><br/>Larger values increase throughput by reducing the number of times to fetch data across the network. Smaller values increase response time, as there is less of a delay waiting for the server to transmit data. | An integer from 1 to 4294967296 (4 GB). Default value is `60000`. The value 1 does not define the number of bytes, but indicates allocating space for exactly one row of data. |

To enable encryption on Oracle connection, you have two options:

-	To use **Triple-DES Encryption (3DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**, on the Oracle server side, go to Oracle Advanced Security (OAS) and configure the encryption settings. For details, see this [Oracle documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/network.112/e40393/asointro.htm#i1008759). The Oracle Application Development Framework (ADF) connector automatically negotiates the encryption method to use the one you configure in OAS when establishing a connection to Oracle.

-	To use **TLS**, set up `truststore` for SSL server authentication by applying one of the following three methods:

    - **Method 1 (recommended)**:

        1.	Install the TLS/SSL certificate by importing it into the local certificate store. The built-in Oracle driver is able to load the needed certificate from the certificate store. 

        2.	In the service, configure the Oracle connection string with `EncryptionMethod=1`.

    - **Method 2**:

        1. Get the TLS/SSL certificate information. Get the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)-encoded or Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)-encoded certificate information of your TLS/SSL cert.

            ```
            openssl x509 -inform (DER|PEM) -in [Full Path to the DER/PEM Certificate including the name of the DER/PEM Certificate] -text
            ```

        2.	In the service, configure the Oracle connection string with `EncryptionMethod=1` and the corresponding `TrustStore` value. For example, `Host=<host>;Port=<port>;Sid=<sid>;User Id=<username>;Password=<password>;EncryptionMethod=1;TrustStore= data:// -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----<certificate content>-----END CERTIFICATE-----`

            >[!Note]
            >- The value of the `TrustStore` field should be prefixed with `data://`.
            >- When specifying content for multiple certificates, specify the content of each certificate between `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`. The number of dashes (`-----`) should be the same before and after both `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` and `END CERTIFICATE`. For example:<br>
            >`-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----<certificate content 1>-----END CERTIFICATE-----`<br>
            >`-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----<certificate content 2>-----END CERTIFICATE-----`<br>
            >`-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----<certificate content 3>-----END CERTIFICATE-----`
            > - The `TrustStore` field supports content up to 8192 characters in length.

    - **Method 3**:
        1. Create the `truststore` file with strong ciphers like AES256.
        
            ```
            openssl pkcs12 -in [Full Path to the DER/PEM Certificate including the name of the DER/PEM Certificate] -out [Path and name of TrustStore] -passout pass:[Keystore PWD] -keypbe AES-256-CBC -certpbe AES-256-CBC -nokeys -export
            ```
        2.	Place the `truststore` file on the self-hosted integration runtime machine. For example, place the file at `C:\MyTrustStoreFile`. 
        
        3.	In the service, configure the Oracle connection string with `EncryptionMethod=1` and the corresponding `TrustStore`/`TrustStorePassword` value. For example, `Host=<host>;Port=<port>;Sid=<sid>;User Id=<username>;Password=<password>;EncryptionMethod=1;TrustStore=C:\\MyTrustStoreFile;TrustStorePassword=<trust_store_password>`.
    
    
**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "OracleLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Oracle",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "Host=<host>;Port=<port>;Sid=<sid>;User Id=<username>;Password=<password>;"
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example: store password in Azure Key Vault**

```json
{
    "name": "OracleLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Oracle",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "Host=<host>;Port=<port>;Sid=<sid>;User Id=<username>;",
            "password": { 
                "type": "AzureKeyVaultSecret", 
                "store": { 
                    "referenceName": "<Azure Key Vault linked service name>", 
                    "type": "LinkedServiceReference" 
                }, 
                "secretName": "<secretName>" 
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```
## Dataset properties

This section provides a list of properties supported by the Oracle dataset. For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see [Datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md). 

To copy data from and to Oracle, set the type property of the dataset to `OracleTable`. The following properties are supported.

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to `OracleTable`. | Yes |
| schema | Name of the schema. |No for source, Yes for sink  |
| table | Name of the table/view. |No for source, Yes for sink  |
| tableName | Name of the table/view with schema. This property is supported for backward compatibility. For new workload, use `schema` and `table`. | No for source, Yes for sink |

**Example:**

```json

            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

This section provides a list of properties supported by the Oracle source and sink. For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md). 

### Oracle as source

>[!TIP]
>To load data from Oracle efficiently by using data partitioning, learn more from [Parallel copy from Oracle](#parallel-copy-from-oracle).

To copy data from Oracle, set the source type in the copy activity to `OracleSource`. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section.

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to `OracleSource`. | Yes |
| oracleReaderQuery | Use the custom SQL query to read data. An example is `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`.<br>When you enable partitioned load, you need to hook any corresponding built-in partition parameters in your query. For examples, see the [Parallel copy from Oracle](#parallel-copy-from-oracle) section. | No |
| convertDecimalToInteger | Oracle NUMBER type with zero or unspecified scale will be converted to corresponding integer. Allowed values are **true** and **false** (default).| No |
| partitionOptions | Specifies the data partitioning options used to load data from Oracle. <br>Allowed values are: **None** (default), **PhysicalPartitionsOfTable**, and **DynamicRange**.<br>When a partition option is enabled (that is, not `None`), the degree of parallelism to concurrently load data from an Oracle database is controlled by the [`parallelCopies`](copy-activity-performance-features.md#parallel-copy) setting on the copy activity. | No |
| partitionSettings | Specify the group of the settings for data partitioning. <br>Apply when the partition option isn't `None`. | No |
| partitionNames | The list of physical partitions that needs to be copied. <br>Apply when the partition option is `PhysicalPartitionsOfTable`. If you use a query to retrieve the source data, hook `?AdfTabularPartitionName` in the WHERE clause. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from Oracle](#parallel-copy-from-oracle) section. | No |
| partitionColumnName | Specify the name of the source column **in integer type** that will be used by range partitioning for parallel copy. If not specified, the primary key of the table is auto-detected and used as the partition column. <br>Apply when the partition option is `DynamicRange`. If you use a query to retrieve the source data, hook  `?AdfRangePartitionColumnName` in the WHERE clause. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from Oracle](#parallel-copy-from-oracle) section. | No |
| partitionUpperBound | The maximum value of the partition column to copy data out. <br>Apply when the partition option is `DynamicRange`. If you use a query to retrieve the source data, hook `?AdfRangePartitionUpbound` in the WHERE clause. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from Oracle](#parallel-copy-from-oracle) section. | No |
| partitionLowerBound | The minimum value of the partition column to copy data out. <br>Apply when the partition option is `DynamicRange`. If you use a query to retrieve the source data, hook `?AdfRangePartitionLowbound` in the WHERE clause. For an example, see the [Parallel copy from Oracle](#parallel-copy-from-oracle) section. | No |

**Example: copy data by using a basic query without partition**

            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Parallel copy from Oracle

The Oracle connector provides built-in data partitioning to copy data from Oracle in parallel. You can find data partitioning options on the **Source** tab of the copy activity.

:::image type="content" source="./media/connector-oracle/connector-oracle-partition-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of partition options":::

When you enable partitioned copy, the service runs parallel queries against your Oracle source to load data by partitions. The parallel degree is controlled by the [`parallelCopies`](copy-activity-performance-features.md#parallel-copy) setting on the copy activity. For example, if you set `parallelCopies` to four, the service concurrently generates and runs four queries based on your specified partition option and settings, and each query retrieves a portion of data from your Oracle database.

You are suggested to enable parallel copy with data partitioning especially when you load large amount of data from your Oracle database. The following are suggested configurations for different scenarios. When copying data into file-based data store, it's recommended to write to a folder as multiple files (only specify folder name), in which case the performance is better than writing to a single file.

| Scenario                                                     | Suggested settings                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Full load from large table, with physical partitions.          | **Partition option**: Physical partitions of table. <br><br/>During execution, the service automatically detects the physical partitions, and copies data by partitions. |
| Full load from large table, without physical partitions, while with an integer column for data partitioning. | **Partition options**: Dynamic range partition.<br>**Partition column**: Specify the column used to partition data. If not specified, the primary key column is used. |
| Load a large amount of data by using a custom query, with physical partitions. | **Partition option**: Physical partitions of table.<br>**Query**: `SELECT * FROM <TABLENAME> PARTITION("?AdfTabularPartitionName") WHERE <your_additional_where_clause>`.<br>**Partition name**: Specify the partition name(s) to copy data from. If not specified, the service automatically detects the physical partitions on the table you specified in the Oracle dataset.<br><br>During execution, the service replaces `?AdfTabularPartitionName` with the actual partition name, and sends to Oracle. |
| Load a large amount of data by using a custom query, without physical partitions, while with an integer column for data partitioning. | **Partition options**: Dynamic range partition.<br>**Query**: `SELECT * FROM <TABLENAME> WHERE ?AdfRangePartitionColumnName <= ?AdfRangePartitionUpbound AND ?AdfRangePartitionColumnName >= ?AdfRangePartitionLowbound AND <your_additional_where_clause>`.<br>**Partition column**: Specify the column used to partition data. You can partition against the column with integer data type.<br>**Partition upper bound** and **partition lower bound**: Specify if you want to filter against partition column to retrieve data only between the lower and upper range.<br><br>During execution, the service replaces `?AdfRangePartitionColumnName`, `?AdfRangePartitionUpbound`, and `?AdfRangePartitionLowbound` with the actual column name and value ranges for each partition, and sends to Oracle. <br>For example, if your partition column "ID" is set with the lower bound as 1 and the upper bound as 80, with parallel copy set as 4, the service retrieves data by 4 partitions. Their IDs are between [1,20], [21, 40], [41, 60], and [61, 80], respectively. |

> [!TIP]
> When copying data from a non-partitioned table, you can use "Dynamic range" partition option to partition against an integer column. If your source data doesn't have such type of column, you can leverage [ORA_HASH]( https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SQLRF/functions136.htm) function in source query to generate a column and use it as partition column.

**Example: query with physical partition**

```json
"source": {
    "type": "OracleSource",
    "query": "SELECT * FROM <TABLENAME> PARTITION(\"?AdfTabularPartitionName\") WHERE <your_additional_where_clause>",
    "partitionOption": "PhysicalPartitionsOfTable",
    "partitionSettings": {
        "partitionNames": [
            "<partitionA_name>",
            "<partitionB_name>"
        ]
    }
}
```

**Example: query with dynamic range partition**

```json
"source": {
    "type": "OracleSource",
    "query": "SELECT * FROM <TABLENAME> WHERE ?AdfRangePartitionColumnName <= ?AdfRangePartitionUpbound AND ?AdfRangePartitionColumnName >= ?AdfRangePartitionLowbound AND <your_additional_where_clause>",
    "partitionOption": "DynamicRange",
    "partitionSettings": {
        "partitionColumnName": "<partition_column_name>",
        "partitionUpperBound": "<upper_value_of_partition_column>",
        "partitionLowerBound": "<lower_value_of_partition_column>"
    }
}
```

## Data type mapping for Oracle

When you copy data from and to Oracle, the following interim data type mappings are used within the service. To learn about how the copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink, see [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md).

| Oracle data type | Interim data type |
|:--- |:--- |
| BFILE |Byte[] |
| BLOB |Byte[]<br/>(only supported on Oracle 10g and higher) |
| CHAR |String |
| CLOB |String |
| DATE |DateTime |
| FLOAT |Decimal, String (if precision > 28) |
| INTEGER |Decimal, String (if precision > 28) |
| LONG |String |
| LONG RAW |Byte[] |
| NCHAR |String |
| NCLOB |String |
| NUMBER (p,s) |Decimal, String (if p > 28) |
| NUMBER without precision and scale |Double |
| NVARCHAR2 |String |
| RAW |Byte[] |
| ROWID |String |
| TIMESTAMP |DateTime |
| TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE |String |
| TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE |String |
| UNSIGNED INTEGER |Number |
| VARCHAR2 |String |
| XML |String |

> [!NOTE]
> The data types INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH and INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND aren't supported.
