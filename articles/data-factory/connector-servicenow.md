# Copy data from ServiceNow using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory and Synapse Analytics pipelines to copy data from ServiceNow. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The new ServiceNow connector provides improved native ServiceNow support. If you are using the legacy ServiceNow connector in your solution, you are recommended to [upgrade your ServiceNow connector](#upgrade-your-servicenow-linked-service) at your earliest convenience. Refer to this [section](#differences-between-servicenow-and-servicenow-legacy) for details on the difference between the legacy and latest version. 

## Supported capabilities

This ServiceNow connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks, see the [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores) table.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity. Therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

**Please use the actual value instead of the displayed value in ServiceNow.**


## Prerequisite

To use this connector, you need to have a role with at least read access to *sys_db_object* and *sys_dictionary* tables in ServiceNow.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

## Create a linked service to ServiceNow using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to ServiceNow in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for ServiceNow and select the ServiceNow connector.

    :::image type="content" source="media/connector-servicenow/servicenow-connector.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the ServiceNow connector.":::    

1. Configure the service details, test the connection, and create the new linked service.

            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by ServiceNow source.

### ServiceNow as source

| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **ServiceNowV2Source** | Yes |
| expression| Use the expression to read data. You can configure the expression in **Query builder**. It has the same usage as the condition builder in ServiceNow. For instructions on how to use it, see this [article](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/vancouver-platform-user-interface/page/use/common-ui-elements/concept/c_ConditionBuilder.html). You can also [use expression parameters](#using-expression-parameters).| No |

| operands | List of expressions on which operator is applied.| Yes when the expression type is Unary or Binary |

**Example:**

```json
"activities": [
    {
        "name": "CopyFromServiceNow",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<ServiceNow input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "ServiceNowV2Source",
                "expression": {
                    "type": "Nary",
                    "operators": [
                        "<"
                    ],
                    "operands": [
                        {
                            "type": "Field",
                            "value": "u_founded"
                        },
                        {
                            "type": "Constant",
                            "value": "2000"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

### Using expression parameters

You can configure the expression parameter in **Query builder** by selecting **Add dynamic content**. The parameter type should be **Object**, and the value should follow the format shown in the example JSON below:

```json
 {
	"type": "Nary",
	"operators": [
		"="
	],
	"operands": [
		{
			"type": "Field",
			"value": "col"
		},
		{
			"type": "Constant",
			"value": "val"
		}
	]
}
```

Here is an example of the source JSON using the expression parameter:

```json
"activities": [
    {
        "name": "CopyFromServiceNow",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<ServiceNow input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "ServiceNowV2Source",
                "expression": {
                    "type": "Expression",
                    "value": "@pipeline().parameters.expressionParameter"
                }
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Lookup activity properties

To learn details about the properties, check [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md).

## <a name="upgrade-your-servicenow-linked-service"></a> Upgrade the ServiceNow connector

Here are the steps that help you to upgrade your ServiceNow connector:

1. Create a new linked service by referring to [Linked service properties](#linked-service-properties).
2. **Query** in source is upgraded to **Query builder**, which has the same usage as the condition builder in ServiceNow. Learn how to configure it referring to [ServiceNow as source](#servicenow-as-source).

## Differences between ServiceNow and ServiceNow (legacy)

The ServiceNow connector offers new functionalities and is compatible with most features of ServiceNow (legacy) connector. The table below shows the feature differences between ServiceNow and ServiceNow (legacy).

| ServiceNow | ServiceNow (legacy) | 
|:--- |:--- |
| useEncryptedEndpoints, useHostVerification and usePeerVerification are not supported in the linked service. | Support useEncryptedEndpoints, useHostVerification and usePeerVerification in the linked service. | 
| Support **Query builder** in the source. | **Query builder** is not supported in the source. | 
| SQL-based queries are not supported. | Support SQL-based queries. | 
| sortBy queries are not supported in **Query builder**. | Support sortBy queries in **Query**. | 
| You can view the schema in the dataset. | You can't view the schema in the dataset. |
