# Quickstart: Use the Copy Data tool in Azure Data Factory Studio to copy data

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-xxx-md](includes/appliesto-adf-xxx-md.md)]

In this quickstart, you use the Copy Data tool in Azure Data Factory Studio to create a pipeline that copies data from a source folder in Azure Blob Storage to a target folder.

## Prerequisites

### Azure subscription

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

### Prepare source data in Azure Blob Storage

To prepare source data by using a template:

1. Select the following button.

   [![Try your first data factory demo](./media/quickstart-get-started/try-it-now.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2Fquickstarts%2Fmicrosoft.datafactory%2Fdata-factory-copy-data-tool%2Fazuredeploy.json)

1. You're directed to the configuration page to deploy the template. On this page:

   1. For **Resource group**, select **Create new** to create a resource group. You can leave all the other values with their defaults.

   1. Select **Review + create**, and then select **Create** to deploy the resources.

> [!NOTE]
> The user who deploys the template needs to assign a role to a managed identity. This step requires permissions that can be granted through the Owner, User Access Administrator, or Managed Identity Operator role.

A new Blob Storage account is created in the new resource group. The moviesDB2.csv file is stored in a folder called **input** in Blob Storage.

### Create a data factory

You can use your existing data factory, or you can create a new one as described in [Quickstart: Create a data factory](quickstart-create-data-factory.md).

## Use the Copy Data tool to copy data

The Copy Data tool has five pages that walk you through the task of copying data. To start the tool:

1. In [Azure Data Factory Studio](https://adf.azure.com), go to your data factory.

1. Select the **Ingest** tile.

:::image type="content" source="./media/doc-common-process/get-started-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the page for a data factory and the Ingest tile in Azure Data Factory Studio.":::

### Step 1: Select the task type

1. On the **Properties** page of the Copy Data tool, choose **Built-in copy task** under **Task type**.

1. Select **Next**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-hello-world-copy-data-tool/copy-data-tool-properties-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Properties page of the Copy Data tool.":::

### Step 2: Complete source configuration

1. On the **Source** page of the Copy Data tool, select **+ Create new connection** to add a connection.

1. Select the linked service type that you want to create for the source connection. (The example in this quickstart uses **Azure Blob Storage**.) Then select **Continue**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-hello-world-copy-data-tool/select-blob-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the gallery of service types in the dialog for a new connection, with Azure Blob Storage selected.":::

1. In the **New connection (Azure Blob Storage)** dialog:
   1. For **Name**, specify a name for your connection.
   1. Under **Account selection method**, select **From Azure subscription**.
   1. In the **Azure subscription** list, select your Azure subscription.
   1. In the **Storage account name** list, select your storage account.
   1. Select **Test connection** and confirm that the connection is successful.
   1. Select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-hello-world-copy-data-tool/configure-blob-storage.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows configuration details for an Azure Blob Storage account.":::

1. Under **Source data store**:

   1. For **Connection**, select the newly created connection.
   1. In the **File or folder** section, select **Browse** to go to the **adftutorial/input** folder. Select the **moviesDB2.csv** file, and then select **OK**.
   1. Select the **Binary copy** checkbox to copy the file as is.
   1. Select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-hello-world-copy-data-tool/source-data-store.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows settings for a source data store.":::

### Step 3: Complete destination configuration

1. On the **Target** page of the Copy Data tool, for **Connection**, select the **AzureBlobStorage** connection that you created.

1. In the **Folder path** section, enter **adftutorial/output**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-hello-world-copy-data-tool/destination-data-store.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows settings for a destination data store.":::

1. Leave other settings as default. Select **Next**.

### Step 4: Enter a name and description for the pipeline

1. On the **Settings** page of the Copy Data tool, specify a name for the pipeline and its description.
1. Select **Next** to use other default configurations.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-hello-world-copy-data-tool/settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Settings page of the Copy Data tool.":::

### Step 5: Review settings and deploy

1. On the **Review and finish** page, review all settings.

1. Select **Next**.

The **Deployment complete** page shows whether the deployment is successful.

## Monitor the running results

After you finish copying the data, you can monitor the pipeline that you created:

1. On the **Deployment complete** page, select **Monitor**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-hello-world-copy-data-tool/deployment-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the page that that shows a completed deployment.":::

1. The application switches to the **Monitor** tab, which shows the status of the pipeline. Select **Refresh** to refresh the list of pipelines. Select the link under **Pipeline name** to view activity run details or to rerun the pipeline.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-hello-world-copy-data-tool/refresh-pipeline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the button for refreshing the list of pipelines.":::

1. On the page that shows the details of the activity run, select the **Details** link (eyeglasses icon) in the **Activity name** column for more details about the copy operation. For information about the properties, see the [overview article about the copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md).
