# Window functions in mapping data flow

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

[!INCLUDE[data-flow-preamble](includes/data-flow-preamble.md)]

The following articles provide details about window functions supported by Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics in mapping data flows.

## Window function list

The following functions are only available in window transformations.

| Window function | Task |
|----|----|
| [cumeDist](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#cumeDist) | The CumeDist function computes the position of a value relative to all values in the partition. The result is the number of rows preceding or equal to the current row in the ordering of the partition divided by the total number of rows in the window partition. Any tie values in the  ordering will evaluate to the same position.  |
| [denseRank](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#denseRank) | Computes the rank of a value in a group of values specified in a window's order by clause. The result is one plus the number of rows preceding or equal to the current row in the ordering of the partition. The values will not produce gaps in the sequence. Dense Rank works even when data is not sorted and looks for change in values.  |
| [lag](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#lag) | Gets the value of the first parameter evaluated n rows before the current row. The second parameter is the number of rows to look back and the default value is 1. If there are not as many rows a value of null is returned unless a default value is specified.  |
| [lead](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#lead) | Gets the value of the first parameter evaluated n rows after the current row. The second parameter is the number of rows to look forward and the default value is 1. If there are not as many rows a value of null is returned unless a default value is specified.  |
| [nTile](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#nTile) | The ```NTile``` function divides the rows for each window partition into `n` buckets ranging from 1 to at most `n`. Bucket values will differ by at most 1. If the number of rows in the partition does not divide evenly into the number of buckets, then the remainder values are distributed one per bucket, starting with the first bucket. The ```NTile``` function is useful for the calculation of ```tertiles```, quartiles, deciles, and other common summary statistics. The function calculates two variables during initialization: The size of a regular bucket will have one extra row added to it. Both variables are based on the size of the current partition. During the calculation process the function keeps track of the current row number, the current bucket number, and the row number at which the bucket will change (bucketThreshold). When the current row number reaches bucket threshold, the bucket value is increased by one and the threshold is increased by the bucket size (plus one extra if the current bucket is padded).  |
| [rank](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#rank) | Computes the rank of a value in a group of values specified in a window's order by clause. The result is one plus the number of rows preceding or equal to the current row in the ordering of the partition. The values will produce gaps in the sequence. Rank works even when data is not sorted and looks for change in values.  |
| [rowNumber](data-flow-expressions-usage.md#rowNumber) | Assigns a sequential row numbering for rows in a window starting with 1.  |
