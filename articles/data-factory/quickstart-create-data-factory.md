# Quickstart: Create a data factory

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-xxx-md](includes/appliesto-adf-xxx-md.md)]

This quickstart describes how to use either [Azure Data Factory Studio](https://adf.azure.com) or the [Azure portal UI](https://portal.azure.com) to create a data factory.

If you're new to Azure Data Factory, see the [introduction to the service](introduction.md) before you try this quickstart.

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- Make sure that you have the required Azure roles to create a data factory. For more information, see [Roles and permissions for Azure Data Factory](concepts-roles-permissions.md).

## Create a data factory in Azure Data Factory Studio

By using Azure Data Factory Studio, you can create a data factory in seconds:

1. Open the Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome web browser. Currently, the Data Factory UI is supported only in these browsers.

1. Go to [Azure Data Factory Studio](https://adf.azure.com) and select the **Create a new data factory** option.

1. You can use the default values for the new data factory. Or you can choose a unique name, a preferred location, and a specific subscription. When you finish with these details, select **Create**.

After you create a data factory, you can go to it from the home page of Azure Data Factory Studio.

## Create a data factory in the Azure portal

When you use the Azure portal to create a data factory, the creation options are more advanced:

1. Open the Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome web browser. Currently, the Data Factory UI is supported only in these browsers.

1. Go to the [page for data factories in the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#browse/Microsoft.DataFactory%2FdataFactories).

1. Select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-create-data-factory/data-factory-create-from-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create button on the Azure portal page for data factories.":::

1. For **Resource group**, take one of the following steps:
   - Select an existing resource group from the dropdown list.
   - Select **Create new**, and then enter the name of a new resource group.

   To learn about resource groups, see [What is a resource group?](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md#resource-groups).

1. For **Region**, select the location for the data factory.

   The list shows only locations that Data Factory supports, and where your Data Factory metadata will be stored. The associated data stores (like Azure Storage and Azure SQL Database) and computes (like Azure HDInsight) that Data Factory uses can run in other regions.

1. For **Name**, enter **ADFTutorialDataFactory**.

   The name of the data factory must be *globally unique*. If you see the following error, change the name of the data factory (for example, to **\<yourname\>ADFTutorialDataFactory**) and try creating it again. To learn about naming rules for Data Factory artifacts, see [Data Factory naming rules](naming-rules.md).

1. For **Version**, select **V2**.

1. Select **Review + create**. After your configuration passes validation, select **Create**.

1. After the creation is complete, select **Go to resource**.

1. On the page for your data factory, select **Launch Studio** to open Azure Data Factory Studio. Then, start the Azure Data Factory UI application on a separate browser tab.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the web browser is stuck at **Authorizing**, clear the **Block third-party cookies and site data** checkbox. Or keep it selected, create an exception for **login.microsoftonline.com**, and then try to open the app again.
