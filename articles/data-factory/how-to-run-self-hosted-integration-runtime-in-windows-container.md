# How to run Self-Hosted Integration Runtime in Windows container

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

Azure Data Factory provides Windows container support for the Self-Hosted Integration Runtime. You can [download the Docker Build source code](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Data-Factory-Integration-Runtime-in-Windows-Container) and combine the building and running process in your own continuous delivery pipeline. 

> [!TIP]
> This article explains how to run the Self-Hosted Integration Runtime in a Windows container on a compatible physical or virtual machine. If you don't want to manage infrastructure, you can run the Self-Hosted Integration Runtime on Azure App Service. For more information, see the [Azure Data Factory self-hosted integration runtime on App Service](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-data-factory-runtime-app-service) sample.

## Prerequisites 

- [Windows container requirements](/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/system-requirements)
- Docker version 2.3 or later 
- Self-Hosted Integration Runtime Version 5.2.7713.1 or later

## Get started 

1. [Install Docker and enable Windows containers.](/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment)

1. [Download the container image source code from GitHub.](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Data-Factory-Integration-Runtime-in-Windows-Container)

1. If you need to use a specific version of the SHIR, you can download it and move it to the *SHIR* folder.

   Otherwise, skip this step. The container image build process will download the latest version of the SHIR automatically.

1. Open your folder in the shell: 

   ```console
   cd "yourFolderPath"
   ```

1. Build the Windows container image:

   ```console
   docker build . -t "yourDockerImageName" 
   ```

1. Run the container with specific arguments by passing environment variables:

   ```console
    docker run -d -e AUTH_KEY=<ir-authentication-key> \
    [-e NODE_NAME=<ir-node-name>] \
    [-e ENABLE_HA={true|false}] \
    [-e HA_PORT=<port>] \
    [-e ENABLE_AE={true|false}] \
    [-e AE_TIME=<expiration-time-in-seconds>] \
    <yourDockerImageName>   
   ```

|Name|Necessity|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_KEY` | Required | | The authentication key for the self-hosted integration runtime. |
| `NODE_NAME` | Optional | `hostname` | The specified name of the node. |
| `ENABLE_HA` | Optional | `false` | The flag to enable high availability and scalability.<br/> It supports up to 4 nodes registered to the same IR when `HA` is enabled, otherwise only 1 is allowed. |
| `HA_PORT` | Optional | `8060` | The port to set up a high availability cluster. |
| `ENABLE_AE` | Optional | `false` | The flag to enable offline nodes auto-expiration.<br/> If enabled, the expired nodes will be removed automatically from the IR when a new node is attempting to register.<br/> Only works when `ENABLE_HA=true`. |
| `AE_TIME` | Optional | `600` |  The expiration timeout duration for offline nodes in seconds. <br/>Should be no less than 600 (10 minutes). |


## Container health check

After the 120 second startup period, the health check runs periodically every 30 seconds. It provides the SHIR's health status to the container engine.

## Limitations

Currently we don't support the below features when running the Self-Hosted Integration Runtime in Windows containers:

- HTTP proxy 
- Encrypted node-node communication with TLS/SSL certificate 
- Generate and import backup 
- Daemon service 
- Auto-update
