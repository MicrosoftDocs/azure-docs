# Copy data from QuickBooks Online using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from QuickBooks Online. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector version 1.0 is currently in preview. You can try it out and give us feedback. If you want to take a dependency on preview connectors in your solution, please contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The QuickBooks connector version 2.0 provides improved native QuickBooks support. If you are using QuickBooks connector version 1.0 in your solution, please [upgrade the QuickBooks connector](#upgrade-the-quickbooks-connector-from-version-10-to-version-20) before **August 31, 2025**. Refer to this [section](#quickbooks-connector-lifecycle-and-upgrade) for details on the difference between version 2.0 and version 1.0.

### Handling refresh tokens for the linked service

When you use the QuickBooks Online connector in a linked service, it's important to manage OAuth 2.0 refresh tokens from QuickBooks correctly. The linked service uses a refresh token to obtain new access tokens. However, QuickBooks Online periodically updates the refresh token, invalidating the previous one. The linked service does not automatically update the refresh token in Azure Key Vault, so you need to manage updating the refresh token to ensure uninterrupted connectivity. Otherwise you might encounter authentication failures once the refresh token expires.

You can manually update the refresh token in Azure Key Vault based on QuickBooks Online's refresh token expiry policy. But another approach is to automate updates with a scheduled task or [Azure Function](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/serverless-keyvault-secret-rotation-handling) that checks for a new refresh token and updates it in Azure Key Vault.

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by QuickBooks dataset.

To copy data from QuickBooks Online, set the type property of the dataset to **QuickBooksObject**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **QuickBooksObject** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "QuickBooksDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "QuickBooksObject",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<QuickBooks linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by QuickBooks source.

### QuickBooks as source

To copy data from QuickBooks Online, set the source type in the copy activity to **QuickBooksSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **QuickBooksSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. <br><br>For version 2.0, you can only use QuickBooks native query with limitations. For more information, see [query operations and syntax](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/learn/explore-the-quickbooks-online-api/data-queries). Note that the `tableName` specified in the query must match the `tableName` in the dataset. <br><br>For version 1.0, you can use SQL-92 query. For example: `"SELECT * FROM "Bill" WHERE Id = '123'"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromQuickBooks",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<QuickBooks input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "QuickBooksSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM \"Bill\" WHERE Id = '123' "
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
## Copy data from Quickbooks Desktop

The Copy Activity in the service cannot copy data directly from Quickbooks Desktop. To copy data from Quickbooks Desktop, export your Quickbooks data to a comma-separated-values (CSV) file and then upload the file to Azure Blob Storage. From there, you can use the service to copy the data to the sink of your choice.

## Data type mapping for Quickbooks

When you copy data from Quickbooks, the following mappings apply from Quickbooks's data types to the internal data types used by the service. To learn about how the copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink, see [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md).

| Quickbooks data type | Interim service data type (for version 2.0) | Interim service data type (for version 1.0) |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| String| string| string |
| Boolean | bool | bool |
| DateTime | datetime | datetime |
| Decimal | decimal (15,2)  | decimal (15, 2) |
| Enum | string | string |
| Date | datetime | datetime |
| BigDecimal | decimal (15,2) | decimal (15, 2) |
| Integer | int | int |

## Lookup activity properties

To learn details about the properties, check [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md).

## Quickbooks connector lifecycle and upgrade

The following table shows the release stage and change logs for different versions of the QuickBooks connector:

| Version  | Release stage | Change log |  
| :----------- | :------- |:------- |
| Version 1.0 | End of support announced | / |  
| Version 2.0 | GA version available | • Support Quickbooks native query with limitations. GROUP BY clauses, JOIN clauses and Aggregate Function (Avg, Max, Sum) aren't supported. For more information, see [query operations and syntax](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/learn/explore-the-quickbooks-online-api/data-queries). <br><br>• The `tableName` specified in the `query` must match the `tableName` in the dataset. <br><br>• SQL-92 query is not supported. <br><br>• `useEncryptedEndpoints` is not supported.  |

### <a name="upgrade-the-quickbooks-connector-from-version-10-to-version-20"></a> Upgrade the Quickbooks connector from version 1.0 to version 2.0

1. In **Edit linked service** page, select 2.0 for version. For more information, see [linked service version 2.0 properties](#version-20).
1. If you use SQL query in the copy activity source or the lookup activity that refers to the version 1.0 linked service, you need to convert them to the QuickBooks native query. Learn more about native query from [Quickbooks as a source type](#quickbooks-as-source) and [query operations and syntax](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/learn/explore-the-quickbooks-online-api/data-queries).
