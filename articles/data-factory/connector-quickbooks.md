# Copy data from QuickBooks Online using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics (Preview)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from QuickBooks Online. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is currently in preview. You can try it out and give us feedback. If you want to take a dependency on preview connectors in your solution, please contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/).

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to QuickBooks connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for QuickBooks linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **QuickBooks** | Yes |
| connectionProperties | A group of properties that defines how to connect to QuickBooks. | Yes |
| ***Under `connectionProperties`:*** | | |
| endpoint | The endpoint of the QuickBooks Online server. (that is, quickbooks.api.intuit.com)  | Yes |
| companyId | The company ID of the QuickBooks company to authorize. For info about how to find the company ID, see [How do I find my Company ID](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/community/Getting-Started/How-do-I-find-my-Company-ID/m-p/185551). | Yes |
| consumerKey | The client ID of your QuickBooks Online application for OAuth 2.0 authentication. Learn more from [here](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization/oauth-2.0#obtain-oauth2-credentials-for-your-app). | Yes |
| consumerSecret | The client secret of your QuickBooks Online application for OAuth 2.0 authentication. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| refreshToken | The OAuth 2.0 refresh token associated with the QuickBooks application. Learn more from [here](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization/oauth-2.0#obtain-oauth2-credentials-for-your-app). Note refresh token will be expired after 180 days. Customer need to regularly update the refresh token. <br/>Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md).| Yes |
| useEncryptedEndpoints | Specifies whether the data source endpoints are encrypted using HTTPS. The default value is true.  | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "QuickBooksLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "QuickBooks",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionProperties": {
                "endpoint": "quickbooks.api.intuit.com",
                "companyId": "<company id>",
                "consumerKey": "<consumer key>", 
                "consumerSecret": {
                     "type": "SecureString",
                     "value": "<clientSecret>"
            	},
                "refreshToken": {
                     "type": "SecureString",
                     "value": "<refresh token>"
            	},
                "useEncryptedEndpoints": true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Handling refresh tokens for the linked service

When you use the QuickBooks Online connector in a linked service, it's important to manage OAuth 2.0 refresh tokens from QuickBooks correctly. The linked service uses a refresh token to obtain new access tokens. However, QuickBooks Online periodically updates the refresh token, invalidating the previous one. The linked service does not automatically update the refresh token in Azure Key Vault, so you need to manage updating the refresh token to ensure uninterrupted connectivity. Otherwise you might encounter authentication failures once the refresh token expires.

You can manually update the refresh token in Azure Key Vault based on QuickBooks Online's refresh token expiry policy. But another approach is to automate updates with a scheduled task or [Azure Function](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/serverless-keyvault-secret-rotation-handling) that checks for a new refresh token and updates it in Azure Key Vault.

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by QuickBooks dataset.

To copy data from QuickBooks Online, set the type property of the dataset to **QuickBooksObject**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **QuickBooksObject** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "QuickBooksDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "QuickBooksObject",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<QuickBooks linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by QuickBooks source.

### QuickBooks as source

To copy data from QuickBooks Online, set the source type in the copy activity to **QuickBooksSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **QuickBooksSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM "Bill" WHERE Id = '123'"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromQuickBooks",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<QuickBooks input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "QuickBooksSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM \"Bill\" WHERE Id = '123' "
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
## Copy data from Quickbooks Desktop

The Copy Activity in the service cannot copy data directly from Quickbooks Desktop. To copy data from Quickbooks Desktop, export your Quickbooks data to a comma-separated-values (CSV) file and then upload the file to Azure Blob Storage. From there, you can use the service to copy the data to the sink of your choice.

## Lookup activity properties

To learn details about the properties, check [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md).
