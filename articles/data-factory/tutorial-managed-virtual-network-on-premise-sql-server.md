# Tutorial: How to access on-premises SQL Server from Data Factory Managed VNet using Private Endpoint

This tutorial provides steps for using the Azure portal to setup Private Link Service and access on-premises SQL Server from a managed virtual network using a private endpoint. Using a managed virtual network ensures that traffic to and from your on-premises SQL source will all pass through your own private endpoint, thereby securing exposure to the public cloud with an extra layer of security and isolation. The required resources mentioned below are necessary to support the scenario.

> [!NOTE]
> The solution presented in this article describes SQL Server connectivity, but you can use a similar approach to connect and query other available [on-premises connectors](connector-overview.md) that are supported in Azure Data Factory.

## Prerequisites

* **Azure subscription**. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* **Virtual Network**. If you don’t have a Virtual Network, create one following [Create Virtual Network](../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md).
* **Virtual network to on-premises network**. Create a connection between virtual network and on-premises network either using [ExpressRoute](../expressroute/expressroute-howto-linkvnet-portal-resource-manager.md?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json) or [VPN](../vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal.md?toc=/azure/virtual-network/toc.json). If you prefer to use a cloud virtual machine in a private network, you can do this as well. Just create a virtual network for your cloud virtual machines and a [private link to the virtual network](/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview) and you can access them as if they were on-premises machines in your private network even though they are hosted in the cloud.
* **Data Factory with Managed VNet enabled**. If you don’t have a Data Factory or Managed VNet is not enabled, create one following [Create Data Factory with Managed VNet](tutorial-copy-data-portal-private.md).

## Create subnets for resources

**Use the portal to create subnets in your virtual network.**

| Subnet | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
|be-subnet |subnet for backend servers|
|fe-subnet |subnet for standard internal load balancer|
|pls-subnet|subnet for Private Link Service|

:::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-managed-virtual-network/subnets.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the subnets." lightbox="./media/tutorial-managed-virtual-network/subnets-expanded.png":::

## Create a standard load balancer

Use the portal to create a standard internal load balancer.

1. On the top left-hand side of the screen, select **Create a resource > Networking > Load Balancer**.
2. In the **Basics** tab of the **Create load balancer** page, enter, or select the following information:

    | Setting | Value |
    |:--- |:--- |
    |Subscription|Select your subscription.|
    |Resource group|Select your resource group.|
    |Name|Enter **myLoadBalancer**.|
    |Region|Select **East US**.|
    |Type|Select **Internal**.|
    |SKU|Select **Standard**.|
    |Virtual network|Select your virtual network.|
    |Subnet|Select **fe-subnet** created in the previous step.|
    |IP address assignment|Select **Dynamic**.|
    |Availability zone|Select **Zone-redundant**.|

3. Accept the defaults for the remaining settings, and then select **Review + create**.
4. In the **Review + create** tab, select **Create**.

## Create load balancer resources

### Create a backend pool

A backend address pool contains the IP addresses of the virtual (NICs) connected to the load balancer.

Create the backend address pool **myBackendPool** to include virtual machines for load-balancing internet traffic.

1. Select **All services** in the left-hand menu, select **All resources**, and then select **myLoadBalancer** from the resources list.
2. Under **Settings**, select **Backend pools**, then select **Add**.
3. On the **Add a backend pool** page, for name, type **myBackendPool**, as the name for your backend pool, and then select **Add**.

### Create a health probe

The load balancer monitors the status of your app with a health probe.

The health probe adds or removes VMs from the load balancer based on their response to health checks.

Create a health probe named **myHealthProbe** to monitor the health of the VMs.

1. Select **All services** in the left-hand menu, select **All resources**, and then select **myLoadBalancer** from the resources list.
2. Under **Settings**, select **Health probes**, then select **Add**.

    | Setting | Value |
    |:--- |:--- |
    |Name|Enter **myHealthProbe**.|
    |Protocol|Select **TCP**.|
    |Port|Enter 22.|
    |Interval|Enter **15** for number of **Interval** in seconds between probe attempts.|
    |Unhealthy threshold|Select **2** for number of **Unhealthy threshold** or consecutive probe failures that must occur before a VM is considered unhealthy.|

3. Leave the rest the defaults and select **OK**.

### Create a load balancer rule

A load balancer rule is used to define how traffic is distributed to the VMs. You define 
the frontend IP configuration for the incoming traffic and the backend IP pool to receive 
the traffic. The source and destination port are defined in the rule.

In this section, you'll create a load balancer rule:

1. Select **All services** in the left-hand menu, select **All resources**, and then select **myLoadBalancer** from the resources list.
2. Under **Settings**, select **Load-balancing rules**, then select **Add**.
3. Use these values to configure the load-balancing rule:

    | Setting | Value |
    |:--- |:--- |
    |Name|Enter **myRule**.|
    |IP Version|Select **IPv4**.|
    |Frontend IP address|Select **LoadBalancerFrontEnd**.|
    |Protocol|Select **TCP**.|
    |Port|Enter **1433**.|
    |Backend port|Enter **1433**.|
    |Backend pool|Select **myBackendPool**.|
    |Health probe|Select **myHealthProbe**.|
    |Idle timeout (minutes)|Move the slider to **15** minutes.|
    |TCP reset|Select **Disabled**.|

4. Leave the rest of the defaults and then select **OK**.

## Create a private link service

In this section, you'll create a Private Link service behind a standard load balancer.

1. On the upper-left part of the page in the Azure portal, select **Create a resource**.
2. Search for **Private Link** in the **Search the Marketplace** box.
3. Select **Create**.
4. In **Overview** under **Private Link Center**, select the blue **Create private link service** button.

    |Name  |Enter **myPrivateLinkService**.|
    |Region  |Select **East US**.|

6. Select the **Outbound settings** tab or select **Next: Outbound settings** at the 
bottom of the page.
7. In the **Outbound settings** tab, enter or select the following information:

    | Setting | Value |
    |:--- |:--- |
    |Load balancer|Select **myLoadBalancer**.|
    |Load balancer frontend IP address|Select **LoadBalancerFrontEnd**.|
    |Source NAT subnet|Select **pls-subnet**.|
    |Enable TCP proxy V2|Leave the default of **No**.|
    |**Private IP address settings**||
    |Leave the default settings.||

8. Select the **Access security** tab or select **Next: Access security** at the bottom of 
the page.
9. Leave the default of **Role-based access control only** in the **Access security** tab.
10. Select the **Tags** tab or select **Next: Tags** at the bottom of the page.

5. Select **Review + create**.
6. Review the settings, and then select **Create**.
7. You can repeat step 1 to 6 to have more than 1 backend server VM for HA.

## Creating Forwarding Rule to Endpoint

1. Login and copy script [ip_fwd.sh](https://github.com/sajitsasi/az-ip-fwd/blob/main/ip_fwd.sh) to your backend server VMs. 

2. Run the script with the following options:
   
    ```bash
    sudo ./ip_fwd.sh -i eth0 -f 1433 -a <FQDN/IP> -b 1433
    ```
   Set the placeholder `<FQDN/IP>` is your target SQL Server IP.
    
    > [!NOTE] 
    > FQDN doesn't work for on-premises SQL Server unless you add a record in Azure DNS zone.
    
4. Run the following command and check the iptables in your backend server VMs. You can see one record in your iptables with your target IP.<br/>

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -t nat -v -L PREROUTING -n --line-number**
   ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have more than one SQL Server or data sources, you need to define multiple load balancer rules and IP table records with different ports. Otherwise, there will be some conflict. For example,<br/>
    >
    > |                  |Port in load balancer rule|Backend port in load balance rule|Command run in backend server VM|
    > |------------------|---------|--------|---------|
    > |**SQL Server 1**|1433 |1433 |sudo ./ip_fwd.sh -i eth0 -f 1433 -a <FQDN/IP> -b 1433|
    > |**SQL Server 2**|1434 |1434 |sudo ./ip_fwd.sh -i eth0 -f 1434 -a <FQDN/IP> -b 1433|

    > [!NOTE]
    > It's important to be aware that the configuration within the virtual machine (VM) is not permanent. This means that each time the VM restarts, it will require reconfiguration.

## Create a Private Endpoint to Private Link Service

1. Select All services in the left-hand menu, select All resources, and then select your 
data factory from the resources list.
2. Select **Author & Monitor** to launch the Data Factory UI in a separate tab.
3. Go to the **Manage** tab and then go to the **Managed private endpoints** section.
4. Select + **New** under **Managed private endpoints**.
5. Select the **Private Link Service** tile from the list and select **Continue**.
6. Enter the name of private endpoint and select **myPrivateLinkService** in private link service list.
7. Add the `<FQDN>` of your target on-premises SQL Server.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-managed-virtual-network/private-endpoint-6.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the private endpoint settings.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > When deploying your SQL Server on a virtual machine within a virtual network, it is essential to enhance your FQDN by appending **privatelink**. Otherwise, it will be conflicted with other records in the DNS setting. For example, you can simply modify the SQL Server's FQDN from **sqlserver.westus.cloudapp.azure.net** to **sqlserver.privatelink.westus.cloudapp.azure.net**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Currently ApplicationIntent and MultiSubnetFailover are not supported in SQL connection properties.

8. Create private endpoint.

## Create a linked service and test the connection

1. Go to the **Manage** tab and then go to the **Linked services** section.
2. Select + **New** under **Linked Service**.
3. Select the **SQL Server** tile from the list and select **Continue**.    

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-managed-virtual-network/linked-service-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the linked service creation page.":::   

4. Enable **Interactive Authoring**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-managed-virtual-network/linked-service-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to enable Interactive Authoring.":::

5. Input the **FQDN** of your on-premises SQL Server, **user name** and **password**.
6. Then click **Test connection**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-managed-virtual-network/linked-service-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the SQL server linked service creation page.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have more than one SQL Server and need to define multiple load balancer rules and IP table records with different ports, make sure you explicitly add the port name after the FQDN when you edit Linked Service. The NAT VM will handle the port translation. If it's not explicitly specified, the connection will always time-out.

## Troubleshooting

Go to the backend server VM, confirm telnet the SQL Server works: **telnet **<**FQDN**>** 1433**.
