#  Transform data in TeamDesk (Preview) using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use Data Flow to transform data in TeamDesk (Preview). To learn more, read the introductory article for [Azure Data Factory](introduction.md) or [Azure Synapse Analytics](../synapse-analytics/overview-what-is.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is currently in preview. You can try it out and give us feedback. If you want to take a dependency on preview connectors in your solution, please contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/).

## Supported capabilities

This TeamDesk connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Mapping data flow](concepts-data-flow-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; |

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks, see the [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores) table.

## Create a TeamDesk linked service using UI

Use the following steps to create a TeamDesk linked service in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then select New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide information about properties that are used to define Data Factory and Synapse pipeline entities specific to TeamDesk.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for the TeamDesk linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to **TeamDesk**. |Yes |
| url | The URL of your TeamDesk database. An example is `https://www.teamdesk.net/secure/db/xxxxx`. | Yes |
| authenticationType | Type of authentication used to connect to the TeamDesk service. Allowed values are **basic** and **token**. Refer to corresponding sections below on more properties and examples respectively.|Yes |

### Basic authentication

Set the **authenticationType** property to **basic**. In addition to the generic properties that are described in the preceding section, specify the following properties:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| userName | The user name used to log in to TeamDesk. |Yes  |
| password | Specify a password for the user account you specified for the user name. Mark this field as **SecureString** to store it securely. Or, you can [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). |Yes  |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "TeamDeskLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "TeamDesk",
        "typeProperties": {
            "url": "https://www.teamdesk.net/secure/db/xxxxx",
            "authenticationType": "basic",
            "userName": "<user name>",
            "password": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<password>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Token authentication

Set the **authenticationType** property to **token**. In addition to the generic properties that are described in the preceding section, specify the following properties:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| apiToken | Specify an API token for the TeamDesk. Mark this field as **SecureString** to store it securely. Or, you can [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). |Yes |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "TeamDeskLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "TeamDesk",
        "typeProperties": {
            "url": "https://www.teamdesk.net/secure/db/xxxxx",
            "authenticationType": "token",
            "apiToken": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<API token>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Mapping data flow properties

When transforming data in mapping data flow, you can read tables from TeamDesk. For more information, see the [source transformation](data-flow-source.md) in mapping data flows. You can only use an [inline dataset](data-flow-source.md#inline-datasets) as source type.

### Source transformation

The below table lists the properties supported by TeamDesk source. You can edit these properties in the **Source options** tab.

| Name | Description | Required | Allowed values | Data flow script property |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Table | Data flow will fetch all the data from the table specified in the source options. | Yes when use inline mode| - | table |
| View | Data flow will fetch the specified view in the table specified in the source options.| No | - | view |

#### TeamDesk source script examples

```
source(allowSchemaDrift: true,
	validateSchema: false,
	store: 'teamdesk',
	format: 'rest',
	table: 'Table',
	view: 'View') ~> TeamDesksource
```
