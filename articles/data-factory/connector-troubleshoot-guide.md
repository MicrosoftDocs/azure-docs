## General copy activity errors

The following errors are general to the copy activity and could occur with any connector.

#### <a name="error-code-usererrorodbcoperationfailed"></a> Error code: 2200 - UserErrorOdbcOperationFailed

- **Message**: `The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send.`

- **Cause**: This typically indicates an authentication failure during data transfer operations. This can occur when the remote party closes the transport stream.

- **Reccomendation**:
  - Verify the source connection and test it to ensure it is functioning correctly.
  - Check the authentication method used for the connection.
  - Review firewall configuration settings for Azure Cosmos DB to ensure they allow the necessary traffic.

#### <a name="error-code-jrenotfound"></a> Error code: 20000 - JreNotFound

- **Message**: `Java Runtime Environment cannot be found on the Self-hosted Integration Runtime machine. It is required for parsing or writing to Parquet/ORC files. Make sure Java Runtime Environment has been installed on the Self-hosted Integration Runtime machine.`

- **Cause**: The self-hosted IR can't find Java Runtime. Java Runtime is required for reading particular sources.

- **Recommendation**:  Check your integration runtime environment, see [Use Self-hosted Integration Runtime](./format-parquet.md#using-self-hosted-integration-runtime).

#### <a name="error-code-jniexception"></a> Error code: 20002 - JniException

- **Message**: `An error occurred when invoking Java Native Interface.`

- **Cause**: If the error message contains "Can't create JVM: JNI return code [-6][JNI call failed: Invalid arguments.]," the possible cause is that JVM can't be created because some illegal (global) arguments are set.

- **Recommendation**: Sign in to the machine that hosts *each node* of your self-hosted integration runtime. Check to ensure that the system variable is set correctly, as follows: `_JAVA_OPTIONS "-Xms256m -Xmx16g" with memory bigger than 8G`. Restart all the integration runtime nodes, and then rerun the pipeline.

#### <a name="error-code-wildcardpathsinknotsupported"></a> Error code: 20020 - WildcardPathSinkNotSupported

- **Message**: `Wildcard in path is not supported in sink dataset. Fix the path: '%setting;'.`

- **Cause**: The sink dataset doesn't support wildcard values.

- **Recommendation**:  Check the sink dataset, and rewrite the path without using a wildcard value.


### FIPS issue

- **Symptoms**: Copy activity fails on a FIPS-enabled self-hosted IR machine with the following error message: `This implementation is not part of the Windows Platform FIPS validated cryptographic algorithms.` 

- **Cause**: This error might occur when you copy data with connectors such as Azure Blob, SFTP, and so on. Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) defines a certain set of cryptographic algorithms that are allowed to be used. When FIPS mode is enabled on the machine, some cryptographic classes that copy activity depends on are blocked in some scenarios.

- **Resolution**: Learn [why weâ€™re not recommending "FIPS Mode" anymore](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/why-we-8217-re-not-recommending-8220-fips-mode-8221-anymore/ba-p/701037), and evaluate whether you can disable FIPS on your self-hosted IR machine.

    Alternatively, if you only want to bypass FIPS and make the activity runs succeed, take the following steps:

    1. Open the folder where Self-hosted IR is installed. The path is usually *C:\Program Files\Microsoft Integration Runtime \<IR version>\Shared*.

    2. Open the *diawp.exe.config* file and then, at the end of the `<runtime>` section, add `<enforceFIPSPolicy enabled="false"/>`, as shown here:

        :::image type="content" source="./media/connector-troubleshoot-guide/disable-fips-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a section of the diawp.exe.config file showing FIPS disabled.":::

    3. Save the file, and then restart the Self-hosted IR machine.

#### <a name="error-code-getoauth2accesstokenerrorresponse"></a> Error code: 20150 - GetOAuth2AccessTokenErrorResponse

- **Message**: `Failed to get access token from your token endpoint. Error returned from your authorization server: %errorResponse;.`

- **Cause**: Your client ID or client secret is invalid, and the authentication failed in your authorization server.

- **Recommendation**: Correct all OAuth2 client credential flow settings of your authorization server.

#### <a name="error-code-failedtogetoauth2accesstoken"></a> Error code: 20151 - FailedToGetOAuth2AccessToken

- **Message**: `Failed to get access token from your token endpoint. Error message: %errorMessage;.`

- **Recommendation**: Correct all OAuth2 client credential flow settings of your authorization server.

#### <a name="error-code-oauth2accesstokentypenotsupported"></a> Error code: 20152 - OAuth2AccessTokenTypeNotSupported

- **Message**: `The token type '%tokenType;' from your authorization server is not supported, supported types: '%tokenTypes;'.`

- **Cause**: Your authorization server isn't supported.

- **Recommendation**: Use an authorization server that can return tokens with supported token types.

#### <a name="error-code-oauth2clientidcolonnotallowed"></a> Error code: 20153 - OAuth2ClientIdColonNotAllowed

- **Message**: `The character colon(:) is not allowed in clientId for OAuth2ClientCredential authentication.`

- **Cause**: Your client ID includes the invalid character colon (`:`).

- **Recommendation**: Use a valid client ID.

#### <a name="error-code-managedidentitycredentialobjectnotsupported"></a> Error code: 20523 - ManagedIdentityCredentialObjectNotSupported

- **Message**: `Managed identity credential is not supported in this version ('%version;') of Self Hosted Integration Runtime.`

#### <a name="error-code-querymissingformatsettingsindataset"></a> Error code: 20551 - QueryMissingFormatSettingsInDataset

- **Message**: `The format settings are missing in dataset %dataSetName;.`

- **Cause**: The dataset type is Binary, which isn't supported.

- **Recommendation**: Use the DelimitedText, Json, Avro, Orc, or Parquet dataset instead.

- **Cause**: For the file storage, the format settings are missing in the dataset.

- **Recommendation**: Deselect the "Binary copy" in the dataset, and set correct format settings.

## General connector errors

#### <a name="error-code-usererrorodbcinvalidquerystring"></a> Error code: 9611 - UserErrorOdbcInvalidQueryString

- **Message**: `The following ODBC Query is not valid: '%'.`
 
- **Cause**: You provide a wrong or invalid query to fetch the data/schemas.

- **Recommendation**: Verify your query is valid and can return data/schemas. Use [Script activity](transform-data-using-script.md) if you want to execute nonquery scripts and your data store is supported. Alternatively, consider to use stored procedure that returns a dummy result to execute your nonquery scripts.

#### Error code: 11775

- **Message**: `Failed to connect to your instance of Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server. '%'`
 
- **Cause**: Exact cause depends on the text returned in `'%'`. If it's **The operation has timed out**, it can be because the instance of PostgreSQL is stopped or because the network connectivity method configured for your instance doesn't allow connections from the Integration Runtime selected. User or password provided is incorrect. If it's **28P01: password authentication failed for user &lt;youruser&gt;**, it means that the user provided doesn't exist in the instance or that the password is incorrect. If it's **28000: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "*###.###.###.###*", user "&lt;youruser&gt;", database "&lt;yourdatabase&gt;", no encryption**, it means that the encryption method selected isn't compatible with the configuration of the server.

- **Recommendation**: Confirm that the user provided exists in your instance of PostgreSQL and that the password corresponds to the one currently assigned to that user. Make sure that the encryption method selected is accepted by your instance of PostgreSQL, based on its current configuration. If the network connectivity method of your instance is configured for Private access (virtual network integration), use a Self-Hosted Integration Runtime (IR) to connect to it. If it's configured for Public access (allowed IP addresses), it's recommended to use an Azure IR with managed virtual network and deploy a managed private endpoint to connect to your instance. When it's configured for Public access (allowed IP addresses) a less recommended alternative consists in creating firewall rules in your instance to allow traffic originating on the IP addresses used by the Azure IR you're using.
