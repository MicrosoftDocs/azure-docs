# Copy activity in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics


[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

In Azure Data Factory and Synapse pipelines, you can use the Copy activity to copy data among data stores located on-premises and in the cloud. After you copy the data, you can use other activities to further transform and analyze it. You can also use the Copy activity to publish transformation and analysis results for business intelligence (BI) and application consumption.

:::image type="content" source="media/copy-activity-overview/copy-activity.png" alt-text="The role of the Copy activity":::

The Copy activity is executed on an [integration runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md). You can use different types of integration runtimes for different data copy scenarios:

* When you're copying data between two data stores that are publicly accessible through the internet from any IP, you can use the Azure integration runtime for the copy activity. This integration runtime is secure, reliable, scalable, and [globally available](concepts-integration-runtime.md#integration-runtime-location).
* When you're copying data to and from data stores that are located on-premises or in a network with access control (for example, an Azure virtual network), you need to set up a self-hosted integration runtime.

An integration runtime needs to be associated with each source and sink data store. For information about how the Copy activity determines which integration runtime to use, see [Determining which IR to use](concepts-integration-runtime.md#determining-which-ir-to-use).

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot use more than one self-hosted integration runtime within the same Copy activity. The source and sink for the activity must be connected with the same self-hosted integration runtime.

To copy data from a source to a sink, the service that runs the Copy activity performs these steps:

1. Reads data from a source data store.
2. Performs serialization/deserialization, compression/decompression, column mapping, and so on. It performs these operations based on the configuration of the input dataset, output dataset, and Copy activity.
3. Writes data to the sink/destination data store.

:::image type="content" source="media/copy-activity-overview/copy-activity-overview.png" alt-text="Copy activity overview":::

> [!NOTE]
> If a self-hosted integration runtime is used in either a source or sink data store within a Copy activity, then both the source and sink must be accessible from the server hosting the integration runtime for the Copy activity to be successful.

## Supported data stores and formats

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-supported-data-stores](includes/data-factory-v2-supported-data-stores.md)]

### Supported file formats

Azure Data Factory supports the following file formats. Refer to each article for format-based settings.

- [Avro format](format-avro.md)
- [Binary format](format-binary.md)
- [Delimited text format](format-delimited-text.md)
- [Excel format](format-excel.md)
- [Iceberg format](format-iceberg.md) (only for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2)
- [JSON format](format-json.md)
- [ORC format](format-orc.md)
- [Parquet format](format-parquet.md)
- [XML format](format-xml.md)

You can use the Copy activity to copy files as-is between two file-based data stores, in which case the data is copied efficiently without any serialization or deserialization. In addition, you can also parse or generate files of a given format, for example, you can perform the following:

* Copy data from a SQL Server database and write to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 in Parquet format.
* Copy files in text (CSV) format from an on-premises file system and write to Azure Blob storage in Avro format.
* Copy zipped files from an on-premises file system, decompress them on-the-fly, and write extracted files to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
* Copy data in Gzip compressed-text (CSV) format from Azure Blob storage and write it to Azure SQL Database.
* Many more activities that require serialization/deserialization or compression/decompression.

## Supported regions

The service that enables the Copy activity is available globally in the regions and geographies listed in [Azure integration runtime locations](concepts-integration-runtime.md#integration-runtime-location). The globally available topology ensures efficient data movement that usually avoids cross-region hops. See [Products by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/#services) to check the availability of Data Factory, Synapse Workspaces and data movement in a specific region.

## Configuration

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

In general, to use the Copy activity in Azure Data Factory or Synapse pipelines, you need to:

1. **Create linked services for the source data store and the sink data store.** You can find the list of supported connectors in the [Supported data stores and formats](#supported-data-stores-and-formats) section of this article. Refer to the connector article's "Linked service properties" section for configuration information and supported properties. 
2. **Create datasets for the source and sink.** Refer to the "Dataset properties" sections of the source and sink connector articles for configuration information and supported properties.
3. **Create a pipeline with the Copy activity.** The next section provides an example.

### Syntax

The following template of a Copy activity contains a complete list of supported properties. Specify the ones that fit your scenario.

## Monitoring

You can monitor the Copy activity run in the Azure Data Factory and Synapse pipelines both visually and programmatically. For details, see [Monitor copy activity](copy-activity-monitoring.md).

## Incremental copy

Data Factory and Synapse pipelines enable you to incrementally copy delta data from a source data store to a sink data store. For details, see [Tutorial: Incrementally copy data](tutorial-incremental-copy-overview.md).

## Performance and tuning

The [copy activity monitoring](copy-activity-monitoring.md) experience shows you the copy performance statistics for each of your activity run. The [Copy activity performance and scalability guide](copy-activity-performance.md) describes key factors that affect the performance of data movement via the Copy activity. It also lists the performance values observed during testing and discusses how to optimize the performance of the Copy activity.

## Resume from last failed run

Copy activity supports resume from last failed run when you copy large size of files as-is with binary format between file-based stores and choose to preserve the folder/file hierarchy from source to sink, e.g. to migrate data from Amazon S3 to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. It applies to the following file-based connectors: [Amazon S3](connector-amazon-simple-storage-service.md), [Amazon S3 Compatible Storage](connector-amazon-s3-compatible-storage.md) [Azure Blob](connector-azure-blob-storage.md), [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](connector-azure-data-lake-store.md), [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](connector-azure-data-lake-storage.md), [Azure Files](connector-azure-file-storage.md), [File System](connector-file-system.md), [FTP](connector-ftp.md), [Google Cloud Storage](connector-google-cloud-storage.md), [HDFS](connector-hdfs.md), [Oracle Cloud Storage](connector-oracle-cloud-storage.md) and [SFTP](connector-sftp.md).

You can leverage the copy activity resume in the following two ways:

- **Activity level retry:** You can set retry count on copy activity. During the pipeline execution, if this copy activity run fails, the next automatic retry will start from last trial's failure point.
- **Rerun from failed activity:** After pipeline execution completion, you can also trigger a rerun from the failed activity in the ADF UI monitoring view or programmatically. If the failed activity is a copy activity, the pipeline will not only rerun from this activity, but also resume from the previous run's failure point.

    :::image type="content" source="media/copy-activity-overview/resume-copy.png" alt-text="Copy resume":::

Few points to note:

- Resume happens at file level. If copy activity fails when copying a file, in next run, this specific file will be re-copied.
- For resume to work properly, do not change the copy activity settings between the reruns.
- When you copy data from Amazon S3, Azure Blob, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and Google Cloud Storage, copy activity can resume from arbitrary number of copied files. While for the rest of file-based connectors as source, currently copy activity supports resume from a limited number of files, usually at the range of tens of thousands and varies depending on the length of the file paths; files beyond this number will be re-copied during reruns.

For other scenarios than binary file copy, copy activity rerun starts from the beginning.

>[!Note]
>Resuming from last failed run via self-hosted integration runtime is now only supported in the self-hosted integration runtime version 5.43.8935.2 or above.

## Preserve metadata along with data

While copying data from source to sink, in scenarios like data lake migration, you can also choose to preserve the metadata and ACLs along with data using copy activity. See [Preserve metadata](copy-activity-preserve-metadata.md) for details.

## Add metadata tags to file based sink
When the sink is Azure Storage based (Azure data lake storage or Azure Blob Storage), we can opt to add some metadata to the files. These metadata will be appearing as part of the file properties as Key-Value pairs. 
For all the types of file based sinks, you can add metadata involving dynamic content using the pipeline parameters, system variables, functions and variables. 
In addition to this, for binary file based sink, you have the option to add Last Modified datetime (of the source file) using the keyword $$LASTMODIFIED, as well as custom values as a metadata to the sink file. 

## Schema and data type mapping

See [Schema and data type mapping](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md) for information about how the Copy activity maps your source data to your sink.

## Add additional columns during copy

In addition to copying data from source data store to sink, you can also configure to add additional data columns to copy along to sink. For example:

- When you copy from a file-based source, store the relative file path as an additional column to trace from which file the data comes from.
- Duplicate the specified source column as another column.
- Add a column with ADF expression, to attach ADF system variables like pipeline name/pipeline ID, or store other dynamic value from upstream activity's output.
- Add a column with static value to meet your downstream consumption need.

You can find the following configuration on copy activity source tab. You can also map those additional columns in copy activity [schema mapping](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md#schema-mapping) as usual by using your defined column names. 

:::image type="content" source="./media/copy-activity-overview/copy-activity-add-additional-columns.png" alt-text="Add additional columns in copy activity":::

>[!TIP]
>This feature works with the latest dataset model. If you don't see this option from the UI, try creating a new dataset.

To configure it programmatically, add the `additionalColumns` property in your copy activity source:

| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| additionalColumns | Add additional data columns to copy to sink.<br><br>Each object under the `additionalColumns` array represents an extra column. The `name` defines the column name, and the `value` indicates the data value of that column.<br><br>Allowed data values are:<br>- **`$$FILEPATH`** - a reserved variable indicates to store the source files' relative path to the folder path specified in dataset. Apply to file-based source.<br>- **`$$COLUMN:<source_column_name>`** - a reserved variable pattern indicates to duplicate the specified source column as another column<br>- **Expression**<br>- **Static value** | No |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyWithAdditionalColumns",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [...],
        "outputs": [...],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "<source type>",
                "additionalColumns": [
                    {
                        "name": "filePath",
                        "value": "$$FILEPATH"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "newColName",
                        "value": "$$COLUMN:SourceColumnA"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "pipelineName",
                        "value": {
                            "value": "@pipeline().Pipeline",
                            "type": "Expression"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "staticValue",
                        "value": "sampleValue"
                    }
                ],
                ...
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
>[!TIP]
>After configuring additional columns remember to map them to your destination sink, in the Mapping tab.

## Auto create sink tables

When you copy data into SQL database/Azure Synapse Analytics, if the destination table does not exist, copy activity supports automatically creating it based on the source data. It aims to help you quickly get started to load the data and evaluate SQL database/Azure Synapse Analytics. After the data ingestion, you can review and adjust the sink table schema according to your needs.

This feature is supported when copying data from any source into the following sink data stores. You can find the option on *ADF authoring UI* -> *Copy activity sink* -> *Table option* -> *Auto create table*, or via `tableOption` property in copy activity sink payload.

- [Azure SQL Database](connector-azure-sql-database.md)
- [Azure SQL Managed Instance](connector-azure-sql-managed-instance.md)
- [Azure Synapse Analytics](connector-azure-sql-data-warehouse.md)
- [SQL Server](connector-sql-server.md)

:::image type="content" source="media/copy-activity-overview/create-sink-table.png" alt-text="Create sink tables":::

## Fault tolerance

By default, the Copy activity stops copying data and returns a failure when source data rows are incompatible with sink data rows. To make the copy succeed, you can configure the Copy activity to skip and log the incompatible rows and copy only the compatible data. See [Copy activity fault tolerance](copy-activity-fault-tolerance.md) for details.

## Data consistency verification

When you move data from source to destination store, copy activity provides an option for you to do additional data consistency verification to ensure the data is not only successfully copied from source to destination store, but also verified to be consistent between source and destination store. Once inconsistent files have been found during the data movement, you can either abort the copy activity or continue to copy the rest by enabling fault tolerance setting to skip inconsistent files. You can get the skipped file names by enabling session log setting in copy activity. See [Data consistency verification in copy activity](copy-activity-data-consistency.md) for details.

## Session log
You can log your copied file names, which can help you to further ensure the data is not only successfully copied from source to destination store, but also consistent between source and destination store by reviewing the copy activity session logs. See [Session sign in copy activity](copy-activity-log.md) for details.
