# Copy data from Square using Azure Data Factory (Preview)

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from Square. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is currently in preview. You can try it out and give us feedback. If you want to take a dependency on preview connectors in your solution, please contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/).

## Supported capabilities

You can copy data from Square to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Azure Data Factory provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Square connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Square linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Square** | Yes |
| host | The URL of the Square instance. (i.e. mystore.mysquare.com)  | Yes |
| clientId | The client ID associated with your Square application.  | Yes |
| clientSecret | The client secret associated with your Square application. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| redirectUri | The redirect URL assigned in the Square application dashboard. (i.e. http://localhost:2500)  | Yes |
| useEncryptedEndpoints | Specifies whether the data source endpoints are encrypted using HTTPS. The default value is true.  | No |
| useHostVerification | Specifies whether to require the host name in the server's certificate to match the host name of the server when connecting over SSL. The default value is true.  | No |
| usePeerVerification | Specifies whether to verify the identity of the server when connecting over SSL. The default value is true.  | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "SquareLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Square",
        "typeProperties": {
            "host" : "mystore.mysquare.com",
            "clientId" : "<clientId>",
            "clientSecret": {
                 "type": "SecureString",
                 "value": "<clientSecret>"
            },
            "redirectUri" : "http://localhost:2500"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Square dataset.

To copy data from Square, set the type property of the dataset to **SquareObject**. There is no additional type-specific property in this type of dataset.

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "SquareDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SquareObject",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Square linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Square source.

### SquareSource as source

To copy data from Square, set the source type in the copy activity to **SquareSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **SquareSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM Business"`. | Yes |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromSquare",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Square input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "SquareSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM Business"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
