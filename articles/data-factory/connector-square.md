# Copy data from Square using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics (Preview)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from Square. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is currently in preview. You can try it out and give us feedback. If you want to take a dependency on preview connectors in your solution, please contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/).


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Square connector version 2.0 (Preview) provides improved native Square support. If you are using Square connector version 1.0 in your solution, please [upgrade the Square connector](#upgrade-the-square-connector-from-version-10-to-version-20) before **October 15, 2025**. Refer to this [section](#square-connector-lifecycle-and-upgrade) for details on the difference between version 2.0 (Preview) and version 1.0.

## Supported capabilities

This Square connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks, see the [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores) table.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

The connector supports the Windows versions in this [article](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md#prerequisites).

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-integration-runtime-requirements](includes/data-factory-v2-integration-runtime-requirements.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Version 2.0 (Preview) is supported with the self-hosted integration runtime version 5.56.0.0 or above.

## Getting started

        }
    }
}
```

### Access token types

Square support two types of access token: **personal** and **OAuth**.

- Personal access tokens are used to get unlimited Connect API access to resources in your own Square account.
- OAuth access tokens are used to get authenticated and scoped Connect API access to any Square account. Use them when your app accesses resources in other Square accounts on behalf of account owners. OAuth access tokens can also be used to access resources in your own Square account.

    >[!Important]
    > To perform **Test connection** in the linked service, `MERCHANT_PROFILE_READ` is required to get a scoped OAuth access token. For permissions to access other tables, see [Square OAuth Permissions Reference](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/oauth-api/square-permissions).


Authentication via personal access token only needs `accessToken`, while authentication via OAuth requires `accessToken` and `refreshToken`. Learn how to retrieve access token from [here](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/access-tokens).

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Square dataset.

To copy data from Square, set the type property of the dataset to **SquareObject**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **SquareObject** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table. | Yes for version 2.0 (Preview).<br> No for version 1.0 (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "SquareDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SquareObject",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Square linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Square source.

### Square as source

To copy data from Square, set the source type in the copy activity to **SquareSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **SquareSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM Business"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

> [!Note]
> `query` is not supported in version 2.0 (Preview).

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromSquare",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Square input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "SquareSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM Business"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Data type mapping for Square

When you copy data from Square, the following mappings apply from Square's data types to the internal data types used by the service. To learn about how the copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink, see [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md).

| Square data type | Interim service data type (for version 2.0 (Preview)) | Interim service data type (for version 1.0) |
|------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| String           | String                           | String               |
| Integer          | Int32                            | Int32                |
| Long             | Int64                            | Int64                |
| Boolean          | Boolean                          | Boolean              |
| Date             | String                           | Not supported.       |
| Timestamp        | String                           | Not supported.       |
| Timestamp with offset   |String                     | Not supported.       |
| Duration (full)  | String                           | String               |
| Duration (time only) | String                       | String               |
| Money            | Int64                            | Int64                |

## Square connector lifecycle and upgrade

The following table shows the release stage and change logs for different versions of the Square connector:

| Version  | Release stage | Change log |  
| :----------- | :------- |:------- |
| Version 1.0 | End of support announced | / |  
| Version 2.0 | Public Preview |  • The self-hosted integration runtime version should be 5.56.0.0 or above. <br><br>• Date, Timestamp and Timestamp with offset are read as String data type. <br><br> • `useEncryptedEndpoints`, `useHostVerification`, `usePeerVerification` are not supported in the linked service.   <br><br>• `query` is not supported.  |

### <a name="upgrade-the-square-connector-from-version-10-to-version-20"></a> Upgrade the Square connector from version 1.0 to version 2.0 (Preview)

1. In **Edit linked service** page, select 2.0 (Preview) for version. For more information, see [linked service version 2.0 (Preview) properties](#version-20).

1. The data type mapping for the Square linked service version 2.0 (Preview) is different from that for the version 1.0. To learn the latest data type mapping, see [Data type mapping for Square](#data-type-mapping-for-square).

1. Apply a self-hosted integration runtime with version 5.56.0.0 or above.

1. `query` is only supported in version 1.0. You should use the `tableName` instead of `query` in version 2.0 (Preview).
