# Troubleshoot the Hive connector in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article provides suggestions to troubleshoot common problems with the Hive connector in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse.

## The performance difference between the ODBC connector and the Hive connector

- **Symptoms**: The concern about the performance difference between the ODBC connector and the Hive connector. 

- **Cause**: The ODBC connector needs its own driver, which may cause the performance difference due to the third-party driver quality.

- **Recommendation**: Use the Hive connector firstly. 


## Unexpected response received from the server when connecting to the Hive server via ODBC

- **Symptoms**: When connecting to the Hive server using ODBC linked service, you meet this error message: `ERROR [HY000] [Cloudera][DriverSupport] (1110) Unexpected response received from server. Please ensure the server host and port specified for the connection are correct and confirm if SSL should be enabled for the connection.`

- **Cause**: You use the Kerberos authentication that is not supported in Azure Data Factory.

- **Recommendation**: Try the following steps. If they do not work, check the provided driver to resolve this issue.
    1. The **krb5.ini** file is in the **C:\Program Files\MIT\Kerberos\bin** folder.
    2. Add the `KRB5_CONFIG` and `KRB5CCNAME` to the system variable as well.
    3. Edit the **krb5.ini** file.
    4. Shut down and restart the VM and the SHIR from the machine.
