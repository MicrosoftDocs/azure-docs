# Parquet format in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

## Using Self-hosted Integration Runtime

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For copy empowered by Self-hosted Integration Runtime e.g. between on-premises and cloud data stores, if you are not copying Parquet files **as-is**, you need to install the **64-bit JRE 8 (Java Runtime Environment), JDK 23 (Java Development Kit),  or OpenJDK** on your IR machine. Check the following paragraph with more details.

For copy running on Self-hosted IR with Parquet file serialization/deserialization, the service locates the Java runtime by firstly checking the registry *`(SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment\{Current Version}\JavaHome)`* for JRE, if not found, secondly checking system variable *`JAVA_HOME`* for OpenJDK.

- **To use JRE**: The 64-bit IR requires 64-bit JRE. You can find it from [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=808605).
- **To use JDK**: The 64-but IR requires 64-bit JDK 23. You can find it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk23-windows). Be sure to update the `JAVA_HOME` system variable to the root folder of the JDK 23 installation i.e. `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-23`, and add the path to both the `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-23\bin` and `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-23\bin\server` folders to the `Path` system variable.
- **To use OpenJDK**: It's supported since IR version 3.13. Package the jvm.dll with all other required assemblies of OpenJDK into Self-hosted IR machine, and set system environment variable JAVA_HOME accordingly, and then restart Self-hosted IR for taking effect immediately. To download the Microsoft Build of OpenJDK, see [Microsoft Build of OpenJDKâ„¢](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk).

> [!TIP]
> If you copy data to/from Parquet format using Self-hosted Integration Runtime and hit error saying "An error occurred when invoking java, message: **java.lang.OutOfMemoryError:Java heap space**", you can add an environment variable `_JAVA_OPTIONS` in the machine that hosts the Self-hosted IR to adjust the min/max heap size for JVM to empower such copy, then rerun the pipeline.

:::image type="content" source="./media/supported-file-formats-and-compression-codecs/set-jvm-heap-size-on-selfhosted-ir.png" alt-text="Set JVM heap size on Self-hosted IR":::

Example: set variable `_JAVA_OPTIONS` with value `-Xms256m -Xmx16g`. The flag `Xms` specifies the initial memory allocation pool for a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), while `Xmx` specifies the maximum memory allocation pool. This means that JVM will be started with `Xms` amount of memory and will be able to use a maximum of `Xmx` amount of memory. By default, the service uses min 64 MB and max 1G.


## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [Datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by the Parquet dataset.

| Property         | Description                                                  | Required |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| type             | The type property of the dataset must be set to **Parquet**. | Yes      |
| location         | Location settings of the file(s). Each file-based connector has its own location type and supported properties under `location`. **See details in connector article -> Dataset properties section**. | Yes      |
| compressionCodec | The compression codec to use when writing to Parquet files. When reading from Parquet files, Data Factories automatically determine the compression codec based on the file metadata.<br>Supported types are "**none**", "**gzip**", "**snappy**" (default), and "**lzo**". Note currently Copy activity doesn't support LZO when read/write Parquet files. | No       |

> [!NOTE]
> White space in column name is not supported for Parquet files.

Below is an example of Parquet dataset on Azure Blob Storage:

```json
{
    "name": "ParquetDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Parquet",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Azure Blob Storage linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "schema": [ < physical schema, optional, retrievable during authoring > ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "AzureBlobStorageLocation",
                "container": "containername",
                "folderPath": "folder/subfolder",
            },
            "compressionCodec": "snappy"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by the Parquet source and sink.

## Mapping data flow properties

In mapping data flows, you can read and write to parquet format in the following data stores: [Azure Blob Storage](connector-azure-blob-storage.md#mapping-data-flow-properties), [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](connector-azure-data-lake-store.md#mapping-data-flow-properties), [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](connector-azure-data-lake-storage.md#mapping-data-flow-properties) and [SFTP](connector-sftp.md#mapping-data-flow-properties), and you can read parquet format in [Amazon S3](connector-amazon-simple-storage-service.md#mapping-data-flow-properties).

### Source properties

The below table lists the properties supported by a parquet source. You can edit these properties in the **Source options** tab.

| Name | Description | Required | Allowed values | Data flow script property |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Format | Format must be `parquet` | yes | `parquet` | format |
| Wild card paths | All files matching the wildcard path will be processed. Overrides the folder and file path set in the dataset. | no | String[] | wildcardPaths |
| Partition root path | For file data that is partitioned, you can enter a partition root path in order to read partitioned folders as columns | no | String | partitionRootPath |
| List of files | Whether your source is pointing to a text file that lists files to process | no | `true` or `false` | fileList |
| Column to store file name | Create a new column with the source file name and path | no | String | rowUrlColumn |

### Source example

The below image is an example of a parquet source configuration in mapping data flows.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-flow/parquet-source.png" alt-text="Parquet source":::

The associated data flow script is:

```
source(allowSchemaDrift: true,
    validateSchema: false,
    rowUrlColumn: 'fileName',
    format: 'parquet') ~> ParquetSource
```

### Sink properties

The below table lists the properties supported by a parquet sink. You can edit these properties in the **Settings** tab.

| Name | Description | Required | Allowed values | Data flow script property |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Format | Format must be `parquet` | yes | `parquet` | format |
| Clear the folder | If the destination folder is cleared prior to write | no | `true` or `false` | truncate |
| File name option | The naming format of the data written. By default, one file per partition in format `part-#####-tid-<guid>` | no | Pattern: String <br> Per partition: String[] <br> As data in column: String <br> Output to single file: `['<fileName>']` | filePattern <br> partitionFileNames <br> rowUrlColumn <br> partitionFileNames |

### Sink example

The below image is an example of a parquet sink configuration in mapping data flows.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-flow/parquet-sink.png" alt-text="Parquet sink":::

The associated data flow script is:

```
ParquetSource sink(
    format: 'parquet',
    filePattern:'output[n].parquet',
    truncate: true,
    allowSchemaDrift: true,
    validateSchema: false,
    skipDuplicateMapInputs: true,
    skipDuplicateMapOutputs: true) ~> ParquetSink
```

## Data type support

Parquet complex data types (e.g. MAP, LIST, STRUCT) are currently supported only in Data Flows, not in Copy Activity. To use complex types in data flows, do not import the file schema in the dataset, leaving schema blank in the dataset. Then, in the Source transformation, import the projection.
