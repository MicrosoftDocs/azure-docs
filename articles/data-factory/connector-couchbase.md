# Copy data from Couchbase using Azure Data Factory (Preview)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is at [End of Support stage](connector-deprecation-plan.md). You are recommended to migrate to [ODBC connector](connector-odbc.md) by installing a driver.

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from Couchbase. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This Couchbase connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks, see the [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores) table.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

The connector supports the Couchbase version higher than 6.0. 

## Prerequisites

## Create a linked service to Couchbase using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to Couchbase in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for Couchbase and select the Couchbase connector.

1. Configure the service details, test the connection, and create the new linked service.

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Couchbase connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Couchbase linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Couchbase** | Yes |
| connectionString | An ODBC connection string to connect to Couchbase. <br/>You can also put credential string in Azure Key Vault and pull the `credString` configuration out of the connection string. Refer to the following samples and [Store credentials in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md) article with more details. | Yes |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. Learn more from [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. If not specified, it uses the default Azure Integration Runtime. |No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "CouchbaseLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Couchbase",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "Server=<server>; Port=<port>;AuthMech=1;CredString=[{\"user\": \"JSmith\", \"pass\":\"access123\"}, {\"user\": \"Admin\", \"pass\":\"simba123\"}];"
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example: store credential string in Azure Key Vault**

```json
{
    "name": "CouchbaseLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Couchbase",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "Server=<server>; Port=<port>;AuthMech=1;",
            "credString": { 
                "type": "AzureKeyVaultSecret", 
                "store": { 
                    "referenceName": "<Azure Key Vault linked service name>", 
                    "type": "LinkedServiceReference" 
                }, 
                "secretName": "<secretName>" 
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Couchbase dataset.

To copy data from Couchbase, set the type property of the dataset to **CouchbaseTable**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **CouchbaseTable** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |


**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "CouchbaseDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "CouchbaseTable",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Couchbase linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Couchbase source.

### CouchbaseSource as source

To copy data from Couchbase, set the source type in the copy activity to **CouchbaseSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **CouchbaseSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromCouchbase",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Couchbase input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "CouchbaseSource",

            }
        }
