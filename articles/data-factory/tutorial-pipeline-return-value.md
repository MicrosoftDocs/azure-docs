# Set Pipeline Return Value in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

In the calling pipeline-child pipeline paradigm, you can use the [Set Variable activity](control-flow-set-variable-activity.md) to return values from the child pipeline to the calling pipeline. In the following scenario, we have a child pipeline through [Execute Pipeline Activity](control-flow-execute-pipeline-activity.md). And we want to __retrieve information from the child pipeline__, to then be used in the calling pipeline.

Introduce pipeline return value, a dictionary of key value pairs, that allows communications between child pipelines and parent pipeline.

## Prerequisite - Calling a Child Pipeline

As a prerequisite, your design needs an [Execute Pipeline Activity](control-flow-execute-pipeline-activity.md) calling a child pipeline, with _Wait on Completion_ enabled on the activity.

## Configure Pipeline Return Value in Child Pipeline

We expanded the [Set Variable activity](control-flow-set-variable-activity.md) to include system variables _Pipeline Return Value_. You don't need to define them at pipeline level (as opposed to any other variables you use in the pipeline).

1. Search for _Set Variable_ in the pipeline Activities pane, and drag a Set Variable activity to the pipeline canvas.
1. Select the Set Variable activity on the canvas if it isn't already selected, and then its **Variables** tab, to edit its details.
1. Choose _Pipeline return value_ for variable type.
1. Select _New_ to add a new key value pair.
1. The number of key-value pairs that can be added is only limited by the size limit of the returned JSON (4 MB).

There are a few options for value types, including

Type Name | Description
-------- | ----------- 
String | A constant string value. for example: 'ADF is awesome'
Expression | It allows you to reference output from previous activities. You can use string interpolation here to include in-line expression values such as ```"The value is @{guid()}"```.
Array | It expects an array of _string values_. Press "enter" key to separate values in the array
Boolean | True or False
Null | Signal place holder status; the value is constant _null_
Int | A numerical value of integer type. For example: 42
Float | A numerical value of float type. For example: 2.71828
Object | __Warning__ complicated use cases only. It allows you to embed a list of key value pairs type for the value

Value of object type is defined as follows:

``` json
[{"key": "myKey1", "value": {"type": "String", "content": "hello world"}}, 
 {"key": "myKey2", "value": {"type": "String", "content": "hi"}}
]
```

## Retrieving Value in Calling Pipeline

The pipeline return value of the child pipeline becomes the activity output of the Execute Pipeline Activity. You can retrieve the information with _@activity('Execute Pipeline1').output.pipelineReturnValue.keyName_. The use case is limitless. For instance, you can use

* An _int_ value from child pipeline to define the wait period for a [wait activity](control-flow-wait-activity.md).
* A _string_ value to define the URL for the [Web activity](control-flow-web-activity.md).
* An _expression_ value payload for a [script activity](transform-data-using-script.md) for logging purposes.

There are two noticeable callouts in referencing the pipeline return values. 

1. With _Object_ type, you can further expand into the nested json object, such as _@activity('Execute Pipeline1').output.pipelineReturnValue.keyName.nextLevelKey_
1. With _Array_ type, you can specify the index in the list, with _@activity('Execute Pipeline1').output.pipelineReturnValue.keyName[0]_. The number is zero indexed, meaning that it starts with 0.

> [!NOTE]
> Please make sure that the _keyName_ you are referencing exists in your child pipeline. The ADF expression builder can _not_ confirm the referential check for you.
> The Pipeline will fail if the key referenced is missing in the payload

## Special Considerations

* While you can include multiple Set Pipeline Return Value activities in a pipeline, it is important to ensure that only one of them is executed in the pipeline. 

  :::image type="content" source="media/pipeline-return-value/pipeline-return-value-04-multiple.png" alt-text="Screenshot with Pipeline Return Value and Branching.":::

  To avoid the previously described missing key problem when the calling pipeline, we encourage you to have the same list of keys for all branches in child pipeline. Consider using _null_ types for keys that don't have values, in a specific branch.

* The Azure Data Factory expression language does not directly support inline JSON objects. Instead, it's necessary to concatenate strings and expressions properly.

  For example, for the following JSON expression:
  
  ```json
  {
    "datetime": "@{utcnow()}",
    "date": "@{substring(utcnow(),0,10)}",
    "year": "@{substring(utcnow(),0,4)}",
    "month": "@{substring(utcnow(),5,2)}",
    "day": "@{substring(utcnow(),8,2)}"
  }
  ```

  An equivalent Azure Data Factory expression would be:

  ```json
  @{
    concat(
      '{',
      '"datetime": "', utcnow(), '", ',
      '"date": "', substring(utcnow(),0,10), '", ',
      '"year": "', substring(utcnow(),0,4), '", ',
      '"month": "', substring(utcnow(),5,2), '", ',
      '"day": "', substring(utcnow(),8,2), '"',
      '}'
    )
  }
  ```
