Data transformation expressions in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics allow you to transform expressions in many ways, and are a powerful tool enabling you to customize the behavior of your pipelines in almost every setting and property - anywhere you find a text field that shows the **Add dynamic content** or **Open expression builder** links within your pipeline.
