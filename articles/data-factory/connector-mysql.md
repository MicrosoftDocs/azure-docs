# Copy data from MySQL using Azure Data Factory
> [!div class="op_single_selector" title1="Select the version of Data Factory service you are using:"]
> * [Version 1 - GA](v1/data-factory-onprem-mysql-connector.md)
> * [Version 2 - Preview](connector-mysql.md)

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from a MySQL database. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to version 2 of Data Factory, which is currently in preview. If you are using version 1 of the Data Factory service, which is generally available (GA), see [MySQL connector in V1](v1/data-factory-onprem-mysql-connector.md).

## Supported scenarios

You can copy data from MySQL database to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Specifically, this MySQL connector supports MySQL **version 5.1 and above**.

## Prerequisites

To use this MySQL connector, you need to:

- Set up a self-hosted Integration Runtime. See [Self-hosted Integration Runtime](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md) article for details.
- Install the [MySQL Connector/Net for Microsoft Windows](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/) version 6.6.5 or above on the Integration Runtime machine.

> [!TIP]
> If you hit error on "Authentication failed because the remote party has closed the transport stream.", consider to upgrade the MySQL Connector/Net to higher version.

## Getting started
You can create a pipeline with copy activity using .NET SDK, Python SDK, Azure PowerShell, REST API, or Azure Resource Manager template. See [Copy activity tutorial](quickstart-create-data-factory-dot-net.md) for step-by-step instructions to create a pipeline with a copy activity.

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to MySQL connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for MySQL linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **MySql** | Yes |
| server | Name of the MySQL server. | Yes |
| database | Name of the MySQL database. | Yes |
| schema | Name of the schema in the database. | No |
| username | Specify user name to connect to the MySQL database. | Yes |
| password | Specify password for the user account you specified. | Yes |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "MySQLLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "MySql",
        "typeProperties": {
            "server": "<server>",
            "database": "<database>",
            "username": "<username>",
            "password": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<password>"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by MySQL dataset.

To copy data from MySQL, set the type property of the dataset to **RelationalTable**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **RelationalTable** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table in the MySQL database. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "MySQLDataset",
    "properties":
    {
        "type": "RelationalTable",
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<MySQL linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        },
        "typeProperties": {}
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by MySQL source.

### MySQL as source

To copy data from MySQL, set the source type in the copy activity to **RelationalSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **RelationalSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromMySQL",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<MySQL input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "RelationalSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM MyTable"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Data type mapping for MySQL

When copying data from MySQL, the following mappings are used from MySQL data types to Azure Data Factory interim data types. See [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md) to learn about how copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink.

| MySQL data type | Data factory interim data type |
|:--- |:--- |
| `bigint` |`Int64` |
| `bigint unsigned` |`Decimal` |
| `bit` |`Decimal` |
| `blob` |`Byte[]` |
| `bool` |`Boolean` |
| `char` |`String` |
| `date` |`Datetime` |
| `datetime` |`Datetime` |
| `decimal` |`Decimal` |
| `double` |`Double` |
| `double precision` |`Double` |
| `enum` |`String` |
