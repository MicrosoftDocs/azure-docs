# Copy data from MySQL using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory and Synapse Analytics pipelines to copy data from a MySQL database. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

>[!NOTE]
>To copy data from or to [Azure Database for MySQL](/azure/mysql/overview) service, use the specialized [Azure Database for MySQL connector](connector-azure-database-for-mysql.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The MySQL connector version 2.0 provides improved native MySQL support. If you are using MySQL connector version 1.0 in your solution, please [upgrade your MySQL connector](#upgrade-the-mysql-driver-version) as version 1.0 is at [End of Support stage](connector-deprecation-plan.md). Refer to this [section](#differences-between-the-recommended-and-the-legacy-driver-version) for details on the difference between version 2.0 and version 1.0.

## Supported capabilities

This MySQL connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

This connector supports MySQL version 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 8.0, 8.1 and 8.2 under the MySQL connector version 2.0 and 5.6, 5.7 and 8.0 for version 1.0.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-integration-runtime-requirements](includes/data-factory-v2-integration-runtime-requirements.md)]

The Integration Runtime provides a built-in MySQL driver starting from version 3.7, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver.

## Getting started

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to MySQL connector.

## Linked service properties

If you use version 2.0, the following properties are supported for MySQL linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **MySql** | Yes |
| driverVersion | The driver version when you select version 2.0. The value is v2. | Yes |
| server | The name of your MySQL Server. | Yes |
| port | The port number to connect to the MySQL server. |No|
| database | Your MySQL database name. |Yes|
| username | Your user name.|Yes|
| password | The password for the user name. Mark this field as SecureString to store it securely. Or, you can [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |  
| sslMode | This option specifies whether the driver uses TLS encryption and verification when connecting to MySQL. E.g., `SSLMode=<0/1/2/3/4>`.<br/>Options: DISABLED (0) / PREFERRED (1) **(Default)** / REQUIRED (2) / VERIFY_CA (3) / VERIFY_IDENTITY (4) | Yes |
| useSystemTrustStore | This option specifies whether to use a CA certificate from the system trust store, or from a specified PEM file. E.g. `UseSystemTrustStore=<0/1>`;<br/>Options: Enabled (1) / Disabled (0) **(Default)** | No |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. Learn more from [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. If not specified, it uses the default Azure Integration Runtime. |No |
| ***Additional connection properties*** | | |
| allowZeroDateTime | Specifying this property value to `true` allows the special "zero" date value of `0000-00-00` to be retrieved from the database. If set to `false` (the default), date columns are returned as DateTime values, which means `0000-00-00` cannot be retrieved. <br><br> MySQL permits you to store a "zero" value of `0000-00-00` as a "dummy date". In some cases, this feature is more convenient than using NULL values, and uses less data and index space. To disallow `0000-00-00` in MySQL, enable the [NO_ZERO_DATE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_zero_date) mode. For more information, see this [article](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/date-and-time-types.html).| No |
| connectionTimeout | The length of time (in seconds) to wait for a connection to the server before terminating the attempt and generating an error. | No |
| convertZeroDateTime | Set it to `true` to return DateTime.MinValue for date or datetime columns that have disallowed values. | No |
| guidFormat| Determines which column type (if any) should be read as a GUID. Go to this [article](https://mysqlconnector.net/connection-options/) for the description of each column type by searching this property. <br><br> Version 2.0 treats Char(36) as GUID type by default for better performance. The connector treats Char(36) fields as GUIDs for easier database handling. This treatment simplifies operations such as inserting, updating, and retrieving GUID values, ensuring they are consistently managed as GUID objects in the application code instead of plain strings. This behavior is particularly useful in scenarios where GUIDs are used as primary keys or unique identifiers and provides better performance. If you don't need this default setting, you can configure `guidFormat=none` in connection property. |No|
| sslCert | The path to the client's SSL certificate file in PEM format. SslKey must also be specified. |No|
| sslKey | The path to the client's SSL private key in PEM format. SslCert must also be specified.| No |
| treatTinyAsBoolean | When set to true, tinyint(1) values are returned as Boolean. Setting this property to false causes tinyint(1) to be returned as SByte/Byte. <br><br>Version 2.0 treats tinyint(1) as Boolean type by default. For more information, see this [article](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/numeric-type-syntax.html). To let the connector return tiny as numeric, set `treatTinyAsBoolean=false` in the connection properties.| No | 

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "MySQLLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "MySql",
        "typeProperties": {
             "server": "<server>",
             "port": 3306,
             "database": "<database>",
             "username": "<username>",
             "password": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<password>"
             },
             "sslmode": <sslmode>,
             "usesystemtruststore": <UseSystemTrustStore>,
             "driverVersion": "v2"
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example: store password in Azure Key Vault**

```json
{
    "name": "MySQLLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "MySql",
        "typeProperties": {
            "server": "<server>",
            "port": 3306,
            "database": "<database>",
            "username": "<username>",
            "sslmode": <sslmode>,
            "usesystemtruststore": <UseSystemTrustStore>,
            "password": { 
                "type": "AzureKeyVaultSecret", 
                "store": { 
                    "referenceName": "<Azure Key Vault linked service name>", 
                    "type": "LinkedServiceReference" 
                }, 
                "secretName": "<secretName>" 
            },
            "driverVersion": "v2"
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

If you use version 1.0, the following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **MySql** | Yes |
| connectionString | Specify information needed to connect to the Azure Database for MySQL instance.<br/> You can also put password in Azure Key Vault and pull the `password` configuration out of the connection string. Refer to the following samples and [Store credentials in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md) article with more details. | Yes |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. Learn more from [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. If not specified, it uses the default Azure Integration Runtime. | No |

A typical connection string is `Server=<server>;Port=<port>;Database=<database>;UID=<username>;PWD=<password>`. More properties you can set per your case:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| sslMode | This option specifies whether the driver uses TLS encryption and verification when connecting to MySQL. E.g., `SSLMode=<0/1/2/3/4>`.<br/>Options: DISABLED (0) / PREFERRED (1) **(Default)** / REQUIRED (2) / VERIFY_CA (3) / VERIFY_IDENTITY (4) | Yes |
| SSLCert | The full path and name of a .pem file containing the SSL certificate used for proving the identity of the client. <br/> To specify a private key for encrypting this certificate before sending it to the server, use the `SSLKey` property.| Yes, if using two-way SSL verification. |
| SSLKey | The full path and name of a file containing the private key used for encrypting the client-side certificate during two-way SSL verification.| Yes, if using two-way SSL verification. |
| useSystemTrustStore | This option specifies whether to use a CA certificate from the system trust store, or from a specified PEM file. E.g. `UseSystemTrustStore=<0/1>`;<br/>Options: Enabled (1) / Disabled (0) **(Default)** | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "MySQLLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "MySql",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "Server=<server>;Port=<port>;Database=<database>;UID=<username>;PWD=<password>"
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by MySQL dataset.

To copy data from MySQL, the following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **MySqlTable** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table in the MySQL database. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "MySQLDataset",
    "properties":
    {
        "type": "MySqlTable",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<MySQL linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

If you were using `RelationalTable` typed dataset, it is still supported as-is, while you are suggested to use the new one going forward.

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by MySQL source.

### MySQL as source

To copy data from MySQL, the following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **MySqlSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromMySQL",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<MySQL input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "MySqlSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM MyTable"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

If you were using `RelationalSource` typed source, it is still supported as-is, while you are suggested to use the new one going forward.

## Data type mapping for MySQL

When copying data from MySQL, the following mappings are used from MySQL data types to interim data types used by the service internally. See [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md) to learn about how copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink.

| MySQL data type | Interim service data type (for version 2.0)| Interim service data type (for version 1.0) |

## Lookup activity properties

To learn details about the properties, check [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md).

## <a name="upgrade-the-mysql-driver-version"></a> Upgrade the MySQL connector

Here are steps that help you upgrade your MySQL connector: 

1. In **Edit linked service** page, select **2.0** under **Version** and configure the linked service by referring to [Linked service properties](connector-mysql.md#linked-service-properties).  

1. The data type mapping for version 2.0 is different from that for version 1.0. To learn the version 2.0 data type mapping, see [Data type mapping for MySQL](connector-mysql.md#data-type-mapping-for-mysql).

1. Version 2.0 supports more MySQL versions. For more information, see [Supported capabilities](connector-mysql.md#supported-capabilities).

### <a name="best-practices-for-mysql-connector-recommended-version"></a> Best practices for MySQL connector version 2.0

This section introduces best practices for MySQL connector version 2.0.

#### Cannot load SSL key

- **Symptoms**: If you are using MySQL connector version 2.0 with SSL Key as a connection property, you may meet the following error message: `Could not load the client key from your_pem_file: Unrecognized PEM header: -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`

- **Cause**: Version 2.0 cannot decrypt the PCKS#8 format.

- **Recommendation**: Convert the PEM format to PCKS#1.

## <a name="differences-between-the-recommended-and-the-legacy-driver-version"></a> Differences between MySQL version 2.0 and version 1.0

The table below shows the data type mapping differences between MySQL using version 2.0 and version 1.0.

|MySQL data type |Interim service data type (using version 2.0) |Interim service data type (using version 1.0)|
|:---|:---|:---|
|bit(1)| UInt64|Boolean|
|bit(M), M>1|UInt64|Byte[]|
|bool|Boolean|Int16|
|JSON|String|Byte[]|
