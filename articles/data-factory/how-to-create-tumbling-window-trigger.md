# Create a trigger that runs a pipeline on a tumbling window

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article provides steps to create, start, and monitor a tumbling window trigger. For general information about triggers and the supported types, see [Pipeline execution and triggers](concepts-pipeline-execution-triggers.md).

Tumbling window triggers are a type of trigger that fires at a periodic time interval from a specified start time, while retaining state. Tumbling windows are a series of fixed-sized, nonoverlapping, and contiguous time intervals. A tumbling window trigger has a one-to-one relationship with a pipeline and can only reference a singular pipeline.

A tumbling window trigger is a more heavyweight alternative for a schedule trigger. It offers a suite of features for complex scenarios like ([dependency on other tumbling window triggers](#tumbling-window-trigger-dependency), [rerunning a failed job](tumbling-window-trigger-dependency.md#monitor-dependencies), and [setting user retry for pipelines](#user-assigned-retries-of-pipelines)). To further understand the difference between a schedule trigger and a tumbling window trigger, see [Trigger type comparison](concepts-pipeline-execution-triggers.md#trigger-type-comparison).

## Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse portal experience

1. To create a tumbling window trigger in the Azure portal, select the **Triggers** tab, and then select **New**.
1. After the trigger configuration pane opens, select **Tumbling window**. Then define your tumbling window trigger properties.
1. When you're finished, select **Save**.

## Tumbling window trigger type properties

A tumbling window has the following trigger type properties:

```json
{
    "name": "MyTriggerName",
    "properties": {
        "type": "TumblingWindowTrigger",
        "runtimeState": "<<Started/Stopped/Disabled - readonly>>",
        "typeProperties": {
            "frequency": <<Minute/Hour>>,
            "interval": <<int>>,
            "startTime": "<<datetime>>",
            "endTime": <<datetime - optional>>,
            "delay": <<timespan - optional>>,
            "maxConcurrency": <<int>> (required, max allowed: 50),
            "retryPolicy": {
                "count": <<int - optional, default: 0>>,
                "intervalInSeconds": <<int>>,
            },
            "dependsOn": [
                {
                    "type": "TumblingWindowTriggerDependencyReference",
                    "size": <<timespan - optional>>,
                    "offset": <<timespan - optional>>,
                    "referenceTrigger": {
                        "referenceName": "MyTumblingWindowDependency1",
                        "type": "TriggerReference"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type": "SelfDependencyTumblingWindowTriggerReference",
                    "size": <<timespan - optional>>,
                    "offset": <<timespan>>
                }
            ]
        },
        "pipeline": {
            "pipelineReference": {
                "type": "PipelineReference",
                "referenceName": "MyPipelineName"
            },
            "parameters": {
                "parameter1": {
                    "type": "Expression",
                    "value": "@{concat('output',formatDateTime(trigger().outputs.windowStartTime,'-dd-MM-yyyy-HH-mm-ss-ffff'))}"
                },
                "parameter2": {
                    "type": "Expression",
                    "value": "@{concat('output',formatDateTime(trigger().outputs.windowEndTime,'-dd-MM-yyyy-HH-mm-ss-ffff'))}"
                },
                "parameter3": "https://mydemo.azurewebsites.net/api/demoapi"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The following table provides a high-level overview of the major JSON elements that are related to recurrence and scheduling of a tumbling window trigger.

| JSON element | Description | Type | Allowed values | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| `type` | The type of the trigger. The `type` is the fixed value `TumblingWindowTrigger`. | `String` | `TumblingWindowTrigger` | Yes |
| `runtimeState` | The current state of the trigger run time.<br/>This element is \<readOnly>. | `String` | `Started`, `Stopped`, `Disabled` | Yes |
| `frequency` | A string that represents the frequency unit (minutes, hours, or months) at which the trigger recurs. If the `startTime` date values are more granular than the `frequency` value, the `startTime` dates are considered when the window boundaries are computed. For example, if the `frequency` value is `hourly` and the `startTime` value is 2017-09-01T10:10:10Z, the first window is (2017-09-01T10:10:10Z, 2017-09-01T11:10:10Z). | `String` | `Minute`, `Hour`, `Month`  | Yes |
| `interval` | A positive integer that denotes the interval for the `frequency` value, which determines how often the trigger runs. For example, if the `interval` is `3` and the `frequency` is `hour`, the trigger recurs every 3 hours. <br/>The minimum window interval is 5 minutes. | `Integer` | A positive integer. | Yes |
| `startTime`| The first occurrence, which can be in the past. The first trigger interval is (`startTime`, `startTime + interval`). | `DateTime` | A `DateTime` value. | Yes |
| `endTime`| The last occurrence, which can be in the past. | `DateTime` | A `DateTime` value. | Yes |
| `delay` | The amount of time to delay the start of data processing for the window. The pipeline run is started after the expected execution time plus the amount of delay. The delay defines how long the trigger waits past the due time before triggering a new run. The delay doesn't alter the window `startTime`. For example, a `delay` value of 00:10:00 implies a delay of 10 minutes. | `Timespan`<br/>(hh:mm:ss)  | A `timespan` value where the default is `00:00:00`. | No |
| `maxConcurrency` | The number of simultaneous trigger runs that are fired for windows that are ready. For example, to backfill hourly runs for yesterday results in 24 windows. If `maxConcurrency` = 10, trigger events are fired only for the first 10 windows (00:00-01:00 - 09:00-10:00). After the first 10 triggered pipeline runs are complete, trigger runs are fired for the next 10 windows (10:00-11:00 - 19:00-20:00). Continuing with this example of `maxConcurrency` = 10, if there are 10 windows ready, there are 10 total pipeline runs. If only one window is ready, only one pipeline runs. | `Integer` | An integer between 1 and 50. | Yes |
| `retryPolicy: Count` | The number of retries before the pipeline run is marked as `Failed`.  | `Integer` | An integer, where the default is 0 (no retries). | No |
| `retryPolicy: intervalInSeconds` | The delay between retry attempts specified in seconds. | `Integer` | The number of seconds, where the default is 30. The minimum value is `30`. | No |
| `dependsOn: type` | The type of `TumblingWindowTriggerReference`. Required if a dependency is set. | `String` |  `TumblingWindowTriggerDependencyReference`, `SelfDependencyTumblingWindowTriggerReference` | No |
| `dependsOn: size` | The size of the dependency tumbling window. | `Timespan`<br/>(hh:mm:ss)  | A positive `timespan` value where the default is the window size of the child trigger.  | No |
| `dependsOn: offset` | The offset of the dependency trigger. | `Timespan`<br/>(hh:mm:ss) |  A `timespan` value that must be negative in a self-dependency. If no value is specified, the window is the same as the trigger itself. | Self-Dependency: Yes<br/>Other: No  |

> [!NOTE]
> After a tumbling window trigger is published, the `interval` and `frequency` values can't be edited.

### WindowStart and WindowEnd system variables

You can use the `WindowStart` and `WindowEnd` system variables of the tumbling window trigger in your **pipeline** definition (that is, for part of a query). Pass the system variables as parameters to your pipeline in the **trigger** definition. The following example shows you how to pass these variables as parameters.

```json
{
    "name": "MyTriggerName",
    "properties": {
        "type": "TumblingWindowTrigger",
            ...
        "pipeline": {
            "pipelineReference": {
                "type": "PipelineReference",
                "referenceName": "MyPipelineName"
            },
            "parameters": {
                "MyWindowStart": {
                    "type": "Expression",
                    "value": "@{concat('output',formatDateTime(trigger().outputs.windowStartTime,'-dd-MM-yyyy-HH-mm-ss-ffff'))}"
                },
                "MyWindowEnd": {
                    "type": "Expression",
                    "value": "@{concat('output',formatDateTime(trigger().outputs.windowEndTime,'-dd-MM-yyyy-HH-mm-ss-ffff'))}"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To use the `WindowStart` and `WindowEnd` system variable values in the pipeline definition, use your `MyWindowStart` and `MyWindowEnd` parameters, accordingly.

### Execution order of windows in a backfill scenario

If the trigger `startTime` is in the past, then based on the formula M=(CurrentTime- TriggerStartTime)/TumblingWindowSize, the trigger generates {M} backfill(past) runs in parallel, honoring trigger concurrency, before executing the future runs. The order of execution for windows is deterministic, from oldest to newest intervals. Currently, this behavior can't be modified.

> [!NOTE]
> In this scenario, all runs from the selected `startTime` are run before executing future runs. If you need to backfill a long period of time, we recommend doing an initial historical load.

### Existing TriggerResource elements

The following points apply to updating existing `TriggerResource` elements:

* The value for the `frequency` element (or window size) of the trigger along with the `interval` element can't be changed after the trigger is created. This restriction is required for proper functioning of `triggerRun` reruns and dependency evaluations.
* If the value for the `endTime` element of the trigger changes (by adding or updating), the state of the windows that are already processed is *not* reset. The trigger honors the new `endTime` value. If the new `endTime` value is before the windows that are already executed, the trigger stops. Otherwise, the trigger stops when the new `endTime` value is encountered.

### User-assigned retries of pipelines

In the case of pipeline failures, a tumbling window trigger can retry the execution of the referenced pipeline automatically by using the same input parameters, without user intervention. Use the `retryPolicy` property in the trigger definition to specify this action.

### Tumbling window trigger dependency

If you want to make sure that a tumbling window trigger is executed only after the successful execution of another tumbling window trigger in the data factory, [create a tumbling window trigger dependency](tumbling-window-trigger-dependency.md).

### Cancel a tumbling window run

You can cancel runs for a tumbling window trigger if the specific window is in a **Waiting**, **Waiting on dependency**, or **Running** state:

* If the window is in a **Running** state, cancel the associated **Pipeline Run**, and the trigger run is marked as **Canceled** afterwards.
* If the window is in a **Waiting** or **Waiting on dependency** state, you can cancel the window from **Monitoring**.

1. Create a trigger by using the [Set-AzDataFactoryV2Trigger](/powershell/module/az.datafactory/set-azdatafactoryv2trigger) cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Set-AzDataFactoryV2Trigger -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -DataFactoryName $DataFactoryName -Name "MyTrigger" -DefinitionFile "C:\ADFv2QuickStartPSH\MyTrigger.json"
    ```

1. Confirm that the status of the trigger is **Stopped** by using the [Get-AzDataFactoryV2Trigger](/powershell/module/az.datafactory/get-azdatafactoryv2trigger) cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzDataFactoryV2Trigger -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -DataFactoryName $DataFactoryName -Name "MyTrigger"
    ```

1. Start the trigger by using the [Start-AzDataFactoryV2Trigger](/powershell/module/az.datafactory/start-azdatafactoryv2trigger) cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Start-AzDataFactoryV2Trigger -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -DataFactoryName $DataFactoryName -Name "MyTrigger"
    ```

1. Confirm that the status of the trigger is **Started** by using the [Get-AzDataFactoryV2Trigger](/powershell/module/az.datafactory/get-azdatafactoryv2trigger) cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzDataFactoryV2Trigger -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -DataFactoryName $DataFactoryName -Name "MyTrigger"
    ```

1. Get the trigger runs in Azure PowerShell by using the [Get-AzDataFactoryV2TriggerRun](/powershell/module/az.datafactory/get-azdatafactoryv2triggerrun) cmdlet. To get information about the trigger runs, execute the following command periodically. Update the `TriggerRunStartedAfter` and `TriggerRunStartedBefore` values to match the values in your trigger definition:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzDataFactoryV2TriggerRun -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -DataFactoryName $DataFactoryName -TriggerName "MyTrigger" -TriggerRunStartedAfter "2017-12-08T00:00:00" -TriggerRunStartedBefore "2017-12-08T01:00:00"
    ```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

This section shows you how to use the Azure CLI to create, start, and monitor a trigger.

### Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

- Follow the instructions in [Create an Azure Data Factory by using the Azure CLI](./quickstart-create-data-factory-azure-cli.md) to create a data factory and a pipeline.

### Sample code

1. In your working directory, create a JSON file named **MyTrigger.json** with the trigger's properties. For this sample, use the following content:

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Before you save the JSON file, set the value of `referenceName` to your pipeline name. Set the value of the `startTime` element to the current UTC time. Set the value of the `endTime` element to one hour past the current UTC time.

    ```json
    {
        "type": "TumblingWindowTrigger",
        "typeProperties": {
          "frequency": "Minute",
          "interval": "15",
          "startTime": "2017-12-08T00:00:00Z",
          "endTime": "2017-12-08T01:00:00Z",
          "delay": "00:00:01",
          "retryPolicy": {
            "count": 2,
            "intervalInSeconds": 30
          },

          }
        },
        "runtimeState": "Started"
    }
    ```

1. Create a trigger by using the [az datafactory trigger create](/cli/azure/datafactory/trigger#az-datafactory-trigger-create) command:

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For this step and all subsequent steps, replace `ResourceGroupName` with your resource group name. Replace `DataFactoryName` with your data factory's name.

    ```azurecli
    az datafactory trigger create --resource-group "ResourceGroupName" --factory-name "DataFactoryName"  --name "MyTrigger" --properties @MyTrigger.json  
    ```

1. Confirm that the status of the trigger is **Stopped** by using the [az datafactory trigger show](/cli/azure/datafactory/trigger#az-datafactory-trigger-show) command:

    ```azurecli
    az datafactory trigger show --resource-group "ResourceGroupName" --factory-name "DataFactoryName" --name "MyTrigger" 
    ```

1. Start the trigger by using the [az datafactory trigger start](/cli/azure/datafactory/trigger#az-datafactory-trigger-start) command:

    ```azurecli
    az datafactory trigger start --resource-group "ResourceGroupName" --factory-name "DataFactoryName" --name "MyTrigger" 
    ```

1. Confirm that the status of the trigger is **Started** by using the [az datafactory trigger show](/cli/azure/datafactory/trigger#az-datafactory-trigger-show) command:

    ```azurecli
    az datafactory trigger show --resource-group "ResourceGroupName" --factory-name "DataFactoryName" --name "MyTrigger" 
    ```

1. Get the trigger runs in the Azure CLI by using the [az datafactory trigger-run query-by-factory](/cli/azure/datafactory/trigger-run#az-datafactory-trigger-run-query-by-factory) command. To get information about the trigger runs, execute the following command periodically. Update the `last-updated-after` and `last-updated-before` values to match the values in your trigger definition:

    ```azurecli
    az datafactory trigger-run query-by-factory --resource-group "ResourceGroupName" --factory-name "DataFactoryName" --filters operand="TriggerName" operator="Equals" values="MyTrigger" --last-updated-after "2017-12-08T00:00:00Z" --last-updated-before "2017-12-08T01:00:00Z"
