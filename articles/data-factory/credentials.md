# Credentials in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

## Prerequisites

Users must have the Managed Identity Operator (Azure RBAC) role or a custom role with **Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/*/assign/action** RBAC action to configure a user assigned managed identity as a credential. Additional RBAC is required to create and use credentials in Synapse. [Learn more](../synapse-analytics/security/synapse-workspace-synapse-rbac-roles.md).

## Using credentials

We are introducing Credentials which can contain user-assigned managed identities, service principals, and also lists the system-assigned managed identity that you can use in the linked services that support Microsoft Entra authentication. It helps you consolidate and manage all your Microsoft Entra ID-based credentials.  

Below are the generic steps for using a **user-assigned managed identity** in the linked services for authentication. 

# [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

1. If you do not have a user-assigned managed identity created in Azure, first create one in the Azure portal [Managed Identities](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity%2FuserAssignedIdentities) page.

1. Associate the user-assigned managed identity to the data factory instance using Azure portal, SDK, PowerShell, REST API. The screenshot below used Azure portal (data factory blade) to associate the user-assigned managed identity.

1. Create a **Credential** in data factory user interface interactively. You can select the user-assigned managed identity associated with the data factory in Step 1.

1. Create a new linked service and select **User-assigned managed identity** under authentication

# [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

1. If you do not have a user-assigned managed identity created in Azure, first create one in the Azure portal [Managed Identities](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity%2FuserAssignedIdentities) page.

1. Associate the user-assigned managed identity to the workspace using Azure portal, SDK, PowerShell, REST API. The screenshot below used Azure portal (Identity blade) to associate the user-assigned managed identity.

   :::image type="content" source="media/credentials/synapse-uami-azure-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to use Azure portal to associate a user-assigned managed identity.":::

1. Create a **Credential** in Synapse Studio interactively. You can select the user-assigned managed identity associated with the workspace in Step 1.

   :::image type="content" source="media/credentials/user-assigned-credential-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the configuration of new credentials.":::

1. Create a new linked service and select **User-assigned managed identity** under authentication

> [!NOTE] 
> You can use [SDK](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.management.synapse?preserve-view=true&view=azure-dotnet-preview)/ [PowerShell](/powershell/module/az.synapse/?context=%2Fazure%2Fsynapse-analytics%2Fcontext%2Fcontext&view=azps-9.1.0&preserve-view=true)/ [REST APIs](/rest/api/synapse/) for the above actions. An example of creating a user-assigned managed identity and assigning it permissions to a resource with Bicep/ARM is available in [this example](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.datafactory/data-factory-get-started).
> Linked services with user-assigned managed identity are currently not supported in Synapse Spark.
