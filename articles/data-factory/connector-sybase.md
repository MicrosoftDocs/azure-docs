# Copy data from Sybase using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from a Sybase database. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This Sybase connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9313;|

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Specifically, this Sybase connector supports:

- SAP Sybase SQL Anywhere (ASA) **version 16 and above**.
- Copying data using **Basic** or **Windows** authentication.

Sybase IQ and ASE are not supported. You can use generic ODBC connector with Sybase driver instead.

## Prerequisites

To use this Sybase connector, you need to:

- Set up a Self-hosted Integration Runtime. See [Self-hosted Integration Runtime](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md) article for details.
- Install the [data provider for Sybase iAnywhere.Data.SQLAnywhere](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=324846) 16 or above on the Integration Runtime machine.

## Getting started

## Create a linked service to Sybase using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to Sybase in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Create a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Create a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for Sybase and select the Sybase connector.

   :::image type="content" source="media/connector-sybase/sybase-connector.png" alt-text="Select the Sybase connector.":::    


1. Configure the service details, test the connection, and create the new linked service.

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Sybase connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Sybase linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Sybase** | Yes |
| server | Name of the Sybase server. |Yes |
| database | Name of the Sybase database. |Yes |
| authenticationType | Type of authentication used to connect to the Sybase database.<br/>Allowed values are: **Basic**, and **Windows**. |Yes |
| username | Specify user name to connect to the Sybase database. |Yes |
| password | Specify password for the user account you specified for the username. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). |Yes |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. A Self-hosted Integration Runtime is required as mentioned in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites). |Yes |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "SybaseLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Sybase",
        "typeProperties": {
            "server": "<server>",
            "database": "<database>",
            "authenticationType": "Basic",
            "username": "<username>",
            "password": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<password>"
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Sybase dataset.

To copy data from Sybase, the following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **SybaseTable** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table in the Sybase database. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "SybaseDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "SybaseTable",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Sybase linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

If you were using `RelationalTable` typed dataset, it is still supported as-is, while you are suggested to use the new one going forward.

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Sybase source.

### Sybase as source

To copy data from Sybase, the following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **SybaseSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromSybase",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Sybase input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "SybaseSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM MyTable"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

If you were using `RelationalSource` typed source, it is still supported as-is, while you are suggested to use the new one going forward.

## Data type mapping for Sybase

When copying data from Sybase, the following mappings are used from Sybase data types to interim data types used internally within the service. See [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md) to learn about how copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink.

Sybase supports T-SQL types. For a mapping table from SQL types to interim service data types, see [Azure SQL Database Connector - data type mapping](connector-azure-sql-database.md#data-type-mapping-for-azure-sql-database) section.

## Lookup activity properties

To learn details about the properties, check [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md).
