# Copy data from MongoDB using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics (legacy)

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from a MongoDB database. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The service has released a new MongoDB connector which provides better native MongoDB support comparing to this ODBC-based implementation, refer to [MongoDB connector](connector-mongodb.md) article on details.

## Supported capabilities

You can copy data from MongoDB database to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Specifically, this MongoDB connector supports:

- MongoDB **versions 2.4, 2.6, 3.0, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.6**.
- Copying data using **Basic** or **Anonymous** authentication.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-integration-runtime-requirements](includes/data-factory-v2-integration-runtime-requirements.md)]

The Integration Runtime provides a built-in MongoDB driver, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver when copying data from MongoDB.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

## Create a linked service to MongoDB using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to MongoDB in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for Mongo and select the MongoDB connector.

   :::image type="content" source="media/connector-mongodb-legacy/mongodb-legacy-connector.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the MongoDB connector.":::    


1. Configure the service details, test the connection, and create the new linked service.

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to MongoDB connector.

            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **MongoDbCollection** | Yes |

        },
        "typeProperties": {
            "collectionName": "<Collection name>"
        }

```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by MongoDB source.

### MongoDB as source

The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **MongoDbSource** | Yes |
| query |Use the custom SQL-92 query to read data. For example: select * from MyTable. |No (if "collectionName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromMongoDB",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<MongoDB input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "MongoDbSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM MyTable"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

> [!TIP]
> When specify the SQL query, pay attention to the DateTime format. For example: `SELECT * FROM Account WHERE LastModifiedDate >= '2018-06-01' AND LastModifiedDate < '2018-06-02'` or to use parameter `SELECT * FROM Account WHERE LastModifiedDate >= '@{formatDateTime(pipeline().parameters.StartTime,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')}' AND LastModifiedDate < '@{formatDateTime(pipeline().parameters.EndTime,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')}'`

## Schema by Data Factory

Azure Data Factory service infers schema from a MongoDB collection by using the **latest 100 documents** in the collection. If these 100 documents do not contain full schema, some columns may be ignored during the copy operation.

## Data type mapping for MongoDB

When copying data from MongoDB, the following mappings are used from MongoDB data types to interim data types used within the service internally. See [Schema and data type mappings](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md) to learn about how copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink.

| MongoDB data type | Interim service data type |
|:--- |:--- |
| Binary |Byte[] |
| Boolean |Boolean |
| Date |DateTime |
| NumberDouble |Double |
| NumberInt |Int32 |
| NumberLong |Int64 |
| ObjectID |String |
| String |String |
| UUID |Guid |
| Object |Renormalized into flatten columns with â€œ_" as nested separator |

> [!NOTE]
> To learn about support for arrays using virtual tables, refer to [Support for complex types using virtual tables](#support-for-complex-types-using-virtual-tables) section.
>
> Currently, the following MongoDB data types are not supported: DBPointer, JavaScript, Max/Min key, Regular Expression, Symbol, Timestamp, Undefined.

## Support for complex types using virtual tables

The service uses a built-in ODBC driver to connect to and copy data from your MongoDB database. For complex types such as arrays or objects with different types across the documents, the driver re-normalizes data into corresponding virtual tables. Specifically, if a table contains such columns, the driver generates the following virtual tables:

* A **base table**, which contains the same data as the real table except for the complex type columns. The base table uses the same name as the real table that it represents.
* A **virtual table** for each complex type column, which expands the nested data. The virtual tables are named using the name of the real table, a separator â€œ_" and the name of the array or object.

Virtual tables refer to the data in the real table, enabling the driver to access the de-normalized data. You can access the content of MongoDB arrays by querying and joining the virtual tables.

### Example

For example, ExampleTable here is a MongoDB table that has one column with an array of Objects in each cell - Invoices, and one column with an array of Scalar types - Ratings.

| _id | Customer Name | Invoices | Service Level | Ratings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1111 |ABC |[{invoice_id:"123", item:"toaster", price:"456", discount:"0.2"}, {invoice_id:"124", item:"oven", price: "1235", discount: "0.2"}] |Silver |[5,6] |
| 2222 |XYZ |[{invoice_id:"135", item:"fridge", price: "12543", discount: "0.0"}] |Gold |[1,2] |

The driver would generate multiple virtual tables to represent this single table. The first virtual table is the base table named â€œExampleTable", shown in the example. The base table contains all the data of the original table, but the data from the arrays has been omitted and is expanded in the virtual tables.

| _id | Customer Name | Service Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1111 |ABC |Silver |
| 2222 |XYZ |Gold |

The following tables show the virtual tables that represent the original arrays in the example. These tables contain the following:

* A reference back to the original primary key column corresponding to the row of the original array (via the _id column)
* An indication of the position of the data within the original array
* The expanded data for each element within the array

**Table â€œExampleTable_Invoices":**

| _id | ExampleTable_Invoices_dim1_idx | invoice_id | item | price | Discount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1111 |0 |123 |toaster |456 |0.2 |
| 1111 |1 |124 |oven |1235 |0.2 |
| 2222 |0 |135 |fridge |12543 |0.0 |

**Table â€œExampleTable_Ratings":**

| _id | ExampleTable_Ratings_dim1_idx | ExampleTable_Ratings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1111 |0 |5 |
| 1111 |1 |6 |
| 2222 |0 |1 |
| 2222 |1 |2 |
