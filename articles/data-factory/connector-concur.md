# Copy data from Concur using Azure Data Factory (Preview)

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to copy data from Concur. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is currently in preview. You can try it out and give us feedback. If you want to take a dependency on preview connectors in your solution, please contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/).

## Supported capabilities

This Concur connector is supported for the following activities:

- [Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) with [supported source/sink matrix](copy-activity-overview.md)
- [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)

You can copy data from Concur to any supported sink data store. For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

Azure Data Factory provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

> [!NOTE]
> Partner account is currently not supported.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](../../includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Concur connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Concur linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Concur** | Yes |
| clientId | Application client_id supplied by Concur App Management.  | Yes |
| username | The user name that you use to access Concur Service.  | Yes |
| password | The password corresponding to the user name that you provided in the username field. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely in Data Factory, or [reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md). | Yes |
| useEncryptedEndpoints | Specifies whether the data source endpoints are encrypted using HTTPS. The default value is true.  | No |
| useHostVerification | Specifies whether to require the host name in the server's certificate to match the host name of the server when connecting over TLS. The default value is true.  | No |
| usePeerVerification | Specifies whether to verify the identity of the server when connecting over TLS. The default value is true.  | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "ConcurLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Concur",
        "typeProperties": {
            "clientId" : "<clientId>",
            "username" : "<username>",
            "password": {
                "type": "SecureString",
                "value": "<password>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Concur dataset.

To copy data from Concur, set the type property of the dataset to **ConcurObject**. There is no additional type-specific property in this type of dataset. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **ConcurObject** | Yes |
| tableName | Name of the table. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |


**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "ConcurDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "ConcurObject",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Concur linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Concur source.

### ConcurSource as source

To copy data from Concur, set the source type in the copy activity to **ConcurSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **ConcurSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM Opportunities where Id = xxx "`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

**Example:**

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromConcur",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<Concur input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "ConcurSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM Opportunities where Id = xxx"
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```
