### JSON file patterns

When copying data from JSON files, copy activity can automatically detect and parse the following patterns of JSON files. When writing data to JSON files, you can configure the file pattern on copy activity sink.

- **Type I: setOfObjects**

    Each file contains single object, JSON lines, or concatenated objects.

    * **single object JSON example**

        ```json
        {
            "time": "2015-04-29T07:12:20.9100000Z",
            "callingimsi": "466920403025604",
            "callingnum1": "678948008",
            "callingnum2": "567834760",
            "switch1": "China",
            "switch2": "Germany"
        }
        ```

    * **JSON Lines (default for sink)**

        ```json
        {"time":"2015-04-29T07:12:20.9100000Z","callingimsi":"466920403025604","callingnum1":"678948008","callingnum2":"567834760","switch1":"China","switch2":"Germany"}

        ```

    * **concatenated JSON example**

        ```json
        {
            "time": "2015-04-29T07:12:20.9100000Z",

            "switch2": "UK"
        }
        ```

- **Type II: arrayOfObjects**

    Each file contains an array of objects.

    ```json
    [
        {
            "time": "2015-04-29T07:12:20.9100000Z",

            "switch1": "Germany",
            "switch2": "UK"
        }
    ]
    ```

## Mapping data flow properties

In [mapping data flows](concepts-data-flow-overview.md), you can read and write to JSON format in the following data stores: [Azure Blob Storage](connector-azure-blob-storage.md#mapping-data-flow-properties), [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](connector-azure-data-lake-store.md#mapping-data-flow-properties), [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](connector-azure-data-lake-storage.md#mapping-data-flow-properties) and [SFTP](connector-sftp.md#mapping-data-flow-properties), and you can read JSON format in [Amazon S3](connector-amazon-simple-storage-service.md#mapping-data-flow-properties).

### Source properties

The below table lists the properties supported by a json source. You can edit these properties in the **Source options** tab.

| Name | Description | Required | Allowed values | Data flow script property |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Wild card paths | All files matching the wildcard path will be processed. Overrides the folder and file path set in the dataset. | no | String[] | wildcardPaths |
| Partition root path | For file data that is partitioned, you can enter a partition root path in order to read partitioned folders as columns | no | String | partitionRootPath |
| List of files | Whether your source is pointing to a text file that lists files to process | no | `true` or `false` | fileList |
| Column to store file name | Create a new column with the source file name and path | no | String | rowUrlColumn |
| After completion | Delete or move the files after processing. File path starts from the container root | no | Delete: `true` or `false` <br> Move: `['<from>', '<to>']` | purgeFiles <br> moveFiles |
| Filter by last modified | Choose to filter files based upon when they were last altered | no | Timestamp | modifiedAfter <br> modifiedBefore |
| Single document | Mapping data flows read one JSON document from each file | no | `true` or `false` | singleDocument |
| Unquoted column names | If **Unquoted column names** is selected, mapping data flows reads JSON columns that aren't surrounded by quotes. | no | `true` or `false` |  unquotedColumnNames |
| Has comments | Select **Has comments** if the JSON data has C or C++ style commenting | no | `true` or `false` | asComments |
| Single quoted | Reads JSON columns that aren't surrounded by quotes | no | `true` or `false` | singleQuoted |
| Backslash escaped | Select **Backslash escaped** if backslashes are used to escape characters in the JSON data | no | `true` or `false` | backslashEscape |
| Allow no files found | If true, an error is not thrown if no files are found | no | `true` or `false` | ignoreNoFilesFound |

### Inline dataset

Mapping data flows supports "inline datasets" as an option for defining your source and sink. An inline JSON dataset is defined directly inside your source and sink transformations and is not shared outside of the defined dataflow. It is useful for parameterizing dataset properties directly inside your data flow and can benefit from improved performance over shared ADF datasets.

When you are reading large numbers of source folders and files, you can improve the performance of data flow file discovery by setting the option "User projected schema" inside the Projection | Schema options dialog. This option turns off ADF's default schema auto-discovery and will greatly improve the performance of file discovery. Before setting this option, make sure to import the JSON projection so that ADF has an existing schema for projection. This option does not work with schema drift.

### Source format options

Using a JSON dataset as a source in your data flow allows you to set five additional settings. These settings can be found under the **JSON settings** accordion in the **Source Options** tab. For **Document Form** setting, you can select one of **Single document**, **Document per line**  and **Array of documents** types.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-flow/json-settings.png" alt-text="JSON Settings":::

#### Default

By default, JSON data is read in the following format.

```
{ "json": "record 1" }
{ "json": "record 2" }
{ "json": "record 3" }
```

#### Single document

If **Single document** is selected, mapping data flows read one JSON document from each file. 

``` json
File1.json
{
    "json": "record 1"
}
File2.json
{
    "json": "record 2"
}
File3.json
{
    "json": "record 3"
}
```
If **Document per line** is selected, mapping data flows read one JSON document from each line in a file. 

``` json
File1.json
{"json": "record 1"}

File2.json
 {"time":"2015-04-29T07:12:20.9100000Z","callingimsi":"466920403025604","callingnum1":"678948008","callingnum2":"567834760","switch1":"China","switch2":"Germany"}
 {"time":"2015-04-29T07:13:21.0220000Z","callingimsi":"466922202613463","callingnum1":"123436380","callingnum2":"789037573","switch1":"US","switch2":"UK"}

File3.json
 {"time":"2015-04-29T07:12:20.9100000Z","callingimsi":"466920403025604","callingnum1":"678948008","callingnum2":"567834760","switch1":"China","switch2":"Germany"}
 {"time":"2015-04-29T07:13:21.0220000Z","callingimsi":"466922202613463","callingnum1":"123436380","callingnum2":"789037573","switch1":"US","switch2":"UK"}
 {"time":"2015-04-29T07:13:21.4370000Z","callingimsi":"466923101048691","callingnum1":"678901578","callingnum2":"345626404","switch1":"Germany","switch2":"UK"}
```
If **Array of documents** is selected, mapping data flows read one array of document from a file. 

``` json
File.json
[
        {
            "time": "2015-04-29T07:12:20.9100000Z",
            "callingimsi": "466920403025604",
            "callingnum1": "678948008",
            "callingnum2": "567834760",
            "switch1": "China",
            "switch2": "Germany"
        },
        {
            "time": "2015-04-29T07:13:21.0220000Z",
            "callingimsi": "466922202613463",
            "callingnum1": "123436380",
            "callingnum2": "789037573",
            "switch1": "US",
            "switch2": "UK"
        },
        {
            "time": "2015-04-29T07:13:21.4370000Z",
            "callingimsi": "466923101048691",
            "callingnum1": "678901578",
            "callingnum2": "345626404",
            "switch1": "Germany",
            "switch2": "UK"
        }
    ]
```
> [!NOTE]
> If data flows throw an error stating "corrupt_record" when previewing your JSON data, it is likely that your data contains a single document in your JSON file. Setting "single document" should clear that error.

#### Unquoted column names

If **Unquoted column names** is selected, mapping data flows reads JSON columns that aren't surrounded by quotes. 

```
{ json: "record 1" }
{ json: "record 2" }
{ json: "record 3" }
```

#### Has comments

Select **Has comments** if the JSON data has C or C++ style commenting.

``` json
{ "json": /** comment **/ "record 1" }
{ "json": "record 2" }
{ /** comment **/ "json": "record 3" }
```

#### Single quoted

Select **Single quoted** if the JSON fields and values use single quotes instead of double quotes.

```
{ 'json': 'record 1' }
{ 'json': 'record 2' }
{ 'json': 'record 3' }
```

#### Backslash escaped

Select **Backslash escaped** if backslashes are used to escape characters in the JSON data.

```
{ "json": "record 1" }
{ "json": "\} \" \' \\ \n \\n record 2" }
{ "json": "record 3" }
```

### Sink Properties

The below table lists the properties supported by a json sink. You can edit these properties in the **Settings** tab.

| Name | Description | Required | Allowed values | Data flow script property |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Clear the folder | If the destination folder is cleared prior to write | no | `true` or `false` | truncate |
| File name option | The naming format of the data written. By default, one file per partition in format `part-#####-tid-<guid>` | no | Pattern: String <br> Per partition: String[] <br> As data in column: String <br> Output to single file: `['<fileName>']`  | filePattern <br> partitionFileNames <br> rowUrlColumn <br> partitionFileNames |

### Creating JSON structures in a derived column

You can add a complex column to your data flow via the derived column expression builder. In the derived column transformation, add a new column and open the expression builder by clicking on the blue box. To make a column complex, you can enter the JSON structure manually or use the UX to add subcolumns interactively.

#### Using the expression builder UX

In the output schema side pane, hover over a column and click the plus icon. Select **Add subcolumn** to make the column a complex type.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-flow/derive-add-subcolumn.png" alt-text="Add subcolumn":::

You can add additional columns and subcolumns in the same way. For each non-complex field, an expression can be added in the expression editor to the right.

#### Entering the JSON structure manually

To manually add a JSON structure, add a new column and enter the expression in the editor. The expression follows the following general format:

```
@(
    field1=0,
    field2=@(
        field1=0
    )
)
```

If this expression were entered for a column named "complexColumn", then it would be written to the sink as the following JSON:

```
{
    "complexColumn": {
        "field1": 0,
        "field2": {
            "field1": 0
        }
    }
}
```

#### Sample manual script for complete hierarchical definition
```
@(
    title=Title,
    firstName=FirstName,
    middleName=MiddleName,
    lastName=LastName,
    suffix=Suffix,
    contactDetails=@(
        email=EmailAddress,
        phone=Phone
    ),
    address=@(
        line1=AddressLine1,
        line2=AddressLine2,
        city=City,
        state=StateProvince,
        country=CountryRegion,
        postCode=PostalCode
    ),
    ids=[
        toString(CustomerID), toString(AddressID), rowguid
    ]
)
```
