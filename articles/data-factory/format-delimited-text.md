## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [Datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by the delimited text dataset.

| Property         | Description                                                  | Required |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| type             | The type property of the dataset must be set to **DelimitedText**. | Yes      |
| location         | Location settings of the file(s). Each file-based connector has its own location type and supported properties under `location`.  | Yes      |
| columnDelimiter  | The character(s) used to separate columns in a file. <br>The default value is **comma  `,`**. When the column delimiter is defined as empty string, which means no delimiter, the whole line is taken as a single column.<br>Currently, column delimiter as empty string is only supported for mapping data flow but not Copy activity.  | No       |
| rowDelimiter     |  For Copy activity, the single character or "\r\n" used to separate rows in a file. The default value is any of the following values **on read: ["\r\n", "\r", "\n"]**; **on write: "\r\n"**. "\r\n" is only supported in copy command.<br>For Mapping data flow, the single or two characters used to separate rows in a file. The default value is any of the following values **on read: ["\r\n", "\r", "\n"]**; **on write: "\n"**.<br>When the row delimiter is set to no delimiter (empty string), the column delimiter must be set as no delimiter (empty string) as well, which means to treat the entire content as a single value.<br>Currently, row delimiter as empty string is only supported for mapping data flow but not Copy activity. | No       |
| quoteChar        | The single character to quote column values if it contains column delimiter. <br>The default value is **double quotes** `"`. <br>When `quoteChar` is defined as empty string, it means there is no quote char and column value is not quoted, and `escapeChar` is used to escape the column delimiter and itself. | No       |
| escapeChar       | The single character to escape quotes inside a quoted value.<br>The default value is **backslash `\`**. <br>When `escapeChar` is defined as empty string, the `quoteChar` must be set as empty string as well, in which case make sure all column values don't contain delimiters. | No       |
| firstRowAsHeader | Specifies whether to treat/make the first row as a header line with names of columns.<br>Allowed values are **true** and **false** (default).<br>When first row as header is false, note UI data preview and lookup activity output auto generate column names as Prop_{n} (starting from 0), copy activity requires [explicit mapping](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md#explicit-mapping) from source to sink and locates columns by ordinal (starting from 1), and mapping data flow lists and locates columns with name as Column_{n} (starting from 1).  | No       |
| nullValue        | Specifies the string representation of null value. <br>The default value is **empty string**. | No       |
| encodingName     | The encoding type used to read/write test files. <br>Allowed values are as follows: "UTF-8","UTF-8 without BOM", "UTF-16", "UTF-16BE", "UTF-32", "UTF-32BE", "US-ASCII", "UTF-7", "BIG5", "EUC-JP", "EUC-KR", "GB2312", "GB18030", "JOHAB", "SHIFT-JIS", "CP875", "CP866", "IBM00858", "IBM037", "IBM273", "IBM437", "IBM500", "IBM737", "IBM775", "IBM850", "IBM852", "IBM855", "IBM857", "IBM860", "IBM861", "IBM863", "IBM864", "IBM865", "IBM869", "IBM870", "IBM01140", "IBM01141", "IBM01142", "IBM01143", "IBM01144", "IBM01145", "IBM01146", "IBM01147", "IBM01148", "IBM01149", "ISO-2022-JP", "ISO-2022-KR", "ISO-8859-1", "ISO-8859-2", "ISO-8859-3", "ISO-8859-4", "ISO-8859-5", "ISO-8859-6", "ISO-8859-7", "ISO-8859-8", "ISO-8859-9", "ISO-8859-13", "ISO-8859-15", "WINDOWS-874", "WINDOWS-1250", "WINDOWS-1251", "WINDOWS-1252", "WINDOWS-1253", "WINDOWS-1254", "WINDOWS-1255", "WINDOWS-1256", "WINDOWS-1257", "WINDOWS-1258".<br>Note mapping data flow doesn't support UTF-7 encoding.<br>Note mapping data flow doesn't support UTF-8 encoding with Byte Order Mark (BOM). | No |
| compressionCodec | The compression codec used to read/write text files. <br>Allowed values are **bzip2**, **gzip**, **deflate**, **ZipDeflate**, **TarGzip**, **Tar**, **snappy**, or **lz4**. Default is not compressed. <br>**Note** currently Copy activity doesn't support "snappy" & "lz4", and mapping data flow doesn't support "ZipDeflate", "TarGzip" and "Tar". <br>**Note** when using copy activity to decompress **ZipDeflate**/**TarGzip**/**Tar** file(s) and write to file-based sink data store, by default files are extracted to the folder:`<path specified in dataset>/<folder named as source compressed file>/`, use `preserveZipFileNameAsFolder`/`preserveCompressionFileNameAsFolder` on [copy activity source](#delimited-text-as-source) to control whether to preserve the name of the compressed file(s) as folder structure. | No       |
| compressionLevel | The compression ratio. <br>Allowed values are **Optimal** or **Fastest**.<br>- **Fastest:** The compression operation should complete as quickly as possible, even if the resulting file is not optimally compressed.<br>- **Optimal**: The compression operation should be optimally compressed, even if the operation takes a longer time to complete. For more information, see [Compression Level](/dotnet/api/system.io.compression.compressionlevel) topic. | No       |

This property does not apply when source is file-based store or [partition-option-enabled data store](copy-activity-performance-features.md).  | No |

## Mapping data flow properties

In mapping data flows, you can read and write to delimited text format in the following data stores: [Azure Blob Storage](connector-azure-blob-storage.md#mapping-data-flow-properties), [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](connector-azure-data-lake-store.md#mapping-data-flow-properties), [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](connector-azure-data-lake-storage.md#mapping-data-flow-properties) and [SFTP](connector-sftp.md#mapping-data-flow-properties), and you can read delimited text format in [Amazon S3](connector-amazon-simple-storage-service.md#mapping-data-flow-properties).

### Inline dataset

Mapping data flows supports "inline datasets" as an option for defining your source and sink. An inline delimited dataset is defined directly inside your source and sink transformations and is not shared outside of the defined dataflow. It is useful for parameterizing dataset properties directly inside your data flow and can benefit from improved performance from shared ADF datasets.

When you are reading large numbers of source folders and files, you can improve the performance of data flow file discovery by setting the option "User projected schema" inside the Projection | Schema options dialog. This option turns off ADF's default schema auto-discovery and will greatly improve the performance of file discovery. Before setting this option, make sure to import the projection so that ADF has an existing schema for projection. This option does not work with schema drift.

### Source properties

The below table lists the properties supported by a delimited text source. You can edit these properties in the **Source options** tab.

| Name | Description | Required | Allowed values | Data flow script property |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Wild card paths | All files matching the wildcard path will be processed. Overrides the folder and file path set in the dataset. | no | String[] | wildcardPaths |
| Partition root path | For file data that is partitioned, you can enter a partition root path in order to read partitioned folders as columns | no | String | partitionRootPath |
| List of files | Whether your source is pointing to a text file that lists files to process | no | `true` or `false` | fileList |
| Multiline rows | Does the source file contain rows that span multiple lines. Multiline values must be in quotes. | no `true` or `false` | multiLineRow |
| Column to store file name | Create a new column with the source file name and path | no | String | rowUrlColumn |
| After completion | Delete or move the files after processing. File path starts from the container root | no | Delete: `true` or `false` <br> Move: `['<from>', '<to>']` | purgeFiles <br> moveFiles |
| Filter by last modified | Choose to filter files based upon when they were last altered | no | Timestamp | modifiedAfter <br> modifiedBefore |
| Allow no files found | If true, an error is not thrown if no files are found | no | `true` or `false` | ignoreNoFilesFound |
| Maximum columns | The default value is 20480. Customize this value when the column number is over 20480 | no | Integer | maxColumns |

> [!NOTE]
> Data flow sources support for list of files is limited to 1024 entries in your file. To include more files, use wildcards in your file list.
