# Reliability guides by service


This article provides links to reliability guidance for many Azure services.  Most reliability guides contain the following information:

- *Reliability architecture overview* is a synopsis of how the service supports reliability, including information about which components are managed by Microsoft and which are managed by you, any built-in redundancy features, and how to provision and manage multiple resources, if applicable.
- *Transient fault handling* details how the service handles normal day-to-day transient faults that can occur in the cloud and include information on how to handle these faults in your application. This includes information on retry policies, timeouts, and other best practices for handling transient faults.
- *Availability zones* such as zonal and zone-redundant deployment options, traffic routing and data replication between zones, what happens if a zone experiences an outage, failback, and how to configure your resources for availability zone support.
- *Multi-region support* such as how to configure multi-region or geo-disaster support, traffic routing and data replication between regions, region-down experience, failover and failback support, alternative multi-region support.

Some guides also contain information on:

- *Backup support* such as who controls backups, where they are stored and replicated to, how they can be recovered, and whether they are accessible only within a region or across regions.
- *Service level agreements* for availability, including how the expected uptime changes based on the configuration you use.

## Reliability guides by service

This section provides links to reliability guidance for many Azure services. Each service guide contains information on how the service supports reliability features. 

>[!NOTE]
>Some service documents are in the process of, or are not yet updated into a single reliability guide format. These may contain more than one document that references reliability guidance.
