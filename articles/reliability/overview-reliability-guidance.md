# Reliability guides by service

This article provides links to reliability guidance for many Azure services. Most reliability guides contain the following information:

- *Reliability architecture overview* is a synopsis of how the service supports reliability. It includes information about which components Microsoft manages and which components you manage, built-in redundancy features, and how to provision and manage multiple resources, if applicable.

- *Transient fault handling* describes how the service handles day-to-day transient faults that can occur in the cloud. It also describes how to handle these faults in your application, including information about retry policies, timeouts, and other best practices.

- *Availability zones* describe zonal and zone-redundant deployment options, traffic routing and data replication between zones, what happens when a zone experiences an outage, failback, and how to configure your resources for availability zone support.

- *Multi-region support* describes how to configure multi-region or geo-disaster support, traffic routing and data replication between regions, region-down experience, failover and failback support, and alternative multi-region support.

Some guides also contain information about:

- *Backup support*, such as who controls backups, where they're stored and replicated to, how they can be recovered, and whether they're accessible only within a region or across regions.

- *Service-level agreements (SLAs)* for availability, including how the expected uptime changes based on the configuration that you use.

## Reliability guides by service

This section provides links to reliability guidance for many Azure services. Each service guide contains information about how the service supports reliability features. 

> [!NOTE]
> Some service documents don't follow a single reliability guide format. These services might list more than one article that references reliability guidance.
