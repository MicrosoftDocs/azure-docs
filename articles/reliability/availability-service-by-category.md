# Available services by region types and categories 

Availability of services across Azure regions depends on a region's type. There are two types of regions in Azure: *recommended* and *alternate*.

- **Recommended** regions provide the broadest range of service capabilities and currently support availability zones. In the Azure portal, recommended regions are designated as **Recommended**.
- **Alternate** regions extend Azure's footprint within a data residency boundary where a recommended region currently exists. Alternate regions help to optimize latency and provide a second region for disaster recovery needs but don't support availability zones. Azure conducts regular assessments of alternate regions to determine if they should become recommended regions. In the Azure portal, alternate regions are designated   as **Other**.

## Service categories across region types
 
[!INCLUDE [Service categories across region types](../../includes/service-categories/service-category-definitions.md)]

## Available services by region category

Azure assigns service categories as foundational, mainstream, and strategic at general availability. Typically, services start as a strategic service and are upgraded to mainstream and foundational as demand and use grow.

Azure services are presented in the following lists by category. Note that some services are non-regional, which means that they're available globally regardless of region. For information and a complete list of non-regional services, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/).
