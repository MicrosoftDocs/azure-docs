# Reliability in Azure Bot Service

When you create an application (bot) in Azure, you can choose whether or not your bot resource will have global or local data residency. Local data residency ensures that your bot's personal data is preserved, stored, and processed within certain geographic boundaries (like EU boundaries).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Availability zone support is not enabled for any standard channels in the regional bot service.

This article describes reliability support in Azure Bot Service, and covers both regional reliability with availability zones and cross-region resiliency with disaster recovery for bots with local data residency. For a more detailed overview of reliability in Azure, see [Azure reliability](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/overview).

For more information on deploying bots with local data residency and regional compliance, see [Regionalization in Azure Bot Service](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-concept-regionalization).

## Availability zone support

[!INCLUDE [Availability zone description](includes/reliability-availability-zone-description-include.md)]

For regional bots, Azure Bot Service supports zone redundancy by default.  You don't need to set it up or reconfigure for availability zone support. 

### Prerequisites

- Your bot must be regional (not global). 
- Currently, only the "westeurope" region supports availability zones.

### Zone down experience

During a zone-wide outage, the customer should expect a brief degradation of performance, until the service's self-healing rebalances underlying capacity to adjust to healthy zones. This isn't dependent on zone restoration; it's expected that the Microsoft-managed service self-healing state compensates for a lost zone, using capacity from other zones.

### Cross-region disaster recovery in multi-region geography

[!INCLUDE [introduction to disaster recovery](includes/reliability-disaster-recovery-description-include.md)]

Azure Bot Service runs in active-active mode for both global and regional services. When an outage occurs, you don't need to detect errors or manage the service. Azure Bot Service automatically performs autofailover and auto recovery in a multi-region geographical architecture. For the EU bot regional service, Azure Bot Service provides two full regions inside Europe with active/active replication to ensure redundancy. For the global bot service, all available regions/geographies can be served as the global footprint.
