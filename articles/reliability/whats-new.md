The list replaces the previously separated lists for region pairs and nonpaired regions, and availability zones support.

- [Nonregional Azure services](./regions-nonregional-services.md): This article explains the difference between global and geographic nonregional services, and provides a list of nonregional services that indicates whether each is a global or geographic service.

### New articles

- [What are business continuity, high availability, and disaster recovery?](./concept-business-continuity-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md): 
This article defines and describes business continuity and business continuity planning in terms of risk management through high availability and disaster recovery design. While this article doesn't provide explicit guidance about how to meet your own business continuity needs, it helps you to understand the concepts that are used throughout Microsoft's reliability guidance.

- [What are Azure regions?](./regions-overview.md): This article helps you understand Azure regions, and gives you an overview of the resiliency options that some Azure regions support, while offering links to more detailed information on each topic.

- [Azure region pairs and nonpaired regions](./regions-overview.md): This article describes both how region pairs and nonpaired regions are used in Azure.

- [Multi-region solutions in nonpaired regions](./regions-multi-region-nonpaired.md): This article lists some of the services and possible configurations for multi-region solutions, without requiring paired regions.
 
### Updated articles

- [Azure reliability documentation overview](./overview.md): We refreshed the overview of Azure reliability documentation to reflect new documentation. Updates include reliability fundamentals, Azure regions, and Azure availability zones.

- [What are availability zones?](./availability-zones-overview.md): We updated this article to include a video that explains availability zones. We also added new sections on configuring resources for availability zone support, as well as types of availability zone support.
