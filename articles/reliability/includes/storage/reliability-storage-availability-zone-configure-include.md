- **Change replication type.** To learn how to change an existing storage account to zone-redundant storage (ZRS) and about configuration options and requirements, see [Change how a storage account is replicated](/azure/storage/common/redundancy-migration).

- **Disable zone redundancy.** Convert ZRS accounts back to a nonzonal configuration, such as locally redundant storage (LRS), by using the same redundancy configuration change process.
