It may be the case that the cross-region failover capabilities of Azure Storage are unsuitable for the following reasons:

- Your storage account is in a nonpaired region.

- Your business uptime goals aren't satisfied by the recovery time or data loss that the built-in failover options provide.

- You need to fail over to a region that isn't your primary region's pair.

- You need an active/active configuration across regions.

Instead, you can design a cross-region failover solution that's tailored to your needs. A complete treatment of deployment topologies for Azure Table Storage is outside the scope of this article, but you can consider a multi-region deployment model.

Azure Table Storage can be deployed across multiple regions using separate storage accounts in each region. This approach provides flexibility in region selection, the ability to use non-paired regions, and more granular control over replication timing and data consistency. When implementing multiple storage accounts across regions, you need to configure cross-region data replication, implement load balancing and failover policies, and ensure data consistency across regions.
