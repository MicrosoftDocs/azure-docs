- **Asynchronous replication latency:** Data replication to the secondary region is asynchronous, which means that there's a lag between when data is written to the primary region and when it becomes available in the secondary region. This lag can result in potential data loss if a primary region failure occurs before recent data is replicated. The data loss is measured by the recovery point objective (RPO). You can expect the replication lag to be less than 15 minutes, but this time is an estimate and not guaranteed.

   You can check the [Last Sync Time property](/azure/storage/common/last-sync-time-get) to understand how much data might be lost if your storage account has an unplanned failover.
