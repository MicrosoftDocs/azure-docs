You can deploy Azure Storage across multiple regions by using separate storage accounts in each region. This approach provides flexibility in region selection, the ability to use nonpaired regions, and more granular control over replication timing and data consistency. When you implement multiple storage accounts across regions, you need to configure cross-region data replication, implement load balancing and failover policies, and ensure data consistency across regions.
