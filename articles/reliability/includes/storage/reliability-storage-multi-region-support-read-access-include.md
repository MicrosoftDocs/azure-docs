- [Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) and read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS)](/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy#read-access-to-data-in-the-secondary-region) extends geo-redundant storage (GRS) and geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS), with the added benefit of read access to the secondary endpoint. These options are ideal for applications designed for high availability business-critical applications. In the unlikely event that the primary endpoint experiences an outage, applications configured for read access to the secondary region can continue to operate.
