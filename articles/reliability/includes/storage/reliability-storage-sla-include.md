The service-level agreement (SLA) for Azure Storage describes the expected availability of the service and the conditions that must be met to achieve that availability expectation. The availability SLA you're eligible for depends on the storage tier and the replication type that you use. For more information, see [SLAs for Online Services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services).
