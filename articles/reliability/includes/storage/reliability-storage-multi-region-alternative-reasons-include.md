The cross-region failover capabilities of Azure Storage might be unsuitable because of the following reasons:

- Your storage account is in a nonpaired region.

- Your business uptime goals aren't satisfied by the recovery time or data loss that the built-in failover options provide.

- You need to fail over to a region that isn't your primary region's pair.

- You need an active/active configuration across regions.
