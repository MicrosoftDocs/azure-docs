An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources that run your web apps. All web apps must run inside a plan. You can scale a plan to run on multiple VM *instances*, also called *workers*. These instances provide the compute resources that run your app code. A single App Service plan can host multiple apps. All apps run on the same shared set of VM instances.
