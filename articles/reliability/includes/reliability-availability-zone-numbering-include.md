When you select which availability zones to use, you're actually selecting the *logical availability zone*. If you deploy other workload components in a different Azure subscription, they might use a different logical availability zone number to access the same physical availability zone. For more information, see [Physical and logical availability zones](../availability-zones-overview.md#physical-and-logical-availability-zones).
