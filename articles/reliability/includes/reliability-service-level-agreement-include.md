The service-level agreement (SLA) for Azure services describes the expected availability of each service and the conditions that your solution must meet to achieve that availability expectation. For more information, see [SLAs for online services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services).
