# Azure regions with availability zone support

Azure provides the most extensive global footprint of any cloud provider and is rapidly opening new regions and availability zones. Azure supports availability zones in every geographic area that has an Azure datacenter. For more information on availability zones and regions, see [What are Azure regions and availability zones?](availability-zones-overview.md)

The following regions currently support availability zones:

| Americas | Europe | Middle East | Africa | Asia Pacific |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Brazil South | France Central | Israel Central | South Africa North | Australia East |
| Canada Central | Germany West Central | Qatar Central | | Central India |
| Central US | Italy North | UAE North | | China North 3 |
| East US | North Europe | | | East Asia |

\* To learn more about availability zones and available services support in these regions, contact your Microsoft sales or customer representative. For upcoming regions that support availability zones, see [Azure geographies](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/).

> [!NOTE]
> Even when a region provides availability zones, it's possible that some services might not support them in that region. Refer to the [Azure service reliability guides](./overview-reliability-guidance.md) to learn about region support for availability zone-enabled services.
