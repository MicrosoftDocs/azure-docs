# Reliability in Azure Container Instances

This article describes reliability support in Azure Container Instances (ACI) and covers both intra-regional resiliency with [availability zones](#availability-zone-support) and information on Disaster Recovery. For a more detailed overview of reliability in Azure, see [Azure reliability](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/overview).

## Availability zone support

[!INCLUDE [Availability zone description](includes/reliability-availability-zone-description-include.md)]


Azure Container Instances supports *zonal* container group deployments, meaning the instance is pinned to a specific, self-selected availability zone. The availability zone is specified at the container group level. Containers within a container group can't have unique availability zones. To change your container group's availability zone, you must delete the container group and create another container group with the new availability zone.


### Prerequisites

- Zonal container group deployments are supported in most regions where ACI is available for Linux and Windows Server 2019 container groups. For details, see [Regions and resource availability](/azure/container-instances/container-instances-region-availability).

* If using Azure CLI, ensure version `2.30.0` or later is installed.
* If using PowerShell, ensure version `2.1.1-preview` or later is installed.
* If using the Java SDK, ensure version `2.9.0` or later is installed.
* Availability zone support is only available on ACI API version `09-01-2021` or later.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Container groups with GPU resources don't support availability zones at this time.

### Availability zone redeployment and migration

To change your container group's availability zone, you must delete the container group and create another container group with the new availability zone.


### Create a resource with availability zone enabled

To create a Container Instance resource with availability zone enabled, you'll need to deploy a container group using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template.

>[!NOTE]
>Examples in this article are formatted for the Bash shell. If you prefer another shell, adjust the line continuation characters accordingly.

**To deploy a container with ARM:**

1. Copy-paste the following JSON into a new file named `azuredeploy.json`. This example template deploys a container group with a single container into availability zone 1 in East US.

    ```json

                                "protocol": "TCP"

            }
        }
    }
    ```

2. Create a resource group with the [az group create][az-group-create] command:

    ```azurecli
    az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
    ```

3. Deploy the template with the [az deployment group create][az-deployment-group-create] command:

    ```azurecli
    az deployment group create \
      --resource-group myResourceGroup \
      --template-file azuredeploy.json
    ```
4. To verify the container group deployed successfully into an availability zone, view the container group details with the [az container show][az-container-show] command:
    
    ```azurecli
    az container show --name acilinuxpublicipcontainergroup --resource-group myResourceGroup
    ```

### Zonal failover support

A container group of container instances is assigned to a single availability zone. As a result, that group of container instances won't be impacted by an outage that occurs in any other availability zone of the same region

If, however, an outage occurs in the availability zone of the container group, you can expect downtime for all the container instances within that group.

To avoid container instance downtime, we recommend that you create a minimum of two container groups across two different availability zones in a given region. This ensures that your container instance resources are up and running whenever any single zone in that region experiences outage.


## Disaster recovery

When an entire Azure region or datacenter experiences downtime, your mission-critical code needs to continue processing in a different region. Azure Container Instances deployed with zonal configuration run in a specific zone within a specific region. There's no built-in redundancy available. To avoid loss of execution during region wide outages, you can redundantly deploy the container instances in other regions.
