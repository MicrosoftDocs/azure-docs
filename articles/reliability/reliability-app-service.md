# Reliability in Azure App Service

This article describes reliability support in [Azure App Service](../app-service/overview.md), covering intra-regional resiliency with [availability zones](#availability-zone-support), [multi-region deployments](#multi-region-support), and transient fault handling.

Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. Azure App Service adds the power of Microsoft Azure to your application, with capabilities for security, load balancing, autoscaling, and automated management. To explore how Azure App Service can bolster the reliability and resiliency of your application workload, see [App Service overview](../app-service/overview.md)

When you deploy Azure App Service, you can provision multiple instances in an *App Service plan*, which represents the compute workers that run your application code. For more information, see [Azure App Service plan](/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans). Although the platform makes an effort to deploy the instances across different fault domains, it doesn't automatically spread the instances across availability zones.

## Production deployment recommendations

::: zone pivot="free-shared-basic"

- Use premium v3/v4 App Service plans.

- [Enable zone redundancy](#availability-zone-support), which requires that you use Premium v3, Premium v4 or Isolated v2 App Service plans and that you have at minimum two instances of the plan. To view more information, make sure that you select the appropriate tier at the top of this page.

## Transient faults

[!INCLUDE [Transient fault description](includes/reliability-transient-fault-description-include.md)]

Microsoft-provided SDKs usually handle transient faults. Because you host your own applications on Azure App Service, consider how to avoid causing transient faults by making sure that you:

- **Deploy multiple instances in your plan.**  Azure App Service performs automated updates and other forms of maintenance on instances in your plan. If an instance becomes unhealthy, the service can automatically replace that instance with a new healthy instance. During the replacement process, there can be a short period when the previous instance is unavailable and a new instance isn't yet ready to serve traffic. You can mitigate the impact of this behavior by deploying multiple instances of your App Service plan.

- **Use deployment slots.** Azure App Service [deployment slots](/azure/app-service/deploy-staging-slots) allow for zero-downtime deployments of your applications. Use deployment slots to minimize the impact of deployments and configuration changes for your users. Using deployment slots also reduces the likelihood that your application restarts. Restarting causes a transient fault.

- **Avoid scaling up or down.** Instead, select a tier and instance size that meet your performance requirements under typical load. Only scale out instances to handle changes in traffic volume. Scaling up and down can trigger an application restart.

## Availability zone support

[!INCLUDE [AZ support description](includes/reliability-availability-zone-description-include.md)]

Azure App Service can be configured as *zone redundant*, which means that your resources are spread across multiple [availability zones](../reliability/availability-zones-overview.md). Spreading across multiple zones helps your production workloads achieve resiliency and reliability. When you configure zone redundancy on App Service plans, all apps that use the plan are made zone redundant.

Instance spreading with a zone-redundant deployment is determined using the following rules. These rules apply even as the app scales in and out:

- **Minimum instances:** Your App Service plan must have a minimum of two instances for zone redundancy.

- **Maximum availability zones supported by your plan:** Azure determines the number of availability zones that your plan can use. To view the number of availability zones that your plan is able to use, see the *maximumNumberOfZones* property on the App Service plan. This is a read-only property. If this value is equal to 1, your App Service plan doesn't support zone redundancy. If the *maximumNumberOfZones* value is greater than 1, your App Service plan can be configured for zone redundancy.

    ```azurecli
    az appservice plan show -n <app-service-plan-name> -g <resource-group-name> --query properties.maximumNumberOfZones
    ```

- **Instance distribution:** When zone redundancy is enabled, plan instances are distributed across multiple availability zones automatically. The distribution is based on the following rules:

    - The instances distribute evenly if you specify a capacity (number of instances) greater than *maximumNumberOfZones* and the number of instances is divisible by *maximumNumberOfZones*.
    - Any remaining instances are distributed across the remaining zones.
    - When the App Service platform allocates instances for a zone-redundant App Service plan, it uses best-effort zone balancing that the underlying Azure virtual machine scale sets provide. An App Service plan is balanced if each zone has the same number of VMs or differs by plus one VM or minus one VM from all other zones. For more information, see [Zone balancing](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-use-availability-zones#zone-balancing).

- **Physical zone placement** You can view the [physical availability zone](availability-zones-overview.md#physical-and-logical-availability-zones) used for each of your App Service plan instances. Use the [REST API](/rest/api/appservice/web-apps/get-instance-info), which returns the `physicalZone` value for each instance.

    ```azurecli
    az rest --method get --url https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{appName}/instances?api-version=2024-04-01
    ```

For App Service plans that aren't configured as zone redundant, the underlying virtual machine instances aren't resilient to availability zone failures. They can experience downtime during an outage in any zone in that region.

### Regions supported

::: zone pivot="free-shared-basic"

Zone-redundant App Service plans require that you use the Premium v2 or v3 tier and can be deployed in [any region that supports availability zones](./regions-list.md). To view more information, make sure that you select the appropriate tier at the top of this page.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="premium"

Zone-redundant App Service plans can be deployed in [any region that supports availability zones](./regions-list.md).

::: zone-end
 
::: zone pivot="isolated"

To see which regions support availability zones for App Service Environment v3, see [Regions](../app-service/environment/overview.md#regions).

::: zone-end

### Requirements

::: zone pivot="free-shared-basic,premium"

- You must use either the [Premium v2, Premium v3, or Premium v4 plan types](/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans).

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="premium,isolated"

- You must use the [Premium v2, Premium v3, or Isolated v2 plan types](/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans).

- Availability zones are supported only on newer App Service scale units. Even if you're using one of the supported regions, if availability zones aren't supported for the scale unit you use then you receive an error when creating a zone-redundant App Service plan.

    The scale unit you're assigned to is based on the resource group you deploy an App Service plan to. To ensure that your workloads land on a scale unit that supports availability zones, you might need to create a new resource group and then create a new App Service plan and App Service app within the new resource group.

    To see if your App Service plan is on a stamp that supports availability zones, check the `maximumNumberOfZones` property for the App Service plan. If the value is greater than one, your stamp supports zones and you can enable zone redundancy on the plan. If the value is equal to one, your scale unit doesn't support availability zones and you need to deploy a new plan to enable zone redundancy.

    ```azurecli
    az appservice plan show -n <app-service-plan-name> -g <resource-group-name> --query properties.maximumNumberOfZones
    ```

- You must deploy a minimum of two instances in your plan.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="premium,isolated"

### Considerations

During an availability zone outage, some aspects of Azure App Service might be impacted even though the application continues to serve traffic. These behaviors include App Service plan scaling, application creation, application configuration, and application publishing.

When you enable zone redundancy on your App Service plan, you also improve your resiliency to updates that the App Service platform rolls out. To learn more, see [Reliability during service maintenance](#reliability-during-service-maintenance).

### Cost

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="premium"


When you're using App Service Premium v2, Premium v3, or Premium v4 plans, there's no extra cost associated with enabling availability zones as long as you have two or more instances in your App Service plan. You're charged based on your App Service plan SKU, the capacity you specify, and any instances you scale to based on your autoscale criteria.


If you enable availability zones but specify a capacity less than two, the platform enforces a minimum instance count of two. The platform charges you for those two instances.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="isolated"

When you're using App Service Isolated v2 plans, there's no extra cost associated with enabling availability zones as long as you have two or more instances in your App Service plan. You're charged based on your App Service plan SKU, the capacity you specify, and any instances you scale to based on your autoscale criteria.

If you enable availability zones but specify a capacity less than two, the platform enforces a minimum instance count of two. The platform charges you for those two instances.

::: zone-end

### Configure availability zone support

::: zone pivot="free-shared-basic"

- **Create a new App Service plan with zone redundancy.** To deploy a new zone-redundant Azure App Service plan, you must use either the [Premium v2 or Premium v3 plan types](/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans). To view more information, make sure that you select the appropriate tier at the top of this page.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="premium"

- **Create a new App Service plan with zone redundancy.** To deploy a new zone-redundant App Service plan, select the *Zone redundant* option when you deploy the plan in the Azure portal or set the App Service plan `zoneRedundant` property to `true` in the Azure CLI command, Azure PowerShell command, Bicep file, or Azure Resource Manager template.

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/azurecli)

    ```azurecli
    az appservice plan create -g MyResourceGroup -n MyPlan --zone-redundant --number-of-workers 2 --sku P1V3
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use the Azure CLI to modify the `zone-redundant` property, you must specify the `--number-of-workers` property, which is the number of instances, and use a capacity greater than or equal to 2.

    # [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

    ```bicep
    resource appServicePlan 'Microsoft.Web/serverfarms@2022-03-01' = {
        name: appServicePlanName
        location: location
        sku: {
            name: sku
            capacity: 2
        }
        kind: 'linux'
        properties: {
            reserved: true
            zoneRedundant: true
        }
    }
    ```

    ---

- **Migration.** If you have an existing App Service plan that supports zone redundancy (the maximum available zones is greater than 1), you can enable zone redundancy by setting the App Service plan's `zoneRedundant` property to `true` in the Azure CLI, your Bicep file, or your Resource Manager template:

    ```azurecli
    az appservice plan update -g <resource group name> -n <app service plan name> --set zoneRedundant=true sku.capacity=2
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use the Azure CLI to modify the `zoneRedundant` property, you must specify the `sku.capacity` property, which is the number of instances, and use a capacity greater than or equal to 2.
   
    If you're on a plan or a stamp that doesn't support availability zones, you must create a new App Service plan in a new resource group so that you land on the App Service footprint that supports zones.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Changing the zone redundancy status of an App Service plan is almost instantaneous. You don't experience downtime or performance issues during the process.

- **Disable zone redundancy.** To disable zone redundancy, you can set the App Service plan `zoneRedundant` property to `false` or use the Azure CLI.

    ```azurecli
    az appservice plan update -g <resource group name> -n <app service plan name> --set zoneRedundant=false sku.capacity=1
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use the Azure CLI to disable the `zoneRedundant` property, you should specify the `sku.capacity` property, otherwise the value defaults to 1.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="isolated"

- **Create a new App Service plan with zone redundancy.** To deploy a new zone-redundant Azure App Service Environment, see [Create an App Service Environment](/azure/app-service/environment/creation). 

    To create a new zone-redundant App Service plan in an existing App Service Environment:
    
    1. Ensure that the App Service Environment has zone redundancy enabled. You can only enable zone redundancy on an Isolated v2 App Service plan when the App Service Environment is zone redundant. 
    1. Select the *Zone redundant* option when you deploy the plan in the Azure portal, or set the App Service plan's `zoneRedundant` property to `true` in the Azure CLI command, Azure PowerShell command, Bicep file, or Azure Resource Manager template.

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/azurecli)

    ```azurecli
    az appservice plan create -g MyResourceGroup -n MyPlan --app-service-environment MyAse --zone-redundant --number-of-workers 2 --sku I1V2
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use the Azure CLI to modify the `zoneRedundant` property, you must specify the `number-of-workers` property, which is the number of instances, and use a capacity greater than or equal to 2.

    # [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

    ```bicep
    resource appServicePlan 'Microsoft.Web/serverfarms@2022-03-01' = {
        name: appServicePlanName
        location: location
        hostingEnvironmentProfile: {
            id: '...'
        }
        sku: {
            name: sku
            capacity: 2
        }
        kind: 'linux'
        properties: {
            reserved: true
            zoneRedundant: true
        }
    }
    ```

    ---

- **Migration.** If you have an existing App Service Environment or Isolated v2 App Service plan that supports zone redundancy, you can enable zone redundancy at any time.
    
    To enable zone redundancy for the App Service Environment, set the `zoneRedundant` property to `true` or use the Azure CLI.

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/azurecli)

    ```azurecli
    az resource update --ids /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.Web/hostingEnvironments/{aseName} --set properties.zoneRedundant=true
    ```

    # [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

    ```bicep
    resource asev3 'Microsoft.Web/hostingEnvironments@2020-12-01' = {
        name: aseName
        location: location
        kind: 'ASEV3'
        dependsOn: [
            virtualnetwork
        ] 
        properties: {
            ...
            zoneRedundant: true
        }
    }
    ```

    ---

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you change the zone redundancy status of the App Service Environment, you initiate an upgrade that takes 12-24 hours to complete. During the upgrade process, you don't experience any downtime or performance issues.

    For Isolated v2 App Service plans, if the App Service Environment is zone redundant, the App Service plans can be made zone redundant. Each App Service plan has its own independent zone redundancy setting, which means that you can have a mix of zone redundant and non-zone redundant plans in an App Service Environment. To enable zone redundancy on an Isolated v2 App Service plan, set the App Service plan's `zoneRedundant` property to `true` or use the Azure CLI.   

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/azurecli)

    ```azurecli
    az appservice plan update -g <resource group name> -n <app service plan name> --set zoneRedundant=true sku.capacity=2
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use the Azure CLI to modify the `zoneRedundant` property, you must specify the `sku.capacity` property, which is the number of instances, and use a capacity greater than or equal to 2.

    # [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

    ```bicep
    resource appServicePlan 'Microsoft.Web/serverfarms@2022-03-01' = {
        name: appServicePlanName
        location: location
        hostingEnvironmentProfile: {
            id: '...'
        }
        sku: {
            name: sku
            capacity: 2
        }
        kind: 'linux'
        properties: {
            reserved: true
            zoneRedundant: true
        }
    }
    ``` 
    
    ---

- **Disable zone redundancy.** To disable zone redundancy, you can set the App Service plan or App Service Environment `zoneRedundant` property to `false` or use the Azure CLI.

    ```azurecli
    az resource update --ids /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.Web/hostingEnvironments/{aseName} --set properties.zoneRedundant=false

    az appservice plan update -g <resource group name> -n <app service plan name> --set zoneRedundant=false sku.capacity=1
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use the Azure CLI to disable the `zoneRedundant` property, you should specify the `sku.capacity` property, otherwise the value defaults to 1.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="premium,isolated"

### Capacity planning and management

To prepare for availability zone failure, consider *over-provisioning* the capacity of your App Service plan. Over-provisioning allows the solution to tolerate some degree of capacity loss and still continue to function without degraded performance. To learn more about over-provisioning, see [Manage capacity with over-provisioning](./concept-redundancy-replication-backup.md#manage-capacity-with-over-provisioning).

### Normal operations

This section describes what to expect when Azure App Service plans are configured for zone redundancy and all availability zones are operational.

- **Traffic routing between zones:** During normal operations, traffic is routed between all of your available App Service plan instances across all availability zones.

- **Data replication between zones:** During normal operations, any state stored in your application's file system is stored in zone-redundant storage, and is synchronously replicated between availability zones.

### Zone-down experience

This section describes what to expect when an Azure App Service plan is configured for zone redundancy and there's an availability zone outage:

- **Detection and response:** The App Service platform is responsible for detecting a failure in an availability zone and responding. You don't need to do anything to initiate a zone failover.

- **Active requests:** When an availability zone is unavailable, any requests in progress that are connected to an App Service plan instance in the faulty availability zone are terminated. They need to be retried.

- **Traffic rerouting:** When a zone is unavailable, Azure App Service detects the lost instances from that zone. It automatically attempts to find new replacement instances. Then, it spreads traffic across the new instances as needed.

    If you have autoscale configured, and if it decides more instances are needed, autoscale also issues a request to App Service to add more instances. For more information, see [Scale up an app in Azure App Service](../app-service/manage-scale-up.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > [Autoscale behavior is independent of App Service platform behavior](/azure/azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-overview). Your autoscale instance count specification doesn't need to be a multiple of three.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > There's no guarantee that requests for more instances in a zone-down scenario succeed. The back filling of lost instances occurs on a best-effort basis. If you need guaranteed capacity when an availability zone is lost, you should create and configure your App Service plans to account for losing a zone. You can do that by [overprovisioning the capacity of your App Service plan](#capacity-planning-and-management).

- **Nonruntime behaviors:** Applications that are deployed in a zone-redundant App Service plan continue to run and serve traffic even if an availability zone experiences an outage. However, nonruntime behaviors might be affected during an availability zone outage. These behaviors include App Service plan scaling, application creation, application configuration, and application publishing.

### Failback

When the availability zone recovers, Azure App Service automatically creates instances in the recovered availability zone, removes any temporary instances created in the other availability zones, and routes traffic between your instances as normal.

### Testing for zone failures

Azure App Service platform manages traffic routing, failover, and failback for zone-redundant App Service plans. Because this feature is fully managed, you don't need to initiate or validate availability zone failure processes.

::: zone-end

## Multi-region support

Azure App Service is a single-region service. If the region becomes unavailable, your application is also unavailable.

### Alternative multi-region solutions

To ensure that your application becomes less susceptible to a single-region failure, you need to deploy your application to multiple regions:

- Deploy your application to the instances in each region.
- Configure load balancing and failover policies.
- Replicate your data across the regions so that you can recover your last application state.

::: zone pivot="free-shared-basic,premium"

For example architectures that illustrates this approach, see:

- [Reference architecture: Highly available multi-region web application](/azure/architecture/web-apps/app-service/architectures/multi-region).
- [Multi-region App Service apps for disaster recovery](/azure/architecture/web-apps/guides/multi-region-app-service/multi-region-app-service)

To follow along with a tutorial that creates a multi-region app, see [Tutorial: Create a highly available multi-region app in Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/tutorial-multi-region-app).

::: zone pivot="isolated"

For an example approach that illustrates this architecture, see [High availability enterprise deployment using App Service Environment](/azure/architecture/web-apps/app-service-environment/architectures/ase-high-availability-deployment).

::: zone-end

## Backups

When you use Basic tier or higher, you can back up your App Service app to a file by using the App Service backup and restore capabilities. For more information, see [Back up and restore your app in Azure App Service](../app-service/manage-backup.md).

This feature is useful if it's hard to redeploy your code, or if you store state on disk. For most solutions, you shouldn't rely on App Service backups. Use the other methods described in this article to support your resiliency requirements.

## Reliability during service maintenance

Azure App Service performs regular service upgrades, as well as other forms of maintenance. To ensure that your expected capacity is available during an upgrade, the platform automatically adds extra instances of the App Service plan during the upgrade process.

**Enable zone redundancy.** When you enable zone redundancy on your App Service plan, you also improve your resiliency to updates that the App Service platform rolls out. *Update domains* consist of collections of virtual machines (VMs) that are taken offline at the time of an update. Update domains are tied to availability zones. Deploying multiple instances in your App Service plan and enabling zone redundancy for your plan adds an extra layer of resiliency during upgrades if an instance or zone becomes unhealthy.

::: zone pivot="free-shared-basic,premium"

To learn more, see [Routine planned maintenance for Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/routine-maintenance).

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="isolated"

**Customize the upgrade cycle.** You to customize the upgrade cycle for an App Service Environment. If you need to validate the effect of upgrades on your workload, consider enabling manual upgrades so you can perform validation and testing on a nonproduction instance before the change rolls out to your production instance.

To learn more about maintenance preferences, see [Upgrade preference for App Service Environment planned maintenance](/azure/app-service/environment/how-to-upgrade-preference).

::: zone-end

## Service-level agreement (SLA)

The service-level agreement (SLA) for Azure App Service describes the expected availability of the service. It also describes the conditions that must be met to achieve that availability expectation. To understand those conditions, review the [Service Level Agreements (SLA) for Online Services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services).

When you deploy a zone-redundant App Service plan, the uptime percentage defined in the SLA increases.
