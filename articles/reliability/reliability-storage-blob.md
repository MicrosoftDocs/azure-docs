# Reliability in Azure Blob Storage

Azure Blob Storage is an object storage solution for the cloud from Microsoft. It's designed to store massive amounts of unstructured data such as text, binary data, documents, media files, and application backups. As a foundational Azure storage service, Blob Storage provides multiple reliability features to ensure that your data remains available and durable during both planned and unplanned events.

Blob Storage supports built-in redundancy mechanisms that store multiple copies of your data across different fault domains. It provides comprehensive redundancy options that include availability zone deployment with zone-redundant storage (ZRS), multi-region protection through geo-redundant configurations, and sophisticated failover capabilities.

This article describes reliability support in [Blob Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview), covering intra-regional resiliency via [availability zones](#availability-zone-support) and [multi-region deployments](#multi-region-support).

> [!NOTE]
> Blob Storage is part of the Azure Storage platform. Some of the capabilities of Blob Storage are common across many Azure Storage services. In this article, we use *Azure Storage* to refer to these features.

## Production deployment recommendations

To learn about how to deploy Blob Storage to support your solution's reliability requirements, and how reliability affects other aspects of your architecture, see [Architecture best practices for Blob Storage](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-blob-storage) in the Azure Well-Architected Framework.

## Reliability architecture overview

Azure Storage provides several redundancy options to help you protect your data against different types of failures. Each option provides a specific level of data redundancy, so you can choose the level that best matches your application's requirements.

[!INCLUDE [Storage - Reliability architecture overview](includes/storage/reliability-storage-architecture-include.md)]

## Transient faults

[!INCLUDE [Transient fault description](includes/reliability-transient-fault-description-include.md)]

To effectively manage transient faults when you use Blob Storage, implement the following recommendations:

- **Use the Azure Storage client libraries**, which include built-in retry policies with exponential backoff and jitter. The .NET, Java, Python, and JavaScript SDKs automatically handle retries for transient failures. For more information about retry configuration options, see [Implement a retry policy with .NET](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-retry-policy).

- **Configure appropriate timeout values** for your blob operations based on blob size and network conditions. Larger blobs require longer timeouts, but smaller operations can use shorter values to detect failures quickly.

## Availability zone support

[!INCLUDE [AZ support description](includes/reliability-availability-zone-description-include.md)]

Blob Storage provides robust availability zone support through ZRS configurations that automatically distribute your data across multiple availability zones within a region. Unlike locally redundant storage (LRS), ZRS guarantees that Azure synchronously replicates your blob data across multiple availability zones. ZRS ensures that your data remains accessible even if one zone experiences an outage.

Zone redundancy is enabled at the storage account level and applies to all blob containers within that account. You can't set different redundancy levels for individual containers. The redundancy configuration is applied to the entire storage account. When an availability zone experiences an outage, Azure Storage automatically routes requests to healthy zones without requiring intervention from you or your application.

[!INCLUDE [Storage - Availability zone support](includes/storage/reliability-storage-availability-zone-support-include.md)]

### Region support

[!INCLUDE [Storage - Availability zone region support](includes/storage/reliability-storage-availability-zone-region-support-include.md)]

### Requirements

Zone redundancy is available for both Standard general-purpose v2 and Premium Block Blob storage account types. Block blobs, append blobs, and page blobs all support zone-redundant configurations, but the type of storage account that you use determines which capabilities are available. For more information, see [Supported storage account types](/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy#supported-storage-account-types).

### Cost

[!INCLUDE [Storage - Availability zone cost](includes/storage/reliability-storage-availability-zone-cost-include.md)]

For more information, see [Blob Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/).

### Configure availability zone support

- **Create a blob storage account with zone redundancy.** To create a new storage account with ZRS, see [Create a storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create) and select **ZRS**, **geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)**, or **read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GZRS)** as the redundancy option during account creation.

[!INCLUDE [Storage - Configure availability zone support](includes/storage/reliability-storage-availability-zone-configure-include.md)]

### Normal operations

This section describes what to expect when a blob storage account is configured for zone redundancy and all availability zones are operational.

[!INCLUDE [Storage - Normal operations](includes/storage/reliability-storage-availability-zone-normal-operations-include.md)]

### Zone-down experience

This section describes what to expect when a blob storage account is configured for ZRS and there's an availability zone outage.

[!INCLUDE [Storage - Zone down experience](includes/storage/reliability-storage-availability-zone-down-experience-include.md)]

- **Traffic rerouting:** If an availability zone goes offline, Azure initiates networking changes like Domain Name System (DNS) repointing. These updates ensure that traffic is rerouted to the remaining healthy availability zones. The service maintains full functionality by using the surviving zones and doesn't require customer intervention.

[!INCLUDE [Storage - Alternative multi-region approaches - approach overview](includes/storage/reliability-storage-multi-region-alternative-approach-include.md)]

**Object replication** provides an extra option for cross-region data replication that provides asynchronous copying of block blobs between storage accounts. Unlike the built-in geo-redundant storage options that use fixed paired regions, object replication allows you to replicate data between storage accounts in any Azure region, including nonpaired regions. This approach gives you full control over source and destination regions, replication policies, and the specific containers and blob prefixes to replicate.

You can configure object replication to replicate all blobs within a container or specific subsets based on blob prefixes and tags. The replication is asynchronous and occurs in the background. You can configure multiple replication policies and even chain replication across multiple storage accounts to create sophisticated multi-region topologies.

Object replication isn't compatible with all storage accounts. For example, it doesn't work with storage accounts that use hierarchical namespaces (also known as *Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 accounts*).

For more information, see [Object replication for block blobs](/azure/storage/blobs/object-replication-overview) and [Configure object replication](/azure/storage/blobs/object-replication-configure).

## Backups

Blob Storage provides multiple data protection mechanisms that complement redundancy for comprehensive backup strategies. The service's built-in redundancy protects against infrastructure failures, and extra backup capabilities protect against accidental deletion, corruption, and malicious activities.

**Point-in-time restore (PITR)** allows you to restore block blob data to a previous state within a configured retention period of up to 365 days. Microsoft fully manages this feature. It also provides granular recovery capabilities at the container or blob level. PITR data is stored in the same region as the source account and is accessible even during regional outages if you use geo-redundant configurations.

**Blob versioning** automatically maintains previous versions of blobs when they're modified or deleted. Each version is stored as a separate object and can be accessed independently. Versions are stored in the same region as the current blob and follow the same redundancy configuration as the storage account.

**Soft delete** provides a safety net for accidentally deleted blobs and containers by retaining deleted data for a configurable period. Soft-deleted data remains in the same storage account and region, which makes it immediately available for recovery. For geo-redundant accounts, soft-deleted data is also replicated to the secondary region.

**Blob snapshots** create read-only, point-in-time copies of blobs that you can use for backup and recovery scenarios. Snapshots are stored in the same storage account and follow the same redundancy and geo-replication settings as the base blob.

For cross-region backup requirements, consider using **Azure Backup for blobs**, which provides centralized backup management and can store backup data in regions different from the source data. This service provides operational and vaulted backup options that have configurable retention policies and restore capabilities. For more information, see [Backup for blobs overview](/azure/backup/blob-backup-overview).

For most solutions, you shouldn't rely exclusively on backups. Instead, use the other capabilities described in this guide to support your resiliency requirements. However, backups protect against some risks that other approaches don't. For more information, see [Redundancy, replication, and backup](concept-redundancy-replication-backup.md).
