# Reliability in Azure NetApp Files

This article describes reliability support in Azure NetApp Files, covering intra-regional resiliency via [availability zones](#availability-zone-support) and [multi-region deployments](#multi-region-support).

[!INCLUDE [Shared responsibility description](includes/reliability-shared-responsibility-include.md)]

Azure NetApp Files is a native, enterprise-grade file storage solution that's integrated seamlessly within Azure, enabling file sharing across clients via SMB and NFS protocols. Designed for high performance, Azure NetApp Files offers scalable and secure file storage that's managed as a service.

To use Azure NetApp Files, you must configure a NetApp account which contains *capacity pools* that in turn host *volumes*. You can configure capacity and throughput independently, and manage data protection options tailored to various needs. You can enable replication between volumes, even if they're in different locations.

## Production deployment recommendations

To learn about how to deploy Azure NetApp Files to support your solution's reliability requirements, and how reliability affects other aspects of your architecture, see [Architecture best practices for Azure NetApp Files in the Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-netapp-files).

## Transient faults

[!INCLUDE [Transient fault description](includes/reliability-transient-fault-description-include.md)]

In addition to transient fault types that can affect any cloud-based solution, Azure NetApp Files can also be affected by occasional planned maintenance, such as platform updates, service updates, and software upgrades.

From a file protocol (e.g. NFS and SMB) perspective, transient faults aren't disruptive if the application can handle the I/O pauses that might briefly occur during these events. The I/O pauses are typically short, ranging from a few seconds up to 30 seconds.  Some applications might require tuning to handle the I/O pauses.

The NFS protocol is especially robust, and client-server file operations generally continue normally. Some applications might require tuning to handle I/O pauses for as long as 30-45 seconds. Ensure that you're aware of the application’s resiliency settings to cope with the storage service maintenance events.

For human-interactive applications leveraging the SMB protocol, the standard protocol settings are usually sufficient. Azure NetApp Files also supports [SMB continuous availability](../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-create-volumes-smb.md#continuous-availability), which enables SMB Transparent Failover. SMB Transparent Failover eliminates disruptions caused by service maintenance events. It also improves reliability and user experience.

SMB continuous availability is only available for [specific applications](../azure-netapp-files/faq-application-resilience.md#do-i-need-to-take-special-precautions-for-smb-based-applications).

For further recommendations, see [Azure NetApp Files application resilience FAQs](../azure-netapp-files/faq-application-resilience.md).

## Availability zone support

[!INCLUDE [AZ support description](includes/reliability-availability-zone-description-include.md)]

Azure NetApp Files supports *zonal* deployments of volumes. [Azure NetApp Files' availability zone volume placement feature](../azure-netapp-files/replication.md#availability-zones) lets you deploy each volume in a single availability zone of your choice, as long as Azure NetApp Files is present in that availability zone and has sufficient capacity. If you have latency-sensitive applications, you can deploy a volume to the same availability zone as your Azure compute resources and other services in the same zone.

In the diagram below, all virtual machines (VMs) within the region in (peered) VNets can access all Azure NetApp Files resources (blue arrows). VMs accessing Azure NetApp Files volumes in the same zone (green arrows) share the availability zone failure domain. Note there's no replication between the different volumes at the platform level.

:::image type="content" source="./media/reliability-netapp-files/availability-zone-diagram.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows NetApp Files availability zone volume placement." border="false" lightbox="./media/reliability-netapp-files/availability-zone-diagram.png":::

A single-zone deployment isn't sufficient to meet high reliability requirements. To asynchronously replicate data between volumes in different availability zones, you can use [cross-zone replication](../azure-netapp-files/cross-zone-replication-introduction.md). You must configure cross-zone replication separately from availability zone volume placement.

If an availability zone fails, you're responsible for detecting the failure and switching to an alternative volume in a different zone.

### Region support

Cross-zone replication is available in all [availability zone-enabled regions](availability-zones-region-support.md) with [Azure NetApp Files presence](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=netapp&regions=all&rar=true).

### Considerations

- Availability zone volume placement in Azure NetApp Files provides zonal volume placement. You'll see low latency when connecting to virtual machines within the same availability zone. However, it doesn't provide proximity placement with virtual machines or other resources, and the volume might be in a different physical part of the datacenter. 

- Replication is permitted between different Azure subscriptions as long as they are within the same Microsoft Entra tenant.

- For other considerations related to availability zones in Azure NetApp Files, see [Requirements and considerations for using cross-zone replication](../azure-netapp-files/cross-zone-replication-requirements-considerations.md) and [Manage availability zone volume placement](../azure-netapp-files/manage-availability-zone-volume-placement.md#requirements-and-considerations).

### Cost

There's no extra charge to enable availability zone volume placement in Azure NetApp Files. You only pay for the capacity pools and resources you deploy within these zones.

Replicated volumes are hosted on a [capacity pool](../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-understand-storage-hierarchy.md#capacity_pools). As such, the cost for cross-zone replication is based on the provisioned capacity pool size and tier as normal. There's no additional cost for data replication.

### Configure availability zone support

You need to separately configure volume placement and cross-zone replication.

- **Volume placement:**

    - **Create a new volume or configure an existing volume with availability zone support.**  To configure availability zones for volumes in Azure NetApp Files, see [Manage availability zone volume placement for Azure NetApp Files](../azure-netapp-files/manage-availability-zone-volume-placement.md).

        If you're deploying Terraform-managed volumes with availability zones, other configurations are required. For more information, see [Populate availability zone for Terraform-managed volumes](../azure-netapp-files/manage-availability-zone-volume-placement.md#populate-availability-zone-for-terraform-managed-volumes).

        If you're using role-based access control, [ensure you configure the correct permissions](../azure-netapp-files/manage-availability-zone-volume-placement.md#configure-custom-rbac-roles).

    - **Migrate a volume between availability zones:** After a volume is configured to be placed into an availability zone, the specified availability zone can’t be modified. Volumes can't be moved between availability zones.

    - **Disable availability zone support for a volume.** After a volume is configured to be placed into an availability zone, you can't disable the availability zone support.

- **Cross-zone replication:**

    - **Enable cross-zone replication:** To improve the resiliency of your solution, [configure cross-zone replication to another volume](../azure-netapp-files/create-cross-zone-replication.md).

    - **Disable cross-zone replication:** You can disable cross-zone replication by breaking the replication pairing. To learn more, see [Manage disaster recovery using Azure NetApp Files](../azure-netapp-files/cross-region-replication-manage-disaster-recovery.md#fail-over-to-destination-volume). 

### Normal operations

This section describes what to expect when Azure NetApp Files volumes are configured to be deployed into multiple availability zones, cross-zone replication is enabled, and all availability zones are operational.

- **Traffic routing between zones:** Incoming requests are routed to the specific volume, which is located in the availability zone you selected.

- **Data replication between zones:** Azure NetApp Files cross-zone replication means that all changes to the source volume are asynchronously replicated to destination volumes. You can decide how frequently the replication should happen. Cross-zone replication supports three replication schedules: 10 minutes, hourly, and daily.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The 10-minute replication schedule isn't supported for [large volumes](../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-understand-storage-hierarchy.md#large-volumes) using cross-zone replication.

### Zone-down experience

This section describes what to expect when Azure NetApp Files volumes are configured to be deployed into multiple availability zones, cross-zone replication is enabled, and there's an availability zone outage.

- **Detection and response:** You're responsible for detecting the loss of an availability zone and initiating a failover.

    To monitor the health of your Azure NetApp Files volume, you can use Azure Monitor metrics. Any anomalies indicating a zone-down scenario are detected via real-time metrics such as IOPS, latency, and capacity usage. Alerts and notifications can be configured to be sent to administrators, enabling immediate response actions such as rebalancing file shares or initiating failover or other disaster recovery protocols.

    Failover is a manual process. When you need to activate the destination volume, such as when you want to fail over to the destination availability zone, you need to break the replication peering and then mount the destination volume. For more information, see [fail over to the destination volume](../azure-netapp-files/cross-region-replication-manage-disaster-recovery.md#fail-over-to-destination-volume).

- **Active requests:** During a zone-down event, active requests can experience disruptions or increased latencies.

- **Expected data loss:** The amount of data loss (also called the recovery point objective, or RPO) you can expect during a zone failover depends on the cross-zone replication schedule you configure.

    | Replication schedule | Typical RPO |
    |---|---|
    | Every 10 minutes | 20 minutes|
    | Hourly | Two hours |
    | Daily | Less than 48 hours |

- **Expected downtime:** Failover to another zone requires that you break the peering relationship to activate the destination volume and provide read and write data access in the second site. After you trigger the peering to break, you can expect these to be completed within one minute.

    However, the total amount of downtime (also called the recovery time objective, or RTO) you can expect during a zone failover depends on multiple factors, including how long it takes for your systems or processes to detect the loss of the zone and to initiate failover processes. It's also important to decide whether to automate your response or if manual steps are required. For well-prepared configurations, the overall process typically requires between a few minutes and up to an hour.

- **Traffic rerouting:** You're responsible for redirecting your application traffic to connect to the newly active destination volume. For more information, see [fail over to the destination volume](../azure-netapp-files/cross-region-replication-manage-disaster-recovery.md#fail-over-to-destination-volume).

### Failback

Failback is a manual process that requires performing a resync operation, reestablishing the replication, and remounting the source volume for the client to access. For more information, see [Manage disaster recovery using Azure NetApp Files](../azure-netapp-files/cross-region-replication-manage-disaster-recovery.md).

### Testing for zone failures

You can test your cross-zone replication configuration safely by using snapshots of your volume. To learn about a high-level approach to test your cross-zone replication configuration, see [Test disaster recovery for Azure NetApp Files](../azure-netapp-files/test-disaster-recovery.md).

## Multi-region support

By default, Azure NetApp Files is a single-region service. If the region becomes unavailable, volumes stored in that region are also unavailable. To improve resiliency in the event of a regional outage, Azure NetApp Files supports cross-region replication. You can asynchronously replicate data from an Azure NetApp Files volume (source) in one region to another Azure NetApp Files volume (destination) in another region preselected by Microsoft. This capability enables you to fail over your critical application if a region-wide outage or disaster happens.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also replicate a single volume to another availability zone *and* to another region. To learn more, see [Understand cross-zone-region replication in Azure NetApp Files](../azure-netapp-files/cross-zone-region-replication.md).

### Region support

The secondary region that you can replicate your volumes to depends on the primary region. For more information, see [supported region pairs](../azure-netapp-files/replication.md#supported-region-pairs). 

### Considerations

Replication is permitted between different Azure subscriptions as long as they are within the same Microsoft Entra tenant.

For other considerations related to cross-region replication in Azure NetApp Files, see [Requirements and considerations for using cross-region replication](../azure-netapp-files/replication-requirements.md).

### Cost

Cross-region replication is charged based on the amount of data you replicate. For more details and some example scenarios, see [Cost model for cross-region replication](../azure-netapp-files/replication.md#cost-model-for-cross-region-replication).

### Configure multi-region support

- **Enable cross-region replication:** To improve the resiliency of your solution, [configure cross-region replication](../azure-netapp-files/cross-region-replication-create-peering.md).

- **Disable cross-region replication:** You can disable cross-region replication by breaking the replication pairing. To learn more, see [Manage disaster recovery using Azure NetApp Files](../azure-netapp-files/cross-region-replication-manage-disaster-recovery.md#fail-over-to-destination-volume).

### Normal operations

This section describes what to expect when Azure NetApp Files volumes are configured to use cross-region replication is enabled, and both regions are operational.

- **Traffic routing between regions:** Incoming requests are routed to the specific volume, which is located in the primary region.

- **Data replication between regions:** Azure NetApp Files cross-region replication means that all changes to the source volume are asynchronously replicated to destination volumes. You can decide how frequently the replication should happen. Cross-region replication supports three replication schedules: 10 minutes, hourly, and daily.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The 10-minute replication schedule isn't supported for [large volumes](../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-understand-storage-hierarchy.md#large-volumes) using cross-region replication.

- **Monitor replication health:** You can monitor the health of the peering relationship, and you can configure alerts to notify you if the replication lag increases beyond your expected threshold. To learn more, see [Display health and monitor status of replication relationship](../azure-netapp-files/cross-region-replication-display-health-status.md).

### Region-down experience

This section describes what to expect when Azure NetApp Files volumes are configured to use cross-region replication is enabled, and there's an outage of the primary region.

- **Detection and response:** You're responsible for detecting the loss of a region and initiating a failover.

    To monitor the health of your Azure NetApp Files volume, you can use Azure Monitor metrics. Any anomalies indicating a region-down scenario are detected via real-time metrics such as IOPS, latency, and capacity usage. Alerts and notifications can be configured to be sent to administrators, which enables immediate response actions such as rebalancing file shares or initiating failover or other disaster recovery protocols.

    Failover is a manual process.

## Backups

[Azure NetApp Files backup](../azure-netapp-files/backup-introduction.md) expands the data protection capabilities of Azure NetApp Files by providing a fully managed backup solution for long-term recovery, archive, and compliance. Backups created by the service are stored in Azure storage, independent of volume snapshots that are available for near-term recovery or cloning. Backups taken by the service can be restored to new Azure NetApp Files volumes within the region. Azure NetApp Files backup supports both policy-based (scheduled) backups and manual (on-demand) backups.

For further security, Azure NetApp Files [snapshots](../azure-netapp-files/data-protection-disaster-recovery-options.md#snapshots) add stability, scalability, and fast recoverability without affecting performance. They provide the foundation for other redundancy solutions, including backup, cross-region replication, and cross-zone replication.

For most solutions, you shouldn't rely exclusively on backups. Instead, use the other capabilities described in this guide to support your resiliency requirements. However, backups protect against some risks that other approaches don't. For more information, see [What are redundancy, replication, and backup?](concept-redundancy-replication-backup.md).

## Service-level agreement

The service-level agreement (SLA) for Azure NetApp Files describes the expected availability of the service, and the conditions that must be met to achieve that availability expectation. For more information, see [Service Level Agreements (SLA) for Online Services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services).
