# Reliability in Azure IoT Hub

This article describes reliability support in Azure IoT Hub. It covers intra-regional resiliency via [availability zones](#availability-zone-support) and [multi-region deployments](#multi-region-support).

[!INCLUDE [Shared responsibility description](includes/reliability-shared-responsibility-include.md)]

When you evaluate reliability options, you also need to evaluate the trade-offs between the following items:

- Level of resiliency that you require
- Implementation and maintenance complexity
- Cost of implementing different options

For more information, see [Reliability trade-offs](/azure/well-architected/reliability/tradeoffs).

## Transient faults

[!INCLUDE [Transient fault description](includes/reliability-transient-fault-description-include.md)]

IoT Hub provides a reasonably high uptime guarantee, but transient failures can occur in any distributed computing platform. To handle transient failures, build the appropriate [retry patterns](../iot/concepts-manage-device-reconnections.md#retry-patterns) in components that interact with cloud applications.

## Availability zone support

[!INCLUDE [AZ support description](includes/reliability-availability-zone-description-include.md)]

IoT Hub supports two distinct types of availability zone support:

- *Zone redundancy for data*, which automatically replicates data between multiple availability zones for the underlying storage components that store the device identity registry and device-to-cloud messages.

- *Zone redundancy for compute*, which provides resiliency in the components that are responsible for managing the devices and routing messages.

### Region support

The type of availability zone support for your IoT hub depends on the region that it's deployed in.

IoT hubs that you create in regions that aren't on this list aren't resilient to zone outages.

### Cost

There's no extra cost for zone redundancy with IoT Hub.

### Configure availability zone support

IoT Hub resources automatically support zone redundancy when deployed in [supported regions](#region-support). No further configuration is required.

### Normal operations

This section describes what to expect when IoT Hub resources are configured for zone redundancy and all availability zones are operational.

- **Data replication between zones:** When your IoT hub is deployed in a region that supports zone redundancy for data, changes in data are replicated between availability zones automatically. Replication occurs synchronously.

- **Traffic routing between zones:** When your IoT hub is deployed in a region that supports zone redundancy for compute components, requests are routed to a primary instance of the service in one of the availability zones. Azure selects the active instance and zone automatically.

### Zone-down experience

This section describes what to expect when IoT Hub resources are configured for zone redundancy and there's an availability zone outage.

- **Detection and response:** The IoT Hub service is responsible for detecting a failure in an availability zone. You don't need to do anything to initiate a zone failover.

+ **Notification**: Azure IoT Hub doesn't notify you when a zone is down. However, you can use [Azure Resource Health](/azure/service-health/resource-health-overview) to monitor for the health of your IoT hub. You can also use [Azure Service Health](/azure/service-health/overview) to understand the overall health of the Azure Iot Hub service, including any zone failures.

  Set up alerts on these services to receive notifications of zone-level problems. For more information, see [Create Service Health alerts in the Azure portal](/azure/service-health/alerts-activity-log-service-notifications-portal) and [Create and configure Resource Health alerts](/azure/service-health/resource-health-alert-arm-template-guide).

- **Active requests:** During a zone failure, active requests might be dropped. Your clients and devices should have sufficient [retry logic](../iot/concepts-manage-device-reconnections.md#retry-patterns) implemented to handle transient faults.

- **Expected data loss:** When your IoT hub is deployed in a region that supports zone redundancy for data, a zone failure shouldn't cause any data loss.

- **Expected downtime:** When your IoT hub is deployed in a region that supports zone redundancy for both compute and data components, a zone failure shouldn't cause downtime to your IoT Hub resources.

- **Traffic rerouting:** When your IoT hub is deployed in a region that supports zone redundancy for compute components, IoT Hub detects the loss of the zone. Then, any new requests are automatically redirected to a new primary instance of the service in one of the healthy availability zones.

### Zone recovery

When the availability zone recovers, IoT Hub automatically restores instances in the availability zone and reroutes traffic between your instances as normal.

### Testing for zone failures

Because IoT Hub fully manages traffic routing, failover, and failback for zone failures, you don't need to validate availability zone failure processes or provide any further input.

## Multi-region support

IoT Hub is a single-region service. If the region becomes unavailable, your IoT Hub resources are also unavailable.

However, if your resources are in a [region that's paired](./regions-paired.md), your IoT hub's data is replicated to the paired region.

Your IoT hub might fail over to the paired region in the following scenarios:

- *Customer-initiated failover:* You can trigger manual failover to the paired region yourself, whether the region is experiencing downtime or not. You can use this approach to perform planned failovers and drills.

- *Microsoft-initiated failover:* If a region is lost, Microsoft can initiate a failover of IoT hubs to the paired region. However, Microsoft is unlikely to initiate failover except after a significant delay and on a best-effort basis. Failover of IoT Hub resources might occur at a different time than failover of other Azure services. This process is a default option and requires no intervention from you.

If resources are in a *nonpaired region*, Microsoft doesn’t replicate configuration and data across regions, and there’s no built-in cross-region failover. However, you can deploy separate resources into multiple regions. In this scenario, it's your responsibility to manage replication, traffic distribution, and failover.

If your IoT hub is in a nonpaired region, or if the default replication and failover behavior doesn't meet your needs, you can use [alternative multi-region approaches](#alternative-multi-region-approaches) to plan for and initiate failovers.

### Region support

Default replication and failover is only supported in regions that are paired.

### Requirements

Paired region replication and failover options are available for all IoT Hub tiers.

### Considerations

Don't use customer-initiated failover to permanently migrate your hub between the Azure paired regions. Generally, devices are located close to the hub's primary region. If you move your hub to the secondary region, latency increases for operations between the devices and the IoT hub in the secondary location.

### Cost

For hubs in regions that are paired, there's no extra cost for cross-region data replication or failover.

If your IoT hub is in a nonpaired region, see [alternative multi-region approaches](#alternative-multi-region-approaches) for possible cost information.

### Configure replication and prepare for failover

By default, cross-region data replication is automatically configured when you create an IoT hub in a paired region. This process is a default option and requires no intervention from you. In regions except for Brazil South and Southeast Asia (Singapore), your customer data isn't stored or processed outside of the geography where you deploy the service instance.

If your IoT hub is in the Brazil South or Southeast Asia (Singapore) regions, you can disable data replication and opt out of failover. For more information, see [Disable disaster recovery (DR)](../iot-hub/how-to-disable-dr.md).

If your IoT hub is in a nonpaired region, you need to plan your own cross-region replication and failover approach. For more information, see [Alternative multi-region approaches](#alternative-multi-region-approaches).

### Normal operations

This section describes what to expect when an IoT hub is configured for cross-region replication and failover, and the primary region is operational.

- **Data replication between regions:** Data is replicated automatically to the paired region. Replication occurs asynchronously, which means that some data loss is expected if a failover occurs. There's no data replication between regions for IoT hubs in nonpaired regions.

- **Traffic routing between regions:** In normal operations, traffic only flows to the primary region.

### Region-down experience

This section describes what to expect when an IoT hub is configured for cross-region replication and failover and there's an outage in the primary region.

- **Detection and response:** Responsibility for detecting and responding to an outage in the primary region can vary.

  - *Customer-initiated failover:* You're responsible for detecting a region loss and deciding when to fail over. For more information about how to perform customer-initiated failover between paired regions, see [Perform manual failover for an IoT hub](../iot-hub/tutorial-manual-failover.md).

    There are limits on how frequently you can perform customer-initiated failover or failback:

    - Users are allowed to perform two successful failover operations and two successful failback operations per day.

    - Back-to-back failover or failback operations aren't allowed. You must wait for one hour between these operations.

  - *Microsoft-initiated failover:* Microsoft can decide to perform a failover if the primary region is lost. This process can take several hours after the loss of the primary region, or even longer in some scenarios. Failover of IoT Hub resources might not occur at the same time as other Azure services.

- **Active requests:** Any requests that the primary region is processing during a failover are likely to be lost. Clients should retry requests after failover completes.

- **Expected data loss:** For regions that are paired, data is replicated asynchronously to the paired region. As a result, some data loss is expected after failover. This process applies to both Microsoft-managed and customer-managed failovers. The following table outlines the *recovery point objective (RPO)*, or expected data loss, of each type of data that IoT hubs store.

  | Data type | RPO |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | Identity registry | 0-5 minutes data loss |
  | Device twin data | 0-5 minutes data loss |
  | Cloud-to-device messages <sup>1</sup> | 0-5 minutes data loss |
  | Parent <sup>1</sup> and device jobs | 0-5 minutes data loss |
  | Device-to-cloud messages | All unread messages are lost |
  | Cloud-to-device feedback messages | All unread messages are lost |

  <sup>1</sup> Cloud-to-device messages and parent jobs aren't recovered as part of a customer-initiated failover.

- **Expected downtime:** The expected downtime during region failover depends on the failover type.

  - *Customer-initiated failover:* Expect approximately 10 minutes to 2 hours of downtime from when the region is lost to when the resource is operational in the paired region. The number of devices registered against the IoT hub instance being failed over affects the recovery time. You can expect the recovery time for a hub that hosts approximately 100,000 devices to be around 15 minutes.

  - *Microsoft-initiated failover:* Expect approximately 2 to 26 hours of downtime from when the region is lost to when the resource is available in the paired region.

    The high amount of recovery time is because Microsoft must perform the failover operation on behalf of all the affected customers in that region. For critical systems, you should use customer-initiated failover to achieve less downtime. However, if you run a less-critical IoT solution that can sustain a downtime of roughly one day, it might be possible to take a dependency on the Microsoft-initiated option to satisfy the overall DR goals for your IoT solution.

  - For both failover types, the fully qualified domain name of the IoT hub instance remains the same after failover, which means that the connection string also remains the same. However, because the underlying IP address changes, clients must wait for Domain Name System (DNS) records to update before accessing the IoT hub after failover.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The IoT Hub SDKs don't cache the IP address of the IoT hub. User code interfacing with the SDKs also shouldn't cache the IP address of the IoT hub.

    Because of these factors, the time for the runtime operations being performed against your IoT hub instance to become fully operational after the failover process can be expressed by using the following function:

    > Time to recover = RTO [10 minutes to 2 hours for customer-initiated failover or 2 to 26 hours for Microsoft-initiated failover] + DNS propagation delay + Time that the client application takes to refresh any cached IoT hub IP address

- **Traffic rerouting:** During the failover process, IoT Hub updates DNS records to point to the paired region. All subsequent requests are sent to the paired region.

  After the failover operation for the IoT hub completes, all operations from the device and back-end applications are expected to continue working without requiring manual intervention. This continuity ensures that your device-to-cloud messages continue to work, and the entire device registry is intact. If you emit events through Azure Event Grid, they can be consumed via the same subscriptions that you configured earlier as long as those Event Grid subscriptions continue to be available. No further handling is required for custom endpoints.

### Post-failover configuration required

Depending on where you route your IoT hub's messages, you might need to perform extra steps after failover completes.

- **Azure Event Hubs:** The Event Hubs-compatible name and endpoint of your IoT hub's built-in events endpoint change after failover. This change occurs because the Event Hubs client doesn't have visibility into IoT Hub events.

  When you receive telemetry messages from the built-in endpoint by using either the Event Hubs client or event processor host, [use the IoT hub's connection string](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-read-builtin.md#connect-to-the-built-in-endpoint) to establish the connection. This approach ensures that your back-end applications continue to work without requiring manual intervention after failover.

  If you use the Event Hubs-compatible name and endpoint in your application directly, you need to [fetch the new Event Hubs-compatible endpoint](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-read-builtin.md#connect-to-the-built-in-endpoint) after failover to continue operations. To retrieve the endpoint and name, you can use the Azure portal or the .NET SDK:

  - *The Azure portal:* For more information about how to use the portal to retrieve the Event Hubs-compatible endpoint and the Event Hubs-compatible name, see [Connect to the built-in endpoint](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-read-builtin.md#connect-to-the-built-in-endpoint).

  - *The .NET SDK:* To use the IoT hub connection string to recapture the Event Hubs-compatible endpoint, use the [sample code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/samples/iothub-connect-to-eventhubs). This code example uses the connection string to get the new Event Hubs endpoint and re-establish the connection. You must have Visual Studio installed.

- **Azure Functions and Azure Stream Analytics:** If you use Azure Functions or Stream Analytics to connect to the built-in events endpoint, you must update the Event Hubs endpoint that the function or job connects to, following the same process outlined in the preceding bullet point. Then perform a **Restart** action because any event stream offsets become invalid after failover.

- **Azure Storage:** When routing to Azure Storage, list the blobs or files first. Then iterate over them to ensure that all blobs or files are read without assuming partitioning. The partition range can potentially change during a Microsoft-initiated failover or customer-initiated failover. You can use the [List Blobs API](/rest/api/storageservices/list-blobs) to enumerate the list of blobs or the [List Azure Data Lake Storage API](/rest/api/storageservices/datalakestoragegen2/filesystem/list) for the list of files. For more information, see [Azure Storage as a routing endpoint](../iot-hub//iot-hub-devguide-endpoints.md#azure-storage-as-a-routing-endpoint).

### Region recovery

To fail back to the primary region, you can manually trigger the failover action a second time. It's important to remember the [restrictions on how frequently you can fail over](#region-down-experience).

If the original failover operation was performed to recover from an extended outage in the original primary region, perform failback to the primary region after the primary region recovers from the outage.

### Testing for region failures

To simulate a failure during a region outage, you can trigger a manual failover of your IoT hub. However, because regional failover causes both downtime and data loss, you should only perform test failovers in nonproduction environments. For more information, see [Region-down experience](#region-down-experience). Consider setting up a test IoT Hub instance to initiate the planned failover option periodically. Periodic testing can help you build confidence in your ability to restore and operate your end-to-end solutions effectively when a real disaster occurs.

### Alternative multi-region approaches

The cross-region failover capabilities of IoT Hub aren't suitable for the following scenarios:

- Your IoT hub is in a nonpaired region.

- Your business uptime goals aren't satisfied by the recovery time or data loss that either built-in failover option provides.

- You need to fail over to a region that isn't your primary region's pair.

You can design a cross-region failover solution tailored to each individual device. A complete treatment of deployment topologies in IoT solutions is outside the scope of this article, but you can consider a multi-region deployment model. In this model, your primary IoT hub and solution back end run primarily in one Azure region. A secondary IoT hub and back end are deployed in another Azure region. If the IoT hub in the primary region experiences an outage or the network connectivity from the device to the primary region is interrupted, devices use a secondary service endpoint.

- **Expected downtime:** This approach has less than one minute of downtime but can be complex to implement.

- **Expected data loss:** The amount of data loss depends on the specific data stores that you use and the way that you configure geo-replication between them.

- **Cost:** This approach requires you to provision at least one extra IoT hub, which increases your overall cost.

At a high level, to implement a regional failover model with IoT Hub, you need to take the following measures:

- **A secondary IoT hub and device routing logic:** If service in your primary region is disrupted, devices must begin to connect to your secondary region. Because of the state-aware nature of most services involved, solution administrators commonly trigger the inter-region failover process manually. The best way to communicate the new endpoint to devices while maintaining control over the process is to have them regularly check a concierge service for the current active endpoint. The concierge service can be a web application that's replicated and kept reachable by using DNS-redirection techniques, such as [Azure Traffic Manager](../traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  > Traffic Manager doesn't have built-in support for IoT Hub. You can configure custom Traffic Manager endpoints for each IoT hub. Configure the Traffic Manager endpoint's health probe to use the IoT hub's endpoint.

- **Identity registry replication:** To be usable, the secondary IoT hub must contain all device identities that can connect to the solution. The solution should keep geo-replicated backups of device identities and upload them to the secondary IoT hub before switching the active endpoint for the devices. The device identity export functionality of IoT Hub is useful in this context. For more information, see [Understand the identity registry in your IoT hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-identity-registry.md).

- **Merge logic:** When the primary region becomes available again, all the state and data created in the secondary region must be migrated back to the primary region. This state and data mostly relate to device identities and application metadata, which must be merged with the primary IoT hub and any other application-specific stores in the primary region.

  To simplify this step, use *idempotent* operations. Idempotent operations minimize the side effects from the eventual consistent distribution of events and from duplicates or out-of-order delivery of events. Also, the application logic should be designed to tolerate potential inconsistencies or slightly out-of-date state. This scenario can occur because of the extra time that it takes for the system to heal based on RPOs.

## Backups

For most solutions, you shouldn't rely exclusively on backups. Instead, use the other capabilities described in this guide to support your resiliency requirements. However, backups protect against some risks that other approaches don't. For more information, see [Redundancy, replication, and backup](./concept-redundancy-replication-backup.md).

The IoT Hub service enables bulk export operations, which allow you to export the entire identity registry of an IoT hub. This data is transferred to an Azure Storage blob container by using a shared access signature. This method enables you to create reliable backups of your device information in a blob container that you control. For more information, see [Import and export IoT Hub device identities in bulk](../iot-hub/iot-hub-bulk-identity-mgmt.md).

You can also export an existing IoT hub's Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) to create a backup of the IoT hub's configuration. For more information, see [Manually migrate an IoT hub by using an ARM template](../iot-hub/migrate-hub-arm.md).

## Service-level agreement

The service-level agreement (SLA) for IoT Hub describes the expected availability of the service and the conditions that must be met to achieve that availability expectation. To understand those conditions, it's important that you review the [SLAs for online services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services).
