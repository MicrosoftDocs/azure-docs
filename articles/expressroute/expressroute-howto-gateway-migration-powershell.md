# Migrate to an availability zone-enabled ExpressRoute virtual network gateway using PowerShell

When you create an ExpressRoute virtual network gateway, you need to choose the [gateway SKU](expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways.md#gateway-types). If you choose a higher-level SKU, more CPUs and network bandwidth are allocated to the gateway. As a result, the gateway can support higher network throughput and more dependable network connections to the virtual network. 

The following SKUs are available for ExpressRoute virtual network gateways:

* Standard
* HighPerformance
* UltraPerformance
* ErGw1Az
* ErGw2Az
* ErGw3Az
* ErGwScale (Preview)

## Prerequisites

- Review the [Gateway migration](gateway-migration.md) article before you begin.
- You must have an existing [ExpressRoute Virtual network gateway](expressroute-howto-add-gateway-portal-resource-manager.md) in your Azure subscription.

### Working with Azure PowerShell

## Migrate to a new gateway in using PowerShell

Here are the steps to migrate to a new gateway using PowerShell.

### Clone the script

1. Clone the setup script from GitHub.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-docs-powershell-samples/ 
   ```

1. Change to the directory where the script is located.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   CD azure-docs-powershell-samples/expressroute-gateway/
   ```
### Prepare the migration

This script creates a new ExpressRoute virtual network gateway on the same gateway subnet and connects it to your existing ExpressRoute circuits.

1. Identify the resource ID of the gateway that will be migrated. 

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $resourceId = Get-AzResource -Name {virtual network gateway name}
   $resourceId.Id
    ```
1. Run the **PrepareMigration.ps1** script to prepare the migration. 

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
   gateway-migration/preparemigration.ps1
    ```
1. Enter the resource ID of your gateway. 
1. Choose a name for your new resources, the new resource name will be added to the existing name. For example: existingresourcename_newname.
1. Enter an availability zone for your new gateway. 


### Run the migration

This script transfers the configuration from the old gateway to the new one.

1. Identify the resource ID of your new post-migration gateway. Use the resource name you given for this gateway in the previous step. 

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $resourceId = Get-AzResource -Name {virtual network gateway name}
   $resourceId.Id
    ```
1.  Run the **Migration.ps1** script to perform the migration. 

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    gateway-migration/migration.ps1
    ```
1. Enter the resource ID of your premigration gateway.
1. Enter the resource ID of your post-migration gateway.

### Commit the migration

This script deletes the old gateway and its connections.

1. Run the **CommitMigration.ps1** script to complete the migration. 

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
   gateway-migration/commitmigration.ps1
    ```
1. Enter the resource ID of the premigration gateway.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > - Before running this step, verify that the new virtual network gateway has a working ExpressRoute connection.
    > - When migrating your gateway, you can expect possible interruption for a maximum of 30 seconds.
