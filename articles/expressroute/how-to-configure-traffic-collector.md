# Configure Traffic Collector for ExpressRoute

This article helps you deploy an ExpressRoute Traffic Collector using the Azure portal. You learn how to add and remove an ExpressRoute Traffic Collector, associate it to an ExpressRoute circuit and Log Analytics workspace. Once the ExpressRoute Traffic Collector is deployed, sampled flow logs get imported into a Log Analytics workspace. For more information, see [About ExpressRoute Traffic Collector](traffic-collector.md).

## Prerequisites

- An ExpressRoute circuit with bandwidth 1 Gbps or greater and Private or Microsoft peering configured.

- A Log Analytics workspace (Create new or use existing workspace).
## Limitations

- ExpressRoute Traffic Collector supports a maximum ExpressRoute circuit size of 100 Gbps.

- You can associate up to 20 ExpressRoute circuits with ExpressRoute Traffic Collector. The total circuit bandwidth can't exceed 100 Gbps.

- The ExpressRoute circuit, Traffic Collector and the Log Analytics workspace must be in the same geo-political region. Cross geo-political resource association isn't supported.  

> [!NOTE]
> - Log Analytics and ExpressRoute Traffic Collector can be deployed in a different subscription.
> - When ExpressRoute Traffic Collector gets deployed in an Azure region that supports availability zones, it will have availability zone enabled by default.

## Permissions

- Minimum of **contributor** access is required to deploy ExpressRoute Traffic Collector.
- Minimum of **contributor** access is required to associate ExpressRoute circuit with ExpressRoute Traffic Collector.

- **Monitor contributor** role is required to associate Log Analytics workspace with ExpressRoute Traffic Collector.

- Minimum of **contributor** access is required in both subscriptions to associate an ExpressRoute Traffic Collector with an ExpressRoute circuit in a different subscription.

For more information, see [Identity and access management](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-ops-guide-iam.md).

## Deploy ExpressRoute Traffic Collector

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. In the portal, go to the ExpressRoute circuits page and select **ExpressRoute Traffic Collectors** from the top of the page. Select **+ Create new** from the drop-down menu.

1. On the **Create an ExpressRoute Traffic Collector** page, enter or select the following information then select **Next**.

   | Setting | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | Subscription | Select the subscription to create the ExpressRoute Traffic Collector resource. This resource needs to be in the same subscription as the ExpressRoute circuit. |
   | Resource group | Select the resource group to deploy this resource into. |
   | Name | Enter a name to identify this ExpressRoute Traffic Collector resource. |
   | Region | Select a region to deploy this resource into. This resource needs to be in the same geo-political region as the Log Analytics workspace and the ExpressRoute circuits. |
   | Collector Policy | This value is automatically filled in as **Default**. |
   
1. On the **Select ExpressRoute circuit** tab, select **+ Add ExpressRoute Circuits**. 

1. On the **Add Circuits** page, select the checkbox next to the circuit you would like Traffic Collector to monitor and then select **Add**. Select **Next** to configure where logs get forwarded to.

1. On the **Forward Logs** tab, select the checkbox for **Send to Log Analytics workspace**. You can create a new Log Analytics workspace or select an existing one. The workspace can be in a different Azure subscription but has to be in the same geo-political region. Select **Next** once a workspace has been chosen.

1. On the **Tags** tab, you can add optional tags for tracking purpose. Select **Next** to review your configuration.

1. Select **Create** once validation has passed to deploy your ExpressRoute Traffic Collector.

1. Once deployed you should start seeing sampled flow logs within the configure Log Analytics workspace.

## Clean up resources

To delete the ExpressRoute Traffic Collector resource, you first need to remove all ExpressRoute circuit associations. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you delete the ExpressRoute Traffic Collector resource before removing all circuit associations, you'll need to wait about 40 mins for the deletion to timeout before you can try again.
>

Once all circuits have been removed from the ExpressRoute Traffic Collector, select **Delete** from the overview page to remove the resource from your subscription.
