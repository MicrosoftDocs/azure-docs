# About ExpressRoute scalable gateway (preview)

The ExpressRoute scalable gateway (ErGwScale) is a new virtual network gateway SKU that provides flexible, high-bandwidth connectivity for your Azure virtual networks. With support for up to 40-Gbps bandwidth and autoscaling capabilities, ErGwScale helps you efficiently manage network performance and scale resources to meet your workload needs. This article explains the features, configuration options, limitations, and performance details of the ErGwScale gateway.

## Autoscaling vs. fixed scale unit

The virtual network gateway infrastructure autoscales between the minimum and maximum scale unit that you configure, based on the bandwidth or flow count utilization. Scale operations might take up to 30 minutes to complete. If you want to achieve a fixed connectivity at a specific bandwidth value, you can configure a fixed scale unit by setting the minimum scale unit and the maximum scale unit to the same value.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>The minimum scale unit must be 1, when the maximum scale unit is 1.


You can configure the gateway's scaling, as per requirements, by setting the minimum and maximum scale units:
- To configure a fixed-size gateway, set both the **minimum** and **maximum** scale units to the same value (for example, set both to **1**, set both to **20**, set both to **40**).
- To enable autoscaling, set the **minimum scale unit** to **2** or higher, and specify the desired **maximum scale unit** (up to 40).

This allows the gateway to automatically scale based on your workload requirements.

| Scenario              | Minimum Scale Unit | Maximum Scale Unit | Autoscaling Enabled? |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Fixed scaling         | 1                 | 1                 | No                  |
| Fixed scaling         | 20                | 20                | No                  |  
| Fixed scaling         | 40                | 40                | No                  |  
| Autoscaling           | 2 or higher       | Up to 40          | Yes                 |

## Upgrade and migration paths

You can move to the SKU ErGwScale using either an upgrade or migration process, depending on your current gateway SKU. 

**Upgrade options**
- If you have an existing gateway using the ErGw1Az, ErGw2Az, or ErGw3Az SKU, you can [upgrade](expressroute-howto-add-gateway-portal-resource-manager.md#upgrade-the-gateway-sku) directly to the Scalable Gateway SKU. No migration tool is required.
- Upgrades can be performed through the Azure portal or by using PowerShell.

This process may take up to 2 hours to complete. During this time, the gateway remains available and does not experience downtime.

**Migration options**
- If your gateway uses the Standard, High Performance, or Ultra Performance SKU, you must use the [migration Tool](gateway-migration.md) to move to ErGwScale.

## Limitations

* **IPsec over ExpressRoute**: ErGwScale currently doesn't support [IPsec traffic over ExpressRoute](expressroute-about-encryption.md). 
* **Basic IP**: ErGwScale doesn't support the Basic IP SKU. You need to use a Standard IP SKU to configure ErGwScale.
* **Minimum and maximum scale units**: The *minimum scale unit* can't be lower than 1 and the *maximum scale unit* can't be higher than 40.

### Supported performance per scale unit

| Scale unit | Bandwidth (Gbps) | Packets per second | Connections per second | Maximum VM connections <sup>1</sup> | Maximum number of flows |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1-10 | 1 | 100,000 | 7,000 | 2,000 | 100,000 |
| 11-40 | 1 | 200,000 | 7,000 | 1,000 | 100,000 |

### Sample performance with scale unit

| Scale unit | Bandwidth (Gbps) | Packets per second | Connections per second | Maximum VM connections <sup>1</sup> | Maximum number of flows |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| 10 | 10 | 1,000,000 | 70,000 | 20,000 | 1,000,000 |
| 20 | 20 | 2,000,000 | 140,000 | 30,000 | 2,000,000 |
| 40 | 40 | 8,000,000 | 280,000 | 50,000 | 4,000,000 |

<sup>1</sup> Maximum VM connections scale differently beyond 10 scale units. The first 10 scale units provide capacity for 2,000 VMs per scale unit. Scale units 11 and above provide 1,000 more VM capacity per scale unit.

## Region availability

ErGwScale is available in most regions except the following regions:

* Belgium Central
* Japan East
* Qatar Central
* Southeast Asia
* West Europe
* West India
* West US 2


## Pricing

| SKU                | Price per hour per scale unit |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| **ErGwScale**   | **$0.21**                    |
