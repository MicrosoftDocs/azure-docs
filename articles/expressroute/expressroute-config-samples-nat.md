# Router configuration samples to set up and manage NAT

This page provides NAT configuration samples for Cisco ASA and Juniper SRX series routers when working with ExpressRoute. These are intended to be samples for guidance only and must not be used as is. You can work with your vendor to come up with appropriate configurations for your network.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Samples in this page are intended to be purely for guidance. You must work with your vendor's sales / technical team and your networking team to come up with appropriate configurations to meet your needs. Microsoft will not support issues related to configurations listed in this page. You must contact your device vendor for support issues.
> 
> 

* Router configuration samples below apply to Azure Public and Microsoft peerings. You must not configure NAT for Azure private peering. Review [ExpressRoute peerings](expressroute-circuit-peerings.md) and [ExpressRoute NAT requirements](expressroute-nat.md) for more details.

* You MUST use separate NAT IP pools for connectivity to the internet and ExpressRoute. Using the same NAT IP pool across the internet and ExpressRoute will result in asymmetric routing and loss of connectivity.


## Cisco ASA firewalls
### PAT configuration for traffic from customer network to Microsoft
    object network MSFT-PAT
      range <SNAT-START-IP> <SNAT-END-IP>


    object-group network MSFT-Range
      network-object <IP> <Subnet_Mask>

    object-group network on-prem-range-1
      network-object <IP> <Subnet-Mask>

    object-group network on-prem-range-2
      network-object <IP> <Subnet-Mask>

    object-group network on-prem
      network-object object on-prem-range-1
      network-object object on-prem-range-2

    nat (outside,inside) source dynamic on-prem pat-pool MSFT-PAT destination static MSFT-Range MSFT-Range

### PAT configuration for traffic from Microsoft to customer network

**Interfaces and Direction:**

    Source Interface (where the traffic enters the ASA): inside
    Destination Interface (where the traffic exits the ASA): outside

**Configuration:**

NAT Pool:

    object network outbound-PAT
        host <NAT-IP>

Target Server:

    object network Customer-Network
        network-object <IP> <Subnet-Mask>

Object Group for Customer IP Addresses

    object-group network MSFT-Network-1
        network-object <MSFT-IP> <Subnet-Mask>

    object-group network MSFT-PAT-Networks
        network-object object MSFT-Network-1

NAT Commands:

    nat (inside,outside) source dynamic MSFT-PAT-Networks pat-pool outbound-PAT destination static Customer-Network Customer-Network


## Juniper SRX series routers
### 1. Create redundant Ethernet interfaces for the cluster
    interfaces {
        reth0 {
            description "To Internal Network";
            vlan-tagging;
            redundant-ether-options {
                redundancy-group 1;
            }
            unit 100 {
                vlan-id 100;
                family inet {
                    address <IP-Address/Subnet-mask>;
                }
            }
        }
        reth1 {
            description "To Microsoft via Edge Router";
            vlan-tagging;
            redundant-ether-options {
                redundancy-group 2;
            }
            unit 100 {
                description "To Microsoft via Edge Router";
                vlan-id 100;
                family inet {
                    address <IP-Address/Subnet-mask>;
                }
            }
        }
    }


### 2. Create two security zones
* Trust Zone for internal network and Untrust Zone for external network facing Edge Routers
* Assign appropriate interfaces to the zones
* Allow services on the interfaces

    security {
        zones {
            security-zone Trust {
                host-inbound-traffic {
                    system-services {
                        ping;
                    }
                    protocols {
                        bgp;
                    }
                }
                interfaces {
                    reth0.100;
                }
            }
            security-zone Untrust {
                host-inbound-traffic {
                    system-services {
                        ping;
                    }
                    protocols {
                        bgp;
                    }
                }
                interfaces {
                    reth1.100;
                }
            }
        }
    }


### 3. Create security policies between zones
    security {
        policies {
            from-zone Trust to-zone Untrust {
                policy allow-any {
                    match {
                        source-address any;
                        destination-address any;
                        application any;
                    }
                    then {
                        permit;
                    }
                }
            }
            from-zone Untrust to-zone Trust {
                policy allow-any {
                    match {
                        source-address any;
                        destination-address any;
                        application any;
                    }
                    then {
                        permit;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }


### 4. Configure NAT policies
* Create two NAT pools. One will be used to NAT traffic outbound to Microsoft and other from Microsoft to the customer.
* Create rules to NAT the respective traffic
  
       security {
           nat {
               source {
                   pool SNAT-To-ExpressRoute {
                       routing-instance {
                           External-ExpressRoute;
                       }
                       address {
                           <NAT-IP-address/Subnet-mask>;
                       }
                   }
                   pool SNAT-From-ExpressRoute {
                       routing-instance {
                           Internal;
                       }
                       address {
                           <NAT-IP-address/Subnet-mask>;
                       }
                   }
                   rule-set Outbound_NAT {
                       from routing-instance Internal;
                       to routing-instance External-ExpressRoute;
                       rule SNAT-Out {
                           match {
                               source-address 0.0.0.0/0;
                           }
                           then {
                               source-nat {
                                   pool {
                                       SNAT-To-ExpressRoute;
                                   }
                               }
                           }
                       }
                   }
                   rule-set Inbound-NAT {
                       from routing-instance External-ExpressRoute;
                       to routing-instance Internal;
                       rule SNAT-In {
                           match {
                               source-address 0.0.0.0/0;
                           }
                           then {
                               source-nat {
                                   pool {
                                       SNAT-From-ExpressRoute;
                                   }
                               }
                           }
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
       }

### 5. Configure BGP to advertise selective prefixes in each direction
Refer to samples in [Routing configuration samples](expressroute-config-samples-routing.md) page.

### 6. Create policies
    routing-options {
                  autonomous-system <Customer-ASN>;
    }
    policy-options {
        prefix-list Microsoft-Prefixes {
            <IP-Address/Subnet-Mask;
            <IP-Address/Subnet-Mask;
        }
        prefix-list private-ranges {
            10.0.0.0/8;
            172.16.0.0/12;
            192.168.0.0/16;
            100.64.0.0/10;
        }
        policy-statement Advertise-NAT-Pools {
            from {
                protocol static;
                route-filter <NAT-Pool-Address/Subnet-mask> prefix-length-range /32-/32;
            }
            then accept;
        }
        policy-statement Accept-from-Microsoft {
            term 1 {
                from {
                    instance External-ExpressRoute;
                    prefix-list-filter Microsoft-Prefixes orlonger;
                }
                then accept;
            }
            term deny {
                then reject;
            }
        }
        policy-statement Accept-from-Internal {
            term no-private {
                from {
                    instance Internal;
                    prefix-list-filter private-ranges orlonger;
                }
                then reject;
            }
            term bgp {
                from {
                    instance Internal;
                    protocol bgp;
                }
                then accept;
            }
            term deny {
                then reject;
            }
        }
    }
    routing-instances {
        Internal {
            instance-type virtual-router;
            interface reth0.100;

                }
                instance-import Accept-from-Microsoft;
            }
            protocols {
                bgp {
                    group customer {
                        export <Advertise-NAT-Pools>;
                        peer-as <Customer-ASN-1>;
                        neighbor <BGP-Neighbor-IP-Address>;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        External-ExpressRoute {
            instance-type virtual-router;
