# Configure Connection Monitor for Azure ExpressRoute

This article guides you through configuring a Connection Monitor extension to monitor ExpressRoute. Connection Monitor is a cloud-based network monitoring solution that tracks connectivity between Azure cloud deployments and on-premises locations (such as branch offices). It's part of Azure Monitor logs and allows you to monitor network connectivity for both private and Microsoft peering connections. By configuring Connection Monitor for ExpressRoute, you can identify and resolve network issues.

[!INCLUDE [azure-monitor-log-analytics-rebrand](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor-log-analytics-rebrand.md)]

With Connection Monitor for ExpressRoute, you can:

* Monitor loss and latency across various VNets and set alerts.
* Monitor all network paths, including redundant ones.
* Troubleshoot transient and point-in-time network issues that are difficult to replicate.
* Identify specific network segments responsible for degraded performance.

## Workflow

Monitoring agents are installed on multiple servers, both on-premises and in Azure. These agents communicate by sending TCP handshake packets, allowing Azure to map the network topology and traffic paths.

1. Create a Log Analytics workspace.
2. Install and configure software agents (not required for Microsoft Peering only):
    * Install monitoring agents on on-premises servers and Azure VMs (for private peering).
    * Configure settings on monitoring agent servers to allow communication (for example, open firewall ports).
3. Configure network security group (NSG) rules to allow communication between monitoring agents on Azure VMs and on-premises agents.
4. Enable Network Watcher on your subscription.
5. Set up monitoring by creating connection monitors with test groups to monitor source and destination endpoints across your network.

If you're already using Network Performance Monitor (deprecated) or Connection Monitor and have a Log Analytics workspace in a supported region, you can skip steps 1 and 2 and start from step 3.

## Create a workspace

Create a workspace in the subscription that has the VNets linked to the ExpressRoute circuit.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). From the subscription with the virtual networks connected to your ExpressRoute circuit, select **+ Create a resource**. Search for *Log Analytics Workspace*, then select **Create**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can create a new workspace or use an existing one. If using an existing workspace, ensure it's been migrated to the new query language. [More information...](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview)

1. Create a workspace by entering or selecting the following information:

    | Settings | Value |
    | -------- | ----- |
    | Subscription | Select the subscription with the ExpressRoute circuit. |
    | Resource Group | Create a new or select an existing resource group. |
    | Name | Enter a name to identify this workspace. |
    | Region | Select a region where this workspace is created. |

   >[!NOTE]
   >The ExpressRoute circuit can be anywhere in the world. It doesn't have to be in the same region as the workspace.

1. Select **Review + Create** to validate and then **Create** to deploy the workspace. Once deployed, continue to the next section to configure the monitoring solution.

## Configure monitoring solution

Complete the Azure PowerShell script by replacing the values for *$SubscriptionId*, *$location*, *$resourceGroup*, and *$workspaceName*. Then run the script to configure the monitoring solution.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$subscriptionId = "Subscription ID should come here"
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $subscriptionId

$location = "Workspace location should come here"
$resourceGroup = "Resource group name should come here"
$workspaceName = "Workspace name should come here"

$solution = @{
    Location          = $location
    Properties        = @{
        workspaceResourceId
        workspaceResourceId = "/subscriptions/$($subscriptionId)/resourcegroups/$($resourceGroup)/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/$($workspaceName)"
    }
    Plan              = @{
        Name          = "NetworkMonitoring($($workspaceName))" 
        Publisher     = "Microsoft"
        Product       = "OMSGallery/NetworkMonitoring"
        PromotionCode = ""
    }
    ResourceName      = "NetworkMonitoring($($workspaceName))" 
    ResourceType      = "Microsoft.OperationsManagement/solutions" 
    ResourceGroupName = $resourceGroup
}

New-AzResource @solution -Force
```

Once you configure the monitoring solution, proceed to install and configure the monitoring agents on your servers.

## Install and configure agents on-premises

### Download the agent setup file

1. Navigate to the **Log Analytics workspace** and select **Agents management** under *Settings*. Download the agent that corresponds to your machine's operating system.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-connection-monitor/download-agent.png" alt-text="Screenshot of agent management page in workspace.":::

1. Copy the **Workspace ID** and **Primary Key** to Notepad.

1. For Windows machines, download and run this PowerShell script [*EnableRules.ps1*](https://aka.ms/npmpowershellscript) in a PowerShell window with Administrator privileges. The script opens the relevant firewall port for TCP transactions.

    For Linux machines, change the port number manually:
    * Navigate to /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/npm_state.
    * Open the npmdregistry file.
    * Change the value for Port Number `PortNumber:<port of your choice>`.

### Install Log Analytics agent on each monitoring server

Install the Log Analytics agent on at least two servers on both sides of the ExpressRoute connection for redundancy. Follow these steps:

1. Select the appropriate operating system for the steps to install the Log Analytics agent on your servers:
    * [Windows](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agent-windows#install-the-agent)
    * [Linux](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agent-linux)

1. After installation, the Microsoft Monitoring Agent appears in the Control Panel. Review your configuration and [verify the agent connectivity](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agent-windows#verify-agent-connectivity-to-azure-monitor) to Azure Monitor logs.

1. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for other on-premises machines you wish to monitor.

### Install Network Watcher agent on each monitoring server

#### New Azure virtual machine

If creating a new Azure VM for monitoring connectivity, you can install the Network Watcher agent during VM creation.

#### Existing Azure virtual machine

If using an existing VM, install the Network Agent separately for [Linux](../network-watcher/network-watcher-agent-linux.md) and [Windows](../network-watcher/network-watcher-agent-windows.md).

### Open firewall ports on monitoring agent servers

Ensure firewall rules allow TCP or ICMP packets between source and destination servers for connection monitoring.

#### Windows

Run the [EnableRules](https://aka.ms/npmpowershellscript) PowerShell script (downloaded earlier) in a PowerShell window with administrative privileges. This script creates the necessary registry keys and Windows Firewall rules.

> [!NOTE]
> The script configures Windows Firewall rules only on the server where it's bring run. Ensure network firewalls allow traffic for the TCP port used by Connection Monitor.

#### Linux

Change port numbers manually:
1. Navigate to /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/npm_state.
1. Open the npmdregistry file.
1. Change the value for Port Number `PortNumber:<port of your choice>`. Ensure the same port number is used across all agents in a workspace.

## Configure Network Security Group rules

To monitor servers in Azure, configure NSG rules to allow TCP or ICMP traffic from Connection Monitor. The default port is **8084**.

For more information about NSG, see the tutorial on [filtering network traffic](../virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure agents are installed (both on-premises and Azure) and run the PowerShell script before proceeding.

## Enable Network Watcher

Ensure Network Watcher is enabled for your subscription. For more information, see [Enable Network Watcher](../network-watcher/network-watcher-create.md).

## Create a connection monitor

For a high-level overview of creating a connection monitor, tests, and test groups, see [Create a connection monitor](../network-watcher/connection-monitor-create-using-portal.md). Follow these steps to configure connection monitoring for Private Peering and Microsoft Peering:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your **Network Watcher** resource and select **Connection monitor** under *Monitoring*. Select **Create** to create a new connection monitor.

1. On the **Basics** tab, select the same region where you deployed your Log Analytics workspace for the *Region* field. For *Workspace configuration*, select the existing Log Analytics workspace you created earlier. Then select **Next: Test groups >>**.

1. On the *Add test group details* page, add the source and destination endpoints for your test group. Enter a **Name** for this test group.

1. Select **Add source** and navigate to the **Non-Azure endpoints** tab. Choose the on-premises resources with Log Analytics agent installed that you want to monitor, then select **Add endpoints**.
