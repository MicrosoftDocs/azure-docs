ExpressRoute uses Network insights to provide a detailed topology mapping of all ExpressRoute components (peerings, connections, gateways) in relation with one another. Network insights for ExpressRoute also have preloaded metrics dashboard for availability, throughput, packet drops, and gateway metrics. For more information, see [Azure ExpressRoute Insights using Networking Insights](expressroute-network-insights.md).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-resource-types](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-resource-types.md)]
For more information about the resource types for ExpressRoute, see [Azure ExpressRoute monitoring data reference](monitor-expressroute-reference.md).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-data-storage](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-data-storage.md)]

Resource Logs aren't collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations.

See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings) for the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for *Azure ExpressRoute* are listed in [Azure ExpressRoute monitoring data reference](monitor-expressroute-reference.md#resource-logs).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enabling these settings requires additional Azure services (storage account, event hub, or Log Analytics), which may increase your cost. To calculate an estimated cost, visit the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator).

For a list of available metrics for ExpressRoute, see [Azure ExpressRoute monitoring data reference](monitor-expressroute-reference.md#metrics).

> [!NOTE]
> Using **Classic Metrics** is not recommended.

## Analyzing metrics

You can analyze metrics for *Azure ExpressRoute* with metrics from other Azure services using metrics explorer by opening **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Analyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics) for details on using this tool.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts/metrics-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the metrics dashboard for ExpressRoute.":::

For reference, you can see a list of [all resource metrics supported in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported).

- To view **ExpressRoute** metrics, filter by Resource Type *ExpressRoute circuits*. 
- To view **Global Reach** metrics, filter by Resource Type *ExpressRoute circuits* and select an ExpressRoute circuit resource that has Global Reach enabled. 
- To view **ExpressRoute Direct** metrics, filter Resource Type by *ExpressRoute Ports*. 

Once a metric is selected, the default aggregation is applied. Optionally, you can apply splitting, which shows the metric with different dimensions.

### ExpressRoute metrics

To view **Metrics**, go to the *Azure Monitor* page and select *Metrics*. To view **ExpressRoute** metrics, filter by Resource Type *ExpressRoute circuits*. To view **Global Reach** metrics, filter by Resource Type *ExpressRoute circuits* and select an ExpressRoute circuit resource that has Global Reach enabled. To view **ExpressRoute Direct** metrics, filter Resource Type by *ExpressRoute Ports*. 

After a metric is selected, the default aggregation is applied. Optionally, you can apply splitting, which shows the metric with different dimensions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When viewing ExpressRoute metrics in the Azure portal, select a time granularity of **5 minutes or greater** for best possible results.

For the ExpressRoute metrics, see [Azure ExpressRoute monitoring data reference](monitor-expressroute-reference.md).

### Aggregation Types

Metrics explorer supports sum, maximum, minimum, average and count as [aggregation types](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-charts#aggregation). You should use the recommended Aggregation type when reviewing the insights for each ExpressRoute metric.

- Sum: The sum of all values captured during the aggregation interval.
- Count: The number of measurements captured during the aggregation interval.
- Average: The average of the metric values captured during the aggregation interval.
- Min: The smallest value captured during the aggregation interval.
- Max: The largest value captured during the aggregation interval.

For the available resource log categories, their associated Log Analytics tables, and the log schemas for ExpressRoute, see [Azure ExpressRoute monitoring data reference](monitor-expressroute-reference.md#resource-logs).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-activity-log](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-activity-log.md)]

### More metrics in Log Analytics

You can also view ExpressRoute metrics by going to your ExpressRoute circuit resource and selecting the *Logs* tab. For any metrics you query, the output contains the following columns.

| Column | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| TimeGrain | string | PT1M (metric values are pushed every minute) |
| Count     | real   | Usually is 2 (each MSEE pushes a single metric value every minute) |
| Minimum   | real   | The minimum of the two metric values pushed by the two MSEEs |
| Maximum   | real   | The maximum of the two metric values pushed by the two MSEEs | 
| Average   | real   | Equal to (Minimum + Maximum)/2 |
| Total     | real   | Sum of the two metric values from both MSEEs (the main value to focus on for the metric queried) |

## Analyzing logs

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.  

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema#top-level-common-schema). The schema for ExpressRoute resource logs is found in the [Azure ExpressRoute Data Reference](monitor-expressroute-reference.md#schemas).

The [Activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) is a platform logging that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.

ExpressRoute stores data in the following tables.

| Table | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| AzureDiagnostics | Common table used by multiple services to store Resource logs. Resource logs from ExpressRoute can be identified with `MICROSOFT.NETWORK`. |
| AzureMetrics | Metric data emitted by ExpressRoute that measure their health and performance. 

To view these tables, navigate to your ExpressRoute circuit resource and select **Logs** under *Monitoring*.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure diagnostic logs, such as BGP route table log are updated every 24 hours.
