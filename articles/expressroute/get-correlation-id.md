# Get operation correlation ID from Activity Log

The Azure Resource Manager Activity Log provides information about resource modifications and helps trace request flows between services. Each operation has a unique **Correlation ID** that aids in troubleshooting issues by correlating them with other signals across multiple services. This guide shows you how to obtain the correlation ID from the Activity Log for an ExpressRoute resource, such as a circuit, gateway, connection, or peering.

## Prerequisites

- Access to an ExpressRoute circuit, gateway, or connection resource.

## Obtain operation correlation ID

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Navigate to your ExpressRoute resource in the Azure portal. Select **Activity log** from the left menu.

1. On the Activity log page, apply filters to narrow down the results. For example, filter by **operation type**, **resource type**, or **date/time range** to show activities for a specific ExpressRoute resource. By default, the Activity Log shows all activities for the selected resource.

## Next steps

* File a support request with the correlation ID to help troubleshoot your issue. For more information, see [How to create an Azure support request](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request).
