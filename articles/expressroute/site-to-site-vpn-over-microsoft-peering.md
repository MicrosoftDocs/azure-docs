# Configure a site-to-site VPN over ExpressRoute Microsoft peering

This article helps you configure secure encrypted connectivity between your on-premises network and your Azure virtual networks (VNets) over an ExpressRoute private connection. You can use Microsoft peering to establish a site-to-site IPsec/IKE VPN tunnel between your selected on-premises networks and Azure VNets. Configuring a secure tunnel over ExpressRoute allows for data exchange with confidentiality, anti-replay, authenticity, and integrity.

>[!NOTE]
>When you set up site-to-site VPN over Microsoft peering, you are charged for the VPN gateway and VPN egress. For more information, see [VPN Gateway pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/vpn-gateway).

For high availability and redundancy, you can configure multiple tunnels over the two MSEE-PE pairs of a ExpressRoute circuit and enable load balancing between the tunnels.

:::image type="content" source="./media/site-to-site-vpn-over-microsoft-peering/high-availability.png" alt-text="Diagram of multiple IPsec tunnels to create high availability over an ExpressRoute Microsoft peering connection.":::

VPN tunnels over Microsoft peering can be terminated either using VPN gateway, or using an appropriate Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) available through Azure Marketplace. You can exchange routes statically or dynamically over the encrypted tunnels without exposing the route exchange to the underlying Microsoft peering. In the examples in this article, BGP (different from the BGP session used to create the Microsoft peering) is used to dynamically exchange prefixes over the encrypted tunnels.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>For the on-premises side, typically Microsoft peering is terminated on the DMZ and private peering is terminated on the core network zone. The two zones would be segregated using firewalls. If you are configuring Microsoft peering exclusively for enabling secure tunneling over ExpressRoute, remember to filter through only the public IPs of interest that are getting advertised via Microsoft peering.
>

## <a name="workflow"></a>Workflow

1. Configure Microsoft peering for your ExpressRoute circuit.
2. Advertise selected Azure regional public prefixes to your on-premises network via Microsoft peering.
3. Configure a VPN gateway and establish IPsec tunnels
4. Configure the on-premises VPN device.
5. Create the site-to-site IPsec/IKE connection.
6. (Optional) Configure firewalls/filtering on the on-premises VPN device.
7. Test and validate the IPsec communication over the ExpressRoute circuit.

## <a name="peering"></a>1. Configure Microsoft peering

To configure a site-to-site VPN connection over ExpressRoute, you must use ExpressRoute Microsoft peering.

* To configure a new ExpressRoute circuit, start with the [ExpressRoute prerequisites](expressroute-prerequisites.md) article, and then [Create and modify an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-arm.md).

* If you already have an ExpressRoute circuit, but don't have Microsoft peering configured, configure Microsoft peering using the [Create and modify peering for an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-routing-arm.md#msft) article.

Once you configured your circuit and Microsoft peering, you can easily view it using the **Overview** page in the Azure portal.

## <a name="routefilter"></a>2. Configure route filters

A route filter lets you identify services you want to consume through your ExpressRoute circuit's Microsoft peering. It's essentially an allowlist of all the BGP community values. 

:::image type="content" source="./media/site-to-site-vpn-over-microsoft-peering/route-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a route filter overview page.":::

In this example, the deployment is only in the *Azure West US 2* region. A route filter rule is added to allow only the advertisement of Azure West US 2 regional prefixes, which has the BGP community value *12076:51026*. You specify the regional prefixes that you want to allow by selecting **Manage rule**.

Within the route filter, you also need to choose the ExpressRoute circuits for which the route filter applies. You can choose the ExpressRoute circuits by selecting **Add circuit**. In the previous figure, the route filter is associated to the example ExpressRoute circuit.

### <a name="configfilter"></a>2.1 Configure the route filter

Configure a route filter. For steps, see [Configure route filters for Microsoft peering](how-to-routefilter-portal.md).

### <a name="verifybgp"></a>2.2 Verify BGP routes

Once you successfully created the Microsoft peering over your ExpressRoute circuit and associated a route filter with the circuit, you can verify the BGP routes received from Microsoft Enterprise Edge (MSEEs) on the PE devices that are peering with the MSEEs. The verification command varies, depending on the operating system of your PE devices.

#### Cisco examples

This example uses a Cisco IOS-XE command. In the example, a virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instance is used to isolate the peering traffic.

```
show ip bgp vpnv4 vrf 10 summary
```

The following partial output shows that 68 prefixes were received from the neighbor \*.243.229.34 with the Autonomous System Number (ASN) 12076 (MSEE):

```
...

Neighbor        V           AS MsgRcvd MsgSent   TblVer  InQ OutQ Up/Down  State/PfxRcd
X.243.229.34    4        12076   17671   17650    25228    0    0 1w4d           68
```

To see the list of prefixes received from the neighbor, use the following example:

```
sh ip bgp vpnv4 vrf 10 neighbors X.243.229.34 received-routes
```

To confirm that you're receiving the correct set of prefixes, you can cross-verify. The following Azure PowerShell command output lists the prefixes advertised via Microsoft peering for each of the services and for each of the Azure region:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzBgpServiceCommunity
```

## <a name="vpngateway"></a>3. Configure the VPN gateway and IPsec tunnels

In this section, IPsec VPN tunnels are created between the Azure VPN gateway and the on-premises VPN device. The examples use Cisco Cloud Service Router (CSR1000) VPN devices.

The following diagram shows the IPsec VPN tunnels established between on-premises VPN device 1, and the Azure VPN gateway instance pair. The two IPsec VPN tunnels established between the on-premises VPN device 2 and the Azure VPN gateway instance pair isn't illustrated in the diagram. The configuration details aren't listed. However, having more VPN tunnels improves high availability.

:::image type="content" source="./media/site-to-site-vpn-over-microsoft-peering/establish-tunnels.png" alt-text="Diagram of an established VPN tunnel over ExpressRoute.":::

Over the IPsec tunnel pair, an eBGP session is established to exchange private network routes. The following diagram shows the eBGP session established over the IPsec tunnel pair:

:::image type="content" source="./media/site-to-site-vpn-over-microsoft-peering/tunnel-bgp.png" alt-text="Diagram of an established eBGP session over the IPsec tunnel.":::

The following diagram shows the abstracted overview of the example network:

:::image type="content" source="./media/site-to-site-vpn-over-microsoft-peering/overview-reference.png" alt-text="Diagram of a network environment once VPN gets established between on-premises and Azure.":::

### About the Azure Resource Manager template examples

In the examples, the VPN gateway and the IPsec tunnel terminations are configured using an Azure Resource Manager template. If you're new to using Resource Manager templates, or to understand the Resource Manager template basics, see [Understand the structure and syntax of Azure Resource Manager templates](../azure-resource-manager/templates/syntax.md). The template in this section creates a green field Azure environment (virtual network). However, if you have an existing virtual network, you can reference it in the template. If you aren't familiar with VPN gateway IPsec/IKE site-to-site configurations, see [Create a site-to-site connection](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-create-site-to-site-rm-powershell.md).

>[!NOTE]
>You do not need to use Azure Resource Manager templates in order to create this configuration. You can create this configuration using the Azure portal, or PowerShell.
>

### <a name="variables3"></a>3.1 Declare the variables

In this example, the variable declarations correspond to the example network. When declaring variables, modify this section to reflect your environment.

* The variable **localAddressPrefix** is an array of on-premises IP addresses to terminate the IPsec tunnels.
* The **gatewaySku** determines the VPN throughput. For more information about gatewaySku and vpnType, see [VPN Gateway configuration settings](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateway-settings.md#gwsku). For pricing, see [VPN Gateway pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/vpn-gateway).
* Set the **vpnType** to **RouteBased**.

```json

  "api-version": "2017-06-01"
},
```

### <a name="vnet"></a>3.2 Create virtual network (virtual network)

If you're associating an existing virtual network with the VPN tunnels, you can skip this step.

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "[variables('api-version')]",
  "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks",
  "name": "[variables('virtualNetworkName')]",
  "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
  "properties": {
    "addressSpace": {
      "addressPrefixes": [
        "[variables('azureVNetAddressPrefix')]"
      ]
    },
    "subnets": [
      {
        "name": "[variables('subnetName')]",
        "properties": {
          "addressPrefix": "[variables('subnetPrefix')]"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "GatewaySubnet",
        "properties": {
          "addressPrefix": "[variables('gatewaySubnetPrefix')]"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "comments": "Create a Virtual Network with Subnet1 and Gatewaysubnet"
},
```

### <a name="ip"></a>3.3 Assign public IP addresses to VPN gateway instances
 
Assign a public IP address for each instance of a VPN gateway.

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "[variables('api-version')]",
  "type": "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses",
    "name": "[variables('gatewayPublicIPName1')]",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "properties": {
      "publicIPAllocationMethod": "Static"
    },
    "comments": "Public IP for the first instance of the VPN gateway"
  },
  {
    "apiVersion": "[variables('api-version')]",
    "type": "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses",
    "name": "[variables('gatewayPublicIPName2')]",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "properties": {
      "publicIPAllocationMethod": "Static"
    },
    "comments": "Public IP for the second instance of the VPN gateway"
  },
```

### <a name="termination"></a>3.4 Specify the on-premises VPN tunnel termination (local network gateway)

The on-premises VPN devices are referred to as the **local network gateway**. The following json snippet also specifies remote BGP peer details:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "[variables('api-version')]",
  "type": "Microsoft.Network/localNetworkGateways",
  "name": "[variables('localGatewayName')]",
  "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
  "properties": {
    "localNetworkAddressSpace": {
      "addressPrefixes": "[variables('localAddressPrefix')]"
    },
    "gatewayIpAddress": "[variables('localGatewayIpAddress')]",
    "bgpSettings": {
      "asn": "[variables('asnRemote')]",
      "bgpPeeringAddress": "[variables('bgpPeeringAddress')]",
      "peerWeight": 0
    }
  },
  "comments": "Local Network Gateway (referred to your on-premises location) with IP address of remote tunnel peering and IP address of remote BGP peer"
},
```

### <a name="creategw"></a>3.5 Create the VPN gateway

This section of the template configures the VPN gateway with the required settings for an active-active configuration. Keep in mind the following requirements:

* Create the VPN gateway with a **"RouteBased"** VpnType. This setting is mandatory if you want to enable the BGP routing between the VPN gateway, and the VPN on-premises.
* To establish VPN tunnels between the two instances of the VPN gateway and a given on-premises device in active-active mode, the **"activeActive"** parameter is set to **true** in the Resource Manager template. To understand more about highly available VPN gateways, see [Highly available VPN gateway connectivity](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-highlyavailable.md).
* To configure eBGP sessions between the VPN tunnels, you must specify two different ASNs on either side. It's preferable to specify private ASN numbers. For more information, see [Overview of BGP and Azure VPN gateways](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-bgp-overview.md).

```json

        "asn": "[variables('asnVpnGateway')]"
      }
    },
    "comments": "VPN Gateway in active-active configuration with BGP support"
  },
```

### <a name="ipsectunnel"></a>3.6 Establish the IPsec tunnels

The final action of the script creates IPsec tunnels between the Azure VPN gateway and the on-premises VPN device.

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "[variables('api-version')]",
  "name": "[variables('connectionName')]",
  "type": "Microsoft.Network/connections",
  "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
  "dependsOn": [
    "[concat('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways/', variables('gatewayName'))]",
    "[concat('Microsoft.Network/localNetworkGateways/', variables('localGatewayName'))]"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "virtualNetworkGateway1": {
      "id": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways', variables('gatewayName'))]"
    },
    "localNetworkGateway2": {
      "id": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/localNetworkGateways', variables('localGatewayName'))]"
    },
    "connectionType": "IPsec",
    "routingWeight": 0,
    "sharedKey": "[variables('sharedKey')]",
    "enableBGP": "true"
  },
  "comments": "Create a Connection type site-to-site (IPsec) between the Azure VPN Gateway and the VPN device on-premises"
  }
```

## <a name="device"></a>4. Configure the on-premises VPN device

The Azure VPN gateway is compatible with many VPN devices from different vendors. For configuration information and devices that are validated to work with VPN gateway, see [About VPN devices](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices.md).

When configuring your VPN device, you need the following items:

* A shared key. This value is the same shared key that you specify when creating your site-to-site VPN connection. The examples use a basic shared key. We recommend that you generate a more complex key to use.
* The Public IP address of your VPN gateway. You can view the public IP address by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or CLI. To find the Public IP address of your VPN gateway using the Azure portal, navigate to Virtual network gateways, then select the name of your gateway.

Typically eBGP peers are directly connected (often over a WAN connection). However, when you're configuring eBGP over IPsec VPN tunnels via ExpressRoute Microsoft peering, there are multiple routing domains between the eBGP peers. Use the **ebgp-multihop** command to establish the eBGP neighbor relationship between the two not-directly connected peers. The integer that follows ebgp-multihop command specifies the time to live (TTL) value in the BGP packets. The command **maximum-paths eibgp 2** enables load balancing of traffic between the two BGP paths.

## <a name="firewalls"></a>5. Configure VPN device filtering and firewalls (optional)

Configure your firewall and filtering according to your requirements.

## <a name="testipsec"></a>6. Test and validate the IPsec tunnel

The status of IPsec tunnels can be verified on the Azure VPN gateway by PowerShell commands:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name vpn2local1 -ResourceGroupName myRG | Select-Object  ConnectionStatus,EgressBytesTransferred,IngressBytesTransferred | fl
```

Example output:

```azurepowershell
ConnectionStatus        : Connected
EgressBytesTransferred  : 17734660
IngressBytesTransferred : 10538211
```

To check the status of the tunnels on the Azure VPN gateway instances independently, use the following example:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name vpn2local1 -ResourceGroupName myRG | Select-Object -ExpandProperty TunnelConnectionStatus
```

Example output:

```azurepowershell
Tunnel                           : vpn2local1_52.175.250.191
ConnectionStatus                 : Connected
IngressBytesTransferred          : 4877438
EgressBytesTransferred           : 8754071
LastConnectionEstablishedUtcTime : 11/04/2017 17:03:30

Tunnel                           : vpn2local1_52.175.253.112
ConnectionStatus                 : Connected
IngressBytesTransferred          : 5660773
EgressBytesTransferred           : 8980589
LastConnectionEstablishedUtcTime : 11/04/2017 17:03:13
```

You can also check the tunnel status on your on-premises VPN device.

### <a name="verifye2e"></a>Verify end-to-end connectivity between the inside network on-premises and the Azure virtual network

If the IPsec tunnels are up and the static routes are correctly set, you should be able to ping the IP address of the remote BGP peer:

```
csr1#ping 10.2.0.228
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.2.0.228, timeout is 2 seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 5/5/5 ms

#ping 10.2.0.229
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.2.0.229, timeout is 2 seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 4/5/6 ms
```

### <a name="verifybgp"></a>Verify the BGP sessions over IPsec

On the Azure VPN gateway, verify the status of BGP peer:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayBGPPeerStatus -VirtualNetworkGatewayName vpnGtw -ResourceGroupName SEA-C1-VPN-ER | ft
```

Example output:

```azurepowershell
  Asn ConnectedDuration LocalAddress MessagesReceived MessagesSent Neighbor    RoutesReceived State

```

To verify the list of network prefixes received via eBGP from the VPN concentrator on-premises, you can filter by attribute "Origin":

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayLearnedRoute -VirtualNetworkGatewayName vpnGtw -ResourceGroupName myRG  | Where-Object Origin -eq "EBgp" |ft
```

In the example output, the ASN 65010 is the BGP autonomous system number in the VPN on-premises.

```azurepowershell
AsPath LocalAddress Network      NextHop     Origin SourcePeer  Weight
------ ------------ -------      -------     ------ ----------  ------
65010  10.2.0.228   10.1.10.0/25 172.16.0.10 EBgp   172.16.0.10  32768
65010  10.2.0.228   10.0.0.0/24  172.16.0.10 EBgp   172.16.0.10  32768
```

To see the list of advertised routes:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayAdvertisedRoute -VirtualNetworkGatewayName vpnGtw -ResourceGroupName myRG -Peer 10.2.0.228 | ft
```

Example output:

```azurepowershell
