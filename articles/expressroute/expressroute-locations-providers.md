The tables in this article provide information on ExpressRoute connectivity providers, ExpressRoute geographical coverage, Microsoft cloud services supported over ExpressRoute, and ExpressRoute System Integrators (SIs).

## <a name="partners"></a>ExpressRoute connectivity providers
ExpressRoute is supported across all Azure regions and locations. The following map provides a list of Azure regions and ExpressRoute locations. ExpressRoute locations refer to those where Microsoft peers with several service providers.

![Location map][0]

You will have access to Azure services across all regions within a geopolitical region if you connected to at least one ExpressRoute location within the geopolitical region. 

### Azure regions to ExpressRoute locations within a geopolitical region
The following table provides a map of Azure regions to ExpressRoute locations within a geopolitical region.

| **Geopolitical region** | **Azure regions** | **ExpressRoute locations** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **North America** |East US, West US, East US 2, West US 2, Central US, South Central US, North Central US, West Central US, Canada Central, Canada East |Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Antonio, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Washington DC, Montreal, Quebec City, Toronto |
| **South America** |Brazil South |Sao Paulo |

### Regions and geopolitical boundaries for national clouds
The table below provides information on regions and geopolitical boundaries for national clouds.

| **Geopolitical region** | **Azure regions** | **ExpressRoute locations** |

Connectivity to national cloud environments is not supported. You can work with your connectivity provider if such a need arises.
