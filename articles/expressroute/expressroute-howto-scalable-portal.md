# Configure a scalable ExpressRoute gateway using Azure portal and PowerShell

This article walks you through configuring a scalable ExpressRoute gateway in Azure using both the Azure portal and PowerShell. A scalable gateway lets you adjust bandwidth and performance for your ExpressRoute connection as your workload needs change.
## Prerequisites

### Subnet requirement
The scalable gateway must be deployed in a subnet that is /26 or larger. This ensures enough IP address space for gateway scaling and high availability.

### Regional availability
Before deployment, review the About Scalable Gateway (link) to confirm region support. Some regions may not currently support scalable gateway functionality.

## Create the virtual network gateway

1. In the Azure portal, select **Create a resource** from the left menu. Search for "Virtual Network Gateway" and select it from the results. On the **Virtual network gateway** page, choose **Create**.

2. On the **Create virtual network gateway** page, provide the following settings:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Project details** |  |
    | Subscription | Ensure the correct subscription is selected. |
    | Resource Group | The resource group is automatically selected after you choose the virtual network. |
    | **Instance details** |  |
    | Name | Enter a name for your gateway resource. This isn't the same as the gateway subnet name. |
    | Region | Select the region where your virtual network is located. If the region doesn't match your virtual network, it will not appear in the **Virtual network** dropdown.<br>If you want to deploy in an [Azure Extended Zone](../extended-zones/overview.md), select **Deploy to an Azure Extended Zone**. |
    | Gateway type | Choose **ExpressRoute**. |
    | SKU | Select **ErGwScale** from the dropdown. For details, see [ExpressRoute gateway SKUs](expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways.md#gwsku). |
    | Minimum Scale Units | Enter the minimum number of scale units. For more information, see [ExpressRoute Gateway Scale Units](scalable-gateway.md). |
    | Maximum Scale Units | Enter the maximum number of scale units. For more information, see [ExpressRoute Gateway Scale Units](scalable-gateway.md). |
    | Virtual network | Select *vnet-1*. |
    | **Public IP address** |  |
    | Assignment | By default, ExpressRoute gateways use an [Auto-Assigned Public IP](expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways.md#auto-assigned-public-ip). |

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The ErGwScale SKU does not support IPsec over ExpressRoute or workloads that rely on UDP flow count at this time.

3. Select **Review + Create**, then **Create** to start the deployment. Validation occurs, and the gateway creation process may take up to 45 minutes.

## Update the gateway SKU to Scalable Gateway after migration

After migrating your ExpressRoute gateway to a new deployment, you can further enhance its performance and resiliency by updating its SKU and scale units using Azure PowerShell.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To upgrade your gateway, first set the maximum scale unit to 10. After the upgrade is complete, you can adjust the configuration to your desired maximum scale unit.

To update your gateway configuration, run the following PowerShell commands:

```powershell
$vng = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name <GatewayName> -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName>
Set-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -VirtualNetworkGateway $vng -MinScaleUnit 2 -MaxScaleUnit 2 -GatewaySku ErGwScale
```

**Instructions:**
- Replace `<GatewayName>` with the name of your migrated Virtual Network Gateway.
- Replace `<ResourceGroupName>` with the name of the resource group containing your gateway.

The example above sets both the minimum and maximum scale units to 2 and updates the gateway SKU to `ErGwScale` for improved scalability and throughput.

## Change the scale units

1. In the Azure portal, go to your ExpressRoute virtual network gateway.
2. Under **Settings**, select **Configuration**.
3. In the **Configuration** pane, adjust the **Minimum Scale Units** and/or **Maximum Scale Units** as needed.

> [!NOTE]
> To migrate your existing ExpressRoute gateway to a scalable gateway, follow the steps in the [ExpressRoute gateway migration guide](expressroute-howto-gateway-migration-portal.md).
