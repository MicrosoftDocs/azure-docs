# Using Azure ExpressRoute to create hybrid connectivity to support remote users

This article describes how you can leverage ExpressRoute, Azure, Microsoft network, and the Azure partner ecosystem to work remotely.

## Connecting to Azure services with ExpressRoute

[ExpressRoute](expressroute-introduction.md) is an Azure service that enables private connectivity between Microsoft datacenters and infrastructure that's on your premises or in a colocation facility. ExpressRoute connections do not go over the public Internet. They offer secure connectivity, reliability, and speeds, with lower and consistent latencies than typical connections over the Internet.
