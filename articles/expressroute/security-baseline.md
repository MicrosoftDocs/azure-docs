# Azure security baseline for ExpressRoute

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to ExpressRoute. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to ExpressRoute. **Controls** not applicable to ExpressRoute have been excluded.

 
To see how ExpressRoute completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full ExpressRoute security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Logging and Monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: Enable Azure Activity Log diagnostic settings and send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace, Azure event hub, or Azure storage account for archive. Activity logs provide insight into the operations that were performed on your Azure ExpressRoute resources at the control plane level. Using Azure Activity Log data, you can determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed at the control plane level for your ExpressRoute resources.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 2.3: Enable audit logging for Azure resources

**Guidance**: Enable Azure Activity Log diagnostic settings and send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace, Azure event hub, or Azure storage account for archive. Activity logs provide insight into the operations that were performed on your Azure ExpressRoute resources at the control plane level. Using Azure Activity Log data, you can determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed at the control plane level for your ExpressRoute resources.

- [How to enable Diagnostic Settings for Azure Activity Log](../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 2.5: Configure security log storage retention

**Guidance**: In Azure Monitor, set log retention period for Log Analytics workspaces associated with your Azure ExpressRoute resources according to your organization's compliance regulations.

- [How to set log retention parameters](../azure-monitor/logs/manage-cost-storage.md#change-the-data-retention-period)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 2.6: Monitor and review logs

**Guidance**: Enable Azure Activity Log diagnostic settings and send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace. Perform queries in Log Analytics to search terms, identify trends, analyze patterns, and provide many other insights based on the Activity Log Data that may have been collected for Azure ExpressRoute.

## Identity and Access Control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and Access Control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Maintain an inventory of the user accounts that have administrative access to the control plane (e.g. Azure portal) of your Azure ExpressRoute resources.

You can use the Identity and Access control (IAM) pane in the Azure portal for your subscription to configure Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). The roles are applied to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities in Active Directory. 

Additionally, partners using the ExpressRoute Partner Resource Manager API can apply Role-Based Access Control to the expressRouteCrossConnection resource. These controls can define permissions for which users accounts can modify the expressRouteCrossConnection resource and add/update/delete peering configurations.

- [Understand Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/overview.md)

- [Leverage Azure RBAC in the ExpressRoute Partner Resource Manager API](cross-connections-api-development.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.2: Change default passwords where applicable

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) does not have the concept of default passwords. Other Azure resources requiring a password forces a password to be created with complexity requirements and a minimum password length, which differs depending on the service. You are responsible for third-party applications and marketplace services that may use default passwords.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

Additionally, to help you keep track of dedicated administrative accounts, you may use recommendations from Azure Security Center or built-in Azure Policies, such as:

- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

For more information, see the following references:

- [How to use Azure Security Center to monitor identity and access (Preview)](../security-center/security-center-identity-access.md)

- [How to use Azure Policy](../governance/policy/tutorials/create-and-manage.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.4: Use Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO)

**Guidance**: Not applicable; single sign-on (SSO) adds security and convenience when users sign in to custom applications in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Access to the Azure ExpressRoute control plane (e.g. Azure portal) is already integrated with Azure AD and is accessed through the Azure portal as well as the Azure Resource Manager REST API.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.5: Use multi-factor authentication for all Azure Active Directory-based access

**Guidance**: Enable Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Multi-Factor Authentication and follow Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management recommendations.

- [How to enable Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication](../active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted.md)

- [How to monitor identity and access within Azure Security Center](../security-center/security-center-identity-access.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.6: Use dedicated machines (Privileged Access Workstations) for all administrative tasks

**Guidance**: Use a Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Multi-Factor Authentication enabled to log into and configure your Azure Sentinel-related resources. 

- [Privileged Access Workstations](https://4sysops.com/archives/understand-the-microsoft-privileged-access-workstation-paw-security-model/)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.7: Log and alert on suspicious activities from administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for generation of logs and alerts when suspicious or unsafe activity occurs in the environment.

In addition, use Azure AD risk detections to view alerts and reports on risky user behavior.

- [How to deploy Privileged Identity Management (PIM)](../active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-deployment-plan.md)

- [Understand Azure AD risk detections](../active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.8: Manage Azure resources from only approved locations

**Guidance**: Use Conditional Access Named Locations to allow access to the Azure portal from only specific logical groupings of IP address ranges or countries/regions.

- [How to configure Named Locations in Azure](../active-directory/reports-monitoring/quickstart-configure-named-locations.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.9: Use Azure Active Directory

**Guidance**: Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the central authentication and authorization system for your Azure Sentinel instances. Azure AD protects data by using strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Azure AD also salts, hashes, and securely stores user credentials.

- [How to create and configure an Azure AD instance](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.10: Regularly review and reconcile user access

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides logs to help you discover stale accounts. In addition, use Azure Identity Access Reviews to efficiently manage group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. User access can be reviewed on a regular basis to make sure only the right Users have continued access.

- [How to use Azure Identity Access Reviews](../active-directory/governance/access-reviews-overview.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.11: Monitor attempts to access deactivated credentials

**Guidance**: Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the central authentication and authorization system for your Azure ExpressRoute resources. Azure AD protects data by using strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Azure AD also salts, hashes, and securely stores user credentials.

You have access to Azure AD sign-in activity, audit and risk event log sources, which allow you to integrate with Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

You can streamline this process by creating diagnostic settings for Azure AD user accounts and sending the audit logs and sign-in logs to a Log Analytics workspace. You can configure desired log alerts within Log Analytics.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.12: Alert on account sign-in behavior deviation

**Guidance**: For account login behavior deviation on the control plane (e.g. Azure portal), use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Identity Protection and risk detection features to configure automated responses to detected suspicious actions related to user identities. You can also ingest data into Azure Sentinel for further investigation.

- [How to view Azure AD risky sign-in](../active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

## Data Protection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data Protection](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-protection.md).*

### 4.4: Encrypt all sensitive information in transit

**Guidance**: IPsec is an IETF standard. It encrypts data at the Internet Protocol (IP) level or Network Layer 3. You can use IPsec to encrypt an end-to-end connection between your on-premises network and your virtual network (VNET) on Azure. 

- [How to configure Site to Site IPSEC over ExpressRoute](site-to-site-vpn-over-microsoft-peering.md)

- [How to configure Site to Site IPSEC over ExpressRoute](site-to-site-vpn-over-microsoft-peering.md)

**Responsibility**: Shared

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 4.6: Use Azure RBAC to control access to resources 

**Guidance**: You can use the Identity and Access control (IAM) pane in the Azure portal for your subscription to configure Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). The roles are applied to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities in Active Directory. You can use built-in roles or custom roles for individuals and groups.

Azure ExpressRoute also has circuit owner and circuit user roles. Circuit users are owners of virtual network gateways that are not within the same subscription as the ExpressRoute circuit. The circuit owner has the power to modify and revoke authorizations at any time. Revoking an authorization results in all link connections being deleted from the subscription whose access was revoked. Circuit users can redeem authorizations (one authorization per virtual network).

Additionally, partners using the ExpressRoute Partner Resource Manager API can apply Role-Based Access Control to the expressRouteCrossConnection resource. These controls can define permissions for which users accounts can modify the expressRouteCrossConnection resource and add/update/delete peering configurations.

## Inventory and Asset Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Inventory and Asset Management](../security/benchmarks/security-control-inventory-asset-management.md).*

### 6.1: Use automated asset discovery solution

**Guidance**: Use Azure Resource Graph to query/discover all resources (such as compute, storage, network, ports, and protocols etc.) within your subscription(s). Ensure appropriate (read) permissions in your tenant and enumerate all Azure subscriptions as well as resources within your subscriptions.

Although classic Azure resources may be discovered via Resource Graph, it is highly recommended that you create and use Azure Resource Manager resources going forward.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 6.3: Delete unauthorized Azure resources

**Guidance**: Use tagging, management groups, and separate subscriptions, where appropriate, to organize and track Azure resources. Reconcile inventory on a regular basis and ensure unauthorized resources are deleted from the subscription in a timely manner.

In addition, use Azure Policy to put restrictions on the type of resources that can be created in customer subscription(s) using the following built-in policy definitions:

- Not allowed resource types
- Allowed resource types

For more information, see the following references:

- [How to create additional Azure subscriptions](../cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription.md)
