# Move ExpressRoute circuits from classic to Resource Manager deployment model using PowerShell

To use an ExpressRoute circuit for both the classic and Resource Manager deployment models, you must move the circuit to the Resource Manager deployment model. The following sections help you move your circuit by using PowerShell.

## Before you begin

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/hybrid-az-ps.md)]

* Verify that you have installed both the classic and Az Azure PowerShell modules locally on your computer. For more information, see [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/).
* Make sure that you have reviewed the [prerequisites](expressroute-prerequisites.md), [routing requirements](expressroute-routing.md), and [workflows](expressroute-workflows.md) before you begin configuration.
* Review the information that is provided under [Moving an ExpressRoute circuit from classic to Resource Manager](expressroute-move.md). Make sure that you fully understand the limits and limitations.
* Verify that the circuit is fully operational in the classic deployment model.
* Ensure that you have a resource group that was created in the Resource Manager deployment model.

## Move an ExpressRoute circuit

### Step 1: Gather circuit details from the classic deployment model

Sign in to the Azure classic environment and gather the service key.

1. Sign in to your Azure account.

   ```powershell
   Add-AzureAccount
   ```

2. Select the appropriate Azure subscription.

   ```powershell
   Select-AzureSubscription "<Enter Subscription Name here>"
   ```

3. Import the PowerShell modules for Azure and ExpressRoute.

   ```powershell
   Import-Module 'C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Azure\5.1.1\Azure\Azure.psd1'
   Import-Module 'C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Azure\5.1.1\ExpressRoute\ExpressRoute.psd1'
   ```

4. Use the cmdlet below to get the service keys for all of your ExpressRoute circuits. After retrieving the keys, copy the **service key** of the circuit that you want to move to the Resource Manager deployment model.

   ```powershell
   Get-AzureDedicatedCircuit
   ```

### Step 2: Sign in and create a resource group

Sign in to the Resource Manager environment and create a new resource group.

1. Sign in to your Azure Resource Manager environment.

   ```powershell
   Connect-AzAccount
   ```

2. Select the appropriate Azure subscription.

   ```powershell
   Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName "<Enter Subscription Name here>" | Select-AzSubscription
   ```

3. Modify the snippet below to create a new resource group if you don't already have a resource group.

   ```powershell
   New-AzResourceGroup -Name "DemoRG" -Location "West US"
   ```

### Step 3: Move the ExpressRoute circuit to the Resource Manager deployment model

You are now ready to move your ExpressRoute circuit from the classic deployment model to the Resource Manager deployment model. Before proceeding, review the information provided in [Moving an ExpressRoute circuit from the classic to the Resource Manager deployment model](expressroute-move.md).

To move your circuit, modify and run the following snippet:

```powershell
Move-AzExpressRouteCircuit -Name "MyCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "DemoRG" -Location "West US" -ServiceKey "<Service-key>"
```

In classic mode, an ExpressRoute circuit does not have the concept of being tied to a region. However, in Resource Manager, every resource needs to be mapped to an Azure region. The region specified in the Move-AzExpressRouteCircuit cmdlet can technically be any region. For organizational purposes, you may want to choose a region that closely represents your peering location.

> [!NOTE]
> * After moving your classic ExpressRoute circuit to the Resource Manager deployment model, it will have access to both the classic and Resource Manager deployment models by default.
> * The new name that is listed in the previous cmdlet will be used to address the resource. The circuit will essentially be renamed.

## Modify circuit access

### To enable ExpressRoute circuit access for both deployment models

You can enable access to the classic deployment model for ExpressRoute circuits that were created in the Resource Manager deployment model. Run the following cmdlets to enable access to both deployment models:

1. Get the circuit details.

   ```powershell
   $ckt = Get-AzExpressRouteCircuit -Name "DemoCkt" -ResourceGroupName "DemoRG"
   ```

2. Set "Allow Classic Operations" to TRUE.

   ```powershell
   $ckt.AllowClassicOperations = $true
   ```

3. Update the circuit. After this operation has finished successfully, you will be able to view the circuit in the classic deployment model.

   ```powershell
   Set-AzExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt
   ```

4. Run the following cmdlet to get the details of the ExpressRoute circuit. You must be able to see the service key listed.

   ```powershell
   get-azurededicatedcircuit
   ```

5. You can now manage links to the ExpressRoute circuit using the classic deployment model commands for classic VNets, and the Resource Manager commands for Resource Manager VNets. The following articles help you manage links to the ExpressRoute circuit:

    * [Link your virtual network to your ExpressRoute circuit in the Resource Manager deployment model](expressroute-howto-linkvnet-arm.md)
    * [Link your virtual network to your ExpressRoute circuit in the classic deployment model](expressroute-howto-linkvnet-classic.md)

### To disable ExpressRoute circuit access to the classic deployment model

Run the following cmdlets to disable access to the classic deployment model.

1. Get details of the ExpressRoute circuit.

   ```powershell
   $ckt = Get-AzExpressRouteCircuit -Name "DemoCkt" -ResourceGroupName "DemoRG"
   ```

2. Set "Allow Classic Operations" to FALSE.

   ```powershell
   $ckt.AllowClassicOperations = $false
   ```

3. Update the circuit. After this operation has finished successfully, you will not be able to view the circuit in the classic deployment model.

   ```powershell
   Set-AzExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt
   ```
