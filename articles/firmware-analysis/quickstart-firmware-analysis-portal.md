# Quickstart: Analyze a firmware image

In this quickstart, learn how to use the Azure portal to upload a firmware image for security analysis and view the results.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

> [!NOTE]
> The **firmware analysis** page is in PREVIEW. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include other legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
>

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> The **firmware analysis** feature is automatically available if you currently access Defender for IoT using the Security Admin, Contributor, or Owner role. If you only have the Security Reader role or want to use **firmware analysis** as a standalone feature, your Admin must assign the Firmware Analysis Admin role. For additional information, please see [Firmware analysis Azure RBAC](./firmware-analysis-rbac.md).

## Onboard your subscription

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and search for **firmware analysis**. Select the blue **Get started** button or go to the **Firmware workspaces** tab.
