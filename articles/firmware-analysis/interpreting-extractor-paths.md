# Overview of How Firmware Images are Structured

A firmware image is a collection of files and file systems containing software that operates hardware. Often, it includes compressed files, executables, and system files. These file systems may or may not include other file systems within each file. For example, a firmware image that’s a .zip file may include individual files such as executables within it but may also include other compressed file systems, such as a SquashFS file. You can visualize it like the following:

:::image type="content" source="media/extractor-paths/file-systems.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how the file system of a firmware image might look like." lightbox="media/extractor-paths/file-systems.png":::

*Each circle represents a file that may or may not have more file systems within it. The extractor repeatedly extracts each circle until there are no more circles (files) within it to be extracted.*

If the large, encompassing oval represents the firmware image, the three circles within the large oval may represent individual file systems within this firmware image. The circles may even represent executables with embedded file systems within them.

Because of the complex structure of firmware images – any given layer could be an executable or a file system with another embedded executable or file system – we need a comprehensive way to present the extraction results to accurately reflect a firmware image’s structure.

**How the Extractor Works**

The firmware analysis extractor identifies and decompresses data found within firmware images. There are multiple types of extractors, one for each type of file. For a full list of file formats that firmware analysis supports, check [Firmware analysis Frequently Asked Questions](firmware-analysis-faq.md).

For example, a `ZipArchive` extractor would extract a `ZipArchive` file. The extractor extracts the image as it sits on the disk in your system, and you will need to correlate the file path to the structure of files on your build environment. When you upload your firmware images to the firmware analysis service, the extractor recursively extracts the image until it cannot extract further. This means that the original firmware image is decompressed into individual files, and each individual file is sent again to the extractor to see if they can be further decompressed. This repeats until the extractor cannot decompress further.

Sometimes, there may be numerous files concatenated into one. Extractor will identify that there are numerous files in that one file, and use the appropriate extractor to extract each file, then put each file into its own respective directory. This means that if there were four files that were compiled with `GZip`, and they were concatenated into one file, extractor will identify that there are four `GZip` files at that level of extraction. Extractor will put the first `GZip` file into a directory named `GZipExtractor/1`, the second into a directory named `GZipExtractor/2`, and so on.

## Interpret File Paths Created by the Extractor

In the firmware analysis service, the SBOM view of the analysis results contains the file paths:

:::image type="content" source="media/extractor-paths/sbom-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of SBOM view in the firmware analysis results." lightbox="media/extractor-paths/sbom-view.png":::

Here is an example of a file path that might be seen in analysis results, and how to visualize the path in a file-system structure:

:::image type="content" source="media/extractor-paths/sample-path.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a sample file path by the extractor." lightbox="media/extractor-paths/sample-path.png":::

The following file-system structure is a visual representation of the SBOM file path:

:::image type="content" source="media/extractor-paths/sample-file-system-structure.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a sample file system structure." lightbox="media/extractor-paths/sample-file-system-structure.png":::

In this sample file path, a `ZipArchiveExtractor` extracted a `ZipArchive`, and it puts the contents into a directory named `ZipArchiveExtractor/1`. Again, the ‘1’ means that this was the first – and possibly, the only – `ZipArchive` file at this level of extraction. The extractor assigns a default name called `zip-root` to the `ZipArchive` file.

:::image type="content" source="media/extractor-paths/zip-root-in-file-system.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the zip-root in the file system." lightbox="media/extractor-paths/zip-root-in-file-system.png":::

> [!Note]
> Usually, you can assume that a subdirectory with the suffix `-root` is created by Extractor and does not actually exist in your environment. It is just a subdirectory created by Extractor to hold the contents of that file type.

Within `zip-root` is the `adhoc` file:

:::image type="content" source="media/extractor-paths/ziproot-adhoc-in-file-system.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the zip-root and adhoc files in the file system." lightbox="media/extractor-paths/ziproot-adhoc-in-file-system.png":::

Within the `adhoc` file is the `lede-17.01.4-arc770-generic-nsim-initramfs.elf` file:

:::image type="content" source="media/extractor-paths/adhoc-lede-in-file-system.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the adhoc and lede files in the file system." lightbox="media/extractor-paths/adhoc-lede-in-file-system.png":::

Since the `lede…` file ends with `.extracted`, this means that there is something within this `.elf` file that needs to be extracted further. The next extractor used was a `CPIOArchiveExtractor`, which means that there was a `CPIOArchive` file system embedded in the `.elf` file. The contents of the `CPIOArchive` file were placed in a `cpio-root` subdirectory: 

:::image type="content" source="media/extractor-paths/cpio-root-in-file-system.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the cpio-root file in the file system." lightbox="media/extractor-paths/cpio-root-in-file-system.png":::

and within the `CPIOArchive` file, there was a `bin` file, and that `bin` file had a file named `busybox` within it:

:::image type="content" source="media/extractor-paths/cpio-bin-busybox-in-file-system.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the cpio-root, bin, and busybox files in the file system." lightbox="media/extractor-paths/cpio-bin-busybox-in-file-system.png":::

## Locate the Path in your Environment

Since the first extractor that was used was a `ZipArchiveExtractor`, this means that everything exists in a `Zip` file. Locate the `Zip` file, and within that, the full path on your environment would be `/adhoc/lede-17.01.4-arc770-generic-nsim-initramfs.elf.extracted/bin/busybox`. However, assume that you can only see into the first level of extraction – the `.elf` file. To see further, you would need your own extractor to extract beyond the first layer. This means that, tangibly, the file path to go to would be: `/adhoc/lede-17.01.4-arc770-generic-nsim-initramfs.elf`.

## Multiple Extractor Paths

In some cases, you may notice a `(+1)` or `(+2)` next to the file path:

:::image type="content" source="media/extractor-paths/multiple-paths.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an SBOM with multiple paths." lightbox="media/extractor-paths/multiple-paths.png":::

When you hover over the number, you’ll see a pop-up that looks like this:

:::image type="content" source="media/extractor-paths/pop-up-multiple-paths.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an SBOM's multiple paths." lightbox="media/extractor-paths/pop-up-multiple-paths.png":::

This means that the SBOM can be found at these two executable paths.
