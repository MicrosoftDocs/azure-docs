# Understand your Azure Marketplace payout reports

## Access and view your payout reports

While we transition to Dev Center some of your payout reports may be available in the Dev Center at https://dev.windows.com/en-us while others may still be found in Publishing Portal at https://publish.windowsazure.com.

Payout reporting will now be available in **Dev Center** for any Marketplace offerings that are associated with modern payouts; this currently includes:
- VMs
- B+C offers
- Data and Dev Services offered under EA

Payout reporting will still be in **Publishing Portal** for:
- Data and Dev Services offered under Web Direct (which still uses the legacy payout system).

Reports are available 45 days after the close of the quarter and are calculated after any refunds.

### Access payout reports in Dev Center
