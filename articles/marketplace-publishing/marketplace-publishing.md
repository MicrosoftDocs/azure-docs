# Microsoft Azure Marketplace Publishing

This information is provided to help you publish your software solution into the Azure Marketplace for other Azure customers to purchase.

## Getting Started
The first thing you would want to do as a publisher is to define out what kind of solution your company is offering. Azure Marketplace supports multiple different types of solutions and each of them require a slightly different set of work from you in order to successfully publish into the Marketplace.

** Types of solutions **

1. Data Services
2. Developer Services
3. Virtual Machines
4. Solution Templates

## Common Steps
Some steps are shared between the different types of solutions. This provides a short overview of what steps you will need to complete for any type of solution.

**Create Your Publisher Portal Account**  The Publisher Portal is how you will manage the details of your offer, including marketing copy, pricing, and categories. Log into https://publish.windowsazure.com with any Microsoft Account to create an account.

**Submit Microsoft Seller Application.**  If you wish to sell paid solution in the Azure Marketplace you must be an approved seller, with an approved seller account, tax profile and payout account.

**Push Your Offer to Staging.**  In order to test how your offer will look and work in the Azure Marketplace, we allow you to push your offer into a staging environment where only the Azure Subscription's you grant access will be able to see your offer. This allows you to fully walk through the experience your customers will have before making your offer available for everybody.

**Publish Your Offer to Production.** Once your offer is tested and working in Staging, you will use the Publishing Portal to publish your offer to production.  This will initiate a final review process by Azure Marketplace Store admins.  When your offer is approved it will be released to the live Azure Marketplace.
