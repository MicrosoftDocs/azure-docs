# Get Pre-Approved via Microsoft Azure Certification Program

This article provides instructions of how to become Microsoft Azure Certified. For a detailed overview of the Microsoft Azure Certification program and its benefits, visit [http://azure.com/certified](http://azure.com/certified)

> [AZURE.NOTE] The Azure Certification is only applicable if you are going to create a Virtual Machine, Solution Template and Developer Services for the Azure Marketplace. If you are not creating any of these artifacts, please skip this step and move forward to **Step 1**, [Microsoft Seller Account: Creation & Registration](marketplace-publishing-accounts-creation-registration.md)

## Getting started
1. The first step on the path to getting your application or service certified and onboarded to Azure Marketplace is to fill out the application form on the [Microsoft Azure Certified](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partner-program/) web page.

2. If you meet the basic eligibility criteria we will ask you to share some more details about your business and the application or service that you want to certify. When we have all the details from you we will review your application to ensure is it’s a good fit for Azure Marketplace and if your application is approved we will start working with you to onboard your solution to Azure Marketplace.

3. If you are working with a Partner Account Manager or a DX Partner Manager please request them to nominate you for the Azure Certification program. Or go to the [Microsoft Azure Certified](http://azure.com/certified) web page, click on **“Request Information”** and fill in the application form.

**"Sell-from" Countries**

> [AZURE.WARNING] In order to sell your services on Microsoft Azure Marketplace, your registered entity needs to be from one of the approved “sell from” countries. This restriction is for payout and taxation reasons. We are actively looking to expand this list of countries in the near future, so please stay tuned. For the complete list, please see section 1b of the document at link http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=526833.

## Next Step
Once you have received pre-approval from the Microsoft Azure Certification Program, you can proceed to **Step 1**, [Microsoft Seller Account: Creation & Registration](marketplace-publishing-accounts-creation-registration.md).
