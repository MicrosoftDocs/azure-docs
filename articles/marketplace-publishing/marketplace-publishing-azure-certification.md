# Get pre-approved via the Microsoft Azure Certified program
This article provides instructions on how to become Microsoft Azure Certified so that you can publish your solution into the Azure Marketplace and qualify for marketing benefits. For a detailed overview of the Microsoft Azure Certified program and its benefits, visit [http://azure.com/certified](http://azure.com/certified).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure certification is applicable only if you are going to create a virtual machine or a solution template for the Azure Marketplace.

## Getting started
1. The first step on the path to getting your solution certified and onboarded to the Azure Marketplace is to fill out the application form on the [Microsoft Azure Certified](https://createopportunity.azurewebsites.net) webpage.
2. If you meet the eligibility criteria and your application is approved, we will start working with you to onboard your solution to the Azure Marketplace.
3. If you are working with a Partner Account Manager or a DX Partner Manager, please ask them to nominate your solution for the Azure Certified program OR go to the [Microsoft Azure Certified](http://createopportunity.azurewebsites.net) webpage, fill out the application form and enter the email of your Partner Account Manager or DX Partner Manager in the Microsoft Sponsor Contact field.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **"Sell-from" countries** - in order to sell your services on the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, your registered entity needs to be from one of the approved “sell-from” countries. This restriction is for payout and taxation reasons. We are actively looking to expand this list of countries in the near future, so stay tuned. For the complete list, see section 1b of the [Azure Marketplace participation policies](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=526833).


## Next step
Once you have received pre-approval from the Microsoft Azure Certified program, you can proceed to [Register your Microsoft account as a Microsoft seller](marketplace-publishing-accounts-creation-registration.md).
