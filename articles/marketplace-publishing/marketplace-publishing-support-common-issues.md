# How to troubleshoot common Azure Marketplace publisher issues
This article explains how to resolve or get support for some common Marketplace scenarios.

## Credits and refunds

In some circumstances, you may need to request a credit or a refund on behalf of a customer.  Microsoft Support can help ensure that your customer’s credit and refund requests are considered and that a response is provided to you in due course.

The following shows you how to request a credit or refund on behalf of a customer.

> [AZURE.NOTE] If a customer or Azure reseller contacts Microsoft to request a refund or credit, we will apply the same policies that we use for our provision of Azure services. If our policies indicate that a refund or credit is due, we will proactively issue (and you authorize us to issue on your behalf) a refund or credit to the customer or Azure reseller, as applicable. If our policies do not indicate that a refund or credit is due, we may invite the customer or Azure reseller to contact you directly.

  ![1_RequestRefund][1]

  1. Navigate to the support pages.
  2. In the **Problem type** box, select **Managing Customers**.
  3. In the **Category** box, select **Approve or request a customer refund**.
  4. Click **Start request**.

  ![2_RequestRefund][2]

5. Provide contact information.
6. In the **What is the issue?** box, enter the following information:

    - The subscription ID of the impacted customer
    - The customer name
    - How much the credit should be for
    - The period of the credit
    - The bill date of that period
    - The reason for the credit

You will then receive an acknowledgement email within 24 hours that we have received your information. After a decision has been made in relation to your request, you will be informed of the outcome.

## Customer subscription validation

In some circumstances, you may need to validate the subscription details for one of your customers. You can contact Microsoft Support to help with this. Microsoft Support will help to confirm that a subscription ID and billing address belong to a known customer.

  ![subscriptionvalidation][3]

- A customer may contact you requesting support.
- You may not know how to validate that a customer is a genuine customer for an offer.
- You can log a support request to request customer subscription validation.
- You will need to provide a customer subscription ID and billing address.
- Microsoft will contact you to provide confirmation that the billing address and subscription ID are known to us.


## How do I update my publisher profile?

**1. Sign in to the Windows Dev Center**.

- Open a new Chrome Incognito or Internet Explorer InPrivate browsing session to ensure that you’re not signed in to a personal account.

![inprivate][4]
