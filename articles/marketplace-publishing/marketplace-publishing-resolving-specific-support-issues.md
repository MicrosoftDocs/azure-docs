# Troubleshoot common publishing problems in the Azure Marketplace

This article will explain how to resolve or get support for some common Marketplace scenarios, as follows:

- Request a credit or refund
- Validate a customer
- Update a publisher profile
- Add or delete Administrators from a publisher account

## Credits and refunds

In some circumstances, you may need to request a credit or a refund on behalf of a customer. Microsoft Support can help ensure your customer’s credit and/ or refund requests are considered and a response provided back to you in due course*.

The following shows you to how request a credit or refund on behalf of a customer.

**Note:** *If a Customer or Azure Reseller contacts us to request a refund or credit, we will apply the same policies that we use for our provision of Azure services. If our policies indicate that a refund or credit is due, we will proactively issue, and you authorize us to issue on your behalf, a refund or credit to the Customer or Azure Reseller, as applicable. If our policies do not indicate that a refund or credit is due, we may invite the Customer or Azure Reseller to contact you directly.*

1. Navigate to the support pages
2. Select 'Managing Customers'
3. Select 'Approve or request a customer refund'

    - The period of the credit
    - The bill date of that period
    - The reason for the credit

You will then receive an acknowledgement email that we have received the information you have provided within 24 hours. Once a decision has been made in relation to your request, you will be informed of the outcome.

## Customer subscription validation
