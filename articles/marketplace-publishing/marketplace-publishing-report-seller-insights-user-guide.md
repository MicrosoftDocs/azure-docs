# How to use the Microsoft Azure Marketplace Seller Insights Portal
## Onboarding

>[!NOTE]
>Administrators only.

### Overview of roles

![Type of account][5]

Use the Seller Insights Portal administrator to add users, edit users, and delete users.

A Seller Insights Portal user can view all data that is available to your organization.

Administrators and users are required to authenticate by using a valid Microsoft account (LiveID http://signup.live.com), or your company’s account. Ensure that the new account ID is associated with a monitored mailbox.

### Invitation to activate your account

Ideally, before signing in to the Seller Insights Portal, the administrator should identify the accounts of the individuals they want to set up as users. Accounts can be a Microsoft account or a company account.

To activate your service, the administrator should go to the URL that is listed in the invitation email (https://reports.azure.com).

>[!NOTE]
>If the administrator email is listed as a Microsoft account and you've not created a Microsoft account that is associated with the email address from which you received the email, you will need to create the account before you sign in. To create the account, go to https://signup.live.command.

### Sign in to the Seller Insights Portal

2. Enter the administrator email address and password.
3. Click the **Sign In** button.
4. Begin to administer your account. Add users, set permissions, and edit users.

## Signing in

Your administrator should advise you through email that your account is created, and share the URL for the Seller Insights Portal with you (https://reports.azure.com).

>[!NOTE]
>The administrator is the owner of the account that publishes solutions to the Azure Marketplace. The owner of this account can provide access to others.  

You can sign in to the Seller Insights Portal by using a personal Microsoft account, or by using a company account. The kind of account depends on what your administrator sets up in your profile. Your administrator should advise you about the account you'll use.

## Resetting a password

***Account and password validation***

1. ***Validate that the account you're using is registered and the password does not work.*** If you enter an account that has been registered in the Azure Active Directory, it will automatically prompt you to choose how to sign in with the account - either a Work or School (Organizational account) or a Personal LiveID account.
2. Go to https://reports.azure.com and sign out of any account you may be signed in with, or open it within a private window to ensure no other accounts are signed in.
3. Enter the Publisher email address without entering a password. It will redirect to ***Step 4*** if it's been registered in Azure Active Directory (Admin accounts are registered, as are any Organizational accounts setup by the Admin account).
4. Choose "Work or school account“. Work or school accounts (‘Organizational accounts’) are setup by companies that have registered with Azure; Personal accounts (‘LiveID’) accounts are personal accounts that have been registered with Microsoft.
 * Note that it is possible that a user previously setup a LiveID account using their company email address, the company later onboarded to Azure, and the same email address was registered as an Organizational account. This means this user can have a LiveID account with the password they used to create the LiveID, and an Organizational account with a separate password used by the company.
5. For the Seller Insights Portal, when selecting "Work or school account“ please ensure you are using your Organizational Account/Password combination and not a LiveID/Password combination.
6. For an Organizational Account, this will re-direct to the Publisher login page.
7. From here, validate that the password for the Organizational account works or does not work. If it does not work, continue to ***Password reset***.

***Password reset***

Try to reset your password by using the Self-Service Password Reset wizard following the links below.

>[!NOTE]
>Note: For Organizational accounts setup by Administrator account, if the Admin turned on the capability to let you to reset your own password, you will be able to reset your own password. Otherwise, the password reset form gives you the option to contact your Admin.

****Microsoft account (Live ID): https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx****
![Password reset Microsoft account][3]

****Work or school account (Organization ID): https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com/****
