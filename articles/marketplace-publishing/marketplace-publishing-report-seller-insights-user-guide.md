# How to use the Microsoft Azure Marketplace Seller Insights Portal
## Onboarding

>[!NOTE]
>Administrators only.


### Overview of roles

This section will show you how to access the Seller Insights Portal for the first time.


![Type of account][5]

Use the Seller Insights Portal administrator to add users, edit users, and delete users.

A Seller Insights Portal user can view all data that is available to your organization.

Administrators and users are required to authenticate by using a valid Microsoft account (LiveID http://signup.live.com), or your company’s account. Ensure that the new account ID is associated with a monitored mailbox.

### Invitation to activate your account

Ideally, before signing in to the Seller Insights Portal, the administrator should identify the accounts of the individuals they want to set up as users. Accounts can be a Microsoft account or a company account.

To activate your service, the administrator should go to the URL that is listed in the invitation email (https://reports.azure.com).

>[!NOTE]
>If the administrator email is listed as a Microsoft account and you have not created a Microsoft account that is associated with the email address from which you received the invitation, you'll need to create the account before you sign in. To create the account, go to https://signup.live.command.


### Sign in to the Seller Insights Portal

1. Sign in to the Seller Insights Portal by clicking the URL in the email sent to you.
2. Enter the administrator email address and password.
3. Click the **Sign In** button.
4. Begin to administer your account. Add users, set permissions, and edit users.
5. Ensure your users have the URL for the Seller Insights Portal.

## Sign in

Your administrator should advise you through email that your account is created, and share the URL for the Seller Insights Portal with you (https://reports.azure.com).

>[!NOTE]
>The administrator is the owner of the account that actually publishes solutions to the Azure Marketplace.  The owner of this account can provide access to others.  If you have access to Publishing Portal as a co-administrator you can find the administrator address by following these steps:
>1. Sign in to Publishing Portal.
>2. Click the **Publishers** tab.
>3. Open the publisher in question (usually there is just one).
>4. Click **Administrators** on the lower left.
>5. The administrator email address that you're looking for is labeled, *Owner*.


You can sign in to the Seller Insights Portal by using a personal Microsoft account, or by using a company account. The kind of account depends on what your administrator sets up in your profile. Your administrator should advise you about the account you'll use.

## Reset a password

**Account and password validation**

1. *Validate that the account you're using is registered and the password doesn't work.* If you enter an account that is registered in Azure Active Directory, it automatically prompts you to choose how to sign in with the account. You'll use a work or school (Organizational account), or a personal Windows LiveID account.
2. Go to https://reports.azure.com and sign out of any account that you may be signed in with. You can also open it within a private window to ensure no other accounts are signed in.
3. Enter the Publisher email address, but don't enter a password. It will redirect to *Step 4* if it's registered in Azure Active Directory.

  >[!NOTE]
  >Administrator accounts are registered. Organizational accounts that are set up by the administrator account are also registered.

4. Choose **Work or school account**. Work or school accounts (also called Organizational accounts) are set up by companies that are registered with Azure. Personal accounts (also called LiveID accounts) are personal accounts that are registered with Microsoft.

  >[!NOTE]
  >It's possible that a user set up a LiveID account by using their company email address. In this scenario, the company later onboards to Azure, and the same email address is registered as an Organizational account. This means this user can have a LiveID account with the password that they used to create the LiveID account. The user can also have an Organizational account with a separate password that is used by the company.

5. For the Seller Insights Portal, when you select **Work or school account**, ensure that you use your Organizational account password combination, and not a LiveID password combination.
6. An Organizational account redirects to the publisher login page.
7. From here, validate that the password for the Organizational account works. If it doesn't work, continue to the "Password reset" section of this article.



**Password reset**

Try to reset your password by using the following links.

>[!NOTE]
>For Organizational accounts that are set up by the administrator account, if the administrator turned on the capability to let you reset your own password, you will be able to reset your own password. Otherwise, the password reset form gives you the option to contact your administrator.

**Microsoft account (Live ID): https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx**
![Password reset Microsoft account][3]

**Work or school account (Organization ID): https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com/**
![Password reset work or school account][4]
