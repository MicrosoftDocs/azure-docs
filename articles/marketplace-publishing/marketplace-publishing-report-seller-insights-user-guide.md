# How to use the Microsoft Azure Marketplace Seller Insights Portal
##Onboarding

>[!NOTE]
>Administrators only

This section will show you how to access the Seller Insights Portal for the first time.

###Overview of roles

![type of account][5]

The Seller Insights Portal Administrator has the ability to add users, edit users, and delete users.

A Seller Insights Portal User has the ability to view all data which is available to your organization.

Both Administrators and Users are required to authenticate using a valid Microsoft Account (LiveID http://signup.live.com) or your company’s account. Please ensure that the ID entered is associated with a monitored mailbox.

###Invitation to activate your account

Ideally, before logging into the Seller Insights Portal, the Administrator should identify the accounts of the individuals they want to set up as users. Accounts can be Microsoft Accounts or Company Accounts.

To activate your service, the Administrator should navigate to the URL listed in the invitation email (https://reports.azure.com)

>[!NOTE]
>If the Administrator email is listed as a Microsoft Account and you have not created a Microsoft Account associated with the email address from which you received the invitation, you will need to do so before sign on by navigating to https://signup.live.command, utilizing this email address when creating your Microsoft Account.

###Sign in to the Portal

1. Sign in to the Seller Insights Portal by clicking on the URL in the email sent to you.
2. Enter the Administrator email address and password.
3. Click the Sign In button.
4. Begin administering your account – add Users, set permissions, and edit Users.
5. Be sure to provide your Users with the URL for the Portal.

![sign in page][6]

##Signing in

Your Administrator should advise you via email that your account has been created, and share the URL for the Seller Insights Portal with you (https://reports.azure.com).

>[!NOTE]
>The administrator is the owner of the account that actually publishes solutions to the Azure Marketplace.  The owner of this account can provide access to others.  If you have access to Publishing Portal as a Co-administrator you can find the administrator address by following these steps:
>1. Log in to Publishng Portal
>2. Click on the Publishers tab
>3. Open the publisher in question (usually there is just one)
>4. Click on "Administrators" on the lower left
>5. The administrator email address that you are looking for is labeled, "Owner."


You can log in to the Seller Insights Portal using a personal Microsoft account or using a company account depending upon which account your Administrator has used when setting up your profile.  Your Administrator should advise you which account to use.

##Resetting a password

***Account and password validation***

1. ***Validate that the account you're using is registered and the password does not work.*** If you enter an account that has been registered in the Azure Active Directory, it will automatically prompt you to choose how to login with the account - either a Work or School (Organizational account) or a Personal LiveID account.
2. Navigate to https://reports.azure.com and log out of any account you may be logged in with, or open it within a private window to ensure no other accounts are logged in.
3. Enter the Publisher email address without entering a password. It will redirect to ***Step 4*** if it's been registered in Azure Active Directory (Admin accounts are registered, as are any Organizational accounts setup by the Admin account).
4. Choose "Work or school account“. Work or school accounts (‘Organizational accounts’) are setup by companies that have registered with Azure; Personal accounts (‘LiveID’) accounts are personal accounts that have been registered with Microsoft.
 * Note that it is possible that a user previously setup a LiveID account using their company email address, the company later onboarded to Azure, and the same email address was registered as an Organizational account. This means this user can have a LiveID account with the password they used to create the LiveID, and an Organizational account with a separate password used by the company.
5. For the Seller Insights Portal, when selecting "Work or school account“ please ensure you are using your Organizational Account/Password combination and not a LiveID/Password combination.
6. For an Organizational Account, this will re-direct to the Publisher login page.
7. From here, validate that the password for the Organizational account works or does not work. If it does not work, continue to ***Password reset***.

***Password reset***

Try to reset your password by using the Self-Service Password Reset wizard following the links below.

>[!NOTE]
>Note: For Organizational accounts setup by Administrator account, if the Admin turned on the capability to let you to reset your own password, you will be able to reset your own password. Otherwise, the password reset form gives you the option to contact your Admin.

****Microsoft account (Live ID): https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx****
![password reset Microsoft account][3]
