## <a name="what-is"> </a>What is Azure Automation?

[Azure Automation](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/automation/) is an Azure service for simplifying cloud management through process automation. Using Azure Automation, long-running, manual, error-prone, and frequently repeated tasks can be automated to increase reliability, efficiency, and time to value for your organization.

Azure Automation provides a highly-reliable and highly-available workflow execution engine that scales to meet your needs as your organization grows. In Azure Automation, processes can be kicked off manually, by 3rd-party systems, or at scheduled intervals so that tasks happen exactly when needed.

Lower operational overhead and free up IT / DevOps staff to focus on work that adds business value by moving your cloud management tasks to be run automatically by Azure Automation. 


## <a name="scenarios"> </a>How can Azure Automation help manage Azure virtual machines?

Virtual Machines can be managed by using the PowerShell cmdlets that are available in the Azure PowerShell tools. Azure Automation has these VM PowerShell cmdelts availble in the Automation service so that you can perform all of your management tasks within the service and also use other Azure cmdlets in the service to perform tasks across Azure services and other external systems you use to manage Virutal Machines.

Specific examples coming soon.
