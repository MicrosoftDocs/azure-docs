# Tutorial: Create approval-based workflows using Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption.md)]

This tutorial shows how to build an example workflow that automates an approval-based task by using Azure Logic Apps. This example specifically creates a Consumption logic app workflow that processes subscription requests for a mailing list that's managed by [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/).

The workflow starts with monitoring an email account for requests, sends received requests for approval, checks whether or not the request gets approval, adds approved members to the mailing list, and confirms whether or not new members get added to the list.

When you finish, your workflow looks like the following high level example:

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-mailing-list-subscriptions-workflow/overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows example Consumption high-level workflow." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-mailing-list-subscriptions-workflow/overview.png":::

> [!TIP]
>
> To learn more, you can ask Azure Copilot these questions:
>
> - *What's Azure Logic Apps?*
> - *What's a Consumption logic app workflow?*
>
> To find Azure Copilot, on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) toolbar, select **Copilot**.

You can create a similar workflow with a Standard logic app resource where some connector operations, such as Azure Blob Storage, are also available as built-in, service provider-based operations. However, the user experience and tutorial steps vary slightly from the Consumption version.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* A MailChimp account where you previously created a list named "test-members-ML" where your logic app can add email addresses for approved members. If you don't have an account, [sign up for a free account](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup/), and then learn [how to create a MailChimp list](https://us17.admin.mailchimp.com/lists/#).

* An email account in Office 365 Outlook or Outlook.com, which supports approval workflows. For other email providers, see [Connectors for Azure Logic Apps](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-logicapps-connectors).

  This tutorial uses Office 365 Outlook with a work or school account. If you use a different email account, the general steps stay the same, but the user experience might slightly differ. If you use Outlook.com, use your personal Microsoft account instead to sign in.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >
  > If you want to use the Gmail connector, only G-Suite business accounts can use this connector without restriction in logic app workflows. 
  > If you have a Gmail consumer account, you can use this connector with only specific Google-approved services, or you can 
  > [create a Google client app to use for authentication with your Gmail connector](/connectors/gmail/#authentication-and-bring-your-own-application). 
  > For more information, see [Data security and privacy policies for Google connectors in Azure Logic Apps](../connectors/connectors-google-data-security-privacy-policy.md).

* If your logic app workflow needs to communicate through a firewall that limits traffic to specific IP addresses, that firewall needs to allow access for *both* the [inbound](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#inbound) and [outbound](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#outbound) IP addresses used by Azure Logic Apps in the Azure region where your logic app resource exists. If your logic app also uses [managed connectors](../connectors/managed.md), such as the Office 365 Outlook connector or SQL connector, or uses [custom connectors](/connectors/custom-connectors/), the firewall also needs to allow access for *all* the [managed connector outbound IP addresses](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#outbound) in your logic app's Azure region.

## Create a Consumption logic app resource

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), sign in with your Azure account.

1. In the Azure portal search box, enter **logic app**, and select **Logic apps**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-build-scheduled-recurring-logic-app-workflow/find-select-logic-apps.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Azure portal search box with logic app entered and selected option for Logic apps." lightbox="media/tutorial-build-scheduled-recurring-logic-app-workflow/find-select-logic-apps.png":::

1. On the **Logic apps** page toolbar, select **Add**.

   The **Create Logic App** page appears and shows the following options:

   [!INCLUDE [logic-apps-host-plans](includes/logic-apps-host-plans.md)]

1. On the **Create Logic App** page, select **Consumption (Multi-tenant)**.

1. On the **Basics** tab, provide the following information about your logic app resource:

   | Property | Required | Value | Description |
   |----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Subscription** | Yes | <*Azure-subscription-name*> | Your Azure subscription name. <br><br>This example uses **Pay-As-You-Go**. |
   | **Resource Group** | Yes | <*Azure-resource-group-name*> | The [Azure resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md#terminology) where you create your logic app and related resources. This name must be unique across regions and can contain only letters, numbers, hyphens (**-**), underscores (**_**), parentheses (**()**), and periods (**.**). <br><br>This example creates a resource group named **LA-MailingList-RG**. |
   | **Logic App name** | Yes | <*logic-app-resource-name*> | Your logic app resource name, which must be unique across regions and can contain only letters, numbers, hyphens (**-**), underscores (**_**), parentheses (**()**), and periods (**.**). <br><br>This example creates a logic app resource named **LA-MailingList**. |
   | **Region** | Yes | <*Azure-region*> | The Azure datacenter region for your app. <br><br>This example uses **West US**. |
   | **Enable log analytics** | Yes | **No** | Change this option only when you want to enable diagnostic logging. For this tutorial, keep the default selection. <br><br>**Note**: This option is available only with Consumption logic apps. |

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Availability zones are automatically enabled for new and existing Consumption logic app workflows in 
   > [Azure regions that support availability zones](../reliability/availability-zones-region-support.md). 
   > For more information, see [Reliability in Azure Functions](../reliability/reliability-functions.md#availability-zone-support) and 
   > [Protect logic apps from region failures with zone redundancy and availability zones](set-up-zone-redundancy-availability-zones.md).

   After you finish, your settings look similar to the following example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-mailing-list-subscriptions-workflow/create-logic-app-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Azure portal and creation page for multitenant Consumption logic app and details." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-mailing-list-subscriptions-workflow/create-logic-app-settings.png":::

1. When you finish, select **Review + create**. After Azure validates the information about your logic app resource, select **Create**.

1. After Azure deploys your logic app resource, select **Go to resource**. Or, find and select your logic app resource by using the Azure search box.

## Add a trigger to check emails

The following steps add a trigger that waits for incoming emails that have subscription requests.

1. On the logic app menu, under **Development Tools**, select **Logic app designer**.

1. On the workflow designer, [follow these general steps to add the **Office 365 Outlook** trigger named **When a new email arrives**](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-trigger).

   The Office 365 Outlook connector requires that you sign in with a Microsoft work or school account. If you're using a personal Microsoft account, use the Outlook.com connector.

1. Sign in to your email account, which creates a connection between your workflow and your email account.

1. In the trigger information box, from the **Advanced parameters** list, add the following parameters, if they don't appear, and provide the following information:

   | Parameter | Value | Description |
   |-----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Importance** | **Any** | Specifies the importance level of the email that you want. |
   | **Folder** | **Inbox** | The email folder to check. |
   | **Subject Filter** | **subscribe-test-members-ML** | Specifies the text to find in the email subject and filters emails based on the subject line. |

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > When you select inside some edit boxes, the options for the dynamic content list (lightning icon) 
   > and expression editor (function icon) appear, which you can ignore for now.

   For more information about this trigger's properties, see the [Office 365 Outlook connector reference](/connectors/office365/) or the [Outlook.com connector reference](/connectors/outlook/).

   When you finish, the trigger looks similar to the following example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-mailing-list-subscriptions-workflow/trigger-information.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow with trigger named When a new email arrives." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-mailing-list-subscriptions-workflow/trigger-information.png":::

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

Your workflow is now live but doesn't do anything other check your emails. Next, add an action that responds when the trigger fires.

## Add an action to send approval email

The following steps add an action that sends an email to approve or reject the request.

1. On the designer, under the trigger named **When a new email arrives**, [follow these general steps to add the **Office 365 Outlook** action named **Send approval email**](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

1. For the **Send approval email** action, provide the following information:

   | Property | Required | Value | Description |
   |----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **To** | Yes | <*approver-email-address*> | The approver's email address. For testing, use your own address. |
   | **Subject** | No | <*email-subject*> | A descriptive email subject. <br><br>This example uses **Approve member request for test-members-ML**. |

   For more information about these properties, see the [Office 365 Outlook connector reference](/connectors/office365/) or the [Outlook.com connector reference](/connectors/outlook/).

   When you finish, the **Send approval email** action looks like the following example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-mailing-list-subscriptions-workflow/add-member-failure.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows example email for failed subscription." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-mailing-list-subscriptions-workflow/add-member-failure.png":::

  > [!TIP]
  >
  > If you don't get any emails, check your email's junk folder. Otherwise, 
  > if you're unsure that your logic app ran correctly, see 
  > [Troubleshoot your logic app](../logic-apps/logic-apps-diagnosing-failures.md).

Congratulations, you created and ran a logic app workflow that integrates information across Azure, Microsoft services, and other SaaS apps!

## Clean up resources

Your workflow continues running until you disable or delete the logic app resource. When you no longer need this sample, delete the resource group that contains your logic app and related resources.
