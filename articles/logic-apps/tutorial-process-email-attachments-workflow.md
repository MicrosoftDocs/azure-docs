# Tutorial: Create workflows that process emails using Azure Logic Apps, Azure Functions, and Azure Storage

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption.md)]

This tutorial shows how to build an example workflow that integrates Azure Functions and Azure Storage by using Azure Logic Apps. This example specifically creates a Consumption logic app workflow that handles incoming emails and any attachments, analyzes the email content using Azure Functions, saves the content to Azure storage, and sends email for reviewing the content.

When you finish, your workflow looks like the following high level example:

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows example Consumption high-level workflow." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/overview.png":::

> [!TIP]
>
> To learn more, you can ask Azure Copilot these questions:
>
> - *What's Azure Logic Apps?*
> - *What's Azure Functions?*
> - *What's Azure Storage?*
> - *What's a Consumption logic app workflow?*
>
> To find Azure Copilot, on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) toolbar, select **Copilot**.

You can create a similar workflow with a Standard logic app resource where some connector operations, such as Azure Blob Storage, are also available as built-in, service provider-based operations. However, the user experience and tutorial steps vary slightly from the Consumption version.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An email account from an email provider supported by Azure Logic Apps, such as Office 365 Outlook, Outlook.com, or Gmail. For other supported email providers, see [Connectors for Azure Logic Apps](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-logicapps-connectors).

  This example uses Office 365 Outlook with a work or school account. If you use a different email account, the general steps stay the same, but the user experience might slightly differ. If you use Outlook.com, use your personal Microsoft account instead to sign in.

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > If you want to use the Gmail connector, only G-Suite business accounts can use this connector without restriction in logic app workflows. 
  > If you have a Gmail consumer account, you can use this connector with only specific Google-approved services, or you can 
  > [create a Google client app to use for authentication with your Gmail connector](/connectors/gmail/#authentication-and-bring-your-own-application). 
  > For more information, see [Data security and privacy policies for Google connectors in Azure Logic Apps](../connectors/connectors-google-data-security-privacy-policy.md).

* Download and install the [free Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](https://storageexplorer.com/). This tool helps you check that your storage container is correctly set up.

* If your workflow needs to communicate through a firewall that limits traffic to specific IP addresses, that firewall needs to allow access for *both* the [inbound](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#inbound) and [outbound](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#outbound) IP addresses used by Azure Logic Apps in the Azure region where your logic app resource exists. If your workflow also uses [managed connectors](../connectors/managed.md), such as the Office 365 Outlook connector or SQL connector, or uses [custom connectors](/connectors/custom-connectors/), the firewall also needs to allow access for *all* the [managed connector outbound IP addresses](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#outbound) in your logic app's Azure region.

## Set up storage to save attachments

The following steps set up [Azure storage](../storage/common/storage-introduction.md) so that you can store incoming emails and attachments as blobs.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), sign in with your Azure account credentials.

1. [Follow these steps to create a storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=azure-portal) unless you already have one.

   On the **Basics** tab, provide the following information:

   | Property | Required | Value | Description |
   |----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Subscription** | Yes | <*Azure-subscription-name*> | Your Azure subscription name. <br><br>This example uses **Pay-As-You-Go**. |
   | **Resource group** | Yes | <*Azure-resource-group*> | The name for the [Azure resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md) used to organize and manage related resources. <br><br>**Note**: A resource group exists inside a specific region. Although the items in this tutorial might not be available in all regions, try to use the same region when possible. <br><br>This example uses **LA-Tutorial-RG**. |
   | **Storage account name** | Yes | <*Azure-storage-account-name*> | Your unique storage account name, which must have 3-24 characters and can contain only lowercase letters and numbers. <br><br>This example uses **attachmentstorageacct**. |
   | **Region** | Yes | <*Azure-region*> | The Azure data region for your storage account. <br><br>This example uses **West US**. |
   | **Primary service** | No | <*Azure-storage-service*> | The primary storage type to use in your storage account. See [Review options for storing data in Azure](../storage/common/storage-introduction.md#review-options-for-storing-data-in-azure). |
   | **Performance** | Yes | - **Standard** <br>- **Premium** | This setting specifies the data types supported and media for storing data. See [Storage account overview](../storage/common/storage-account-overview.md). <br><br>This example uses **Standard**. |
   | **Redundancy** | Yes | - **Locally-redundant storage** <br>- **Geo-redundant storage (GRS)** | This setting enables storing multiple copies of your data as protection from planned and unplanned events. For more information, see [Azure Storage redundancy](../storage/common/storage-redundancy.md). <br><br>This example uses **Geo-redundant storage (GRS)**. |

   To create your storage account, you can also use [Azure PowerShell](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=powershell) or [Azure CLI](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=azure-cli).

1. When you're ready, select **Review + create**. After Azure validates the information about your storage account resource, select **Create**.

1. After Azure deploys your storage account, select **Go to resource**. Or, find and select your storage account by using the Azure search box.

1. Get the storage account's access key by following these steps:

   1. On the storage account menu, under **Security + networking**, select **Access keys**.

   1. Copy the storage account name and **key1**. Save these values somewhere safe to use later.

   To get your storage account's access key, you can also use
   [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/module/az.storage/get-azstorageaccountkey)
   or [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/storage/account/keys).

1. Create a blob storage container for your email attachments.

   1. On the storage account menu, under **Data storage**, select **Containers**.

   1. On the **Containers** page toolbar, select **Container**.

   1. On the **New container** pane, provide the following information:
   
      | Property | Value | Description |
      |----------|-------|-------------|
      | **Name** | **attachments** | The container name. |
      | **Anonymous access level** | **Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs)** |

   1. Select **Create**.

   After you finish, the containers list now shows the new storage container.

To create a storage container, you can also use [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/module/az.storage/new-azstoragecontainer) or [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/storage/container#az-storage-container-create).

Next, connect Storage Explorer to your storage account.

## Set up Storage Explorer

The following steps connect Storage Explorer to your storage account so to you can confirm that your workflow correctly saves attachments as blobs in your storage container.

1. Launch Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer. Sign in with your Azure account.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > If no prompt appears, on the Storage Explorer activity bar, select **Account Management** (profile icon).

1. In the **Select Azure Environment** window, select your Azure environment, and then select **Next**.

   This example continues by selecting global, multitenant **Azure**.

1. In the browser window that appears, sign in with your Azure account.

1. Return to Storage Explorer and the **Account Management** window. Confirm that the correct Microsoft Entra tenant and subscription are selected.

1. On the Storage Explorer activity bar, select **Open Connect Dialog**. 

1. In the **Select Resource** window, select **Storage account or service**.

1. In the **Select Connection Method** window, select **Account name and key** > **Next**.

1. In the **Connect to Azure Storage** window, provide the following information:

   | Property | Value |
   |----------|-------|
   | **Display name** | A friendly name for your connection |
   | **Account name** | Your storage account name |
   | **Account key** | The access key that you previously saved |

1. For **Storage domain**, confirm that **Azure (core.windows.net)** is selected, and select **Next**.

1. On the **Summary** window, confirm your connection information, and select **Connect**.

   Storage Explorer creates the connection. Your storage account appears in the Explorer window under **Emulator & Attached** > **Storage Accounts**.

1. To find your blob storage container, under **Storage Accounts**, expand your storage account, which is **attachmentstorageacct** for this example. Under **Blob Containers** where you find the **attachments** container, for example:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/storage-explorer-check-contianer.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Storage Explorer - find storage container.":::

Next, create an Azure function app and a function that removes HTML from content.

## Create a function app

The following steps create an Azure function that your workflow calls to remove HTML from incoming email.

1. Before you can create a function, [create a function app by selecting the **Consumption** plan](../azure-functions/functions-create-function-app-portal.md) and following these steps:

   1. On the **Basics** tab, provide the following information:

      | Property | Required | Value | Description |
      |----------|----------|-------|-------------|
      | **Subscription** | Yes | <*Azure-subscription-name*> | The same Azure subscription that you previously used for your storage account. |
      | **Resource Group** | Yes | <*Azure-resource-group-name*> | The same Azure resource group that you previously used for your storage account. <br><br>For this example, select **LA-Tutorial-RG**. |
      | **Function App name** | Yes | <*function-app-name*> | Your function app name, which must be unique across Azure regions and can contain only letters (case insensitive), numbers (0-9), and hyphens (**-**). <br><br>This example already uses **CleanTextFunctionApp**, so provide a different name, such as **MyCleanTextFunctionApp-<*your-name*>** |
      | **Runtime stack** | Yes | <*programming-language*> | The runtime for your preferred function programming language. For C# and F# functions, select **.NET**. <br><br>This example uses **.NET**. <br><br>In-portal editing is only available for the following languages: <br><br>- JavaScript <br>- PowerShell <br>- TypeScript <br>- C# script <br><br>You must [locally develop](../azure-functions/functions-develop-local.md#local-development-environments) any C# class library, Java, and Python functions. |
      | **Version** | Yes | <*version-number*> | Select the version for your installed runtime. |
      | **Region** | Yes | <*Azure-region*> | The same region that you previously used. <br><br>This example uses **West US**. |
      | **Operating System** | Yes | <*your-operating-system*> | An operating system is preselected for you based on your runtime stack selection, but you can select the operating system that supports your favorite function programming language. In-portal editing is only supported on Windows. <br><br>This example selects **Windows**. |

   1. Select **Next: Storage**. On the **Storage** tab, provide the following information:

      | Property | Required | Value | Description |
      |----------|----------|-------|-------------|
      | **Storage account** | Yes | <*Azure-storage-account-name*> | Create a storage account for your function app to use. Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and can contain only lowercase letters and numbers. <br><br>This example uses **cleantextfunctionstorageacct**. <br><br>**Note:** This storage account contains your function apps and differs from your previously created storage account for email attachments. You can also use an existing account, which must meet the [storage account requirements](../azure-functions/storage-considerations.md#storage-account-requirements). |

   1. When you finish, select **Review + create**. After Azure validates the provided information, select **Create**.

   1. After Azure deploys the function app resource, select **Go to resource**.

## Create function to remove HTML

The following steps create an Azure function in C# that removes HTML from each incoming email by using the sample code snippet. This function makes the email content cleaner and easier to process. You can call this function from your workflow.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your function app, if not already open.

1. To run your function later in the Azure portal, set up your function app to explicitly accept requests from the portal. On the function app menu, under **API**, select **CORS**. Under **Allowed Origins**, enter **`https://portal.azure.com`**, and select **Save**.

1. On the function app menu, select **Overview**. On the **Functions** tab, select **Create**.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > If you don't see the **Create** button, [select an option to create your function locally](../azure-functions/functions-create-function-app-portal.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp#create-your-functions-locally).

1. [Follow these generic steps to create your function in C# using the **HTTP trigger** template](../azure-functions/functions-create-function-app-portal.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp#create-function), and provide the following information for your function:

   | Parameter | Value |
   |-----------|-------|
   | **Function name** | **RemoveHTMLFunction** |
   | **Authorization level** | **Function** |

1. On the **Code + Test** tab, enter the following C# sample code, which removes HTML and returns the results to the caller.

   ```csharp
   #r "Newtonsoft.Json"

   using System.Net;
   using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
   using Microsoft.Extensions.Primitives;
   using Newtonsoft.Json;
   using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

   public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest req, ILogger log)
   {
      log.LogInformation("HttpWebhook triggered");

      // Parse query parameter
      string emailBodyContent = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();

      // Replace HTML with other characters
      string updatedBody = Regex.Replace(emailBodyContent, "<.*?>", string.Empty);
      updatedBody = updatedBody.Replace("\\r\\n", " ");
      updatedBody = updatedBody.Replace(@"&nbsp;", " ");

      // Return cleaned text
      return (ActionResult)new OkObjectResult(new {updatedBody});
   }
   ```

1. When you finish, on the **Code + Test** toolbar, select **Save**, and then select **Test/Run**.

1. On the **Test/Run** pane, on the **Input** tab, in the **Body** box, enter following sample input, and select **Run**:

   **`{"name": "<p><p>Testing my function</br></p></p>"}`**

   Your function's output looks like the following result:

   **`{"updatedBody": "{\"name\": \"Testing my function\"}"}`**

After you confirm that your function works, create your logic app resource and workflow. Although this tutorial shows how to create a function that removes HTML from emails, Azure Logic Apps also provides an **HTML to Text** connector.

## Create a Consumption logic app resource

1. In the Azure portal search box, enter **logic app**, and select **Logic apps**.

1. On the **Logic apps** page toolbar, select **Add**.

   The **Create Logic App** page appears and shows the following options:

   [!INCLUDE [logic-apps-host-plans](includes/logic-apps-host-plans.md)]

1. On the **Create Logic App** page, select **Consumption (Multi-tenant)**.

1. On the **Basics** tab, provide the following information about your logic app resource:

   | Parameter | Required | Value | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Subscription** | Yes | <*Azure-subscription-name*> | The same Azure subscription that you previously used. |
   | **Resource Group** | Yes | **LA-Tutorial-RG** | The same Azure resource group that you previously used. |
   | **Logic App name** | Yes | <*logic-app-name*> | Your logic app resource name, which must be unique across regions and can contain only letters, numbers, hyphens (**-**), underscores (**_**), parentheses (**()**), and periods (**.**). <br><br>This example creates a logic app resource named **LA-ProcessAttachment**. A Consumption logic app and workflow always have the same name. |
   | **Region** | Yes | **West US** | The same region that you previously used. |
   | **Enable log analytics** | Yes | **No** | Change this option only when you want to enable diagnostic logging. For this tutorial, keep the default selection. <br><br>**Note**: This option is available only with Consumption logic apps. |

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Availability zones are automatically enabled for new and existing Consumption logic app workflows in 
   > [Azure regions that support availability zones](../reliability/availability-zones-region-support.md). 
   > For more information, see [Reliability in Azure Functions](../reliability/reliability-functions.md#availability-zone-support) and 
   > [Protect logic apps from region failures with zone redundancy and availability zones](set-up-zone-redundancy-availability-zones.md).

1. When you're ready, select **Review + create**. After Azure validates the information about your logic app resource, select **Create**.

1. After Azure deploys your logic app resource, select **Go to resource**. Or, find and select your logic app resource by using the Azure search box.

## Add a trigger to monitor incoming email

The following steps add a trigger that waits for incoming emails that have attachments.

1. On the logic app menu, under **Development Tools**, select **Logic app designer**.

1. On the workflow designer, [follow these general steps to add the **Office 365 Outlook** trigger named **When a new email arrives**](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-trigger).

   The Office 365 Outlook connector requires that you sign in with a Microsoft work or school account. If you're using a personal Microsoft account, use the Outlook.com connector.

1. Sign in to your email account, which creates a connection between your workflow and your email account.

1. In the trigger information box, from the **Advanced parameters** list, add the following parameters, if they don't appear, and provide the following information:

   | Parameter | Value | Description |
   |-----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Importance** | **Any** | Specifies the importance level of the email that you want. |
   | **Only with Attachments** | **Yes** | Get only emails with attachments. <br><br>**Note:** The trigger doesn't remove any emails from your account, checking only new messages and processing only emails that match the subject filter. |
   | **Include Attachments** | **Yes** | Get the attachments as input for your workflow, rather than just check for attachments. |
   | **Folder** | **Inbox** | The email folder to check. |
   | **Subject Filter** | **Business Analyst 2 #423501** | Specifies the text to find in the email subject. |

   When you finish, the trigger looks similar to the following example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/trigger-information.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow and Office 365 Outlook trigger.":::

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

   Your workflow is now live but doesn't do anything other check your emails. Next, add a condition that specifies criteria to continue subsequent actions in the workflow.

## Add a condition to check for attachments

The following steps add a condition that selects only emails that have attachments.

1. On the workflow designer, [follow these general steps to add the **Control** action named **Condition**](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

1. In the **Condition** action information pane, rename the action with **If email has attachments and key subject phrase**.

1. Build a condition that checks for emails that have attachments.

   1. On the **Parameters** tab, in the first row under the **AND** list, select inside the left box, and then select the dynamic content list (lightning icon). From this list, in the trigger section, select the **Has Attachment** output.

      > [!TIP]
      >
      > If you don't see the **Has Attachment** output, select **See More**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/has-attachment.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows condition action, second row with cursor in leftmost box, open dynamic content list, and Has Attachment selected." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/has-attachment.png":::

   1. In the middle box, keep the operator named **is equal to**.

   1. In the right box, enter **true**, which is the value to compare with the **Has Attachment** output value from the trigger. If both values are equal, the email has at least one attachment, the condition passes, and the workflow continues.

      :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/finished-condition.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows complete condition." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/finished-condition.png":::

   In your underlying workflow definition, which you can view by selecting **Code view** on the designer toolbar, the condition looks similar to the following example:

   ```json
   "Condition": {
      "actions": { <actions-to-run-when-condition-passes> },
      "expression": {
         "and": [ {
            "equals": [
               "@triggerBody()?['HasAttachment']",
                 "true"
            ]
         } ]
      },
      "runAfter": {},
      "type": "If"
   }
   ```

1. Save your workflow.

### Test your condition

1. On the designer toolbar, select **Run** > **Run**.

   This step manually starts and runs your workflow, but nothing happens until you send a test email to your inbox.

1. Send yourself an email that meets the following criteria:

   * Your email's subject has the text that you specified in the trigger's **Subject Filter**: **Business Analyst 2 #423501**

   * Your email has one attachment. For now, just create one empty text file and attach that file to your email.

   When the email arrives, your workflow checks for attachments and the specified subject text. If the condition passes, the trigger fires and causes Azure Logic Apps to instantiate and run a workflow instance.

1. To check that the trigger fired and the workflow successfully ran, on the logic app menu, select **Overview**.

   * To view successfully run workflows, select **Runs history**.

   * To view successfully fired triggers, select **Trigger history**.

   If the trigger didn't fire, or the workflow didn't run despite a successful trigger, see [Troubleshoot your logic app workflow](logic-apps-diagnosing-failures.md).

Next, define the actions to take for the **True** branch. To save the email along with any attachments, remove any HTML from the email body, then create blobs in the storage container for the email and attachments.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Your workflow can leave the **False** branch empty and not take any actions when an 
> email doesn't have attachments. As a bonus exercise after you finish this tutorial, 
> you can add any appropriate action that you want to take for the **False** branch.

## Call the RemoveHTMLFunction

The following steps add your previously created Azure function, which accepts the email body content from the email trigger as input.

1. On the logic app menu, under **Development Tools**, select **Logic app designer**. In the **True** branch, select **Add an action**.

1. [Follow these general steps to add the **Azure Functions** action named **Choose an Azure function**](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

1. Select your previously created function app, which is **CleanTextFunctionApp** in this example.

1. Select your function, which is named **RemoveHTMLFunction** in this example, and then select **Add Action**.

1. In the **Azure Functions** action information pane, rename the action with **Call RemoveHTMLFunction**.

1. Now specify the input for your function to process.

   1. For **Request Body**, enter the following text with a trailing space:

      **`{ "emailBody": `**

      While you work on this input in the next steps, an error about invalid JSON appears until your input is correctly formatted as JSON. When you previously tested this function, the input specified for this function used JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). So, the request body must also use the same format.

   1. Select inside the **Request Body** box, and then select the dynamic content list (lightning icon) so that you can select outputs from previous actions.

   1. From the dynamic content list, under **When a new email arrives**, select the **Body** output. After this value resolves in the **Request Body** box, remember to add the closing curly brace (**}**).

      :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/add-email-body.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Azure function information box with dynamic content list and Body selected." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/add-email-body.png":::

   When you finish, the Azure function looks like the following example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/add-email-body-done.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows finished Azure function with request body content to pass to your function." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/add-email-body-done.png":::

1. Save your workflow.

Next, add an action that creates a blob to store the email body.

## Add an action to create a blob for email body

The following steps create a blob that stores the email body in your storage container.

1. On the designer, in the condition's **True** block, under your Azure function, select **Add an action**.

1. [Follow these general steps to add the **Azure Blob Storage** action named **Create blob**](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

1. Provide the connection information for your storage account, for example:

   | Parameter | Required | Value | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Connection Name** | Yes | <*connection-name*> | A descriptive name for the connection. <br><br>This example uses **AttachmentStorageConnection**. |
   | **Authentication Type** | Yes | <*authentication-type*> | The authentication type to use for the connection. <br><br>This example uses **Access Key**. |
   | **Azure Storage Account Name Or Blob Endpoint** | Yes | <*storage-account-name*> | The name for your previously created storage account. <br><br>This example uses **attachmentstorageacct**. |
   | **Azure Storage Account Access Key** | Yes | <*storage-account-access-key*> | The access key for your previously created storage account. |

1. When you finish, select **Create New**.

1. In the **Create blob** action information pane, rename the action with **Create blob for email body**.

1. Provide the following action information:

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > If you can't find a specified output in the dynamic content list, 
   > select **See more** next to the operation name.

   | Parameter | Required | Value | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Storage Account Name Or Blob Endpoint** | Yes | **Use connection settings(<*storage-account-name-or-blob-endpoint*>)** | Select the option that includes your storage account name. <br><br>This example uses **`https://attachmentstorageacct.blob.core.windows.net`**. |
   | **Folder Path** | Yes | <*path-and-container-name*> | The path and name for the container that you previously created. <br><br>For this example, select the folder icon, and then select **attachments**. |
   | **Blob Name** | Yes | <*sender-name*> | For this example, use the sender name as the blob name. <br><br>1. Select inside the **Blob Name** box, and then select the dynamic content list option (lightning icon). <br><br>2. From the **When a new email arrives** section, select **From**. |
   | **Blob Content** | Yes | <*cleaned-email-body*> | For this example, use the HTML-free email body as the blob content. <br><br>1. Select inside the **Blob Content** box, and then select the dynamic content list option (lightning icon). <br><br>2. From the **Call RemoveHTMLFunction** section, select **Body**. |

   The following screenshot shows the outputs to select for the **Create blob for email body** action:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/create-blob-email-body.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows storage container, sender, and HTML-free email body in Create blob action." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/create-blob-email-body.png":::

   When you finish, the action looks like the following example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/create-blob-email-body-done.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows example email body information for finished Create blob action." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/create-blob-email-body-done.png":::

1. Save your workflow.

### Test attachment handling 

1. On the designer toolbar, select **Run** > **Run**.

   This step manually starts and runs your workflow, but nothing happens until you send a test email to your inbox.

1. Send yourself an email that meets the following criteria:

   * Your email's subject has the text that you specified in the trigger's **Subject Filter** parameter: **Business Analyst 2 #423501**

   * Your email has one or more attachments. For now, just create one empty text file, and attach that file to your email.

   * Your email has some test content in the body, for example: **Testing my logic app workflow**

   If your workflow didn't trigger or run despite a successful trigger, see [Troubleshoot your logic app workflow](logic-apps-diagnosing-failures.md).

1. Check that your workflow saved the email to the correct storage container.

   1. In Storage Explorer, expand **Emulator & Attached** > **Storage Accounts** > **attachmentstorageacct (Key)** > **Blob Containers** > **attachments**.

   1. Check the **attachments** container for the email.

      At this point, only the email appears in the container because the workflow hasn't processed the attachments yet.

      :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/storage-explorer-saved-email.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Storage Explorer with only the saved email." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/storage-explorer-saved-email.png":::

   1. When you finish, delete the email in Storage Explorer.

1. Optionally, to test the **False** branch, which does nothing at this time, you can send an email that doesn't meet the criteria.

Next, add a **For each** loop to process each email attachment.

## Add a loop to process attachments

The following steps add a loop to process each attachment in the email.

1. Return to the workflow designer. Under the **Create blob for email body** action, select **Add an action**.

1. [Follow these general steps to add the **Control** action named **For each**](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

1. In the **For each** action information pane, rename the action with **For each email attachment**.

1. Now select the content for the loop to process.

   1. In the **For each email attachment** loop, select inside the **Select An Output From Previous Steps** box, and then select the dynamic content list option (lightning icon).

   1. From the **When a new email arrives** section, select **Attachments**.

      The **Attachments** output includes an array with all the attachments from an email. The **For each** loop repeats actions on each array item.

      > [!TIP]
      >
      > If you don't see **Attachments**, select **See More**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/select-attachments.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows dynamic content list with selected output named Attachments." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/select-attachments.png":::

1. Save your workflow.

Next, add an action that saves each attachment as a blob in your **attachments** storage container.

## Add an action to create a blob per attachment

The following steps add an action to create a blob for each attachment.

1. In the designer, in the **For each email attachment** loop, select **Add an action**.

1. [Follow these general steps to add the **Azure Blob Storage** action named **Create blob**](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

1. In the **Create blob** action information pane, rename the action with **Create blob for email attachment**.

1. Provide the following action information:

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > If you can't find a specified output in the dynamic content list, 
   > select **See more** next to the operation name.

   | Parameter | Required | Value | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Storage Account Name Or Blob Endpoint** | Yes | **Use connection settings(<*storage-account-name-or-blob-endpoint*>)** | Select the option that includes your storage account name. <br><br>This example uses **`https://attachmentstorageacct.blob.core.windows.net`**. |
   | **Folder Path** | Yes | <*path-and-container-name*> | The path and name for the container that you previously created. <br><br>For this example, select the folder icon, and then select **attachments**. |
   | **Blob Name** | Yes | <*attachment-name*> | For this example, use the attachment name as the blob name. <br><br>1. Select inside the **Blob Name** box, and then select the dynamic content list option (lightning icon). <br><br>2. From the **When a new email arrives** section, select **Name**. |
   | **Blob Content** | Yes | <*email-content*> | For this example, use the email content as the blob content. <br><br>1. Select inside the **Blob Content** box, and then select the dynamic content list option (lightning icon). <br><br>2. From the **When a new email arrives** section, select **Content**. |

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > If you select an output that has an array, such as the **Content** output, which is an array 
   > that includes attachments, the designer automatically adds a **For each** loop around the action 
   > that references that output. That way, your workflow can perform that action on each array item.
   > To remove loop, move the action that references the output to outside the loop, and delete the loop.

   The following screenshot shows the outputs to select for the **Create blob for email attachment** action:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/create-blob-per-attachment.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows storage container and attachment information in Create blob action." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/create-blob-per-attachment.png":::

   When you finish, the action looks like the following example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/create-blob-per-attachment-done.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows example attachment information for finished Create blob action." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/create-blob-per-attachment-done.png":::

1. Save your workflow.

### Retest attachment handling

1. On the designer toolbar, select **Run** > **Run**.

   This step manually starts and runs your workflow, but nothing happens until you send a test email to your inbox.

1. Send yourself an email that meets the following criteria:

   * Your email's subject has the text that you specified in the trigger's **Subject Filter** parameter: **Business Analyst 2 #423501**

   * Your email has two or more attachments. For now, just create two empty text files and attach those files to your email.

   If your workflow didn't trigger or run despite a successful trigger, see [Troubleshoot your logic app workflow](logic-apps-diagnosing-failures.md).

1. Check that your workflow saved the email and attachments to the correct storage container.

   1. In Storage Explorer, expand **Emulator & Attached** > **Storage Accounts** > **attachmentstorageacct (Key)** > **Blob Containers** > **attachments**.

   1. Check the **attachments** container for both the email and the attachments.

      :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/storage-explorer-saved-attachments.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Storage Explorer and saved email and attachments." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/storage-explorer-saved-attachments.png":::

   1. When you finish, delete the email and attachments in Storage Explorer.

Next, add an action in your workflow that sends email to review the attachments.

## Add an action to send email

The following steps add an action so that your workflow sends email to review the attachments.

1. Return to the workflow designer. In the **True** branch, under the **For each email attachment** loop, select **Add an action**.

1. [Follow these general steps to add the **Office 365 Outlook** action named **Send an email**](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

   This example continues with the Office 365 Outlook connector, which works only with an Azure work or school account. For personal Microsoft accounts, select the Outlook.com connector.

1. If you're asked for credentials, sign in to your email account so that Azure Logic Apps creates a connection to your email account.

1. In the **Send an email** action information pane, rename the action with **Send email for review**.

1. Provide the following action information and select the outputs to include in the email:

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > If you can't find a specified output in the dynamic content list, 
   > select **See more** next to the operation name.

   | Parameter | Required | Value | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **To** | Yes | <*recipient-email-address*> | For testing purposes, use your own email address. |
   | **Subject** | Yes | <*email-subject*> | The email subject to include. <br><br>This example uses **ASAP - Review applicant for position:**, and the **Subject** output from the trigger. <br><br>1. In the **Subject** box, enter the example text with a trailing space. <br><br>2. Select inside the **Subject** box, and then select the dynamic content list option (lightning icon). <br><br>3. In the list, under **When a new email arrives**, select **Subject**. |
   | **Body** | Yes | <*email-body*> | The email body to include. <br><br>The example uses **Please review new applicant:**, the trigger output named **From**, the **Path** output from the **Create blob for email body** action, and the **Body** output from your **Call RemoveHTMLFunction** action. <br><br>1. In the **Body** box, enter the example text, **Please review new applicant:**. <br><br>2. On a new line, enter the example text, **Applicant name:**, and add the **From** output from the trigger. <br><br>3. On a new line, enter the example text, **Application file location:**, and add the **Path** output from the **Create blob for email body** action. <br><br>4. On a new line, enter the example text, **Application email content:**, and add the **Body** output from the **Call RemoveHTMLFunction** action. |

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > If you select an output that has an array, such as the **Content** output, which is an array 
   > that includes attachments, the designer automatically adds a **For each** loop around the action 
   > that references that output. That way, your workflow can perform that action on each array item.
   > To remove loop, move the action that references the output to outside the loop, and delete the loop.

   The following screenshot shows the finished **Send an email** action:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/send-email-done.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows sample email to send." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/send-email-done.png":::

1. Save your workflow.

Your finished workflow now looks like the following example:

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows finished workflow." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/complete.png":::

## Test your workflow

1. Send yourself an email that meets this criteria:

   * Your email's subject has the text that you specified in the trigger's **Subject Filter** parameter: **Business Analyst 2 #423501**

   * Your email has one or more attachments. You can reuse an empty text file from your previous test. For a more realistic scenario, attach a resume file.

   * The email body has this text, which you can copy and paste:

     ```text

1. Run your workflow. If successful, your workflow sends you an email that looks like the following example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/email-notification.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows example email sent by logic app workflow." lightbox="media/tutorial-process-email-attachments-workflow/email-notification.png":::

   If you don't get any emails, check your email's junk folder. Otherwise, if you're unsure that your workflow ran correctly, see [Troubleshoot your logic app workflow](logic-apps-diagnosing-failures.md).

Congratulations, you created and ran a workflow that automates tasks across different Azure services and calls some custom code!

## Clean up resources

Your workflow continues running until you disable or delete the logic app resource. When you no longer need this sample, delete the resource group that contains your logic app and related resources.

1. In the Azure portal search box, enter **resource groups**, and select **Resource groups**.

1. From the **Resource groups** list, select the resource group for this tutorial.

1. On the resource group menu, select **Overview**.

1. On the **Overview** page toolbar, select **Delete resource group**.

1. When the confirmation pane appears, enter the resource group name, and select **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created a logic app workflow that processes and stores email attachments by integrating Azure services, such as Azure Storage and Azure Functions. Now, learn more about other connectors that you can use to build logic app workflows.
