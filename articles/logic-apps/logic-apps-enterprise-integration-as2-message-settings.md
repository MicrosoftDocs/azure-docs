# Reference for AS2 message settings in agreements for Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

This reference describes the properties that you can set in an AS2 agreement for specifying how to handle messages between [trading partners](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-partners.md). Set up these properties based on your agreement with the partner that exchanges messages with you.

## AS2 Receive settings

![Screenshot shows Azure portal and AS2 agreement settings for inbound messages.](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-as2-message-settings/receive-settings.png)

| Property | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Override message properties** | No | Overrides the properties on incoming messages with your property settings. |
| **Message should be signed** | No | Specifies whether all incoming messages must be digitally signed. If you require signing, from the **Certificate** list, select an existing guest partner public certificate for validating the signature on the messages. If you don't have a certificate, learn more about [adding certificates](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-certificates.md). |
| **Message should be encrypted** | No | Specifies whether all incoming messages must be encrypted. Non-encrypted messages are rejected. If you require encryption, from the **Certificate** list, select an existing host partner private certificate for decrypting incoming messages. If you don't have a certificate, learn more about [adding certificates](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-certificates.md). |
| **Message should be compressed** | No | Specifies whether all incoming messages must be compressed. Non-compressed messages are rejected. |
| **Disallow Message ID duplicates** | No | Specifies whether to allow messages with duplicate IDs. If you disallow duplicate IDs, select the number of days between checks. You can also choose whether to suspend duplicates. |
| **MDN Text** | No | Specifies the default message disposition notification (MDN) that you want sent to the message sender. |
| **Send MDN** | No | Specifies whether to send synchronous MDNs for received messages. |
| **Send signed MDN** | No | Specifies whether to send signed MDNs for received messages. If you require signing, from the **MIC Algorithm** list, select the algorithm to use for signing messages. |
| **Send asynchronous MDN** | No | Specifies whether to send MDNs asynchronously. If you select asynchronous MDNs, in the **URL** box, specify the URL for where to send the MDNs. |

## AS2 Send settings

![Screenshot shows Azure portal and AS2 agreement settings for outbound messages.](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-as2-message-settings/send-settings.png)

| Property | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Enable message signing** | No | Specifies whether all outgoing messages must be digitally signed. If you require signing, select these values: <br><br>- From the **Signing Algorithm** list, select the algorithm to use for signing messages. <br>- From the **Certificate** list, select an existing host partner private certificate for signing messages. If you don't have a certificate, learn more about [adding certificates](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-certificates.md). |
| **Enable message encryption** | No | Specifies whether all outgoing messages must be encrypted. If you require encryption, select these values: <br><br>- From the **Encryption Algorithm** list, select the guest partner public certificate algorithm to use for encrypting messages. <br>- From the **Certificate** list, select an existing guest partner public certificate for encrypting outgoing messages. If you don't have a certificate, learn more about [adding certificates](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-certificates.md). |
| **Enable message compression** | No | Specifies whether all outgoing messages must be compressed. |
| **Unfold HTTP headers** | No | Puts the HTTP `content-type` header onto a single line. |
| **Transmit file name in MIME header** | No | Specifies whether to include the file name in the MIME header. |
| **Request MDN** | No | Specifies whether to receive message disposition notifications (MDNs) for all outgoing messages. |
| **Request signed MDN** | No | Specifies whether to receive signed MDNs for all outgoing messages. If you require signing, from the **MIC Algorithm** list, select the algorithm to use for signing messages. |
| **Request asynchronous MDN** | No | Specifies whether to receive MDNs asynchronously. If you select asynchronous MDNs, in the **URL** box, specify the URL for where to send the MDNs. |
| **Enable NRR** | No | Specifies whether to require non-repudiation receipt (NRR). This communication attribute provides evidence that the data was received as addressed. |
| **SHA2 Algorithm format** | No | Specifies the MIC algorithm format to use for signing in the headers for the outgoing AS2 messages or MDN |
