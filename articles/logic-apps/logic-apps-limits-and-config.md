# Limits and configuration reference for Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

> For Power Automate, review [Limits and configuration in Power Automate](/power-automate/limits-and-config).

This reference guide describes the limits and configuration information for Azure Logic Apps and related resources. Based on your scenario, solution requirements, the capabilities that you want, and the environment where you want to run your workflows, you choose whether to create a Consumption logic app workflow that runs in *multitenant* Azure Logic Apps or a Standard logic app workflow that runs in *single-tenant* Azure Logic Apps or an App Service Environment (v3 - Windows plans only).

> [!NOTE]
>
> Many limits are the same across the available environments where Azure Logic Apps runs, but differences are noted where they exist.

The following table briefly summarizes differences between a Consumption logic app and a Standard logic app.

[!INCLUDE [Logic app resource type and environment differences](../../includes/logic-apps-resource-environment-differences-table.md)]

## Workflow definition limits

The following tables list the values for a single workflow definition:

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Workflows per region per Azure subscription | - Consumption: 1,000 workflows where each logic app always has only 1 workflow <br><br>- Standard: Unlimited, based on the selected hosting plan, app activity, size of machine instances, and resource usage, where each logic app can have multiple workflows | For optimal performance guidelines around Standard logic app workflows, see [Best practices and recommendations](create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal.md#best-practices-and-recommendations). |
| Workflow - Maximum name length | - Consumption: 80 characters <br><br>- Standard: 32 characters ||
| Triggers per workflow | - Consumption (designer): 1 trigger <br>- Consumption (JSON): 10 triggers <br><br>- Standard: 1 trigger | - Consumption:  Multiple triggers are possible only when you work on the JSON workflow definition, whether in code view or an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template, not the designer. <br><br>- Standard: Only one trigger is possible, whether in the designer, code view, or an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. |
| Actions per workflow | 500 actions | To extend this limit, you can use nested workflows as necessary. |
| Actions nesting depth | 8 actions | To extend this limit, you can use nested workflows as necessary. |

## Run duration and history retention limits

The following table lists the values for a single workflow run:

| Name | Multitenant | Single-tenant | Notes |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Run history retention in storage | 90 days | 90 days <br>(Default) | The amount of time to keep a workflow's run history in storage after a run starts. <br><br>**Note**: If the workflow's run duration exceeds the retention limit, this run is removed from the run history in storage. If a run isn't immediately removed after reaching the retention limit, the run is removed within 7 days. <br><br>Whether a run completes or times out, run history retention is always calculated by using the run's start time and the current limit specified in the workflow setting, [**Run history retention in days**](#change-retention). No matter the previous limit, the current limit is always used for calculating retention. <br><br>For more information, review [Change duration and run history retention in storage](#change-retention). |
| Run duration | 90 days | - Stateful workflow: 90 days <br>(Default) <br><br>- Stateless workflow: 5 min <br>(Default) | The amount of time that a workflow can continue running before forcing a timeout. The run duration is calculated by using a run's start time and the limit that's specified in the workflow setting, [**Run history retention in days**](#change-duration) at that start time. <br><br>**Important**: Make sure the run duration value is always less than or equal to the run history retention in storage value. Otherwise, run histories might be deleted before the associated jobs are complete. <br><br>For more information, review [Change run duration and history retention in storage](#change-duration). |
| Recurrence interval | - Min: 1 sec <br><br>- Max: 500 days | - Min: 1 sec <br><br>- Max: 500 days ||

<a name="change-retention"></a>

## Change run duration and history retention in storage

If a run's duration exceeds the current run history retention limit, the run is removed from the runs history in storage. To avoid losing run history, make sure that the retention limit is *always* more than the run's longest possible duration.

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

For Consumption logic app workflows, the same setting controls the maximum number of days that a workflow can run and for keeping run history in storage.

* In multitenant Azure Logic Apps, the 90-day default limit is the same as the maximum limit. You can only decrease this value.

For example, suppose that you reduce the retention limit from 90 days to 30 days. A 60-day-old run is removed from the runs history. If you increase the retention period from 30 days to 60 days, a 20-day-old run stays in the runs history for another 40 days.

#### Portal

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) search box, open your logic app workflow in the designer.

1. On the logic app menu, select **Workflow settings**.

1. Under **Runtime options**, from the **Run history retention in days** list, select **Custom**.

1. Drag the slider to change the number of days that you want.

1. When you're done, on the **Workflow settings** toolbar, select **Save**.

#### ARM template

If you use an Azure Resource Manager template, this setting appears as a property in your workflow's resource definition, which is described in the [Microsoft.Logic workflows template reference](/azure/templates/microsoft.logic/workflows):

```json
{
   "name": "{logic-app-name}",
   "type": "Microsoft.Logic/workflows",
   "location": "{Azure-region}",
   "apiVersion": "2019-05-01",
   "properties": {
      "definition": {},
      "parameters": {},
      "runtimeConfiguration": {
         "lifetime": {
            "unit": "day",
            "count": {number-of-days}
         }
      }
   }
}
```

#### [Standard](#tab/standard)

For Standard logic app workflows, you can decrease or increase the 90-day default limit, but you need to add the following settings and their values to your logic app resource or project:

* An app setting named [**Workflows.RuntimeConfiguration.RetentionInDays**](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md#reference-local-settings-json)

* A host setting named [**Runtime.FlowMaintenanceJob.RetentionCooldownInterval**](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md#run-duration-history)

By default, the app setting named **Workflows.RuntimeConfiguration.RetentionInDays** is set to keep 90 days of data. The host setting named **Runtime.FlowMaintenanceJob.RetentionCooldownInterval** is set to check every 7 days for old data to delete. If you leave these default values, you might see data *up to* 97 days old. For example, suppose Azure Logic Apps checks on Day X and deletes data older than Day X - 90 days, and then waits for 7 days before running again. This behavior results in data that ages up to 97 days before the job runs again. However, if you set the interval to 1 day, but leave the retention days at the default value, the maximum delay to delete old data is 90+1 days.

#### Portal

1. [Follow these steps to add the app setting named **Workflows.RuntimeConfiguration.RetentionInDays**](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md?tabs=azure-portal#manage-app-settings), and set the value to the number days that you want to keep your workflow run history.

1. [Follow these steps to add the host setting named **Runtime.FlowMaintenanceJob.RetentionCooldownInterval**](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md#manage-host-settings-portal), and set the value to the number of days as the interval between when to check for and delete run history that you don't want to keep.

#### Visual Studio Code

1. [Follow these steps to add the app setting named **Workflows.RuntimeConfiguration.RetentionInDays**](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md?tabs=visual-studio-code#manage-app-settings), and set the value to the number days that you want to keep your workflow run history.

1. [Follow these steps to add the host setting named **Runtime.FlowMaintenanceJob.RetentionCooldownInterval**](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md#manage-host-settings-visual-studio-code), and set the value to the number of days as the interval between when to check for and delete run history that you don't want to keep.

The timeout value is evaluated for each loop cycle. If any action in the loop takes longer than the timeout limit, the current cycle doesn't stop. However, the next cycle doesn't start because the limit condition isn't met. <br><br>To change this value in multitenant Azure Logic Apps, in the **Until** loop shape, select **Change limits**, and specify the value for the **Timeout** property. <br><br>To change the default value in the single-tenant service, review [Edit host and app settings for logic apps in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md). |

## Throughput limits

The following table lists the values for a single workflow definition:

| Name | Multitenant | Single-tenant | Notes |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Action - Executions per 5-minute rolling interval | Default: 100,000 executions <br>- High throughput mode: 300,000 executions | None | In multitenant Azure Logic Apps, you can raise the default value to the maximum value for your workflow. For more information, see [Run in high throughput mode](#run-high-throughput-mode), which is in preview. Or, you can [distribute the workload across more than one workflow](handle-throttling-problems-429-errors.md#logic-app-throttling) as necessary. |

## Scale for high throughput

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

In single-tenant Azure Logic Apps, a Standard logic app resource uses storage and compute as the primary resources to run workflows.

### Storage

Stateful workflows in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps use Azure Table Storage for persistent data storage during runtime, Azure Blob Storage for maintaining workflow run histories, and Azure Queue Storage for scheduling purposes. For example, a single storage account enables handling a substantial number of requests with rates of up to 2,000 requests per partition and 20,000 requests per second at the storage account level. While a single storage account can handle reasonably high throughput, beyond these thresholds, request rates are subject to throttling, and your workflows might experience partition level throttling or account level throttling as workflow execution rate increases. To make sure that your workflows operate smoothly, it's crucial that you understand the possible limitations and the ways that you can address them.

For more information about scaling targets and limitations for the various Azure Storage services, see the following documentation:

- [Scale targets for Table Storage](../storage/tables/scalability-targets.md#scale-targets-for-table-storage)
- [Data operation targets for Table Storage](../storage/tables/storage-performance-checklist.md#targets-for-data-operations)
- [Scale targets for Blob Storage](../storage/blobs/scalability-targets.md#scale-targets-for-blob-storage)
- [Scale targets for Queue Storage](../storage/queues/scalability-targets.md#scale-targets-for-queue-storage)

#### Scale your logic app for storage limitations

The following recommendations apply to scaling Standard logic app workflows:

- Share workload across multiple workflows.

  Single-tenant Azure Logic Apps already minimizes partition-level throttling by distributing storage transactions across multiple partitions. However, to improve distribution and mitigate partition-level throttling, [distribute the workload across multiple workflows](handle-throttling-problems-429-errors.md#logic-app-throttling), rather than rely on a single workflow.

- Share workload across multiple storage accounts.

  If your workflows require high throughput, you can significantly increase throughput by distributing the workload across multiple storage accounts, rather than rely on a single storage account. You can set up your Standard logic app resource to use up to 32 storage accounts as the limit. To determine the number of storage accounts that you need, use the general guideline of aiming for ~100,000 action executions per minute, per storage account. While this estimate works well for most scenarios, you might use a lower number of action executions if your workflow actions are compute heavy, for example, a query action that processes large data arrays. Make sure that you perform load testing and tune your solution before using in production.

  To enable using multiple storage accounts, follow these steps before you create your Standard logic app. Otherwise, if you change the settings after creation, you might experience data loss or not achieve the necessary scalability.

  1. [Create the storage accounts](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=azure-portal) that you want to use. Save the connection string for each storage account.

  1. Find and open your Standard logic app, and then [edit your logic app's host settings (**host.json** file)](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md?tabs=azure-portal#manage-host-settings---hostjson) to include the following **`extensions`** object, which contains the **`workflow`** and **`settings`** objects with the **Runtime.ScaleUnitsCount** setting:

     ```json
     "extensions": {
         "workflow": {
             "settings": {
                 "Runtime.ScaleUnitsCount": "<storage-accounts-number>"
             }
         }
     }
     ```

     The following example specifies **3** as the number of storage accounts:

     ```json
     {
         "version": "2.0",
         "extensionBundle": {
             "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Workflows",
             "version": "[1.*, 2.0.0)"
         },
         "extensions": {
             "workflow": {
                 "settings": {
                     "Runtime.ScaleUnitsCount": "3"
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

  1. [Edit your logic app's application configuration settings (**local.settings.json**)](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md?tabs=azure-portal#manage-app-settings---localsettingsjson) to add an app setting named **CloudStorageAccount.Workflows.ScaleUnitsDataStorage.CU0\<*storage-account-number*>\.ConnectionString** and the corresponding storage account connection string using the following syntax where the first storage account number is **`00`** up to the number of storage accounts minus 1, for example:

     | App setting name | Value |
     |------------------|-------|
     | **CloudStorageAccount.Workflows.ScaleUnitsDataStorage.CU00.ConnectionString** | `<connection-string-1>` |
     | **CloudStorageAccount.Workflows.ScaleUnitsDataStorage.CU01.ConnectionString** | `<connection-string-2>` |
     | **CloudStorageAccount.Workflows.ScaleUnitsDataStorage.CU02.ConnectionString** | `<connection-string-3>` | 

     > [!IMPORTANT]
     >
     > When you have sensitive information, such as connection strings that include usernames and passwords, 
     > make sure to use the most secure authentication flow available. For example, in Standard logic app workflows, 
     > secure data types, such as `securestring` and `secureobject`, aren't supported. Microsoft recommends that you 
     > authenticate access to Azure resources with a [managed identity](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) 
     > when possible, and assign a role that has the least privilege necessary.
     >
     > If this capability is unavailable, make sure to secure connection strings through other measures, such as 
     > [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview), which you can use with [app settings](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md). 
     > You can then [directly reference secure strings](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references.md), such as connection 
     > strings and keys. Similar to ARM templates, where you can define environment variables at deployment time, you can define 
     > app settings within your [logic app workflow definition](/azure/templates/microsoft.logic/workflows). 
     > You can then capture dynamically generated infrastructure values, such as connection endpoints, storage strings, and more. 
     > For more information, see [Application types for the Microsoft identity platform](/entra/identity-platform/v2-app-types).

   1. In your logic app's application configuration settings, update the **AzureWebJobsStorage** setting value with the same connection string that's in the **CloudStorageAccount.Workflows.ScaleUnitsDataStorage.CU00.ConnectionString** setting.

#### Compute

A Standard logic app runs by using one of the [available compute plans](logic-apps-pricing.md#standard-pricing-tiers), which provide different levels of virtual CPU and memory, or by using an App Service Environment v3, which provides more compute options.

Single-tenant Azure Logic Apps dynamically scales to effectively handle increasing loads. Your logic app uses the following primary factors to determine whether to scale.

> [!NOTE]
>
> For a Standard logic app in an App Service Environment v3, dynamic scaling isn't available. 
> You must set scaling rules on the associated App Service Plan. As a commonly used scaling rule, 
> you can use the CPU metric, and scale your App Service Plan to keep the virtual CPU between 50-70%. 
> For more information, see [Get started with autoscale in Azure](/azure/azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-get-started).

- Trigger

  To determine scaling requirements, the scaler analyzes the trigger that starts each workflow in your logic app. For example, for a workflow with a Service Bus trigger, if the queue length continuously grows, the scaler takes action to add worker instances, which enable processing more messages. Likewise, for a workflow with a Request trigger, if the request latency experiences an upward trend, the scaler increases the number of worker instances to distribute the request load more efficiently. For more information about worker instances, see [Azure Logic Apps (Standard) - Runtime Deep Dive](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-integration-services-blog/azure-logic-apps-running-anywhere-runtime-deep-dive/ba-p/1835564).

- Workflow job execution delay

  At runtime, workflow actions are divided into individual jobs that are queued for execution. Job dispatchers regularly poll the job queue to retrieve and execute these jobs. However, if compute capacity is insufficient to pick up these jobs, they stay in the queue for a longer time, resulting in increased execution delays. The scaler monitors this situation and make scaling decisions to keep the execution delays under control. For more information about how the runtime schedules and runs jobs, see [Azure Logic Apps (Standard) - Runtime Deep Dive](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-integration-services-blog/azure-logic-apps-running-anywhere-runtime-deep-dive/ba-p/1835564).
 
  The scaler also considers the minimum and maximum worker instance counter configuration to determine whether to make scaling decisions, such as adding, removing, or maintaining the current number of worker instances. Typically, the scaler makes these decisions at intervals of approximately 15-30 seconds. So, consider this ramp-up time and its impact on your logic app's scaling speed to effectively handle peak loads. For example, if your workload requires scaling your logic app from just 1 worker instance to 100 worker instances, the ramp-up alone might take 25-50 minutes. Single-tenant Azure Logic Apps scaling shares the same [Azure Functions scaling infrastructure](../azure-functions/event-driven-scaling.md).

##### Configure your logic app compute for faster scaling

- Share workload across multiple logic apps.

  Each logic app can scale independently, so distributing your workload across more than one logic app can significantly accelerate the scaling speed. For example, two logic apps can scale to twice the number of worker instances in the same timeframe as a single logic app. By splitting your workload across multiple apps, you can effectively multiply the scalability and achieve faster scaling results.

- Use prewarmed instances.

  If your scenario requires quicker ramp-up time, consider using prewarmed instances. If your peak load times are deterministic, you can use an automation task to adjust these prewarm instances on a schedule. For more information, see [Manage Azure resources and monitor costs by creating automation tasks (preview)](create-automation-tasks-azure-resources.md).

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

Multitenant Azure Logic Apps has a [default limit](#throughput-limits) on the number of actions that run every 5 minutes. To raise the default value to the [maximum value](#throughput-limits), you can enable high throughput mode, which is in preview. Or, [distribute the workload across multiple logic apps and workflows](handle-throttling-problems-429-errors.md#logic-app-throttling), rather than rely on a single logic app and workflow.

#### Enable high throughput in the portal

1. In the Azure portal, on your logic app's menu, under **Settings**, select **Workflow settings**.

1. Under **Runtime options** > **High throughput**, change the setting to **On**.

   ![Screenshot that shows logic app menu in Azure portal with "Workflow settings" and "High throughput" set to "On".](./media/logic-apps-limits-and-config/run-high-throughput-mode.png)

#### Enable high throughput in a Resource Manager template

To enable this setting in an ARM template for deploying your logic app, in the `properties` object for your logic app's resource definition, add the `runtimeConfiguration` object with the `operationOptions` property set to `OptimizedForHighThroughput`:

```json

## Data gateway limits

Azure Logic Apps supports write operations, including inserts and updates, through the on-premises data gateway. However, these operations have [limits on their payload size](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-onprem#considerations).

<a name="retry-policy-limits"></a>

## Retry policy limits

The following table lists the retry policy limits for a trigger or action, based on whether you have a [Consumption or Standard logic app workflow](logic-apps-overview.md#resource-environment-differences).

| Name | Consumption limit | Standard limit | Notes |
|------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| Retry attempts | - Default: 4 attempts <br> - Max: 90 attempts | - Default: 4 attempts | To change the default limit in Consumption logic app workflows, use the [retry policy parameter](logic-apps-exception-handling.md#retry-policies). To change the default limit in Standard logic app workflows, review [Edit host and app settings for logic apps in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md). |
| Retry interval | None | Default: 7 sec | To change the default limit in Consumption logic app workflows, use the [retry policy parameter](logic-apps-exception-handling.md#retry-policies). <br><br>To change the default limit in Standard logic app workflows, review [Edit host and app settings for logic apps in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md). |

<a name="variables-action-limits"></a>

## Variables action limits

The following table lists the values for a single workflow definition:

| Name | Multitenant | Single-tenant | Notes |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Variables per workflow | 250 variables | 250 variables <br>(Default) ||
| Variable - Maximum content size | 104,857,600 characters | Stateful workflow: 104,857,600 characters <br>(Default) <br><br>Stateless workflow: 1,024 characters <br>(Default) | To change the default value in the single-tenant service, review [Edit host and app settings for logic apps in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md). |
| Variable (Array type) - Maximum number of array items | 100,000 items | 100,000 items <br>(Default) | To change the default value in the single-tenant service, review [Edit host and app settings for logic apps in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md). |

<a name="http-limits"></a>

## HTTP request limits

The following tables list the values for a single inbound or outbound call:

<a name="http-timeout-limits"></a>

### Timeout duration

By default, the HTTP action and APIConnection actions follow the [standard asynchronous operation pattern](/azure/architecture/patterns/async-request-reply), while the Response action follows the *synchronous operation pattern*. Some managed connector operations make asynchronous calls or listen for webhook requests, so the timeout for these operations might be longer than the following limits. For more information, review [each connector's technical reference page](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-logicapps-connectors) and also the [Workflow triggers and actions](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#http-action) documentation.

> [!NOTE]
>
> For a Standard logic app resource in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps, stateless workflows can only run *synchronously*.

| Name | Multitenant | Single-tenant | Notes |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Outbound request | 120 sec <br>(2 min) | 235 sec <br>(3.9 min) <br>(Default) | Examples of outbound requests include calls made by the HTTP trigger or action. <br><br>**Tip**: For longer running operations, use an [asynchronous polling pattern](logic-apps-create-api-app.md#async-pattern) or an ["Until" loop](logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#until-action). To work around timeout limits when you call another workflow that has a [callable endpoint](logic-apps-http-endpoint.md), you can use the built-in Azure Logic Apps action instead, which you can find in the designer's operation picker under **Built-in**. <br><br>To change the default limit in the single-tenant service, review [Edit host and app settings for logic apps in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md). |
| Inbound request | 120 sec <br>(2 min) | 235 sec <br>(3.9 min) <br>(Default) | Examples of inbound requests include calls received by the Request trigger, HTTP Webhook trigger, and HTTP Webhook action. <br><br>**Note**: For the original caller to get the response, all steps in the response must finish within the limit unless you call another nested workflow. For more information, see [Call, trigger, or nest logic apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-http-endpoint.md). <br><br>To change the default limit in the single-tenant service, review [Edit host and app settings for logic apps in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md). |

<a name="content-storage-size-limits"></a>

### Request trigger and webhook trigger size limits

| Name | Multitenant | Single-tenant | Notes |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Request trigger (inbound) and webhook-based triggers - Content size limit per 5-minute rolling interval per workflow | 3,145,728 KB | None | This limit applies only to the content size for inbound requests received by the Request trigger or any webhook trigger. <br><br>For example, suppose the backend has 100 workers. Each worker has a limit of 31,457,280 bytes, which is the result from dividing 3,145,728,000 bytes by 100 workers. To avoid experiencing premature throttling for the Request trigger, use a new HTTP client for each request, which helps evenly distribute the calls across all nodes. For a webhook trigger, you might have to use multiple workflows, which split the load and avoids throttling. |

<a name="message-size-limits"></a>

### Messages

| Name | Chunking enabled | Multitenant | Single-tenant | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Content download - Maximum number of requests | Yes | 1,000 requests | 1,000 requests <br>(Default) ||
| Message size | No | 100 MB | 100 MB | To work around this limit, see [Handle large messages with chunking](logic-apps-handle-large-messages.md). However, some connectors and APIs don't support chunking or even the default limit. <br><br>- Connectors such as AS2, X12, and EDIFACT have their own [B2B message limits](#b2b-protocol-limits). <br><br>To change the default value in the single-tenant service, review [Edit host and app settings for logic apps in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md). |
| Message size per action | Yes | 1 GB | 1,073,741,824 bytes <br>(1 GB) <br>(Default) | This limit applies to actions that either natively support chunking or let you enable chunking in their runtime configuration. For more information about chunking, see [Handle large messages with chunking](../logic-apps/logic-apps-handle-large-messages.md). <br><br>To change the default value in the single-tenant service, review [Edit host and app settings for logic apps in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md). |
| Content chunk size per action | Yes | Varies per connector | 52,428,800 bytes (52 MB) <br>(Default) | This limit applies to actions that either natively support chunking or let you enable chunking in their runtime configuration. <br><br>To change the default value in the single-tenant service, review [Edit host and app settings for logic apps in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md). |

### Character limits

The following table lists the values for a single workflow definition:

| Name | Multitenant | Single-tenant | Notes |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Maximum number of code characters | 1,024 characters | 100,000 characters | To use the higher limit, create a Standard logic app resource, which runs in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps, either [by using the Azure portal](create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal.md) or [by using Visual Studio Code and the **Azure Logic Apps (Standard)** extension](create-single-tenant-workflows-visual-studio-code.md). |
| Maximum duration for running code | 5 sec | 15 sec | To use the higher limit, create a Standard logic app resource, which runs in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps, either [by using the Azure portal](create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal.md) or [by using Visual Studio Code and the **Azure Logic Apps (Standard)** extension](create-single-tenant-workflows-visual-studio-code.md). |

<a name="custom-connector-limits"></a>

## Custom connector limits

In multitenant Azure Logic Apps only, you can create and use [custom managed connectors](/connectors/custom-connectors), which are wrappers around an existing REST API or SOAP API. In single-tenant Azure Logic Apps, you can create and use only [custom built-in connectors](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/integrations-on-azure/azure-logic-apps-running-anywhere-built-in-connector/ba-p/1921272).

The following table lists the values for custom connectors:

| Name | Multitenant | Single-tenant | Notes |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Custom connectors | 1,000 per Azure subscription | Unlimited ||
| APIs per service | SOAP-based: 50 | Not applicable ||
| Parameters per API | SOAP-based: 50 | Not applicable ||
| Requests per minute for a custom connector | 500 requests per minute per connection | Based on your implementation ||

<a name="managed-identity"></a>

## Managed identity limits

| Name | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Managed identities per logic app resource | - Consumption: Either the system-assigned identity *or* only one user-assigned identity <br><br>- Standard: The system-assigned identity *and* any number of user-assigned identities <br><br>**Note**: By default, a **Logic App (Standard)** resource has the system-assigned managed identity automatically enabled to authenticate connections at runtime. This identity differs from the authentication credentials or connection string that you use when you create a connection. If you disable this identity, connections won't work at runtime. To view this setting, on your logic app's menu, under **Settings**, select **Identity**. |
| Number of logic apps that have a managed identity in an Azure subscription per region | - Consumption: 5,000 logic apps <br>- Standard: Per [Azure App Service limits, if any](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md#azure-app-service-limits) |

<a name="integration-account-limits"></a>

## Integration account limits

Each Azure subscription has these integration account limits:

* One [Free tier](logic-apps-pricing.md#integration-accounts) integration account per Azure region. This tier is available only for public regions in Azure, for example, West US or Southeast Asia, but not for [Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet](/azure/china/overview-operations) or [Azure Government](../azure-government/documentation-government-welcome.md).

* 1,000 total integration accounts

To learn how pricing and billing work, see the [Logic Apps pricing model](logic-apps-pricing.md). For pricing rates, see [Logic Apps pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/logic-apps/).

<a name="artifact-number-limits"></a>

### Artifact limits per integration account

The following tables list the values for the number of artifacts limited to each integration account tier. For pricing rates, see [Logic Apps pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/logic-apps/). To learn how pricing and billing work for integration accounts, see the [Logic Apps pricing model](logic-apps-pricing.md#integration-accounts).

> [!NOTE]
> Use the Free tier only for exploratory scenarios, not production scenarios. 
> This tier restricts throughput and usage, and has no service-level agreement (SLA).

| Artifact | Free | Basic | Standard | Premium (preview) |

<a name="artifact-capacity-limits"></a>

### Artifact capacity limits

| Artifact | Limit | Notes |
| -------- | ----- | ----- |
| Assembly | 8 MB | To upload files larger than 2 MB, use an [Azure storage account and blob container](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md). |
| Map (XSLT file) | 8 MB | To upload files larger than 2 MB, use the [Azure Logic Apps REST API - Maps](/rest/api/logic/maps/createorupdate). <br><br>**Note**: The amount of data or records that a map can successfully process is based on the message size and action timeout limits in Azure Logic Apps. For example, if you use an HTTP action, based on [HTTP message size and timeout limits](#http-limits), a map can process data up to the HTTP message size limit if the operation completes within the HTTP timeout limit. |
| Schema | 8 MB | To upload files larger than 2 MB, use an [Azure storage account and blob container](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md). |

## Firewall configuration: IP addresses and service tags

If your environment has strict network requirements and uses a firewall that limits traffic to specific IP addresses, your environment or firewall needs to permit incoming communication received by Azure Logic Apps and outgoing communication sent by Azure Logic Apps. To set up this access, you can create [Azure Firewall rules](../firewall/rule-processing.md) for your firewall to allow access for *both* [inbound](#inbound) and [outbound](#outbound) IP addresses used by Azure Logic Apps in your logic app's Azure region.  *All* logic apps in the same region use the same IP address ranges.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using [Power Automate](/power-automate/getting-started), some actions, such as **HTTP** and **HTTP + OpenAPI**, 
> go directly through the Azure Logic Apps service and come from the IP addresses that are listed here. For more information 
> about the IP addresses used by Power Automate, see [Limits and configuration for Power Automate](/power-automate/limits-and-config#ip-address-configuration).

For example, suppose your logic apps are deployed in the West US region. To support calls that your logic apps send or receive through built-in triggers and actions, such as the [HTTP trigger or action](../connectors/connectors-native-http.md), your firewall needs to allow access for *all* the Azure Logic Apps service inbound IP addresses *and* outbound IP addresses that exist in the West US region.

If your workflow uses [managed connectors](../connectors/managed.md), such as the Office 365 Outlook connector or SQL connector, or uses [custom connectors](/connectors/custom-connectors/), the firewall also needs to allow access for *all* the [managed connector outbound IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses) in your logic app's Azure region. If your workflow uses custom connectors that access on-premises resources through the [on-premises data gateway resource in Azure](logic-apps-gateway-connection.md), you need to set up the gateway installation to allow access for the corresponding [*managed connector* outbound IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses). For more information about setting up communication settings on the gateway, review these topics:

* [Adjust communication settings for the on-premises data gateway](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-communication)
* [Configure proxy settings for the on-premises data gateway](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-proxy)

<a name="ip-setup-considerations"></a>

### Firewall IP configuration considerations

Before you set up your firewall with IP addresses, review these considerations:

* To help you simplify any security rules that you want to create, you can optionally use [service tags](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md) instead, rather than specify IP address prefixes for each region. These tags represent a group of IP address prefixes from a specific Azure service and work across the regions where the Azure Logic Apps service is available:

  * **LogicAppsManagement**: Represents the inbound IP address prefixes for the Azure Logic Apps service.

  * **LogicApps**: Represents the outbound IP address prefixes for the Azure Logic Apps service.

  * **AzureConnectors**: Represents the IP address prefixes for managed connectors that make inbound webhook callbacks to the Azure Logic Apps service and outbound calls to their respective services, such as Azure Storage or Azure Event Hubs.

* For Standard logic app workflows that run in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps, you have to allow access for any trigger or action connections in your workflows. You can allow traffic from [service tags](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md) and use the same level of restrictions or policies as Azure App Service. You also need to find and use the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) for your connections. For more information, review the corresponding sections in the following documentation:

  * [Firewall permissions for single tenant logic apps - Azure portal](create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal.md#firewall-setup)
  * [Firewall permissions for single tenant logic apps - Visual Studio Code](create-single-tenant-workflows-visual-studio-code.md#firewall-setup)

* If your logic apps have problems accessing Azure storage accounts that use [firewalls and firewall rules](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md), you have [various other options to enable access](../connectors/connectors-create-api-azureblobstorage.md#access-storage-accounts-behind-firewalls).

  For example, logic apps can't directly access storage accounts that use firewall rules and exist in the same region. However, if you permit the [outbound IP addresses for managed connectors in your region](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses), your logic apps can access storage accounts that are in a different region except when you use the Azure Table Storage or Azure Queue Storage connectors. To access your Table Storage or Queue Storage, you can use the HTTP trigger and actions instead. For other options, see [Access storage accounts behind firewalls](../connectors/connectors-create-api-azureblobstorage.md#access-storage-accounts-behind-firewalls).

<a name="inbound"></a>

### Inbound IP addresses

For Azure Logic Apps to receive incoming communication through your firewall, you have to allow traffic through the inbound IP addresses described in this section for your logic app's Azure region. To help reduce complexity when you create security rules, you can optionally use the [service tag](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md), **LogicAppsManagement**, rather than specify the Azure Logic Apps inbound IP address prefixes for each region. If you're using Azure Government, see [Azure Government - Inbound IP addresses](#azure-government-inbound).

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Some managed connectors make inbound webhook callbacks to Azure Logic Apps. If you use access control on the logic app resource, 
> you must make sure that the calls from these target systems (IP addresses) have permissions to access your logic app. The following 
> connectors make inbound webhook callbacks to Azure Logic Apps:
>
> Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Sign, Adobe Sign Demo, Adobe Sign Preview, Adobe Sign Stage, Microsoft Sentinel, Event Grid, 
> Microsoft Form, Business Central, Calendly, Common Data Service, DocuSign, DocuSign Demo, Dynamics 365 for Fin & Ops, 
> LiveChat, Office 365* Outlook, Outlook.com, Parserr, SAP*, Shifts for Microsoft Teams, Teamwork Projects, Typeform, and so on:
>
> - **Office 365**: The return caller is actually the Office 365 connector. You can specify the managed connector outbound 
> IP address prefixes for each region, or optionally, you can use the **AzureConnectors** service tag for these managed connectors.
>
> - **SAP**: The return caller depends on whether the deployment environment is either multitenant Azure. 
> In the multitenant environment, the on-premises data gateway makes the call back to the Azure Logic Apps service.

### Outbound IP addresses

For Azure Logic Apps to send outgoing communication through your firewall, you have to allow traffic in your logic app's Azure region for *all the outbound IP addresses* described in this section. If you're using Azure Government, see [Azure Government - Outbound IP addresses](#azure-government-outbound).

> [!TIP]
> 
> To help reduce complexity when you create security rules, you can optionally use the [service tag](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md), 
> **LogicApps**, rather than specify the Azure Logic Apps outbound IP address prefixes for each region. Optionally, you can also use the 
> **AzureConnectors** service tag for managed connectors that make outbound calls to their respective services, such as Azure Storage or 
> Azure Event Hubs, rather than specify the outbound managed connector IP address prefixes for each region. These tags work across the 
> regions where Azure Logic Apps is available.

If your workflow also uses any [managed connectors](../connectors/managed.md), such as the Office 365 Outlook connector or SQL connector, or uses any [custom connectors](/connectors/custom-connectors/), your firewall has to allow traffic in your logic app's Azure region for [*all the managed connector outbound IP addresses*](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses/#azure-logic-apps). If your workflow uses custom connectors that access on-premises resources through the [on-premises data gateway resource in Azure](logic-apps-gateway-connection.md), you need to set up the gateway installation to allow access for the corresponding [*managed connector* outbound IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses#azure-logic-apps). For more information about setting up communication settings on the gateway, review these topics:

* [Adjust communication settings for the on-premises data gateway](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-communication)
* [Configure proxy settings for the on-premises data gateway](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-proxy)

#### Multitenant - Outbound IP addresses

This section lists the outbound IP addresses that Azure Logic Apps requires in your logic app's Azure region to communicate through your firewall. Also, if your workflow uses any managed connectors or custom connectors, your firewall has to allow traffic in your logic app's Azure region for [*all the managed connectors' outbound IP addresses*](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses/#azure-logic-apps). If you have custom connectors that access on-premises resources through the on-premises data gateway resource in Azure, set up your *gateway installation* to allow access for the corresponding managed connector outbound IP addresses.
