# Set up Azure Monitor logs and collect diagnostics data for B2B messages in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies only to Consumption logic apps. For information about monitoring Standard logic apps, review 
> [Enable or open Application Insights after deployment for Standard logic apps](create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal.md#enable-open-application-insights).

After you set up B2B communication between trading partners in your integration account, those partners can exchange messages by using protocols such as AS2, X12, and EDIFACT. To check that this communication works the way you expect, you can set up [Azure Monitor logs](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-platform-logs) for your integration account. [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview) helps you monitor your cloud and on-premises environments so that you can more easily maintain their availability and performance. By using Azure Monitor logs, you can record and store data about runtime data and events, such as trigger events, run events, and action events in a [Log Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#send-to-log-analytics-workspace). For messages, logging also collects information such as:

* Message count and status
* Acknowledgments status
* Correlations between messages and acknowledgments
* Detailed error descriptions for failures

Azure Monitor lets you create [log queries](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview) to help you find and review this information. You can also [use this diagnostics data with other Azure services](monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data.md#other-destinations), such as Azure Storage and Azure Event Hubs.

To set up logging for your integration account, [install the Logic Apps B2B solution](#install-b2b-solution) in the Azure portal. This solution provides aggregated information for B2B message events. Then, to enable logging and creating queries for this information, set up [Azure Monitor logs](#set-up-resource-logs).

This article shows how to enable Azure Monitor logging for your integration account.

[!INCLUDE [azure-monitor-log-analytics-rebrand](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor-log-analytics-rebrand.md)]

## Prerequisites

* A Log Analytics workspace. If you don't have a Log Analytics workspace, learn [how to create a Log Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace).

* A logic app that's set up with Azure Monitor logging and sends that information to a Log Analytics workspace. Learn [how to set up Azure Monitor logs for your logic app](../logic-apps/monitor-logic-apps.md).

* An integration account that's linked to your logic app. Learn [how to link your integration account to your logic app](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md).

## Install Logic Apps B2B solution

Before Azure Monitor logs can track the B2B messages for your logic app, add the **Logic Apps B2B** solution to your Log Analytics workspace.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)'s search box, enter `log analytics workspaces`, and then select **Log Analytics workspaces**.

   ![Select "Log Analytics workspaces"](./media/monitor-b2b-messages-log-analytics/find-select-log-analytics-workspaces.png)

1. Under **Log Analytics workspaces**, select your workspace.

   ![Select your Log Analytics workspace](./media/monitor-b2b-messages-log-analytics/select-log-analytics-workspace.png)

1. On the Overview pane, under **Get started with Log Analytics** > **Configure monitoring solutions**, select **View solutions**.

   ![On Overview pane, select "View solutions"](./media/monitor-b2b-messages-log-analytics/log-analytics-workspace.png)

1. On the Overview pane, select **Add**.

   ![On overview pane, add new solution](./media/monitor-b2b-messages-log-analytics/add-logic-apps-management-solution.png)

1. After the **Marketplace** opens, in the search box, enter `logic apps b2b`, and select **Logic Apps B2B**.

   ![From Marketplace, select "Logic Apps Management"](./media/monitor-b2b-messages-log-analytics/select-logic-apps-b2b-solution.png)

1. On the solution description pane, select **Create**.

   ![Select "Create" to add "Logic Apps B2B" solution](./media/monitor-b2b-messages-log-analytics/create-logic-apps-b2b-solution.png)

1. Review and confirm the Log Analytics workspace where you want to install the solution, and select **Create** again.

   ![Select "Create" for "Logic Apps B2B"](./media/monitor-b2b-messages-log-analytics/confirm-log-analytics-workspace.png)

   After Azure deploys the solution to the Azure resource group that contains your Log Analytics workspace, the solution appears on your workspace's summary pane. When B2B messages are processed, the message count on this pane is updated.

## Set up Azure Monitor logs

You can enable Azure Monitor logging directly from your integration account.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), find and select your integration account.

   ![Find and select your integration account](./media/monitor-b2b-messages-log-analytics/find-integration-account.png)

1. On your integration account's menu, under **Monitoring**, select **Diagnostic settings**. Select **Add diagnostic setting**.

   ![Under "Monitoring", select "Diagnostics settings"](./media/monitor-b2b-messages-log-analytics/monitor-diagnostics-settings.png)

1. To create the setting, follow these steps:

   1. Provide a name for the setting.

   1. Select **Send to Log Analytics**.

   1. For **Subscription**, select the Azure subscription that's associated with your Log Analytics workspace.

   1. For **Log Analytics Workspace**, select the workspace that you want to use.

   1. Under **log**, select the **IntegrationAccountTrackingEvents** category, which specifies the event category that you want to record.

   1. When you're done, select **Save**.

   For example:

## View message status

After your logic app runs, you can view the status and data about those messages in your Log Analytics workspace.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) search box, find and open your Log Analytics workspace.

1. On your workspace's menu, select **Workspace summary** > **Logic Apps B2B**.

   ![Workspace summary pane](./media/monitor-b2b-messages-log-analytics/b2b-overview-messages-summary.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the Logic Apps B2B tile doesn't immediately show results after a run, 
   > try selecting **Refresh** or wait for a short time before trying again.

   By default, the **Logic Apps B2B** tile shows data based on a single day. To change the data scope to a different interval, select the scope control at the top of the page:

   ![Change interval](./media/monitor-b2b-messages-log-analytics/change-summary-interval.png)

1. After the message status dashboard appears, you can view more details for a specific message type, which shows data based on a single day. Select the tile for **AS2**, **X12**, or **EDIFACT**.

   ![View statuses for messages](./media/monitor-b2b-messages-log-analytics/workspace-summary-b2b-messages.png)

   A list of messages appears for your chosen tile. For example, here's what an AS2 message list might look like:

   ![Statuses and details for AS2 messages](./media/monitor-b2b-messages-log-analytics/as2-message-results-list.png)

   To learn more about the properties for each message type, see these message property descriptions:

   * [AS2 message properties](#as2-message-properties)
