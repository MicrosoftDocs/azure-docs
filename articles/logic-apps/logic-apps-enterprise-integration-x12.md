# Exchange X12 messages using workflows in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

To send and receive X12 messages in workflows that you create using Azure Logic Apps, use the **X12** connector, which provides operations that support and manage X12 communication.

This how-to guide shows how to add the X12 encoding and decoding actions to an existing logic app workflow. The **X12** connector doesn't include any triggers, so you can use any trigger to start your workflow. The examples in this guide use the [Request trigger](../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md).

## Connector technical reference

The **X12** connector has one version across workflows in [multitenant Azure Logic Apps and single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](logic-apps-overview.md#resource-environment-differences). For technical information about the **X12** connector, see the following documentation:

* [Connector reference page](/connectors/x12/), which describes the triggers, actions, and limits as documented by the connector's Swagger file

* [B2B protocol limits for message sizes](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#b2b-protocol-limits)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription yet, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An [integration account resource](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md) where you define and store artifacts, such as trading partners, agreements, certificates, and so on, for use in your enterprise integration and B2B workflows. This resource has to meet the following requirements:

  * Both your integration account and logic app resource must exist in the same Azure subscription and Azure region.

  * Defines at least two [trading partners](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-partners.md) that participate in the **X12** operation used in your workflow. The definitions for both partners must use the same X12 business identity qualifier.

  * Defines an [X12 agreement](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-agreements.md) between the trading partners that participate in your workflow. Each agreement requires a host partner and a guest partner. The content in the messages between you and the other partner must match the agreement type. For information about agreement settings to use when receiving and sending messages, see [X12 message settings](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12-message-settings.md).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >
    > If you're working with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) schemas, you have to add a 
    > `schemaReferences` section to your agreement. For more information, see [HIPAA schemas and message types](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12-message-settings.md#hipaa-schemas).

  * Defines the [schemas](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md) to use for XML validation.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >
    > If you're working with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) schemas, make sure to review [HIPAA schemas and message types](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12-message-settings.md#hipaa-schemas).

* Based on whether you're working on a Consumption or Standard logic app workflow, your logic app resource might require a link to your integration account:

  | Logic app workflow | Link required? |
  |--------------------|----------------|
  | Consumption | Connection and [link to integration account](enterprise-integration/create-integration-account.md?tabs=azure-portal%2Cconsumption#link-to-logic-app) are required. You can create the connection when you add the **X12** operation to your workflow. |
  | Standard | Connection to integration account required, but no link required. You can create the connection when you add the **X12** operation to your workflow. |

* The logic app resource and workflow where you want to use the X12 operations.

  For more information, see the following documentation:

  * [Create an example Consumption logic app workflow in multi-tenant Azure Logic Apps](quickstart-create-example-consumption-workflow.md)

  * [Create an example Standard logic app workflow in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal.md)

## Encode X12 messages

The **Encode to X12 message** operation performs the following tasks:

* Resolves the agreement by matching sender and receiver context properties.
* Serializes the EDI interchange and converts XML-encoded messages into EDI transaction sets in the interchange.
* Applies transaction set header and trailer segments.
* Generates an interchange control number, a group control number, and a transaction set control number for each outgoing interchange.
* Replaces separators in the payload data.
* Validates EDI and partner-specific properties.
  * Schema validation of transaction-set data elements against the message schema.
  * EDI validation on transaction-set data elements.
  * Extended validation on transaction-set data elements.
* Requests a Technical and Functional Acknowledgment, if configured.
  * Generates a Technical Acknowledgment as a result of header validation. The technical acknowledgment reports the status of the processing of an interchange header and trailer by the address receiver.
  * Generates a Functional Acknowledgment as a result of body validation. The functional acknowledgment reports each error encountered while processing the received document.

## Decode X12 messages

The **Decode X12 message** operation performs the following tasks:

* Validates the envelope against trading partner agreement.

* Validates EDI and partner-specific properties.

  * EDI structural validation and extended schema validation
  * Interchange envelope structural validation
  * Schema validation of the envelope against the control schema
  * Schema validation of the transaction set data elements against the message schema
  * EDI validation on transaction-set data elements

* Verifies that the interchange, group, and transaction set control numbers aren't duplicates.

  * Checks the interchange control number against previously received interchanges.
  * Checks the group control number against other group control numbers in the interchange.
  * Checks the transaction set control number against other transaction set control numbers in that group.

* Splits an interchange into transaction sets, or preserves the entire interchange:

  * Split the interchange into transaction sets or suspend transaction sets on error: Parse each transaction set. The X12 decode action outputs only the transaction sets that fail validation to `badMessages`, and outputs the remaining transactions sets to `goodMessages`.

  * Split the interchange into transaction sets or suspend interchange on error: Parse each transaction set. If one or more transaction sets in the interchange fail validation, the X12 decode action outputs all the transaction sets in that interchange to `badMessages`.

  * Preserve the interchange or suspend transaction sets on error: Preserve the interchange and process the entire batched interchange. The X12 decode action outputs only the transaction sets that fail validation to `badMessages`, and outputs the remaining transactions sets to `goodMessages`.

  * Preserve the interchange or suspend interchange on error: Preserve the interchange and process the entire batched interchange. If one or more transaction sets in the interchange fail validation, the X12 decode action outputs all the transaction sets in that interchange to `badMessages`.

* Generates a Technical and Functional Acknowledgment, if configured.

  * Generates a Technical Acknowledgment as a result of header validation. The technical acknowledgment reports the status of the processing of an interchange header and trailer by the address receiver.
  * Generates a Functional Acknowledgment as a result of body validation. The functional acknowledgment reports each error encountered while processing the received document.
