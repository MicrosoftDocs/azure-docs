# Quickstart: Create and deploy a Consumption logic app workflow in multi-tenant Azure Logic Apps with Bicep

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption.md)]

[Azure Logic Apps](logic-apps-overview.md) is a cloud service that helps you create and run automated workflows that integrate data, apps, cloud-based services, and on-premises systems by choosing from [hundreds of connectors](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-logicapps-connectors). This quickstart focuses on the process for deploying a Bicep file to create a basic [Consumption logic app workflow](logic-apps-overview.md#resource-environment-differences) that checks the status for Azure on an hourly schedule and runs in [multi-tenant Azure Logic Apps](logic-apps-overview.md#resource-environment-differences).

[!INCLUDE [About Bicep](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/resource-manager-quickstart-bicep-introduction.md)]

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you start.

## Review the Bicep file

The Bicep file used in this quickstart is from [Azure Quickstart Templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/quickstarts/microsoft.logic/logic-app-create/main.bicep).

The quickstart template creates a Consumption logic app workflow that uses the [*built-in*](../connectors/built-in.md) Recurrence trigger, which is set to run every hour, and a built-in HTTP action, which calls a URL that returns the status for Azure. Built-in operations run natively on Azure Logic Apps platform.

This Bicep file creates the following Azure resource:

* [**Microsoft.Logic/workflows**](/azure/templates/microsoft.logic/workflows), which creates the workflow for a logic app.

:::code language="bicep" source="~/quickstart-templates/quickstarts/microsoft.logic/logic-app-create/main.bicep":::

## Deploy the Bicep file

1. Save the Bicep file as **main.bicep** to your local computer.
1. Deploy the Bicep file using either Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell.

   # [CLI](#tab/CLI)

   ```azurecli
   az group create --name exampleRG --location eastus
   az deployment group create --resource-group exampleRG --template-file main.bicep --parameters logicAppName=<logic-name>
   ```

   # [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

   ```azurepowershell
   New-AzResourceGroup -Name exampleRG -Location eastus
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName exampleRG -TemplateFile ./main.bicep -logicAppName "<logic-name>"
   ```

   ---

   > [!NOTE]
   > Replace **\<logic-name\>** with the name of the logic app to create.

   When the deployment finishes, you should see a message indicating the deployment succeeded.

## Review deployed resources

Use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell to list the deployed resources in the resource group.

# [CLI](#tab/CLI)

```azurecli-interactive
az resource list --resource-group exampleRG
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName exampleRG
```

---

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the logic app, use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell to delete the resource group and its resources.

# [CLI](#tab/CLI)

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name exampleRG
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name exampleRG
```
