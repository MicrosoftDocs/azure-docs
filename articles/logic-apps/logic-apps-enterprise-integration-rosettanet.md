# Exchange RosettaNet messages for B2B integration using workflows in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption.md)]

To send and receive RosettaNet messages in workflows that you create using Azure Logic Apps, you can use the RosettaNet connector, which provides actions that manage and support communication that follows RosettaNet standards. RosettaNet is a non-profit consortium that has established standard processes for sharing business information. These standards are commonly used for supply chain processes and are widespread in the semiconductor, electronics, and logistics industries. The RosettaNet consortium creates and maintains Partner Interface Processes (PIPs), which provide common business process definitions for all RosettaNet message exchanges. RosettaNet is based on XML and defines message guidelines, interfaces for business processes, and implementation frameworks for communication between companies. For more information, visit the [RosettaNet site](https://www.gs1us.org/resources/rosettanet).

The connector is based on the RosettaNet Implementation Framework (RNIF) version 2.0.01 and supports all PIPs defined by this version. RNIF is an open network application framework that enables business partners to collaboratively run RosettaNet PIPs. This framework defines the message structure, the need for acknowledgments, Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) encoding, and the digital signature. Communication with the partner can be synchronous or asynchronous. The connector provides the following capabilities:

* Receive or decode RosettaNet messages.
* Send or encode RosettaNet messages.
* Wait for the response and generation of Notification of Failure.

This how-to guide shows how to send and receive RosettaNet messages in workflows using Azure Logic Apps and the RosettaNet connector by completing the following tasks: 

* Add a PIP process configuration, if you don't have one already.
* Create a RosettaNet agreement.
* Add an action that receives or decodes RosettaNet messages.
* Add an action that sends or encodes RosettaNet messages.

## RosettaNet concepts

The following concepts and terms are unique to the RosettaNet specification and are important to know when you build RosettaNet-based integration workflows:

* **PIP**

  The RosettaNet organization creates and maintains PIPs, which provide common business process definitions for all RosettaNet message exchanges. Each PIP specification provides a document type definition (DTD) file and a message guideline document. The DTD file defines the service-content message structure. The message guideline document, which is a human-readable HTML file, specifies element-level constraints. Together, these files provide a complete definition of the business process.

   PIPs are categorized by a high-level business function, or cluster, and a subfunction, or segment. For example, "3A4" is the PIP for Purchase Order, while "3" is the Order Management function, and "3A" is the Quote & Order Entry subfunction. For more information, visit the [RosettaNet site](https://www.gs1us.org/resources/rosettanet).

* **Action**

  Part of a PIP, action messages are business messages that are exchanged between partners.

* **Signal**

   Part of a PIP, signal messages are acknowledgments that are sent in response to action messages.

* **Single action and double action**

  For a single-action PIP, the only response is an acknowledgment signal message. For a double-action PIP, the initiator receives a response message and replies with an acknowledgment in addition to the single-action message flow.

## Connector technical reference

The RosettaNet connector is available only for Consumption logic app workflows.

| Logic app | Environment | Connector version |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Consumption** | Multitenant Azure Logic Apps | Managed connector, which appears in the designer under the **Standard** label. The **RosettaNet** connector provides only actions, but you can use any trigger that works for your scenario. For more information, review the following documentation: <br><br>- [RosettaNet connector operations](#rosettanet-operations) <br>- [B2B protocol limits for message sizes](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#b2b-protocol-limits) <br>- [Managed connectors in Azure Logic Apps](../connectors/managed.md) |

### RosettaNet operations

The **RosettaNet** connector has no triggers. The following table describes the actions that the **RosettaNet** connector provides for establishing security and reliability when transmitting messages:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [**RosettaNet Encode** action](#send-encode-rosettanet) | Send RosettaNet messages using encoding that follows RosettaNet standards. |
| [**RosettaNet Decode** action](#receive-decode-rosettanet) | Receive RosettaNet messages using decoding that follows RosettaNet standards. |
| [**RosettaNet wait for response** action](#send-encode-rosettanet) | Have the host wait for a RosettaNet response or signal message from the receiver. |

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* The Consumption logic app resource and workflow where you want to use the RosettaNet operations.

* An [integration account](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md) for storing your agreement and other business-to-business (B2B) artifacts.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >
  > To work together, both your integration account and logic app resource must exist in the same Azure subscription and Azure region. 
  > To use integration account artifacts in your workflow, make sure to [link your logic app resource to your integration account](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md?tabs=consumption#link-account).

* At least two [partners](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-partners.md) defined in your integration account and use the **DUNS** qualifier under **Business Identities** in the Azure portal.

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > Make sure that you select **DUNS** as the qualifier, which you can find near the 
  > bottom of the **Qualifier** list, and not **1 - D-U-N-S (Dun & Bradstreet)**.

* Optional [certificates](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-certificates.md) for encrypting, decrypting, or signing the messages that you upload to the integration account. Certificates are required only if you use signing or encryption.

After you complete these steps, you're ready to send or receive RosettaNet messages.

<a name="receive-decode-rosettanet"></a>

## Receive or decode RosettaNet messages

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Consumption logic app workflow in the designer.

   Your workflow should already have a trigger and any other actions that you want to run before you add the RosettaNet action. This example continues with the Request trigger.

1. Under the trigger or action, select **New step**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-rosettanet/request-trigger.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the designer. Under the Request trigger, New step is selected.":::

1. Under the **Choose an operation** search box, select **All**. In the search box, enter **rosettanet**. From the actions list, select the action named **RosettaNet Decode**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-rosettanet/select-decode-rosettanet-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the designer. The Choose an operation search box contains rosettanet, and the RosettaNet Decode action is selected.":::

1. Enter the information for the action's properties:

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-rosettanet/decode-action-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the RosettaNet Decode action where boxes are available for the message, the headers, and the role.":::

   | Property | Required | Description |
   |----------|----------|-------------|
   | **Message** | Yes | The RosettaNet message to decode  |
   | **Headers** | Yes | The HTTP headers that provide the values for the version, which is the RNIF version, and the response type, which indicates the communication type between the partners and can be synchronous or asynchronous |
   | **Role** | Yes | The role of the host partner in the PIP |

   The output of the RosettaNet Decode action includes **Outbound signal**. You can encode this output and return it to the partner, or you can take any other action on this output.

<a name="send-encode-rosettanet"></a>

## Send or encode RosettaNet messages

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Consumption logic app workflow in the designer.

   Your workflow should already have a trigger and any other actions that you want to run before you add the RosettaNet action. This example continues with the Request trigger.

1. Under the trigger or action, select **New step**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-rosettanet/request-trigger.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the designer. Under the Request trigger, New step is selected.":::

1. Under the **Choose an operation** search box, select **All**. In the search box, enter **rosettanet**. From the actions list, select the action named **RosettaNet Encode**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-rosettanet/select-encode-rosettanet-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the designer. The Choose an operation search box contains rosettanet, and the RosettaNet Encode action is selected.":::

1. Enter the information for the action's properties:

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-rosettanet/encode-action-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the RosettaNet Encode action where boxes appear for the message, the partners, PIP information, the message type, and the role.":::

   | Property | Required | Description |
   |----------|----------|-------------|
   | **Message** | Yes | The RosettaNet message to encode  |
   | **Host partner** | Yes | The host partner name |
   | **Guest partner** | Yes | The guest partner name |
   | **PIP code** | Yes | The PIP code |
   | **PIP version** | Yes | The PIP version |  
   | **PIP instance identity** | Yes | The unique identifier for this PIP message |  
   | **Message type** | Yes | The type of the message to encode |  
   | **Role** | Yes | The role of the host partner |

   The encoded message is now ready to send to the partner.

1. To send the encoded message, the following example uses the **HTTP** action, which is renamed **HTTP - Send encoded message to partner**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-rosettanet/send-rosettanet-message-to-partner.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the designer with an HTTP action renamed as HTTP - Send encoded message to partner, and the URI, header, and body values are entered.":::

   According to RosettaNet standards, business transactions are considered complete only when all the steps defined by the PIP are complete.

1. After the host sends the encoded message to a partner, the host waits for the signal and acknowledgment. To accomplish this task, add the action named **RosettaNet wait for response**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-rosettanet/rosettanet-wait-for-response-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a RosettaNet wait for response action where boxes are available for the body, PIP instance identity, retry count, and role.":::

   The duration to use for waiting and the number of retries are based on the PIP configuration in your integration account. If the response isn't received, a Notification of Failure is generated. To handle retries, always put the **Encode** and **Wait for response** actions in an **Until** loop.

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-rosettanet/rosettanet-loop.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the designer. An Until loop contains actions for encoding and sending messages and for waiting for responses.":::

## RosettaNet templates

To accelerate development and recommend integration patterns, you can use Consumption logic app templates for decoding and encoding RosettaNet messages. When you create a Consumption logic app workflow, you can select from the template gallery in the designer. You can also find these templates in the [GitHub repository for Azure Logic Apps](https://github.com/Azure/logicapps).

:::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-rosettanet/decode-encode-rosettanet-templates.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the designer. The Enterprise Integration category and templates for decoding and encoding RosettaNet messages are selected.":::
