# Reference for X12 message settings in agreements for Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

This reference describes the properties that you can set in an X12 agreement for specifying how to handle messages between [trading partners](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-partners.md). Set up these properties based on your agreement with the partner that exchanges messages with you.

<a name="inbound-acknowledgment"></a>

### Acknowledgment

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **TA1 Expected** | Return a technical acknowledgment (TA1) to the interchange sender. |
| **FA Expected** | Return a functional acknowledgment (FA) to the interchange sender. <br><br>For the **FA Version** property, based on the schema version, select the 997 or 999 acknowledgments. <br><br>To enable generation of AK2 loops in functional acknowledgments for accepted transaction sets, select **Include AK2 / IK2 Loop**. |

<a name="inbound-schemas"></a>

### Schemas

For this section, select a [schema](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md) from your [integration account](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md) for each transaction type (ST01) and Sender Application (GS02). The EDI Receive Pipeline disassembles the incoming message by matching the values and schema that you set in this section with the values for ST01 and GS02 in the incoming message and with the schema of the incoming message. After you complete each row, a new empty row automatically appears.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Version** | The X12 version for the schema |
| **Transaction Type (ST01)** | The transaction type |
| **Sender Application (GS02)** | The sender application |
| **Schema** | The schema file that you want to use |

<a name="inbound-envelopes"></a>

### Envelopes

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **ISA11 Usage** | The separator to use in a transaction set: <br><br>- **Standard Identifier**: Use a period (.) for decimal notation, rather than the decimal notation of the incoming document in the EDI Receive Pipeline. <br><br>- **Repetition Separator**: Specify the separator for repeated occurrences of a simple data element or a repeated data structure. For example, usually the carat (^) is used as the repetition separator. For HIPAA schemas, you can only use the carat. |

<a name="inbound-control-numbers"></a>

### Control Numbers

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Disallow Interchange control number duplicates** | Block duplicate interchanges. Check the interchange control number (ISA13) for the received interchange control number. If a match is detected, the EDI Receive Pipeline doesn't process the interchange. <br><br><br><br>To specify the number of days to perform the check, enter a value for the **Check for duplicate ISA13 every (days)** property. |
| **Disallow Group control number duplicates** | Block interchanges that have duplicate group control numbers. |
| **Disallow Transaction set control number duplicates** | Block interchanges that have duplicate transaction set control numbers. |

<a name="inbound-validations"></a>

### Validations

The **Default** row shows the validation rules that are used for an EDI message type. If you want to define different rules, select each box where you want the rule set to **true**. After you complete each row, a new empty row automatically appears.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Message Type** | The EDI message type |
| **EDI Validation** | Perform EDI validation on data types as defined by the schema's EDI properties, length restrictions, empty data elements, and trailing separators. |
| **Extended Validation** | If the data type isn't EDI, validation is on the data element requirement and allowed repetition, enumerations, and data element length validation (min or max). |
| **Allow Leading/Trailing Zeroes** | Keep any additional leading or trailing zero and space characters. Don't remove these characters. |
| **Trim Leading/Trailing Zeroes** | Remove any leading or trailing zero and space characters. |
| **Trailing Separator Policy** | Generate trailing separators. <br><br>- **Not Allowed**: Prohibit trailing delimiters and separators in the inbound interchange. If the interchange has trailing delimiters and separators, the interchange is declared not valid. <br><br>- **Optional**: Accept interchanges with or without trailing delimiters and separators. <br><br>- **Mandatory**: The inbound interchange must have trailing delimiters and separators. |

## HIPAA schemas and message types

When you work with HIPAA schemas and the 277 or 837 message types, you need to perform a few extra steps. The [document version numbers (GS8)](#outbound-control-version-number) for these message types have more than nine characters, for example, "005010X222A1". Also, some document version numbers map to variant message types. If you don't reference the correct message type in your schema and in your agreement, you get this error message:

`"The message has an unknown document type and did not resolve to any of the existing schemas configured in the agreement."`

This table lists the affected message types, any variants, and the document version numbers that map to those message types:

| Message type or variant |  Description | Document version number (GS8) |
|-------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| 277 | Health Care Information Status Notification | 005010X212 |
| 837_I | Health Care Claim Institutional | 004010X096A1 <br>005010X223A1 <br>005010X223A2 |
| 837_D | Health Care Claim Dental | 004010X097A1 <br>005010X224A1 <br>005010X224A2 |
| 837_P | Health Care Claim Professional | 004010X098A1 <br>005010X222 <br>005010X222A1 |

You also need to disable EDI validation when you use these document version numbers because they result in an error that the character length is invalid.

To specify these document version numbers and message types, follow these steps:

> [!NOTE]
>
> Each message with 837_P, 837_I, or 837_D type requires a separate agreement.

1. In your HIPAA schema, replace the current message type with the variant message type for the document version number that you want to use.

   For example, suppose you want to use document version number `005010X222A1` with the `837` message type. In your schema, replace each `"X12_00501_837"` value with the `"X12_00501_837_P"` value instead.

   To update your schema, follow these steps:

   1. In the Azure portal, go to your integration account. Find and download your schema. Replace the message type and rename the schema file, and upload your revised schema to your integration account. For more information, see [Edit a schema](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md#edit-schema).

   1. In your agreement's message settings, select the revised schema.

1. In your agreement's `schemaReferences` object, add another entry that specifies the variant message type that matches your document version number.

   For example, suppose you want to use document version number `005010X222A1` for the `837` message type. Your agreement has a `schemaReferences` section with these properties and values:

   ```json
   "schemaReferences": [
      {
         "messageId": "837",
         "schemaVersion": "00501",
         "schemaName": "X12_00501_837"
      }
   ]
   ```

   Edit your `schemaReferences` section to look like the following example:

   ```json
   "schemaReferences": [
      {
         "messageId": "837",
         "schemaVersion": "00501",
         "schemaName": "X12_00501_837_P"
      }
   ]
   ```

1. In your agreement's message settings, disable EDI validation by clearing the **EDI Validation** checkbox either for each message type or for all message types if you're using the **Default** values.
