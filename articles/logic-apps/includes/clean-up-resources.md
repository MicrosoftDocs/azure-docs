## Clean up example resources

If you don't need the resources that you created for the examples, make sure to delete the resources so that you don't continue to get charged. You can either follow these steps to delete the resource group that contains these resources, or you can delete each resource individually.

1. In the Azure search box, enter **resource groups**, and select **Resource groups**.

1. Find and select the resource groups that contain the resources for this example.

1. On the **Overview** page, select **Delete resource group**.

1. When the confirmation pane appears, enter the resource group name, and select **Delete**.
