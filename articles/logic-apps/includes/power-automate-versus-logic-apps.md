|------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Workflow automation with advanced features for enterprise developers | Same as Standard | Workflow automation for citizen developers and business users |
| **Users** | Professional integrators and developers, IT professionals, administrators who use Office 365 and Azure services | Same as Standard | Citizen developers, business users, office workers, Power Platform solution creators, SharePoint administrators, Office 365 users and makers |
| **Pricing or licensing model** | Fixed pricing - Azure subscription | Consumption (Pay per execution) - Azure subscription | Microsoft 365 per user license |
| **Development environment** | Visual designer and JSON code view in the following locations: <br><br>- [Browser-based Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) <br>- Locally installed Visual Studio Code | Visual designer and JSON code view in the following locations: <br><br>- [Browser-based Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) <br>- Locally installed Visual Studio Code | [Browser-based visual designer](https://make.preview.powerautomate.com/) and mobile app with UI only |
| **Integration** | - 1,400+ connectors for Microsoft, Azure, and non-Microsoft services, apps, and data. Includes more built-in operation types, which offer greater throughput than Consumption along with direct access to virtual network integration <br><br>- On-premises systems support <br><br>- B2B capabilities <br><br>- Create your own connectors <br><br>- Integrate with hybrid solutions | Same as Standard but with fewer built-in operation types, less throughput capacity, no virtual network direct access, and no hybrid deployment option | 1,400+ connectors for Microsoft and non-Microsoft services, apps, systems, and data, such as SharePoint, Dynamics 365, and others |
| **Trigger types** | - Schedule-driven or *polling*, such as **Recurrence** and many service-based triggers, such as **When a new email arrives** <br><br>- Event-driven or *push*, such as **Request** (inbound) and some service-based triggers, such as Event Grid <br><br>- HTTP call (outbound), such as **HTTP** | Same as Standard | - Schedule-driven or *polling*, such as **Recurrence** and many service-based triggers, such as **When a new email arrives** <br><br>- Event-driven or *push*, such as **Request** (inbound) and some service-based triggers, such as Event Grid <br><br>- User activity-based, such as **Flow button** or specific connectors Instant, UI Flow, Business Process |
| **Custom integration** | Complex logic support through Azure Functions, custom APIs, and integration with external code repositories | Same as Standard | Limited to mostly no code or low code |
| **Security** | - Managed identity <br><br>- [OAuth 2.0 with Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/architecture/auth-oauth2) <br><br>- [Granular role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app#standard-workflows) <br><br>- Virtual network integration and private endpoints <br><br>- Compliance certifications <br><br>- [Data encryption at rest](/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest) <br><br>- [Data encryption in transit](/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-overview#encryption-of-data-in-transit) <br><br>- [Azure Policy definitions](/azure/logic-apps/security-controls-policy) <br><br>- [Azure security audit logs](/azure/security/fundamentals/log-audit) | - Managed identity <br><br>- [OAuth 2.0 with Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/architecture/auth-oauth2) <br><br>- [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app#consumption-workflows) <br><br>- Compliance certifications <br><br>- [Restricted connectors](/azure/logic-apps/block-connections-connectors) <br><br>- [Data encryption at rest](/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest) <br><br>- [Data encryption in transit](/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-overview#encryption-of-data-in-transit) <br><br>- [Azure Policy definitions](/azure/logic-apps/security-controls-policy) <br><br>- [Azure security audit logs](/azure/security/fundamentals/log-audit) | - Basic user roles and permissions with Microsoft Entra ID <br><br>- [Microsoft 365 security audit logs](/power-platform/admin/logging-power-automate) <br><br>- [Data loss prevention (DLP)](/power-platform/admin/wp-data-loss-prevention) <br><br>- [Data encryption at rest](/power-platform/admin/about-encryption#at-rest-data-protection) <br><br>- [Data encryption in transit](/power-platform/admin/about-encryption#in-transit-data-protection) |
| **Scalability** | Large scale workflows with high throughput and low latency | Small to medium scale workflows | Small to medium scale workflows |
| **Performance** | Dedicated resources single-tenant Azure Logic Apps or App Service Environment (ASE), faster execution, parallel processing, and better performance optimization | High throughput for actions, otherwise limited by shared resources in multitenant Azure Logic Apps | Suitable for lower-scale automation, limited by shared resources in Power Automate |
| **Business continuity and disaster recovery** (BCDR) | Built-in geo-redundancy, multiregion deployment, high availability with automated failover | Built-in geo-redundancy, multiregion deployment, high availability with automated failover | Limited regional deployment options |
| **Monitoring and diagnostics** | - [Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and custom alerts](/azure/logic-apps/monitor-logic-apps-overview) <br><br>- [Monitor with Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/logic-apps/healthy-unhealthy-resource)  <br><br>- [Health Check](/azure/logic-apps/monitor-health-standard-workflows) <br><br>- [Enhanced telemetry](/azure/logic-apps/enable-enhanced-telemetry-standard-workflows) | Same as Standard except for Health Check and enhanced telemetry | - Basic monitoring through the Power Automate portal <br><br>- Custom injection into Application Insights |
