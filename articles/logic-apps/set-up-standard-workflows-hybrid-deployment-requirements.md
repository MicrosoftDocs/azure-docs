Sometimes you have to set up and manage your own infrastructure to meet specific needs for regulatory compliance, data privacy, or network restrictions. Azure Logic Apps offers a *hybrid deployment model* so that you can deploy and host Standard logic app workflows in on-premises, private cloud, or public cloud scenarios. This model gives you the capabilities to host integration solutions in partially connected environments when you need to use local processing, data storage, and network access. With the hybrid option, you have the freedom and flexibility to choose the best environment for your workflows.

## How hybrid deployment works

Standard logic app workflows with the hybrid deployment option are powered by an Azure Logic Apps runtime that is hosted in an Azure Container Apps extension. In your workflow, any [built-in operations](../connectors/built-in.md) run locally with the runtime so that you get higher throughput for access to local data sources. If you need access to non-local data resources, for example, cloud-based services such as Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Teams, Salesforce, GitHub, LinkedIn, or ServiceNow, you can choose operations from [1,000+ connectors hosted in Azure](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-logicapps-connectors) to include in your workflows. For more information, see [Managed (shared) connectors](../connectors/managed.md). Although you need to have internet connectivity to manage your logic app in the Azure portal, the semi-connected nature of this platform lets you absorb any temporary internet connectivity issues.

For example, if you have an on-premises scenario, the following architectural overview shows where Standard logic app workflows are hosted and run in the hybrid model. The partially connected environment includes the following resources for hosting and working with your Standard logic apps, which deploy as Azure Container Apps resources:

- Azure Arc-enabled Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters
- A SQL database to locally store workflow run history, inputs, and outputs for processing
- A Server Message Block (SMB) file share to locally store artifacts used by your workflows

:::image type="content" source="media/set-up-standard-workflows-hybrid-deployment-requirements/architecture-overview.png" alt-text="Diagram with architectural overview for where Standard logic apps are hosted in a partially connected environment." border="false":::

For hosting, you can also set up and use [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters on Azure Local](/azure/azure-local/overview) or [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters on Windows Server](/azure/aks/hybrid/kubernetes-walkthrough-powershell).

For more information, see the following documentation:

- [What is Azure Kubernetes Service?](/azure/aks/what-is-aks)
- [Core concepts for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads)
- [Custom locations for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters](/azure/azure-arc/platform/conceptual-custom-locations)
- [What is Azure Container Apps?](../container-apps/overview.md)
- [Azure Container Apps on Azure Arc](../container-apps/azure-arc-overview.md)

This how-to guide shows how to set up the necessary on-premises resources in your infrastructure so that you can create, deploy, and host a Standard logic app workflow using the hybrid deployment model.

<a name="billing"></a>

## How billing works

The hybrid option uses a billing model where you pay only for what you need and can scale resources for dynamic workloads without having to buy for peak usage. You're responsible for the following items:

- Your Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes infrastructure

- Your SQL Server license

- Billing charges for vCPU usage to support Standard logic app workloads

  For more information, see the following sections:

  - [vCPU usage calculation](#vcpu-usage-calculation)
  - [Billing charge calculation](#billing-charge-calculation)

- Billing charges for any [managed (shared) connector operations](../connectors/managed.md), such as Microsoft Teams or Microsoft Office 365, in your logic app workflows.

  These operation executions follow [Standard pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/logic-apps/#pricing).

<a name="vcpu-usage-calculation"></a>

### vCPU usage calculation

The vCPU usage for your Standard logic app affects your billing charges. A *vCPU* refers to the number of CPU cores, but this ratio isn't necessarily 1:1. The following formula calculates the vCPU usage for your logic app:

**vCPU usage** = (**# of allocated vCPUs**) x (**# of replicas**)

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **# of allocated vCPUs** | By default, your logic app is allocated a default number of vCPUs. You can [change this vCPU allocation](create-standard-workflows-hybrid-deployment.md#change-vcpu-and-memory-allocation-in-the-azure-portal) anytime after you create your logic app resource. <br><br>**Note**: Any vCPUs that you allocate to your logic app come from *replica* vCPUs, so your allocation range is from 0.25 to 2 cores. For more information, see the next row. |
| **# of replicas** | A [*replica*](create-standard-workflows-hybrid-deployment.md#change-replica-scaling-in-azure-portal) is a new instance of a logic app resource revision or version that deploys when a workflow trigger event occurs. This number of replicas can vary due to your app's scaling needs at any given time. You can [change the minimum and maximum number of replicas](create-standard-workflows-hybrid-deployment.md#change-replica-scaling-in-azure-portal) that each version or revision can have to meet your scaling needs. <br><br>**Note**: Each replica is limited to two vCPUs. Any vCPUs that you allocate to your logic app come from replica vCPUs, so your allocation range is 0.25 to 2 cores. |

<a name="billing-charge-calculation"></a>

### Billing charge calculation

The following formula calculates your billing charge per hour, which is based on vCPU usage and at the rate of $0.18 USD per hour while your logic app is enabled:

**Charge per hour** = (**vCPU usage**) x (**rate per hour**)

For example, the following table shows some example billing charge calculations:

| # of allocated vCPUs | # of replicas | vCPU usage | $USD rate per hour | Charge per hour |
|----------------------|---------------|------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 1 | (1 x 1) = 1 | $0.18 | (1 x $0.18) = **$0.18** |
| 0.5 | 2 | (0.5 x 2) = 1 | $0.18 | (1 x $0.18) = **$0.18** |
| 0.5 | 1 | (0.5 x 1) = 0.5 | $0.18 | (0.5 x $0.18) = **$0.09** |

## Limitations

- Hybrid deployment is currently available and supported only for the following Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters:

  - Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters
  - Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters on Azure Local (formerly Azure Stack HCI)
  - Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters on Windows Server

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- Basic understanding about [core AKS concepts](/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads)

- [Technical requirements for working with Azure CLI](/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli#before-you-begin)

- [Technical requirements for Azure Container Apps on Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](/azure/container-apps/azure-arc-overview#prerequisites), including access to a public or private container registry, such as the [Azure Container Registry](/azure/container-registry/).

## Create a Kubernetes cluster

Before you can deploy your Standard logic app as on-premises resource to an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster in an Azure Container Apps connected environment, you first need a [Kubernetes cluster](/azure/aks/core-aks-concepts#cluster-components). You'll later connect this cluster to Azure Arc so that you have an [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/overview).

Your Kubernetes cluster requires inbound and outbound connectivity with the [SQL database that you later create as the storage provider](#create-storage-provider) and with the [Server Message Block file share that you later create for artifacts storage](#set-up-smb-file-share). These resources must exist within the same network.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can also create a [Kubernetes cluster on Azure Local](/azure/azure-local/overview) 
> or [Kubernetes cluster on Windows Server](/azure/aks/hybrid/overview) and apply the steps in this guide 
> to connect your cluster to Azure Arc and set up your connected environment. For more information about 
> Azure Local and AKS on Windows Server, see the following resources:

> - [Set up an Azure Kubernetes Service host on Azure Local and Windows Server and deploy a workload cluster using PowerShell](/azure/aks/aksarc/kubernetes-walkthrough-powershell)

1. Set the following environment variables for the Kubernetes cluster that you want to create:

   ```azurecli
   SUBSCRIPTION="<Azure-subscription-ID>"
   AKS_CLUSTER_GROUP_NAME="<aks-cluster-resource-group-name>"
   AKS_NAME="<aks-cluster-name>"
   LOCATION="eastus"

      --generate-ssh-keys \
      --enable-cluster-autoscaler \
      --max-count 6 \
      --min-count 1
   ```

   | Parameter | Required | Value | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **`max count`** | No | <*max-nodes-value*> | The maximum number of nodes to use for the autoscaler when you include the **`enable-cluster-autoscaler`** option. This value ranges from **1** to **1000**. |

<a name="update-coredns-azure-local"></a>

## Update CoreDNS for a Kubernetes cluster in Azure Local

If your Azure Kubernetes cluster is hosted in Azure Local, you must manually update the CoreDNS configuration for your cluster. This step adds a new *config map* to your Azure Kubernetes namespace. In comparison, Azure Logic Apps automatically completes this step when your Kubernetes cluster is hosted in Azure. However, for a cluster hosted elsewhere, you must manually complete this step.

For more information, see the following documentation:

- [CoreDNS for Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#coredns)
- [Customize CoreDNS for Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/coredns-custom)
- [ConfigMaps in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/)
- [Namespaces - core concepts for Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/core-aks-concepts#namespaces)

To update the CoreDNS configuration, run the following Azure CLI command using the options for your scenario:

```azurecli
az containerapp arc setup-core-dns
```

| Parameters | Required | Description |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| **`--distro`** | Yes | The supported distribution to use for updating the CoreDNS configuration. Allowed values: `AksAzureLocal` |
| **`--kube-config`** | No | The path to the ([*kubeconfig file*](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/)), which contains the configuration parameters for accessing Kubernetes clusters. |
| **`--kube-context`** | No | The kubeconfig context from the on-premises host for your cluster. In Kubernetes, a *context* defines how to communicate with a Kubernetes cluster. |
| **`skip-ssl-verification`** | No | Skip SSL verification for any cluster connection. |
| **`--yes -y`** | No | Don't prompt for confirmation. |

For more information, such as global parameters, see [**az containerapp arc setup-core-dns**](/cli/azure/containerapp/arc#az-containerapp-arc-setup-core-dns).

### Examples

- Set up CoreDNS configuration for Azure Local:

  ```azurecli
  az containerapp arc setup-core-dns --distro AksAzureLocal
  ```

- Set up CoreDNS configuration for Azure Local using a Kubernetes configuration file and the Kubernetes context:

   ```azurecli
   az containerapp arc setup-core-dns --distro AksAzureLocal --kube-config <kubeconfig-file-path> --kube-context <kubeconfig-context-name>
   ```

## Create SQL Server storage provider

Standard logic app workflows in the hybrid deployment model use a SQL database as the storage provider for the data used by workflows and the Azure Logic Apps runtime, for example, workflow run history, inputs, outputs, and so on. 

Your SQL database requires inbound and outbound connectivity with your Kubernetes cluster, so these resources must exist in the same network.

1. Set up any of the following SQL Server editions:

   - SQL Server on premises
   - [Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-database-paas-overview)
   - [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview)
   - [SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc](/sql/sql-server/azure-arc/overview)

   For more information, see [Set up SQL database storage for Standard logic app workflows](/azure/logic-apps/set-up-sql-db-storage-single-tenant-standard-workflows).

1. Confirm that your SQL database is in the same network as your Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster and SMB file share.

1. Find and save the connection string for the SQL database that you created.

<a name="set-up-smb-file-share"></a>

## Set up SMB file share for artifacts storage

To store artifacts such as maps, schemas, and assemblies for your logic app (container app) resource, you need to have a file share that uses the [Server Message Block (SMB) protocol](/windows/win32/fileio/microsoft-smb-protocol-and-cifs-protocol-overview).

- You need administrator access to set up your SMB file share.

- Your SMB file share must exist in the same network as your Kubernetes cluster and SQL database.

- Your SMB file share requires inbound and outbound connectivity with your Kubernetes cluster. If you enabled Azure virtual network restrictions, make sure that your file share exists in the same virtual network as your Kubernetes cluster or in a peered virtual network.

- Don't use the same exact file share path for multiple logic apps.

- You can use separate SMB file shares for each logic app, or you can use different folders in the same SMB file share as long as those folders aren't nested. For example, don't have a logic app use the root path, and then have another logic app use a subfolder.

- To deploy your logic app using Visual Studio Code, make sure that the local computer with Visual Studio Code can access the file share.

### Set up your SMB file share on Windows

Make sure that your SMB file share exists in the same virtual network as the cluster where you mount your file share.

1. In Windows, go to the folder that you want to share, open the shortcut menu, select **Properties**.

1. On the **Sharing** tab, select **Share**.

1. In the box that opens, select a person who you want to have access to the file share.

1. Select **Share**, and copy the link for the network path.

   If your local computer isn't connected to a domain, replace the computer name in the network path with the IP address.

1. Save the IP address to use later as the host name.

### Set up Azure Files as your SMB file share

Alternatively, for testing purposes, you can use [Azure Files as an SMB file share](/azure/storage/files/files-smb-protocol). Make sure that your SMB file share exists in the same virtual network as the cluster where you mount your file share.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), [create an Azure storage account](/azure/storage/files/storage-how-to-create-file-share?tabs=azure-portal#create-a-storage-account).

1. From the storage account menu, under **Data storage**, select **File shares**.

1. From the **File shares** page toolbar, select **+ File share**, and provide the required information for your SMB file share.

1. After deployment completes, select **Go to resource**.

1. On the file share menu, select **Overview**, if not selected.

1. On the **Overview** page toolbar, select **Connect**. On the **Connect** pane, select **Show script**.

1. Copy the following values and save them somewhere safe for later use:

   - File share's host name, for example, **mystorage.file.core.windows.net**
   - File share path
   - Username without **`localhost\`**
   - Password

1. On the **Overview** page toolbar, select **+ Add directory**, and provide a name to use for the directory. Save this name to use later.

You need these saved values to provide your SMB file share information when you deploy your logic app resource.

For more information, see [Create an SMB Azure file share](/azure/storage/files/storage-how-to-create-file-share?tabs=azure-portal).

## Confirm SMB file share connection

To test the connection between your Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster and your SMB file share, and to check that your file share is correctly set up, follow these steps:

- If your SMB file share isn't on the same cluster, confirm that the ping operation works from your Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster to the virtual machine that has your SMB file share. To check that the ping operation works, follow these steps:

  1. In your Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster, create a test [pod](/azure/aks/core-aks-concepts#pods) that runs any Linux image, such as BusyBox or Ubuntu.

  1. Go to the container in your pod, and install the **iputils-ping** package by running the following Linux commands:

     ```
     apt-get update
     apt-get install iputils-ping
     ```

- To confirm that your SMB file share is correctly set up, follow these steps:

  1. In your test pod with the same Linux image, create a folder that has the path named **mnt/smb**.

  1. Go to the root or home directory that contains the **mnt** folder.

  1. Run the following command:

     **`- mount -t cifs //{ip-address-smb-computer}/{file-share-name}/mnt/smb -o username={user-name}, password={password}`**

- To confirm that artifacts correctly upload, connect to the SMB file share path, and check whether artifact files exist in the correct folder that you specify during deployment.
