# Add trading partners to integration accounts for workflows in Azure Logic Apps

To represent your organization and others in business-to-business (B2B) enterprise integration workflows, create a *trading partner* in your [integration account](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md) to represent each participant in a business relationship. Partners are business entities that participate in B2B transactions and exchange messages with each other.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before your define these partners, have a conversation with your partners about how to identify and validate the messages that you send 
> each other. To participate in an agreement and exchange messages with each other, partners in your integration account have to use the 
> same or compatible *business qualifiers*. After you agree on these details, you're ready to create partners in your integration account.

This article shows how to create and manage partners, which you can later use to create agreements that define the specific industry-standard protocol for exchanging messages between partners.

If you're new to logic apps, review [What is Azure Logic Apps](logic-apps-overview.md)? For more information about B2B enterprise integration, review [B2B enterprise integration workflows with Azure Logic Apps](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription yet, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An [integration account resource](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md) where you define and store artifacts, such as trading partners, agreements, certificates, and so on, for use in your enterprise integration and B2B workflows. This resource has to meet the following requirements:

  * Is associated with the same Azure subscription as your logic app resource.

  * Exists in the same location or Azure region as your logic app resource.

  * If you're using the [**Logic App (Consumption)** resource type](logic-apps-overview.md#resource-environment-differences), your integration account requires a [link to your logic app resource](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md#link-account) before you can use artifacts in your workflow.

  * If you're using the [**Logic App (Standard)** resource type](logic-apps-overview.md#resource-environment-differences), your integration account doesn't need a link to your logic app resource but is still required to store other artifacts, such as partners, agreements, and certificates, along with using the [AS2](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-as2.md), [X12](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12.md), and [EDIFACT](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-edifact.md) operations. Your integration account still has to meet other requirements, such as using the same Azure subscription and existing in the same location as your logic app resource.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Currently, only the **Logic App (Consumption)** resource type supports [RosettaNet](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-rosettanet.md) operations. 
  > The **Logic App (Standard)** resource type doesn't include [RosettaNet](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-rosettanet.md) operations.

## Add a partner

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) search box, enter `integration accounts`, and select **Integration accounts**.

1. Under **Integration accounts**, select the integration account where you want to add your partners.

1. On the integration account menu, under **Settings**, select **Partners**.

1. On the **Partners** pane, select **Add**.

1. On the **Add Partner** pane, provide the following information about the partner:

   | Property | Required | Description |
   |----------|----------|-------------|
   | **Name** | Yes | The partner's name |
   | **Qualifier** | Yes | The authenticating body that provides unique business identities to organizations, for example, **D-U-N-S (Dun & Bradstreet)**. <p>Partners can opt for a mutually defined business identity. For these scenarios, select **Mutually Defined** for EDIFACT or **Mutually Defined (X12)** for X12. <p>For RosettaNet, select only **DUNS**, which is the standard. <p>**Important**: For partners in your integration account to participate in an agreement and exchange messages with each other, they have to use the same or compatible qualifier. |
   | **Value** | Yes | A value that identifies the documents that your logic apps receive. <p>For partners that use RosettaNet, this value must be a nine-digit number that corresponds to the DUNS number. You can provide more information for RosettaNet partners, such as their classification and contact information, by creating the partners first and then [editing their definitions afterwards](#edit-partner). |
