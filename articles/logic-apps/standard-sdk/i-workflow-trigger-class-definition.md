# IWorkflowTrigger interface

**Namespace**: Microsoft.Azure.Workflows.Sdk

Represents the entry-point trigger that initiates workflow execution. Every workflow has exactly one trigger as the root node, and downstream actions are chained from it before being registered with [WorkflowFactory](workflow-factory-class-definition.md).

## Usage

```C#
var trigger = WorkflowTriggers.BuiltIn.CreateHttpTrigger();
var action = WorkflowActions.BuiltIn.Compose(inputs: () => "Hello").WithName("Greet");
trigger.Then(action);

WorkflowFactory.CreateStatefulWorkflow("MyWorkflow", trigger);
```

## Methods

_This type implements `Then()` methods from [IChainableNode](i-chainable-node-class-definition.md). See that page for full documentation of all overloads._
