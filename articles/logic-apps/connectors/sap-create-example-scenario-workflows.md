# Create workflows for common SAP integration scenarios in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

This how-to guide shows how to create example logic app workflows for some common SAP integration scenarios using Azure Logic Apps and the SAP connector.

Both Standard and Consumption logic app workflows offer the SAP *managed* connector that's hosted and run in multitenant Azure. Standard workflows also offer the SAP *built-in service provider* connector that's hosted and run in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps. For more information, see [Connector technical reference](sap.md#connector-technical-reference).

## Prerequisites

- Before you start, make sure to [review and meet the SAP connector requirements](sap.md#prerequisites) for your specific scenario.

[!INCLUDE [api-test-http-request-tools-bullet](../../../includes/api-test-http-request-tools-bullet.md)]

## Receive messages from SAP

The following example logic app workflow triggers when the workflow's SAP trigger receives a message from an SAP server.

<a name="add-sap-trigger"></a>

### Add an SAP trigger

Based on whether you have a Consumption workflow in multitenant Azure Logic Apps or a Standard workflow in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps, follow the corresponding steps:

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Consumption logic app and blank workflow in the designer.

1. In the designer, [follow these general steps to add the SAP managed connector trigger named **When a message is received**](../create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-trigger).

1. If prompted, provide the following [connection information](/connectors/sap/#default-connection) for your on-premises SAP server. When you're done, select **Create**. Otherwise, continue with the next step to set up your SAP trigger.

   | Parameter | Required | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------------|
   | **Connection Name** | Yes | Enter a name for the connection. |
   | **Client** | Yes | The SAP client ID to use for connecting to your SAP server |
   | **Authentication Type** | Yes | The authentication type to use for your connection, which must be **Basic** (username and password). To create an SNC connection, see [Enable Secure Network Communications (SNC)](sap.md?tabs=single-tenant#enable-secure-network-communications). |
   | **SAP Username** | Yes | The username for your SAP server |
   | **SAP Password** | Yes | The password for your SAP server |
   | **Logon Type** | Yes | Select either **Application Server** or **Group** (Message Server), and then configure the corresponding required parameters, even though they appear optional: <br><br>**Application Server**: <br>- **AS Host**: The host name for your SAP Application Server <br>- **AS Service**: The service name or port number for your SAP Application Server <br>- **AS System Number**: Your SAP server's system number, which ranges from 00 to 99 <br><br>**Group**: <br>- **MS Server Host**: The host name for your SAP Message Server <br>- **MS Service Name or Port Number**: The service name or port number for your SAP Message Server <br>- **MS System ID**: The system ID for your SAP server <br>- **MS Logon Group**: The logon group for your SAP server. On your SAP server, you can find or edit the **Logon Group** value by opening the **CCMS: Maintain Logon Groups** (T-Code SMLG) dialog box. For more information, review [SAP Note 26317 - Set up for LOGON group for automatic load balancing](https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/26317). |
   | **Safe Typing** | No | This option available for backward compatibility and only checks the string length. By default, strong typing is used to check for invalid values by performing XML validation against the schema. This behavior can help you detect issues earlier. Learn more about the [Safe Typing setting](#safe-typing). |
   | **Use SNC** | No | To create an SNC connection, see [Enable Secure Network Communications (SNC)](sap.md?tabs=single-tenant#enable-secure-network-communications). For more information about SNC, see [Getting started with SAP SNC for RFC integrations - SAP blog](https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-members/getting-started-with-sap-snc-for-rfc-integrations/ba-p/13983462). |
   | **Data Gateway** | Yes | 1. For **Subscription**, select the Azure subscription for the data gateway resource that you created in the Azure portal for your data gateway installation. <br><br>2. For **Gateway**, select your data gateway resource in Azure. |

   For other optional available connection parameters, see [Default connection information](/connectors/sap/#default-connection).

   After Azure Logic Apps sets up and tests your connection, the trigger information box appears. For more information about any connection problems that might happen, see [Troubleshoot connections](#troubleshoot-connections).

1. Based on your SAP server configuration and scenario, provide the necessary parameter values for the [**When a message is received** trigger](/connectors/sap/#when-a-message-is-received), and add any other available trigger parameters that you want to use in your scenario.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > This SAP trigger is a webhook-based trigger, not a polling trigger, and doesn't include options to specify 
   > a polling schedule. For example, when you use the managed SAP connector with the on-premises data gateway, 
   > the trigger is called from the data gateway only when a message arrives, so no polling is necessary.

   | Parameter | Required | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------------|
   | **GatewayHost** | Yes | The registration gateway host for the SAP RFC server |
   | **GatewayService** | Yes | The registration gateway service for the SAP RFC server |
   | **ProgramId** | Yes | The registration gateway program ID for the SAP RFC server. <br><br>**Note**: This value is case-sensitive. Make sure that you consistently use the same case format for the **Program ID** value when you configure your logic app workflow and SAP server. Otherwise, when you attempt to send an IDoc to SAP, the tRFC Monitor (T-Code SM58) might show the following errors (links require SAP login): <br><br>- [**Function IDOC_INBOUND_ASYNCHRONOUS not found** (2399329)](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2399329)<br>- [**Non-ABAP RFC client (partner type) not supported** (353597)](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/353597) |
   | **DegreeOfParallelism** | No | The number of calls to process in parallel. To add this parameter and change the value, from the **Advanced parameters** list, select **DegreeOfParallelism**, and enter the new value. |
   | **SapActions** | No | Filter the messages that you receive from your SAP server based on a [list of SAP actions](#filter-with-sap-actions). To add this parameter, from the **Advanced parameters** list, select **SapActions**. In the new **SapActions** section, for the **SapActions - 1** parameter, use the file picker to select an SAP action or manually specify an action. For more information about the SAP action, see [Message schemas for IDoc operations](/biztalk/adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/message-schemas-for-idoc-operations). |
   | **IDoc Format** | No | The format to use for receiving IDocs. To add this parameter, from the **Advanced parameters** list, select **IDoc Format**. <br><br>- To receive IDocs as SAP plain XML, from the **IDoc Format** list, select **SapPlainXml**. <br><br>- To receive IDocs as a flat file, from the **IDoc Format** list, select **FlatFile**. <br><br>- **Note**: If you also use the [Flat File Decode action](../logic-apps-enterprise-integration-flatfile.md) in your workflow, in your flat file schema, you have to use the **early_terminate_optional_fields** property and set the value to **true**. This requirement is necessary because the flat file IDoc data record that's sent by SAP on the tRFC call named `IDOC_INBOUND_ASYNCHRONOUS` isn't padded to the full SDATA field length. Azure Logic Apps provides the flat file IDoc original data without padding as received from SAP. Also, when you combine this SAP trigger with the Flat File Decode action, the schema that's provided to the action must match. |
   | **Receive IDOCS with unreleased segments** | No | Receive IDocs with or without unreleased segments. To add this parameter and change the value, from the **Advanced parameters** list, select **Receive IDOCS with unreleased segments**, and select **Yes** or **No**. |
   | **SncPartnerNames** | No | The list of SNC partners that have permissions to call the trigger at the SAP client library level. Only the listed partners are authorized by the SAP server's SNC connection. To add this parameter, from the **Advanced parameters** list, select **SncPartnerNames**. Make sure to enter each name separated by a vertical bar (**\|**). |

   The following example shows a minimally configured SAP managed trigger in a workflow:

   :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/sap-managed-trigger.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows workflow and a minimally configured SAP managed connector trigger.":::

   The following example shows an SAP managed trigger where you can filter messages by selecting SAP actions:

   :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/sap-managed-trigger-select-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows workflow, SAP managed connector trigger, and selecting an SAP action to filter messages.":::

   Or, by manually specifying an SAP action:

   :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/trigger-manual-sap-action-managed.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows workflow, SAP managed connector trigger, and manually entering the SAP action to filter messages.":::

   The following example shows how SAP actions appear when you set up the SAP managed connector trigger to receive multiple messages:

   :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/trigger-sap-action-multiple-messages-managed.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows workflow and SAP managed connector trigger that receives multiple messages.":::

1. Save your workflow so you can start receiving messages from your SAP server. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

   Your workflow is now ready to receive messages from your SAP server.

1. After the trigger fires and runs your workflow, review the workflow's trigger history to confirm that trigger registration succeeded.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

The SAP built-in trigger is a non-polling, Azure Functions-based trigger, not a SOAP-based, webhook trigger like the SAP managed trigger. So, the trigger doesn't include options to specify a polling schedule. The trigger is called only when a message arrives, so no polling is necessary.

> [!NOTE]
>
> To send a response following the SAP built-in trigger, make sure to add the 
> [**Respond to SAP server** action](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/built-in/reference/sap/#respond-to-sap-server) 
> to your workflow, rather than use the **Response** action, which applies only to workflows that start with the **Request** 
> trigger named **When a HTTP request is received** and follow the Request-Response pattern.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open your Standard logic app and a blank workflow in the designer.

1. In the designer, [follow these general steps to find and add the SAP built-in trigger named **When a message is received**](../create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=standard#add-trigger).

1. If prompted, provide the following connection information for your on-premises SAP server. When you're done, select **Create**. Otherwise, continue with the next step to set up your SAP trigger.

   | Parameter | Required | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------------|
   | **Connection name** | Yes | Enter a name for the connection. |
   | **Client** | Yes | The SAP client ID to use for connecting to your SAP server |
   | **Authentication Type** | Yes | The authentication type to use for your connection. To create an SNC connection, see [Enable Secure Network Communications (SNC)](sap.md?tabs=single-tenant#enable-secure-network-communications). |
   | **SAP Username** | Yes | The username for your SAP server |
   | **SAP Password** | Yes | The password for your SAP server |
   | **Logon Type** | Yes | Select either **Application Server** or **Group**, and then configure the corresponding required parameters, even though they appear optional: <br><br>**Application Server**: <br>- **Server Host**: The host name for your SAP Application Server <br>- **Service**: The service name or port number for your SAP Application Server <br>- **System Number**: Your SAP server's system number, which ranges from 00 to 99 <br><br>**Group**: <br>- **Server Host**: The host name for your SAP Message Server <br>- **Service Name or Port Number**: The service name or port number for your SAP Message Server <br>- **System ID**: The system ID for your SAP server <br>- **Logon Group**: The logon group for your SAP server. On your SAP server, you can find or edit the **Logon Group** value by opening the **CCMS: Maintain Logon Groups** (T-Code SMLG) dialog box. For more information, review [SAP Note 26317 - Set up for LOGON group for automatic load balancing](https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/26317). |
   | **Language** | Yes | The language to use for sending data to your SAP server. The value is either **Default** (English) or one of the [permitted values](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/built-in/reference/sap/#parameters-21). <br><br>**Note**: The SAP built-in connector saves this parameter value as part of the SAP connection parameters. For more information, see [Change language headers for sending data to SAP](#change-language-headers). |

   After Azure Logic Apps sets up and tests your connection, the SAP trigger information box appears. For more information about any connection problems that might happen, see [Troubleshoot connections](#troubleshoot-connections).

1. Based on your SAP server configuration and scenario, provide the following trigger information, and add any available trigger parameters that you want to use in your scenario.

   | Parameter | Required | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------------|
   | **IDoc Format** | Yes | The format to use for receiving IDocs. <br><br>- To receive IDocs as SAP plain XML, from the **IDoc Format** list, select **SapPlainXml**. <br><br>- To receive IDocs as a flat file, from the **IDoc Format** list, select **FlatFile**. <br><br>**Note**: If you also use the [Flat File Decode action](../logic-apps-enterprise-integration-flatfile.md) in your workflow, in your flat file schema, you have to use the **early_terminate_optional_fields** property and set the value to **true**. This requirement is necessary because the flat file IDoc data record that's sent by SAP on the tRFC call named `IDOC_INBOUND_ASYNCHRONOUS` isn't padded to the full SDATA field length. Azure Logic Apps provides the flat file IDoc original data without padding as received from SAP. Also, when you combine this SAP trigger with the Flat File Decode action, the schema that's provided to the action must match. |
   | **Degree of Parallelism** | Yes | The number of calls to process in parallel |
   | **Allow Unreleased Segment** | Yes | Receive IDocs with or without unreleased segments. From the list, select **Yes** or **No**. |
   | **Gateway Host** | Yes | The registration gateway host for the SAP server |
   | **Gateway Service** | Yes | The registration gateway service for the SAP server |
   | **Program ID** | Yes | The registration gateway program ID for the SAP server. <br><br>**Note**: This value is case-sensitive. Make sure that you consistently use the same case format for the **Program ID** value when you configure your logic app workflow and SAP server. Otherwise, when you attempt to send an IDoc to SAP, the tRFC Monitor (T-Code SM58) might show the following errors (links require SAP login): <br><br>- [**Function IDOC_INBOUND_ASYNCHRONOUS not found** (2399329)](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2399329)<br>- [**Non-ABAP RFC client (partner type) not supported** (353597)](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/353597) |
   | **SNC Partner Name** | No | The list of SNC partners that have permissions to call the trigger at the SAP client library level. Only the listed partners are authorized by the SAP server's SNC connection. To add this parameter, from the **Advanced parameters** list, select **SNC Partner Name**. Make sure to enter each name separated by a vertical bar (**\|**). |

   The following example shows a minimally configured SAP built-in trigger in a Standard workflow:

   :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/trigger-sap-built-in-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow and minimally configured SAP built-in connector trigger.":::

1. Save your workflow so you can start receiving messages from your SAP server. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

   Your workflow is now ready to receive messages from your SAP server.

## Receive IDoc packets from SAP

To receive IDoc packets, which are batches or groups of IDocs, the SAP trigger doesn't need extra configuration. However, to process each item in an IDoc packet after the trigger receives the packet, you have to implement a few more steps to split the packet into individual IDocs by setting up SAP to [send IDocs in packets](https://help.sap.com/viewer/8f3819b0c24149b5959ab31070b64058/7.4.16/4ab38886549a6d8ce10000000a42189c.html). 

The following example workflow shows how to extract individual IDocs from a packet by using the [`xpath()` function](../workflow-definition-language-functions-reference.md#xpath):

1. Before you start, you need a Consumption or Standard logic app workflow with an SAP trigger. If your workflow doesn't already start with this trigger, follow the previous steps in this guide to [add the SAP trigger that can receive messages to your workflow](#receive-messages-sap).

1. To immediately reply to your SAP server with the SAP request status, add the following response action, based on whether you use an SAP managed trigger or SAP built-in trigger:

   - SAP managed trigger: For this trigger, [add a Response action to your workflow](../../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md#add-a-response-action).

     In the Response action, use one of the following status codes (`statusCode`):

     | Status code | Description |
     |-------------|-------------|
     | **202 Accepted** | The request was accepted for processing, but processing isn't complete yet. |
     | **204 No Content** | The server successfully fulfilled the request, and no other content is available to send in the response payload body. |
     | **200 OK** | This status code always contains a payload, even if the server generates a payload body of zero length. |

   - SAP built-in trigger: For this trigger, add the [**Respond to SAP server** action](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/built-in/reference/sap/#respond-to-sap-server) to your workflow.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > As a best practice, add the response action immediately after the trigger to free up the communication channel with your SAP server.

1. Get the root namespace from the XML IDoc that your workflow receives from SAP.

   1. To extract this namespace from the XML document and store the namespace in a local string variable, add the **Initialize variable** action.

   1. Rename the action's title to **Get namespace for root node in received IDoc**.

   1. Provide a name for the variable, and set the type to **String**.

   1. In the action, select inside the **Value** edit box to show the options for the dynamic content list (lightning icon) and expression editor (function icon).
   
   1. Select the function icon to open expression editor, and create the following expression using the [`xpath()` function](../workflow-definition-language-functions-reference.md#xpath):

      `xpath(xml(triggerBody()?['Content']), 'namespace-uri(/*)')`

      :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/get-namespace-expression.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows workflow and action with expression to get the root node namespace from received IDoc.":::

      When you're done, the expression resolves and now appears as the following format:

      ![Screenshot shows resolved expression that gets root node namespace from received IDoc.](media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/get-namespace-expression-resolved.png)

1. To extract an individual IDoc by storing the IDoc collection in a local array variable, follow these steps:

   1. Add another **Initialize variable** action.

   1. Rename the action's title to **Get array with IDoc data elements**.

   1. Provide a name for the variable, and set the type to **Array**.

      The array variable makes each IDoc available for your workflow to process individually by enumerating over the collection. 

   1. In the action, select inside the **Value** edit box to show the options for the dynamic content list (lightning icon) and expression editor (function icon).

   1. Select the lightning icon to open the expression editor, and create the following `xpath()` expression:

      `xpath(xml(triggerBody()?['Content']), '/*[local-name()="Receive"]/*[local-name()="idocData"]')`

      When you're done, the expression resolves and now appears as the following format:

      :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/get-array-idoc-expression-resolved.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow and action with expression to get an IDocs array.":::

      In this example, the following workflow transfers each IDoc to an SFTP server by using a **Control** action named **For each** and the SFTP-SSH action named **Create file**. Each IDoc must include the root namespace, which is the reason why the file content is wrapped inside a `<Receive></Receive>` element along with the root namespace before sending the IDoc to the downstream app, or SFTP server in this case.

      :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/get-idoc-loop-batch.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows workflow that sends an IDoc to an SFTP server.":::

<a name="filter-with-sap-actions"></a>

## Filter received messages with SAP actions

If you use the SAP managed connector under the trigger in your workflow, set up a way to explicitly filter out any unwanted actions from your SAP server, based on the root node namespace in the received XML payload. You can provide a list (array) with a single or multiple SAP actions. By default, this array is empty, which means that your workflow receives all the messages from your SAP server without filtering. When you set up the array filter, the trigger receives messages only from the specified SAP action types and rejects all other messages from your SAP server. However, this filter doesn't affect whether the typing of the received payload is weak or strong. Any SAP action filtering happens at the level of the SAP Adapter for your on-premises data gateway. For more information, review [how to test sending IDocs to Azure Logic Apps from SAP](sap.md#test-sending-idocs-from-sap).

## Set up asynchronous request-reply pattern for triggers

The SAP managed connector supports Azure's [asynchronous request-reply pattern](/azure/architecture/patterns/async-request-reply) for Azure Logic Apps triggers. You can use this pattern to create successful requests that would otherwise fail with the default synchronous request-reply pattern.

> [!NOTE]
>
> In workflows with multiple **Response** actions, all **Response** actions must use the same request-reply pattern. 
> For example, if your workflow uses a switch control with multiple possible **Response** actions, you must set up 
> all the **Response** actions to use the same request-reply pattern, either synchronous or asynchronous.

If you enable an asynchronous response for your **Response** action, your workflow can respond with a **202 Accepted** reply after accepting a request for processing. The reply contains a location header that you can use to retrieve the final state of your request.

To configure an asynchronous request-reply pattern for your workflow using the SAP connector, follow these steps:

1. In the designer, open your logic app workflow. Confirm that your workflow starts with an SAP trigger.

1. In your workflow, find the **Response** action, and open that action's **Settings**.

1. Based on whether you have a Consumption or Standard workflow, follow the corresponding steps:

   - Consumption: Under **Asynchronous Response**, turn the setting from **Off** to **On**, and select **Done**.
   - Standard: Expand **Networking**, and under **Asynchronous Response**, turn the setting from **Off** to **On**.

1. Save your workflow.

## Send IDocs to SAP

To create a logic app workflow that sends an IDoc to an SAP server and returns a response, follow these examples:

1. [Create a logic app workflow that's triggered by an HTTP request.](#add-request-trigger)
1. [Add an SAP action to your workflow for sending an IDoc to SAP.](#add-sap-action-send-idoc)
1. [Add a response action to your workflow.](#add-response-action)
1. [Create a remote function call (RFC) request-response pattern, if you're using an RFC to receive replies from SAP ABAP.](#create-rfc-request-response-pattern)
1. [Test your workflow.](#test-workflow)

<a name="add-request-trigger"></a>

### Add the Request trigger

To have your workflow receive IDocs from SAP over XML HTTP, you can use the [**Request** built-in trigger](../../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md). This trigger creates an endpoint with a URL where your SAP server can send HTTP POST requests to your workflow. When your workflow receives these requests, the trigger fires and runs the next step in your workflow.

To receive IDocs over Common Programming Interface Communication (CPIC) as plain XML or as a flat file, review the section, [Receive message from SAP](#receive-messages-sap).

Based on whether you have a Consumption workflow in multitenant Azure Logic Apps or a Standard workflow in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps, follow the corresponding steps:

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), create a Consumption logic app resource and a blank workflow in the designer.

1. In the designer, [follow these general steps to find and add the Request built-in trigger named **When a HTTP request is received**](../create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-trigger).

   :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/add-request-trigger-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow with Request trigger.":::

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

   This step generates an endpoint URL where your trigger can receive requests from your SAP server, for example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/generate-http-endpoint-url-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow and Request trigger with generated endpoint URL for receiving requests.":::

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), create a Standard logic app resource and a blank workflow in the designer.

1. In the designer, [follow these general steps to find and add the Request built-in trigger named **When a HTTP request is received**](../create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=standard#add-trigger).

   :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/add-request-trigger-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow with Request trigger.":::

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

   This step generates an endpoint URL where your trigger can receive requests from your SAP server, for example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/generate-http-endpoint-url-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow and Request trigger with generated endpoint URL for receiving requests.":::

<a name="add-sap-action-send-idoc"></a>

### Add an SAP action to send an IDoc

Next, create an action to send your IDoc to SAP when the workflow's **Request** trigger fires. Based on whether you have a Consumption workflow in multitenant Azure Logic Apps or a Standard workflow in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps, follow the corresponding steps:

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the workflow designer, under the **Request** trigger, [follow these general steps to find and add the SAP managed action named **Send message to SAP**](../create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

1. If prompted, provide the following [connection information](/connectors/sap/#default-connection) for your on-premises SAP server. When you're done, select **Create**. Otherwise, continue with the next step to set up the SAP action.

   | **Safe Typing** | No | This option available for backward compatibility and only checks the string length. By default, strong typing is used to check for invalid values by performing XML validation against the schema. This behavior can help you detect issues earlier. Learn more about the [Safe Typing setting](#safe-typing). |
   | **Use SNC** | No | To create an SNC connection, see [Enable Secure Network Communications (SNC)](sap.md?tabs=single-tenant#enable-secure-network-communications). For more information about SNC, see [Getting started with SAP SNC for RFC integrations - SAP blog](https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-members/getting-started-with-sap-snc-for-rfc-integrations/ba-p/13983462). |

1. In the **Send message to SAP** action, find and select an available SAP action on your SAP server to send the IDoc.

   The **Send message to SAP** action is generic and can send a message for BAPI, IDoc, RFC, or tRFC, but you must first select the message type and SAP action to use.

   1. In the **SAP Action** box, select the folder icon. From the list that opens, select **BAPI**, **IDOC**, **RFC**, or **TRFC**.
   
      This example selects **IDOC**. If you select a different type, the available SAP actions change based on your selection.

      > [!NOTE]
      >
      > If you get a **Bad Gateway (500)** error or **Bad request (400)** error, see [500 Bad Gateway or 400 Bad Request error](#bad-gateway-request).

   1. Browse the SAP action type folders using the arrows to find and select the SAP action that you want to use.

      This example selects the following folders all the way to the SAP action named **Send**: **ORDERS** > **ORDERS05** > **720** > **Send**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/sap-send-message-find-orders-action-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow and selections for folders named Orders, Orders05, 720, and so on.":::

      If you can't find the action you want, you can manually enter a path in the **SAP Action** box, for example:

      :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/sap-manually-enter-action-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow, action named Send message to SAP, and SAP Action box with manually entered path for SAP action named Send.":::

      > [!TIP]
      >
      > For the **SAP Action** parameter, you can use the expression editor to provide the parameter value. 
      > That way, you can use the same SAP action for different message types.

      For more information about IDoc messages, see [Message schemas for IDoc operations](/biztalk/adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/message-schemas-for-idoc-operations).

   1. In the **Send message to SAP** action, include the body output from the **Request** trigger.

      1. Select inside the **Input Message** edit box to show the options for the dynamic content list (lightning icon) and expression editor (function icon).

      1. Select the lightning icon for the dynamic content list.

      1. In the list, under **When a HTTP request is received**, select **Body**. The **Body** field contains the body output from the **Request** trigger.

         > [!NOTE]

1. Save your workflow.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. In the designer, under the **Request** trigger, [follow these general steps to find and add the SAP built-in action named **[IDoc] Send document to SAP**](../create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=standard#add-action).

   Rather than have a generic action to send messages with different types, the SAP built-in connector provides individual actions for BAPI, IDoc, RFC, and so on. For example, these actions include **[BAPI] Call method in SAP** and **[RFC] Call function in SAP**.

1. If prompted, provide the following connection information for your on-premises SAP server. When you're done, select **Create**. Otherwise, continue with the next step to set up the SAP action.

   | Parameter | Required | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------------|
   | **Connection name** | Yes | Enter a name for the connection. |
   | **Client** | Yes | The SAP client ID to use for connecting to your SAP server |
   | **Authentication Type** | Yes | The authentication type to use for your connection. To create an SNC connection, see [Enable Secure Network Communications (SNC)](sap.md?tabs=single-tenant#enable-secure-network-communications). |
   | **SAP Username** | Yes | The username for your SAP server |
   | **SAP Password** | Yes | The password for your SAP server |
   | **Logon Type** | Yes | Select either **Application Server** or **Group**, and then configure the corresponding required parameters, even though they appear optional: <br><br>**Application Server**: <br>- **Server Host**: The host name for your SAP Application Server <br>- **Service**: The service name or port number for your SAP Application Server <br>- **System Number**: Your SAP server's system number, which ranges from 00 to 99 <br><br>**Group**: <br>- **Server Host**: The host name for your SAP Message Server <br>- **Service Name or Port Number**: The service name or port number for your SAP Message Server <br>- **System ID**: The system ID for your SAP server <br>- **Logon Group**: The logon group for your SAP server. On your SAP server, you can find or edit the **Logon Group** value by opening the **CCMS: Maintain Logon Groups** (T-Code SMLG) dialog box. For more information, review [SAP Note 26317 - Set up for LOGON group for automatic load balancing](https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/26317). |
   | **Language** | Yes | The language to use for sending data to your SAP server. The value is either **Default** (English) or one of the [permitted values](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/built-in/reference/sap/#parameters-21). <br><br>**Note**: The SAP built-in connector saves this parameter value as part of the SAP connection parameters. For more information, see [Change language headers for sending data to SAP](#change-language-headers). |

#### Send flat file IDocs to SAP server (Managed connector only)

To send an IDoc using a flat file schema when you use the SAP managed connector, you can wrap the IDoc in an XML envelope and [follow the general steps to add an SAP action to send an IDoc](#add-sap-action-send-idoc), but with the following changes.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you're using the SAP built-in connector, make sure that you don't wrap a flat file IDoc in an XML envelope.

### Wrap IDoc with XML envelope

1. In the SAP action that you use to send the message, use the following URI:

   **`http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Idoc/SendIdoc`**

1. Format your input message with an XML envelope.

The following example shows a sample XML payload:

```xml
<SendIdoc xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Idoc/">

### Add a response action

Now, set up your workflow to return the results from your SAP server to the original requestor. For this task, follow these steps:

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the designer, under the SAP action, [follow these general steps to find and add the Request built-in action named **Response**](../create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

1. In the **Response** action, select inside the **Body** edit box to show the options for the dynamic content list (lightning icon) and expression editor (function icon).

1. Select the lightning icon for the dynamic content list.

1. From the list, under **Send message to SAP**, select **Body**. The **Body** field contains the body output from the SAP action.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/response-action-select-sap-body-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow, Response action, dynamic content list, and selected SAP action output named Body.":::

1. Save your workflow.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. In the designer, under the SAP action, [follow these general steps to find and add the Request built-in action named **Response**](../create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=standard#add-action).

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > If you use the SAP built-in trigger, which is an Azure Functions-based trigger, not a webhook trigger, add the 
   > [**Respond to SAP server** action](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/built-in/reference/sap/#respond-to-sap-server) 
   > to your workflow and include the output from the SAP action.

1. In the **Response** action, select inside the **Body** edit box to show the options for the dynamic content list (lightning icon) and expression editor (function icon).

1. Select the lightning icon for the dynamic content list.

1. From the list, under **[IDoc] Send document to SAP**, find and select **Body**. The **Body** field contains the body output from the SAP action.

<a name="create-rfc-request-response-pattern"></a>

### Create a remote function call (RFC) request-response pattern

For the Consumption workflows that use the SAP managed connector, if you have to receive replies by using a remote function call (RFC) to Azure Logic Apps from SAP ABAP, you must implement a request and response pattern. To receive IDocs in your workflow when you use the [**Request** trigger](../../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md), make sure that the workflow's first action is a [Response action](../../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md#add-response) that uses the **200 OK** status code without any content. This recommended step immediately completes the SAP Logical Unit of Work (LUW) asynchronous transfer over tRFC, which leaves the SAP CPIC conversation available again. You can then add more actions to your workflow for processing the received IDoc without blocking later transfers.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The SAP trigger receives IDocs over tRFC, which doesn't have a response parameter, by design.

To implement a request and response pattern, you must first discover the RFC schema using the [`generate schema` command](sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts.md). The generated schema has two possible root nodes: 

* The request node, which is the call that you receive from SAP
* The response node, which is your reply back to SAP

In the following example, the `STFC_CONNECTION` RFC module generates a request and response pattern. The request XML is parsed to extract a node value where SAP requests `<ECHOTEXT>`. The response inserts the current timestamp as a dynamic value. You receive a similar response when you send a `STFC_CONNECTION` RFC from a logic app workflow to SAP.

```xml
<STFC_CONNECTIONResponse xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/">
  <ECHOTEXT>@{first(xpath(xml(triggerBody()?['Content']), '/*[local-name()="STFC_CONNECTION"]/*[local-name()="REQUTEXT"]/text()'))}</ECHOTEXT>
  <RESPTEXT>Azure Logic Apps @{utcNow()}</RESPTEXT>
</STFC_CONNECTIONResponse>
```

<a name="test-workflow"></a>

### Test your workflow

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. If your Consumption logic app resource isn't already enabled, on your logic app menu, select **Overview**. On the toolbar, select **Enable**.

1. On the **Overview** or designer toolbar, select **Run** > **Run** to manually start your workflow.

1. To simulate a webhook trigger payload and trigger the workflow, send an HTTP request to the endpoint URL created by your workflow's **Request** trigger, including the method that the **Request** trigger expects, by using your HTTP request tool and its instructions. Make sure to include your message content with your request.

   This example uses the **POST** method and the endpoint URL to send an IDoc file, which must be in XML format and include the namespace for the SAP action that you selected, for example:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
   <Send xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Idoc/2/ORDERS05//720/Send">
     <idocData>
       <...>
     </idocData>
   </Send>
   ```

1. After you send your HTTP request, wait for the response from your workflow.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. If your Standard logic app resource is stopped or disabled, from your workflow, go to the logic app resource level, and select **Overview**. On the toolbar, select **Start**.

1. Return to the workflow level. On the workflow menu, under **Tools**, select **Designer**. On the toolbar, select **Run** > **Run** to manually start your workflow.

1. To simulate a webhook trigger payload and trigger the workflow, send an HTTP request to the endpoint URL created by your workflow's **Request** trigger, including the method that the **Request** trigger expects, by using your HTTP request tool and its instructions. Make sure to include your message content with your request.

   This example uses the **POST** method and the endpoint URL to send an IDoc file, which must be in XML format and include the namespace for the SAP action that you selected, for example:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
   <Send xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Idoc/2/ORDERS05//720/Send">
     <idocData>
       <...>
     </idocData>
   </Send>
   ```

1. After you send the HTTP request, wait for the response from your workflow.

---

You've now created a workflow that can send IDocs and communicate with your SAP server. Now that you've set up an SAP connection for your workflow, you can try experimenting with BAPI and RFC.

#### Workflow time-out issues

Your workflow times out in any of the following scenarios:

- All the steps required for the response don't finish within the [request time-out limit](../logic-apps-limits-and-config.md). If this condition happens, requests might get blocked. To help you diagnose problems, learn [how to check workflow status and view run history for your workflows](/azure/logic-apps/view-workflow-status-run-history).

- Your SAP system's processing mode is set to the default **Trigger immediately** setting, which causes your SAP system to block the inbound call for IDoc transmission until an IDoc finishes processing.

  If your SAP system is under load, for example, when your workflow sends a batch of IDocs all at one time to SAP, the queued IDoc calls time out. The default processing mode causes your SAP system to block the inbound call for IDoc transmission until an IDoc finishes processing. In Azure Logic Apps, workflow actions have a 2-minute time out, by default.

  To resolve this problem, follow the [steps in the **Prerequisites** section that change the setting to **Trigger by background program**](sap.md#prerequisites).

<a name="safe-typing"></a>

## Safe typing

By default, when you create a connection for the SAP managed operation, strong typing is used to check for invalid values by performing XML validation against the schema. This behavior can help you detect issues earlier. The **Safe Typing** option is available for backward compatibility and only checks the string length. If you choose **Safe Typing**, the DATS type and TIMS type in SAP are treated as strings rather than as their XML equivalents, `xs:date` and `xs:time`, where `xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"`. Safe typing affects the behavior for all schema generation, the send message for both the "been sent" payload and the "been received" response, and the trigger.

When strong typing is used (**Safe Typing** isn't enabled), the schema maps the DATS and TIMS types to more straightforward XML types:

```xml
<xs:element minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1" name="UPDDAT" nillable="true" type="xs:date"/>
<xs:element minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1" name="UPDTIM" nillable="true" type="xs:time"/>
```

When you send messages using strong typing, the DATS and TIMS response complies with the matching XML type format:

```xml
<DATE>9999-12-31</DATE>
<TIME>23:59:59</TIME>
```

When **Safe Typing** is enabled, the schema maps the DATS and TIMS types to XML string fields with length restrictions only, for example:

```xml
<xs:element minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1" name="UPDDAT" nillable="true">
  <xs:simpleType>
    <xs:restriction base="xs:string">
      <xs:maxLength value="8" />
    </xs:restriction>
  </xs:simpleType>
</xs:element>
<xs:element minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1" name="UPDTIM" nillable="true">
  <xs:simpleType>
    <xs:restriction base="xs:string">
      <xs:maxLength value="6" />
    </xs:restriction>
  </xs:simpleType>
</xs:element>
```

When messages are sent with **Safe Typing** enabled, the DATS and TIMS response looks like this example:

```xml
<DATE>99991231</DATE>
<TIME>235959</TIME>
```

## Advanced scenarios

<a name="change-language-headers"></a>

### Change language headers for sending data to SAP

When you connect to SAP from Azure Logic Apps, English is the default language used by the SAP connection for sending data to your SAP server. However, the SAP managed connector and SAP built-in connector handle changing and saving the language used in different ways.

* When you create a connection with SAP built-in connector, the connection parameters let you specify and save the language parameter value as part of the SAP connection parameters.

* When you create a connection with the SAP managed connector, the connection parameters don't have language parameter. So, during this time, you can't specify or the language to use for sending data to your SAP server. Instead, at both workflow design time and run time, the connector uses your web browser's local language from each request that's sent to your server. For example, if your browser is set to Portuguese, Azure Logic Apps creates and tests the SAP connection with Portuguese, but doesn't save the connection with that language.

  However, you can set the language for your connection by using the [standard HTTP header `Accept-Language`](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4) with your inbound requests. Most web browsers add an `Accept-Language` header based on your locale settings. The web browser applies this header when you create a new SAP connection in the workflow designer. So, you can either update your web browser's settings to use your preferred language, or you can create your SAP connection using Azure Resource Manager instead of the workflow designer.

  For example, you can send a request with the `Accept-Language` header to your logic app workflow by using the **Request** trigger named **When a HTTP request is received**. All the actions in your workflow receive the header. Then, SAP uses the specified languages in its system messages, such as BAPI error messages. If you don't pass an `Accept-Language` header at run time, by default, English is used.

  If you use the `Accept-Language` header, you might get the following error: **Please check your account info and/or permissions and try again.** In this case, check the SAP component's error logs instead. The error actually happens in the SAP component that uses the header, so you might get one of these error messages:

  * **"SAP.Middleware.Connector.RfcLogonException: Select one of the installed languages"**

  * **"SAP.Middleware.Connector.RfcAbapMessageException: Select one of the installed languages"**

<a name="confirm-transaction-explicitly"></a>

## Confirm transaction separately and explicitly

When you send transactions to SAP from Azure Logic Apps, this exchange happens in two steps as described in the SAP document, [Transactional RFC Server Programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_nwpi71/7.1/22/042ad7488911d189490000e829fbbd/content.htm?no_cache=true).

By default, the SAP managed connector action named [**Send message to SAP**](/connectors/sap/#send-message-to-sap) handles both the steps to transfer the function and confirm the transaction in a single call. You can also to decouple these steps. The capability to decouple the transfer and confirmation steps is useful for scenarios where you don't want to duplicate transactions in SAP. Such scenarios include failures that happen due to causes such as network issues.

You can send an IDoc without automatically confirming the transaction using the SAP managed connector action named [**[IDOC] Send document to SAP**](/connectors/sap/#[idoc]-send-document-to-sap). You can then explicitly confirm the transaction using the SAP managed connector action named [**[IDOC - RFC] Confirm transaction Id**](/connectors/sap/#[idoc---rfc]-confirm-transaction-id). When your workflow separately confirms the transaction in a different step, the SAP system completes the transaction only once.

In Standard workflows, the SAP built-in connector also has actions that separately handle the transfer and confirmation steps, specifically, [**[IDoc] Send document to SAP**](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/built-in/reference/sap/#[idoc]-send-document-to-sap) and [**[IDOC - RFC] Confirm transaction Id**](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/built-in/reference/sap/#[idoc---rfc]-confirm-transaction-id).

The following example workflow shows this pattern:

1. Create and open a Consumption or Standard logic app with a blank workflow in the designer. Add the **Request** trigger.

1. To help avoid sending duplicate IDocs to SAP, [follow these alternative steps to create and use an IDoc transaction ID in your SAP actions](#create=transaction-ID-variable).

1. Add the SAP action named **[IDOC] Send document to SAP** to your Consumption workflow. For Standard workflows, add the action's "in-app" version named **[IDoc] Send document to SAP**, rather than the "shared" version.

1. Provide the information for the IDoc that you send to your SAP system plus the following values:

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > If the following parameters don't automatically appear, open the **Advanced parameters** list, and select the parameters. 

   | Parameter | Value | Description |
   |-----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Confirm TID** | **No** | Don't automatically confirm the transaction ID, which explicitly happens in a separate step. |
   | **Transaction Id GUID** | <*IDoc-transaction-ID*> | You can either manually specify this value, or the connector can automatically generate this GUID as an output from the **[IDOC] Send document to SAP** action. This example leaves this parameter empty to automatically generate the GUID. |

   **Consumption workflow with shared SAP action**

   :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/sap-send-idoc-with-id-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow with the action named IDOC Send document to SAP.":::

   **Standard workflow with in-app SAP action**

   :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/sap-send-idoc-with-id-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow with the action named IDoc Send document to SAP.":::

1. On the SAP action named **[IDOC] Send document to SAP**, open **Settings** to review the **Retry policy**.

   The **Default** option is the recommended policy, but you can select a custom policy for your specific needs. If you choose to use a custom policy, set up at least one retry to overcome temporary network outages.

1. Now, add the SAP action named **[IDOC - RFC] Confirm transaction Id**.

   1. Select inside the **Transaction ID** edit box to show the options for the dynamic content list (lightning icon) and expression editor (function icon).

   1. Select the lightning icon for the dynamic content list.

   1. Based on your workflow, follow the corresponding step to include the transaction ID output value from the previous SAP action.

      **Consumption workflow with shared SAP actions**

      In the dynamic content list, under **[IDOC] Send document to SAP**, select the **Transaction Id** value. The example now looks like the following sample:

      :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/sap-confirm-id-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow with action named Confirm transaction ID, which includes the transaction ID GUID output from previous action.":::

      **Standard workflow with in-app SAP actions**

      In the dynamic content list, under **[IDoc] Send document to SAP**, select the **Transaction Id GUID** value. The example now looks like the following sample:

      :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/sap-confirm-id-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow with action named Confirm transaction ID, which includes the transaction ID GUID output from previous action.":::

   After this step runs, the current transaction is marked complete at both ends, on the SAP connector side and on SAP system side.

<a name="create=transaction-ID-variable"></a>

### Avoid sending duplicate IDocs with a transaction ID variable

If you experience a problem with your workflow sending duplicate IDocs to SAP, you can create a string variable that serves as an IDoc transaction identifier. You can then use this identifier to help prevent duplicate network transmissions in conditions such as temporary outages, network issues, or lost acknowledgments.

1. In the designer, after you add the **Request** trigger, and before you add the SAP action named **[IDOC] Send document to SAP**, add the action named **Initialize variable** to your workflow.

1. Rename the action to **Create IDoc transaction ID**.

1. In the action information box, provide the following parameter values:

   | Parameter | Value | Description |
   |-----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Name** | <*variable-name*> | A name for your variable, for example, **IDocTransactionID** |
   | **Type** | **String** | The variable type |
   | **Value** | **guid()** | 1. Select inside the **Value** edit box to show the options for the dynamic content list (lightning icon) and expression editor (function icon). <br><br>2. Select the function icon to open the expression editor. <br><br>3. In the editor, enter **guid()**, and select **Add**guid. <br><br>The **Value** parameter is now set to the **guid()** function, which generates a GUID. |

   > [!NOTE]

1. Add the SAP action named **[IDOC] Send document to SAP** to your Consumption workflow. For Standard workflows, add the action's "in-app" version named **[IDoc] Send document to SAP**, rather than the "shared" version.

1. Provide the information for the IDoc that you send to your SAP system plus the following values:

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > If the following parameters don't automatically appear, open the **Advanced parameters** list, and select the parameters. 

   | Parameter | Value | Description |
   |-----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Confirm TID** | **No** | Don't automatically confirm the transaction ID, which explicitly happens in a separate step. |
   | **Transaction Id GUID** | <*IDoc-transaction-ID*> | To select the transaction ID variable that you created, follow these steps: <br><br> 1. Select inside the **Transaction Id GUID** edit box to show the options for the dynamic content list (lightning icon) and expression editor (function icon). <br><br>2. Select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list. <br><br>3. From the list, under **Variables**, select the variable that you previously created, which is **IDocTransactionID** in this example. |

   **Consumption workflow with shared SAP action**

   The example now looks like the following sample:

   :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/sap-send-idoc-with-var-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow with action named IDOC Send document to SAP.":::

   **Standard workflow with in-app SAP action**

   The example now looks like the following sample:

   :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/sap-send-idoc-with-var-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow with action named IDoc Send document to SAP.":::

1. For the SAP action named **[IDOC] Send document to SAP**, open **Settings** to review the **Retry policy**.

   The **Default** option is the recommended policy, but you can select a custom policy for your specific needs. If you choose to use a custom policy, set up at least one retry to overcome temporary network outages.

1. Now, add the SAP action named **[IDOC - RFC] Confirm transaction Id**.

   1. In the action, select inside the **Transaction ID** edit box to show the options for the dynamic content list (lightning icon) and expression editor (function icon).

   1. Select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list. From the list, under **Variables**, enter the name for the variable that you created, which is **IDocTransactionID** in this example.

      **Consumption workflow with shared SAP action**

      The example now looks like the following sample:

      :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/sap-confirm-with-var-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow with action named Confirm transaction ID using a variable.":::

      **Standard workflow with in-app SAP action**

      The example now looks like the following sample:

      :::image type="content" source="media/sap-create-example-scenario-workflows/sap-confirm-with-var-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow with action named Confirm transaction ID using a variable.":::

1. Optionally, validate the deduplication in your test environment.

    1. Add another SAP action named **[IDOC] Send document to SAP**. In the **Transaction ID** parameter, select the **Transaction ID** GUID that you used in the previous step.
    
    1. To validate which IDoc number gets assigned after each call to the action named **[IDOC] Send document to SAP**, add the action named **[IDOC] Get IDOC list for transaction** to your workflow with the same **Transaction ID** and the **Receive** direction.

       If the same IDoc number is returned for both calls, the IDoc was deduplicated.

If you send the same IDoc twice, you can validate that SAP can identify the duplication of the tRFC call, and resolve the two calls to a single inbound IDoc message.

## Troubleshoot problems

<a name="troubleshoot-connections"></a>

### Connection problems

During connection creation, if you receive the following error, a problem exists with your installation of the SAP NCo client library: 

**Test connection failed. Error 'Failed to process request. Error details: 'could not load file or assembly 'sapnco, Version=3.0.0.42, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken 50436dca5c7f7d23' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.'.'**

Make sure to [install the required version of the SAP NCo client library and meet all other prerequisites](sap.md#sap-client-library-prerequisites).

<a name="bad-gateway-request"></a>

### 500 Bad Gateway or 400 Bad Request error

If you receive a **500 Bad Gateway** or **400 Bad Request** error with a message similar to **service 'sapgw00' unknown**, the network service name resolution to port number is failing, for example:

```json
{
   "body": {
      "error": {
         "code": 500,
         "source": "EXAMPLE-FLOW-NAME.eastus.environments.microsoftazurelogicapps.net",
         "clientRequestId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
         "message": "BadGateway",
         "innerError": {
            "error": {
               "code": "UnhandledException",
               "message": "\nERROR service 'sapgw00' unknown\nTIME Wed Nov 11 19:37:50 2020\nRELEASE 721\nCOMPONENT NI (network interface)\nVERSION 40\nRC -3\nMODULE ninti.c\nLINE 933\nDETAIL NiPGetServByName: 'sapgw00' not found\nSYSTEM CALL getaddrinfo\nCOUNTER 1\n\nRETURN CODE: 20"
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```

* **Option 1:** In your API connection and trigger configuration, replace your gateway service name with its port number. In the example error, `sapgw00` needs to be replaced with a real port number, for example, `3300`.

* **Option 2:** If you're using the on-premises data gateway, you can add the gateway service name to the port mapping in `%windir%\System32\drivers\etc\services` and then restart the on-premises data gateway service, for example:

  ```text
  sapgw00  3300/tcp
  ```

You might get a similar error when SAP Application server or Message server name resolves to the IP address. For the on-premises data gateway, you can instead add the name to the IP address mapping in `%windir%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`, for example:

```text
10.0.1.9 SAPDBSERVER01 # SAP System Server VPN IP by computer name
10.0.1.9 SAPDBSERVER01.someguid.xx.xxxxxxx.cloudapp.net # SAP System Server VPN IP by fully qualified computer name
```

## Errors sending IDoc packets from SAP to your trigger

If you can't send IDoc packets from SAP to your trigger, review the Transactional RFC (tRFC) call rejection message in the SAP tRFC (T-Code SM58) dialog box. In the SAP interface, you might get the following error messages, which are clipped due to the substring limits on the **Status Text** field.

### The segment or group definition E2EDK36001 was not found in the IDoc meta

This error message means expected failures happen with other errors. For example, the failure to generate an IDoc XML payload because its segments aren't released by SAP. As a result, the segment type metadata required for conversion is missing.

To have these segments released by SAP, contact the ABAP engineer for your SAP system.

### The RequestContext on the IReplyChannel was closed without a reply being sent

For the SAP managed connector, this error message means unexpected failures happen when the catch-all handler for the channel terminates the channel due to an error, and rebuilds the channel to process other messages.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The SAP managed trigger is a webhook trigger that uses the SOAP-based SAP adapter. However, the SAP built-in trigger is an Azure Functions-based trigger that doesn't use a SOAP SAP adapter and doesn't get this error message.

- To acknowledge that your workflow received the IDoc, [add a Response action](../../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md#add-a-response-action) that returns a **200 OK** status code. Leave the body empty and don't change or add to the headers. The IDoc is transported through tRFC, which doesn't allow for a response payload.

- To reject the IDoc instead, respond with any HTTP status code other than **200 OK**. The SAP Adapter then returns an exception back to SAP on your behalf. You should only reject the IDoc to signal transport errors back to SAP, such as a misrouted IDoc that your application can't process. You shouldn't reject an IDoc for application-level errors, such as issues with the data contained in the IDoc. If you delay transport acceptance for application-level validation, you might experience negative performance due to blocking your connection from transporting other IDocs.

- If you receive this error message and experience systemic failures calling Azure Logic Apps, check that you've configured the network settings for your on-premises data gateway service for your specific environment. For example, if your network environment requires the use of a proxy to call Azure endpoints, you need to configure your on-premises data gateway service to use your proxy. For more information, review [Proxy Configuration](/dotnet/framework/network-programming/proxy-configuration).

- If you receive this error message and experience intermittent failures calling Azure Logic Apps, you might need to increase your retry count or also retry interval by following these steps:

  1. Check the SAP settings in your on-premises data gateway service configuration file named **Microsoft.PowerBI.EnterpriseGateway.exe.config**.

     1. Under the `configuration` root node, add a `configSections` element, if none exists.

     1. Under the `configSections` node, add a `section` element with the following attributes, if none exists: `name="SapAdapterSection" type="Microsoft.Adapters.SAP.Common.SapAdapterSection, Microsoft.Adapters.SAP.Common"`

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        >
        > Don't change the attributes in existing `section` elements, if such elements already exist.

        Your `configSections` element looks like the following version, if no other section or section group is declared in the gateway service configuration:

        ```xml
        <configSections>
          <section name="SapAdapterSection" type="Microsoft.Adapters.SAP.Common.SapAdapterSection, Microsoft.Adapters.SAP.Common"/>
        </configSections>
        ```

     1. Under the `configuration` root node, add an `SapAdapterSection` element, if none exists.

     1. Under the `SapAdapterSection` node, add a `Broker` element with the following attributes, if none exists: `WebhookRetryDefaultDelay="00:00:00.10" WebhookRetryMaximumCount="2"`

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        >
        > Change the attributes for the `Broker` element, even if the element already exists.

        The `SapAdapterSection` element looks like the following version, if no other element or attribute is declared in the SAP adapter configuration:

        ```xml
        <SapAdapterSection>
          <Broker WebhookRetryDefaultDelay="00:00:00.10" WebhookRetryMaximumCount="2" />
        </SapAdapterSection>
        ```

        The retry count setting looks like `WebhookRetryMaximumCount="2"`. The retry interval setting looks like `WebhookRetryDefaultDelay="00:00:00.10"` where the timespan format is `HH:mm:ss.ff`.

     > [!NOTE]
     >
     > For more information about the configuration file, review [Configuration file schema for .NET Framework](/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/).

  1. Save your changes.

  1. If you're using the on-premises data gateway, restart your gateway.
