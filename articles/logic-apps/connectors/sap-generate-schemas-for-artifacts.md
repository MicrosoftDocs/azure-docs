# Generate schemas for SAP artifacts by using workflows in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

This how-to guide shows how to create an example logic app workflow that generates schemas for SAP artifacts. The workflow starts with a **Request** trigger that can receive HTTP POST requests from your SAP server. The workflow then generates schemas for the specified IDoc and BAPI by using the SAP action named **Generate schemas** that sends a request to your SAP server. To send this request, you can use either the generic SAP managed connector action named **Send message to SAP**, or you can use the specific SAP managed or built-in action named **[BAPI] Call method in SAP**. This SAP action returns an [XML schema](#sample-xml-schemas) without the contents or data in the XML document itself. The workflow then uploads the schemas returned by the response to an integration account by using an Azure Resource Manager connector operation.

Schemas contain the following parts:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Request message structure | Use this information to form your BAPI **`get`** list. |
| Response message structure | Use this information to parse the response. |

Both Standard and Consumption logic app workflows offer the SAP *managed* connector, which is hosted and run in multitenant Azure. Standard workflows also offer the SAP *built-in* connector, which is hosted and run in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps. For more information, see [Connector technical reference](sap.md#connector-technical-reference).

## Prerequisites

- Before you start, make sure to [review and meet the SAP connector requirements](sap.md#prerequisites) for your specific scenario.

- If you want to upload your generated schemas to a repository, such as an [integration account](../enterprise-integration/create-integration-account.md), make sure that the repository exists.

- Either a Consumption logic app resource with a blank workflow or a Standard logic app resource with a blank workflow. If you don't have one, create this resource:

  - [Create an example Consumption logic app workflow using the Azure portal](/azure/logic-apps/quickstart-create-example-consumption-workflow)
  
  - [Create an example Standard logic app workflow using the Azure portal](/azure/logic-apps/create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal)

## Generate schemas for an SAP artifact

The following example logic app workflow triggers when the workflow's SAP trigger receives a request from an SAP server. The workflow then runs an SAP action that generates schemas for the specified SAP artifact.

### Add the Request trigger

To have your workflow receive requests from your SAP server over HTTP, you can use the [Request built-in trigger](../../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md). This trigger creates an endpoint with a URL where your SAP server can send HTTP POST requests to your workflow. When your workflow receives these requests, the trigger fires and runs the next step in your workflow.

Based on whether you have a Consumption or Standard workflow, follow the corresponding steps.

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Consumption logic app resource and blank workflow in the designer.

1. In the designer, follow [these general steps to find and add the Request built-in trigger named **When a HTTP request is received**](../create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-trigger).

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/add-request-trigger-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Request trigger for a Consumption workflow." lightbox="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/add-request-trigger-consumption.png":::

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

   This step generates an endpoint URL where your trigger can receive requests from your SAP server, for example:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/generate-http-endpoint-url-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Request trigger's generated endpoint URL for receiving requests in a Consumption workflow." lightbox="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/generate-http-endpoint-url-consumption.png":::

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Standard logic app resource and blank workflow in the designer.

1. In the designer, follow [these general steps to find and add the Request built-in trigger named **When a HTTP request is received**](../create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=standard#add-trigger).

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/add-request-trigger-standard.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Request trigger for a Standard workflow." lightbox="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/add-request-trigger-standard.png":::

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

   This step generates an endpoint URL where your trigger can receive requests from your SAP server, for example:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/generate-http-endpoint-url-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Request trigger's generated endpoint URL for receiving requests in a Standard workflow." lightbox="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/generate-http-endpoint-url-standard.png":::

---

### Add an SAP action to generate schemas

Based on whether you have a Consumption or Standard workflow, follow the corresponding steps.

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the workflow designer, under the **Request** trigger, follow [these general steps to find and add the SAP managed action named **Generate schemas**](../create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

   For more information about this SAP managed action, see [Generate schemas](/connectors/sap/#generate-schemas).

1. If prompted, provide the [connection information](/connectors/sap/#default-connection) for your on-premises SAP server. When you're done, select **Create new**. Otherwise, continue to the next step to set up the SAP action.

   By default, when you create a connection for an SAP managed operation, strong typing is used to check for invalid values by performing XML validation against the schema. This behavior can help you detect issues earlier. For more information about strong typing, see [Safe Typing setting](sap-create-example-scenario-workflows.md#safe-typing). For other available connection parameters, see [Default connection information](/connectors/sap/#default-connection).

   After Azure Logic Apps sets up and tests your connection, the action information pane appears.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/sap-generate-schemas-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow and SAP managed action named Generate schemas." lightbox="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/sap-generate-schemas-consumption.png":::

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > If you get a **Bad Gateway (500)** error or **Bad request (400)** error, see 
   > [500 Bad Gateway or 400 Bad Request error](sap-create-example-scenario-workflows.md#bad-gateway-request).
   > For more information about any connection problems that might happen, see 
   > [Troubleshoot connections](sap-create-example-scenario-workflows.md#troubleshoot-connections).

1. In the [**Generate schemas**](/connectors/sap/#generate-schemas) action, provide a path to the SAP action for which you want to generate a schema.

   This example uses the following sample path for the SAP action named **Send**:

   **`http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Idoc/3/ORDERS05//720/Send`**

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/sap-generate-schemas-action-path-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow, Generate schemas action, and path to an SAP action." lightbox="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/sap-generate-schemas-action-path-consumption.png":::

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > In the **sapActionsUris** section, you can use the expression editor to provide parameter values. 
   > This approach lets you use the same SAP action for different message types.

   For more information about the **Send** SAP action, see [Message schemas for IDoc operations](/biztalk/adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/message-schemas-for-idoc-operations).

   If you have the option to browse and select the folders along this path, follow these steps:

   1. From the **sapActionUris Item - 1** dropdown list, select **BAPI**, **IDOC**, **RFC**, or **TRFC**.

      This example selects **IDOC**. If you select a different operation type, the available parameters change based on your selection.

   1. Browse the SAP folders by using the arrows to find and select the SAP action to use.

      This example selects **ORDERS** > **ORDERS05** > **720** > **Send**.

1. To generate schemas for more than one action, in the **sapActionUris** section, select **Add new item**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/sap-generate-schemas-add-item-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows selecting the option to add a new item." lightbox="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/sap-generate-schemas-add-item-consumption.png":::

1. For each SAP action that you want to generate a schema, provide the path to that action, for example:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/sap-generate-schemas-multiple-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows multiple SAP actions to use for generating schemas." lightbox="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/sap-generate-schemas-multiple-consumption.png":::

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. In the workflow designer, under the **Request** trigger, follow [these general steps to find and add the SAP built-in action named **Generate Schema**](../create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=standard#add-action).

   For more information about this SAP built-in action, see [Generate Schema](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/built-in/reference/sap/#generate-schema-(preview)).

1. If prompted, provide the following connection information for your on-premises SAP server. When you're done, select **Create new**. Otherwise, continue to the next step to set up the SAP action.

   | Parameter | Required | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------------|
   | **Connection Name** | Yes | Enter a name for the connection. |
   | **Client** | Yes | The SAP client ID to use for connecting to your SAP server. |
   | **Authentication Type** | Yes | The authentication type to use for your connection. To create an SNC connection, see [Enable Secure Network Communications (SNC)](sap.md?tabs=standard#enable-secure-network-communications). |
   | **SAP Username** | Yes | The username for your SAP server. |
   | **SAP Password** | Yes | The password for your SAP server. |
   | **Logon Type** | Yes | Select either **ApplicationServer** or **Group**, and then configure the corresponding required parameters, even though they appear optional. <br><br>**Application Server**: <br>- **Server Host**: The host name for your SAP Application Server. <br>- **Service**: The service name or port number for your SAP Application Server. <br>- **System Number**: Your SAP server's system number, which ranges from 00 to 99.<br><br>**Group**: <br>- **Server Host**: The host name for your SAP Message Server. <br>- **Service Name or Port Number**: The service name or port number for your SAP Message Server. <br>- **System ID**: The system ID for your SAP server. <br>- **Logon Group**: The logon group for your SAP server. On your SAP server, you can find or edit the **Logon Group** value by opening the **CCMS: Maintain Logon Groups** (T-Code SMLG) dialog box. For more information, see [SAP Note 26317 - Set up for LOGON group for automatic load balancing](https://www.scribd.com/document/824103171/SAP-Note-26317-Set-up-for-LOGON-group-for-autom-load-balancing). |
   | **Language** | Yes | The language to use for sending data to your SAP server. The value is either **Default** (English) or one of the [permitted values](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/built-in/reference/sap/#parameters-21). <br><br>**Note**: The SAP built-in connector saves this parameter value as part of the SAP connection parameters. For more information, see [Change language headers for sending data to SAP](sap-create-example-scenario-workflows.md?tabs=standard#change-language-headers). |

   For more information about SNC, see [Getting started with SAP SNC for RFC integrations - SAP blog](https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-members/getting-started-with-sap-snc-for-rfc-integrations/ba-p/13983462).

   After Azure Logic Apps sets up and tests your connection, the action information pane appears, for example:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/sap-generate-schemas-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow and SAP built-in action named Generate Schema." lightbox="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/sap-generate-schemas-standard.png":::

   > [!NOTE]

   > If you get a **Bad Gateway (500)** error or **Bad request (400)** error, see 
   > [500 Bad Gateway or 400 Bad Request error](sap-create-example-scenario-workflows.md#bad-gateway-request). 
   > For more information about any connection problems that might happen, see 
   > [Troubleshoot connections](sap-create-example-scenario-workflows.md#troubleshoot-connections).

1. In the [**Generate Schema**](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/built-in/reference/sap/#generate-schema-(preview)) action,  provide a path to the SAP action for which you want to generate a schema.

   For **Operation Type**, this example selects **IDoc**. If you select a different operation type, the available parameters change based on your selection.

   | Parameter | Required | Value | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Operation Type** | Yes | **BAPI**, **IDoc**, **RFC**, or **tRFC** | The operation type to use for the schema generation. This example selects and continues with **IDoc**. |
   | **IDoc Type** | Yes | <*IDoc-type*> | Select the IDoc type to use for schema generation. This example selects **ORDERS05**. |
   | **Release** | Yes | <*IDoc-release-number*> | Select the IDoc release number. This example selects **720**. |
   | **Version** | Yes | <*IDoc-release-version*> | Select the IDoc release version. This example selects **3**. |
   | **Direction** | Yes | <*request-direction*> | Select the direction for the request. This example selects **Send**. |

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/sap-generate-schemas-select-idoc-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow, Generate Schema action, and IDoc artifact information." lightbox="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/sap-generate-schemas-select-idoc-standard.png":::

   For more information about the schemas for this SAP action, see [Message schemas for IDoc operations](/biztalk/adapters-and-accelerators/adapter-sap/message-schemas-for-idoc-operations).

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

### Test your workflow for schema generation

Based on whether you have a Consumption or Standard workflow, follow the corresponding steps.

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. If your Consumption logic app resource isn't already enabled, on your logic app menu, select **Overview**. On the toolbar, select **Enable**.

1. On the designer toolbar, select **Run** > **Run** to manually start your workflow.

1. To simulate a webhook trigger payload and trigger the workflow, send an HTTP request to the endpoint URL created by your workflow's **Request** trigger, including the method that the **Request** trigger expects, by using your HTTP request tool and its instructions. Make sure to include your message content with your request.

   This example uses the **POST** method and the endpoint URL to send an IDoc file, which must be in XML format and include the namespace for the SAP action that you selected, for example:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
   <Send xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Idoc/2/ORDERS05//720/Send">
     <idocData>
       <...>
     </idocData>
   </Send>
   ```

1. After you send your HTTP request, wait for the response from your workflow.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Your workflow might time out if all the steps required for the response don't finish within the [request time-out limit](../logic-apps-limits-and-config.md). 
   > If this condition happens, requests might get blocked. To help you diagnose problems, learn how you can [check workflow status and view run history in Azure Logic Apps](../view-workflow-status-run-history.md?tabs=consumption).

1. On the logic app menu, select **Overview**. On the **Run history** tab, select the workflow run.

1. Select the **Generate schemas** action to review the action's outputs.

   The outputs show the generated schemas for the specified messages.

For more information about reviewing workflow run history, see [Check workflow status, view run history, and set up alerts in Azure Logic Apps](../view-workflow-status-run-history.md?tabs=consumption).

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. If your Standard logic app resource is stopped or disabled, from your workflow, go to the logic app resource level, and select **Overview**. On the toolbar, select **Start**.

1. On the workflow designer toolbar, select **Run** > **Run** to manually start your workflow.

1. To simulate a webhook trigger payload and trigger the workflow, send an HTTP request to the endpoint URL created by your workflow's **Request** trigger, including the method that the **Request** trigger expects, by using your HTTP request tool and its instructions. Make sure to include your message content with your request.

   This example uses the **POST** method and the endpoint URL to send an IDoc file, which must be in XML format and include the namespace for the SAP action that you selected, for example:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
   <Send xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Idoc/2/ORDERS05//720/Send">
     <idocData>
       <...>
     </idocData>
   </Send>
   ```

1. After you send the HTTP request, wait for the response from your workflow.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Your workflow might time out if all the steps required for the response don't finish within the [request time-out limit](../logic-apps-limits-and-config.md). 
   > If this condition happens, requests might get blocked. To help you diagnose problems, learn how you can [check workflow status and view run history in Azure Logic Apps](../view-workflow-status-run-history.md?tabs=standard).

1. On your workflow menu, under **Tools**, select **Run history**.

1. On the **Run history** page, on the **Run history** tab, select the workflow run.

1. Select the **Generate Schema** action to review the action's outputs.

   The outputs show the generated schemas for the specified messages.

For more information about reviewing workflow run history, see [Check workflow status, view run history, and set up alerts in Azure Logic Apps](../monitor-logic-apps.md?tabs=standard).

## Upload schemas to an integration account

Optionally, you can download or store the generated schemas in repositories, such as an [integration account](../logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md) or Azure storage account like a blob container. Integration accounts provide a first-class experience with XML actions for workflows in Azure Logic Apps. You can optionally upload generated schemas to an existing integration account within the same workflow that generates those schemas by using the Azure Resource Manager action named **Create or update a resource**.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Schemas use base64-encoded format. To upload schemas to an integration account, you must decode them first 
> by using the `base64ToString()` function. The following example shows the code for the `properties` element:
>
> ```json
> "properties": {
>    "Content": "@base64ToString(items('For_each')?['Content'])",
>    "ContentType": "application/xml",
>    "SchemaType": "Xml"
> }
> ```

For this task, you need an [integration account](../logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md), if you don't already have one. Follow the corresponding steps based on whether you have a Consumption or Standard workflow. The procedure uploads schemas to an integration account from your workflow after schema generation.

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the workflow designer, under the **Generate schemas** action, follow [these general steps to add the Azure Resource Manager managed action named **Create or update a resource**](../create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

1. If you're prompted to sign in, do that now and continue.

   After Azure Logic Apps sets up and tests your connection, the action information pane appears:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/azure-resource-manager-action-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow and an Azure Resource Manager action named Create or update a resource." lightbox="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/azure-resource-manager-action-consumption.png":::

1. In the **Create or update a resource** action, provide the [required information](/connectors/arm/#create-or-update-a-resource).

   1. You can include any outputs from previous steps in the workflow. Select inside the parameter where you want to include the output. Select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list, and select the output to include.

   1. If the **Location** and **Properties** parameters don't appear on the **Parameters** tab, open the **Advanced parameters** list, and add those parameters.

   1. Provide values for the added parameters, for example:

      :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/azure-resource-manager-action-complete-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow and Azure Resource Manager action with added parameters named Location and Properties." lightbox="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/azure-resource-manager-action-complete-consumption.png":::

   The **Generate schemas** action generates schemas as a collection, so the designer automatically adds a **For each** loop around the Azure Resource Manager action, for example:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/azure-resource-manager-for-each-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow and for each loop with included Azure Resource Manager action." lightbox="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/azure-resource-manager-for-each-consumption.png":::

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. In the workflow designer, under the **Generate Schema** action, follow [these general steps to add the Azure Resource Manager managed action named **Create or update a resource**](../create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=standard#add-action).

1. If you're prompted to sign in, do that now and continue.

   After Azure Logic Apps sets up and tests your connection, the action information pane appears:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/azure-resource-manager-action-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow and an Azure Resource Manager action named Create or update a resource." lightbox="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/azure-resource-manager-action-standard.png":::

1. In the **Create or update a resource** action, provide the [required information](/connectors/arm/#create-or-update-a-resource).

   1. You can include any outputs from previous steps in the workflow. Select inside the parameter where you want to include the output. Select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list, and select the output to include.

   1. If the **Location** and **Properties** parameters don't appear on the **Parameters** tab, open the **Advanced parameters** list, and add those parameters.

   1. Provide values for the added parameters, for example:

      :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/azure-resource-manager-action-complete-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow and Azure Resource Manager action with added parameters named Location and Properties." lightbox="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/azure-resource-manager-action-complete-standard.png":::

   The **Generate Schema** action generates schemas as a collection, so the designer automatically adds a **For each** loop around the Azure Resource Manager action, for example:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/azure-resource-manager-for-each-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow and for each loop with included Azure Resource Manager action." lightbox="./media/sap-generate-schemas-for-artifacts/azure-resource-manager-for-each-standard.png":::

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

---

### Test your workflow

1. Follow [theses general steps to manually test and run your workflow](#test-your-workflow-for-schema-generation). Use the procedure that corresponds to your Consumption workflow in multitenant Azure Logic Apps or Standard workflow in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps.

1. After a successful run, go to the integration account, and confirm the generated schemas exist.

## Sample XML schemas

If you're learning how to generate an XML schema for use in creating a sample document, review the following samples. These examples show how you can work with many types of payloads, including:

* [RFC requests](#xml-samples-for-rfc-requests)
* [BAPI requests](#xml-samples-for-bapi-requests)
* [IDoc requests](#xml-samples-for-idoc-requests)
* Simple or complex XML schema data types
* Table parameters
* Optional XML behaviors

You can begin your XML schema with an optional XML prolog. The SAP connector works with or without the XML prolog.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8">
```

### XML samples for RFC requests

The following example shows a basic RFC call where the RFC name is `STFC_CONNECTION`. This request uses the default namespace named `xmlns=`. However, you can assign and use namespace aliases such as `xmlns:exampleAlias=`. The namespace value is the namespace for all the RFCs in SAP for Microsoft services. The request has a simple input parameter named `<REQUTEXT>`.

```xml
<STFC_CONNECTION xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/">
   <REQUTEXT>exampleInput</REQUTEXT>
</STFC_CONNECTION>
```

The following example shows an RFC call with a table parameter. This example call and group of test RFCs are available in all SAP systems. The table parameter is named `TCPICDAT`. The table line type is `ABAPTEXT`, and this element repeats for each row in the table. This example contains a single line named `LINE`. Requests with a table parameter can contain any number of fields, where the number is a positive integer (*n*). 

```xml
<STFC_WRITE_TO_TCPIC xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/">
   <RESTART_QNAME>exampleQName</RESTART_QNAME>
   <TCPICDAT>
      <ABAPTEXT xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Types/Rfc/">
         <LINE>exampleFieldInput1</LINE>
      </ABAPTEXT>
      <ABAPTEXT xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Types/Rfc/">
         <LINE>exampleFieldInput2</LINE>
      </ABAPTEXT>
      <ABAPTEXT xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Types/Rfc/">
         <LINE>exampleFieldInput3</LINE>
      </ABAPTEXT>
   </TCPICDAT>
</STFC_WRITE_TO_TCPIC>
```

> [!TIP]
>
> To review the result from RFC **STFC_WRITE_TO_TCPIC**, use the SAP Logon's Data Browser (T-Code SE16) and the table named **TCPIC**.

The following example shows an RFC call with a table parameter that has an anonymous field, which is a field without an assigned name. Complex types are declared under a separate namespace where the declaration sets a new default for the current node and all its child elements. The example uses the hex code `x002F` as an escape character for the forward slash symbol `/` because this symbol is reserved in the SAP field name.

```xml
<RFC_XML_TEST_1 xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/">
   <IM_XML_TABLE>
      <RFC_XMLCNT xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Rfc/">
         <_x002F_AnonymousField>AQIDBAU=</_x002F_AnonymousField>
      </RFC_XMLCNT>
   </IM_XML_TABLE>
</RFC_XML_TEST_1>
```

The previous example also shows how to encode binary arrays for the SAP data types `byte` and `XString`. The binary arrays are base64 encoded in XML (XSD binary data type `xs:base64Binary`). In the example, the sample base64 string value `AQIDBAU=` decodes as the binary array `[01][02][03][04]`. This encoding differs and is more space-efficient than the hex encoding of the underlying SAP .NET Connector. With hex encoding, the same value is encoded as the string `01020304`. 

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Exercise caution when you use binary array encoding because hex encoding uses a subset of the base64 range and 
> appears as valid base64 values. For example, the string value `01020304` also decodes as a valid base64

The following example includes prefixes for the namespaces. You can declare all the prefixes at one time, or you can declare any number of prefixes as attributes of a node. The RFC namespace alias named `ns0` is used as the root and parameters for the basic type.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Complex types are declared under a different namespace for RFC types with 
> the alias `ns3` instead of the regular RFC namespace with the alias `ns0`.

#### XML samples for BAPI requests

The following XML samples are example requests to [call the BAPI method](/connectors/sap/#[bapi]-call-method-in-sap-(preview)).

> [!NOTE]
>
> SAP makes business objects available to external systems by describing them in response to RFC `RPY_BOR_TREE_INIT`, 
> which Azure Logic Apps issues without an input filter. Azure Logic Apps inspects the output table `BOR_TREE`. 
> The `SHORT_TEXT` field is used for names of business objects. Business objects not returned by SAP in the output 
> table aren't accessible to Azure Logic Apps.
> 
> If you use custom business objects, make sure to publish and release these business objects in SAP. Otherwise, 
> SAP doesn't list your custom business objects in the output table `BOR_TREE`. You can't access your custom 
> business objects in Azure Logic Apps until you expose the business objects from SAP.

The following example gets a list of banks by using the BAPI method `GETLIST`. This sample contains the business object for a bank named `BUS1011`.

```xml
<GETLIST xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Bapi/BUS1011">
   <BANK_CTRY>US</BANK_CTRY>
   <MAX_ROWS>10</MAX_ROWS>
</GETLIST>
```

The following example creates a bank object by using the `CREATE` method. This example uses the same business object named `BUS1011`, as the previous example. When you use the `CREATE` method to create a bank, make sure to commit your changes because this method isn't committed by default.

> [!TIP]
>
> Make sure that your XML document follows any validation rules configured in your SAP system. For example, for this 
> sample document, in the USA, the bank key (`<BANK_KEY>`) must be a bank routing number, also known as an ABA number.

```xml
<CREATE xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Bapi/BUS1011">
   <BANK_ADDRESS>
      <BANK_NAME xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Types/Rfc">ExampleBankName</BANK_NAME>
      <REGION xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Types/Rfc">ExampleRegionName</REGION>
      <STREET xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Types/Rfc">ExampleStreetAddress</STREET>
      <CITY xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Types/Rfc">Redmond</CITY>
   </BANK_ADDRESS>
   <BANK_CTRY>US</BANK_CTRY>
   <BANK_KEY>123456789</BANK_KEY>
</CREATE>
```

The following example gets details for a bank by using the bank routing number, which is the value for `<BANK_KEY>`.

```xml
<GETDETAIL xmlns="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Bapi/BUS1011">
   <BANKCOUNTRY>US</BANKCOUNTRY>
   <BANKKEY>123456789</BANKKEY>
</GETDETAIL>
```

### XML samples for IDoc requests

To generate a plain SAP IDoc XML schema, use the **SAP Logon** application and the `WE60` T-Code. Access the SAP documentation through the user interface, and generate XML schemas in XSD format for your IDoc types and extensions. For more information about generic SAP formats and payloads, and their built-in dialogs, review the [SAP documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs).

This example declares the root node and namespaces. The URI in the sample code, `http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Idoc/3/ORDERS05//700/Send`, declares the following configuration:

* `/IDoc` is the root node for all IDocs.

* `/3` is the record types version for common segment definitions.

* `/ORDERS05` is the IDoc type.

* `//` is an empty segment because there's no IDoc extension.

* `/700` is the SAP version.

* `/Send` is the action to send the information to SAP.

```xml
<ns0:Send xmlns:ns0="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Idoc/3/ORDERS05//700/Send" xmlns:ns3="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization" xmlns:ns1="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Types/Idoc/Common/" xmlns:ns2="http://Microsoft.LobServices.Sap/2007/03/Idoc/3/ORDERS05//700">
   <ns0:idocData>
```

You can repeat the `idocData` node to send a batch of IDocs in a single call. In the following example, there's one control record named `EDI_DC40`, and multiple data records.

```xml
<...>
   <ns0:idocData>
      <ns2:EDI_DC40>
         <ns1:TABNAM>EDI_DC40</ns1:TABNAM>
         <...>
         <ns1:ARCKEY>Cor1908207-5</ns1:ARCKEY>
      </ns2:EDI_DC40>
      <ns2:E2EDK01005>
         <ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>E23DK01005</ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>
         <ns2:CURCY>USD</ns2:CURCY>
      </ns2:E2EDK01005>
      <ns2:E2EDK03>
      <...>
   </ns0:idocData>
```

The following example shows a sample IDoc control record, which uses a prefix named `EDI_DC`. You must update the values to match your SAP installation and IDoc type. For example, your IDoc client code might not be `800`. Contact your SAP team to make sure you're using the correct values for your SAP installation.

```xml
<ns2:EDI_DC40>
   <ns:TABNAM>EDI_DC40</ns1:TABNAM>
   <ns:MANDT>800</ns1:MANDT>
   <ns:DIRECT>2</ns1:DIRECT>
   <ns:IDOCTYP>ORDERS05</ns1:IDOCTYP>
   <ns:CIMTYP></ns1:CIMTYP>
   <ns:MESTYP>ORDERS</ns1:MESTYP>
   <ns:STD>X</ns1:STD>
   <ns:STDVRS>004010</ns1:STDVRS>
   <ns:STDMES></ns1:STDMES>
   <ns:SNDPOR>SAPENI</ns1:SNDPOR>
   <ns:SNDPRT>LS</ns1:SNDPRT>
   <ns:SNDPFC>AG</ns1:SNDPFC>
   <ns:SNDPRN>ABAP1PXP1</ns1:SNDPRN>
   <ns:SNDLAD></ns1:SNDLAD>
   <ns:RCVPOR>BTSFILE</ns1:RCVPOR>
   <ns:RCVPRT>LI</ns1:RCVPRT>
```

The following example shows a sample data record with plain segments. This example uses the SAP date format. Strong-typed documents can use native XML date formats, such as `2020-12-31 23:59:59`.

```xml
<ns2:E2EDK01005>
   <ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>E2EDK01005</ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>
      <ns2:CURCY>USD</ns2:CURCY>
      <ns2:BSART>OR</ns2:BSART>
      <ns2:BELNR>1908207-5</ns2:BELNR>
      <ns2:ABLAD>CC</ns2:ABLAD>
   </ns2>
   <ns2:E2EDK03>
      <ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>E2EDK03</ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>
      <ns2:IDDAT>002</ns2:IDDAT>
      <ns2:DATUM>20160611</ns2:DATUM>
   </ns2:E2EDK03>
```

The following example shows a data record with grouped segments. The record includes a group parent node named `E2EDKT1002GRP`, and multiple child nodes, including `E2EDKT1002` and `E2EDKT2001`. 

```xml
<ns2:E2EDKT1002GRP>
   <ns2:E2EDKT1002>
      <ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>E2EDKT1002</ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>
         <ns2:TDID>ZONE</ns2:TDID>
   </ns2:E2EDKT1002>
   <ns2:E2EDKT2001>
      <ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>E2EDKT2001</ns2:DATAHEADERCOLUMN_SEGNAM>
         <ns2:TDLINE>CRSD</ns2:TDLINE>
   </ns2:E2EDKT2001>
</ns2:E2EDKT1002GRP>
```

The recommended method is to create an IDoc identifier for use with tRFC. You can set this transaction identifier named `tid` by using the [Send IDoc operation](/connectors/sap/#send-idoc) in the SAP managed connector.

The following example shows an alternate method to set the transaction identifier, or `tid`. In this example, the last data record segment node and the IDoc data node are closed. Then, the GUID, `guid`, is used as the tRFC identifier to detect duplicates.

```xml
     </E2STZUM002GRP>
  </idocData>
  <guid>8820ea40-5825-4b2f-ac3c-b83adc34321c</guid>
</Send>
```
