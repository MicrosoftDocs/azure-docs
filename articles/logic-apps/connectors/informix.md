# Access resources in IBM Informix databases from workflows in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

To automate tasks that manage resources in IBM Informix databases by using workflows in Azure Logic Apps, you can use the IBM **Informix** connector. This connector includes a Microsoft client that communicates with remote Informix server computers across a TCP/IP network, including cloud-based databases such as IBM Informix for Windows running in Azure virtualization and on-premises databases.

You can connect to the following Informix platforms and versions if they are configured to support Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) client connections:

* IBM Informix 12.1
* IBM Informix 11.7

This article shows how to connect from a workflow in Azure Logic Apps to an Informix database and add operations for various tasks.

## Connector technical reference

For technical information based on the connector's Swagger description, such as operations, limits, and other details, see the [connector reference article](/connectors/informix/).

The following table provides more information about the available connector operations:

| Action | Description | Parameters and descriptions |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| **Delete row** | Remove a row from the specified Informix table by running an Informix `DELETE` statement. | - **Table name**: The name for the Informix table that you want <br>- **Row ID**: The unique ID for the row to delete, for example, `9999` |
| **Get row** | Get a single row from the specified Informix table by running an Informix `SELECT WHERE` statement. | - **Table name**: The name for the Informix table that you want. <br>- **Row ID**: The unique ID for the row, for example, `9999`. |
| **Get rows** | Get all the rows in the specified Informix table by running an Informix `SELECT *` statement. | **Table name**: The name for the Informix table that you. want <br><br>To add other parameters to this action, add them from the **Advanced parameters** list. For more information, see the [connector reference article](/connectors/informix/). |
| **Get tables** | List Informix tables by running an Informix `CALL` statement. | None |
| **Insert row** | Add a row to the specified Informix table by running an Informix `INSERT` statement. | - **Table name**: The name for the Informix table that you want. <br>- **Row**: The row with the values to add. |
| **Update row** | Edit a row in the specified Informix table by running an Informix `UPDATE` statement. | - **Table name**: The name for the Informix table that you want <br>- **Row ID**: The unique ID for the row to update, for example, `9999`. <br>- **Row**: The row with the updated values, for example, `102`. |

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* To connect with on-premises Informix databases, you need to [download and install the on-premises data gateway](../logic-apps-gateway-install.md) on a local computer and then [create an Azure data gateway resource in the Azure portal](../logic-apps-gateway-connection.md).

* The Consumption or Standard logic app workflow where you need access to your Informix database.

  The Informix connector provides only actions, so your workflow must start with an existing trigger that best suits your scenario. This example uses the [**Recurrence** trigger](../../connectors/connectors-native-recurrence.md).

  If you don't have a logic app workflow, see the following articles:

  * [Create an example Consumption logic app workflow](../quickstart-create-example-consumption-workflow.md)

  * [Create an example Standard logic app workflow](../create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal.md)

## Add an Informix action

Based on whether you have a Consumption or Standard workflow, follow the corresponding steps on the matching tab:

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Consumption logic app resource.

1. On the resource sidebar, under **Development Tools**, select the designer to open the workflow.

1. On the designer, follow these [general steps to add the **Informix** action that you want](../add-trigger-action-workflow.md?tabs=consumption#add-action) to your workflow.

1. On the connection pane, provide the [connection information for your Informix database](#create-connection).

1. After you successfully create the connection, on the action pane, provide the necessary information for the action.

1. When you're done, save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

1. Either [test your workflow](#test-workflow) or continue adding actions to your workflow.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Standard logic app resource.

1. On the resource sidebar, under **Workflows**, select **Workflows**, and then select your workflow.

1. On the workflow sidebar, under **Tools**, select the designer to open the workflow.

1. On the designer, follow these [general steps to add the **Informix** action that you want](../add-trigger-action-workflow.md?tabs=standard#add-action) to your workflow.

1. On the connection pane, provide the [connection information for your Informix database](#create-connection).

1. After you successfully create the connection, on the action pane, provide the necessary information for the action.

1. When you're done, save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

1. Either [test your workflow](#test-workflow) or continue adding actions to your workflow.

## Connection information

1. For an on-premises Informix database, select **Connect via on-premises data gateway** to view the related required parameters.

1. Specify the following connection information:

   | Parameter name | JSON parameter name | Required | Example value | Description |
   |----------------|---------------------|----------|---------------|-------------|
   | **Connection Name** | `name` | Yes | `informix-demo-connection` | The name for the connection. |
   | **Server** | `server` | Yes | - Cloud database: `informixdemo.cloudapp.net:9089` <br><br>- On-premises database: `informixdemo:9089` | The TCP/IP address or alias that is in either IPv4 or IPv6 format, followed by a colon and a TCP/IP port number |
   | **Database** | `database` | Yes | `nwind` | The DRDA Relational Database Name (RDBNAM) or Informix database name (dbname). Informix accepts a 128-byte string. |
   | **Username** | `username` | No | <*database-user-name*> | Your user name for the database. |
   | **Password** | `password` | No | <*database-password*> | Your password for the database. |
   | **Authentication** | `authentication` | On-premises only | **Windows** (kerberos) or **Basic** | The authentication type required by your database. This parameter appears only when you select **Connect via on-premises data gateway**. <br><br>**Important**: Basic authentication has significant security disadvantages, such as sending credentials with every request and being susceptible to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. While this method might suit certain scenarios, consider more secure authentication methods when available. For more information, see the following resources: <br><br>- [Authentication guidance](#authentication-guidance) <br><br>- [Kerberos authentication overview in Windows Server](/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-authentication-overview) <br><br>- [Authentication and verification methods available in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods) |
   | **Gateway** | `gateway` | On-premises only | - **Subscription**: <*Azure-subscription*> <br><br>- <*Azure-on-premises-data-gateway-resource*> | The Azure subscription and Azure resource name for the on-premises data gateway that you created in the Azure portal. The **Gateway** property and sub-properties appears only when you select **Connect via on-premises data gateway**. |

   The following examples show sample connections for cloud databases and on-premises databases:
