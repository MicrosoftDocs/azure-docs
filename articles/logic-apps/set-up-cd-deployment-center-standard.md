# Set up CD for Standard logic apps with Deployment Center

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-standard.md)]

To streamline deployment automation for Standard logic apps, you can directly integrate your source code repository with your logic app resources by using Deployment Center. This capability helps you set up continuous deployment (CD) directly within your logic app, so you can make sure that every change committed to your repository gets automatically deployed to your logic app. Your team can then ship new features, fix bugs, and respond to changes faster, yet maintain control and visibility over the deployment process.

Deployment Center supports multiple source control providers, seamlessly fits into modern DevOps workloads and scenarios, and makes sure that your logic apps stay current and production ready.

Due to Azure Logic Apps (Standard) similarities with Azure Functions, for more information about Deployment Center, see [Continuous deployment for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-continuous-deployment.md).

## Known issues and limitations

For Deployment Center integration, the Visual Studio Code generated scripts don't include the following activities:

- Deployment for managed connectors that run in global, multitenant Azure.
 
- Build and deployment for custom code.

If you need a process that manages deployment for both custom code and Azure resources, see [Automate build and deployment for Standard logic app workflows with Azure DevOps](/azure/logic-apps/automate-build-deployment-standard).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- [Visual Studio Code with the Azure Logic Apps (Standard) extension installed and their prerequisites](/azure/logic-apps/create-single-tenant-workflows-visual-studio-code#prerequisites).

- An Azure Key Vault resource for you to store connection strings and secrets.

  For more information, see [Quickstart: Create a key vault using the Azure portal](/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal).

- Your Standard logic app resource with the following requirements:

  | Requirement | Description |
  |-------------|-------------|
  | Enable the **SCM Basic Auth Publishing Credentials** setting. | To enable this setting, see [Turn on SCM Basic Auth Publishing Credentials](#turn-on-scm-basic-auth-publishing-credentials). |
  | Create a *user-assigned managed identity* on your logic app. | This identity needs to have role assignments on the following resources: <br><br>- **Logic Apps Standard Contributor** role on your logic app's resource group. <br><br>- **Key Vault Secrets User** role on your key vault resource. <br><br>For more information, see [Create the user-assigned managed identity and assign roles](#create-user-assigned-managed-identity-and-assign-roles). |
  | Create a workspace and project in Visual Studio Code for your logic app. | This workspace also needs a connection to your source control repository. To create the workspace and project, you can [export your Standard logic app to Visual Studio Code](export-standard-logic-app-to-visual-studio-code.md). |

### Turn on SCM Basic Auth publishing credentials

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Standard logic app resource.

1. On the resource sidebar, under **Settings**, select **Configuration**.

1. On the **General settings** tab, under **Platform settings**, select **SCM Basic Auth Publishing Credentials** so that the setting is turned on.

1. When you're done, select **Apply**.

The following example shows where to find the **SCM Basic Auth Publishing Credentials** setting:

### Create user-assigned managed identity and assign roles

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Standard logic app resource.

1. Follow the [general steps to create the user-assigned managed identity](authenticate-with-managed-identity.md?tabs=standard#create-user-assigned-identity-in-the-azure-portal).

1. Follow the [general steps to add the user-assigned managed identity to your logic app](authenticate-with-managed-identity.md?tabs=standard#add-user-assigned-identity-to-logic-app-in-the-azure-portal).

1. Follow the [general steps to give the identity access to the resources](authenticate-with-managed-identity.md?tabs=standard#give-identity-access-to-resources) in the [Prerequisites section](#prerequisites).

1. When you're done, continue on to create scripts for Deployment Center.

## Generate scripts for Deployment Center

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the workspace and project for your Standard logic app.

1. On the Visual Studio Code Activity Bar, select **Explorer** (files icon) to open the Explorer window, which shows your logic app project and files.

1. In the **Explorer** window, find the project root level. Open the project context menu, and select **Generate deployment scripts**.

1. Follow the prompts to complete the following steps:

   1. Select the Azure subscription for your deployed Standard logic app.

   1. Select the Azure resource group for your logic app, and then select your logic app.

   1. Select the associated user-assigned managed identity that has **Logic Apps Standard Contributor** role-based access.

   When you're done, Visual Studio Code creates the following folders and files:

   | Folder name | File name | Description |
   |-------------|-----------|-------------|
   | <*logic-app-project-folder-name*> | **cloud.settings.json** | This file contains the following content: <br><br>- Keys copied from the **local.settings.json** file and required for logic app deployment. <br><br>- Placeholders to specify the key vault references for any secrets. <br><br>- Any associated nonsecret values. |
   | **deployment** | **deploy.ps1** | This deployment script parameterizes the items that you selected during deployment script generation. The script also performs the following tasks: <br><br>- Deploys the logic app code. <br><br>- Updates the authentication required for any Azure-hosted managed connection definition in the **connections.json** file. <br><br>- Configures the settings defined in the **cloud.settings.json** file created in your logic app project. |
   | <*logic-app-project-folder-name*> | **README.md** | This file contains instructions about how to update the **cloud.settings.json** so you can safely deploy application secrets, for example: <br><br>- Connection strings required for built-in, service provider-based connections in your project. <br><br>- Keys for Azure API Management, Azure Functions, and so on. <br><br>- Keys for any other customer-defined secrets. |

1. Review the created files, and update the **cloud.settings.json** with your key vault references.

1. When you're done, push your changes to your source control repository.
