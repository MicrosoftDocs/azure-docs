If you're new to Standard workflows in Azure Logic Apps or updating a workflow built by other developers, you might have many questions about workflows, connectors, their operations, and other tasks that you need to complete in Azure Logic Apps. For example, Azure Logic Apps provides 1,000+ connectors for you to use. How do you choose the best ones for your workflow?

In the Azure portal, within the Standard workflow designer, the workflow assistant offers a chat box so that you can ask questions about the currently open workflow or about Azure Logic Apps in general. The assistant generates answers and provides access to Azure Logic Apps documentation and best practices. When you use the assistant, you don't have to switch context to search or browse for documentation online.

The workflow assistant delivers curated information based on reputable knowledge sources, such as the Azure Logic Apps documentation on Microsoft Learn, connector schemas, and tech community blogs. The assistant can also build responses using the currently open workflow in the designer. That way, you can learn how to complete tasks specific to your workflow's context. For example, you can ask how to configure a specific action in the workflow, get recommendations about the action's inputs or outputs, how to test that data, and so on.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > If you close the workflow assistant pane, your chat history isn't saved or preserved. 
   > When you reopen the assistant, you start with new chat box.

1. [Provide optional feedback about your experience with the workflow assistant](#provide-feedback).

## Limitations

- Inaccurate responses

  The workflow assistant can generate valid responses that might not be semantically correct or capture the intent behind your prompt. As the language model trains with more data over time, the responses will improve. Always make sure to carefully review the assistant's recommendations before you apply them to your workflows.

- No support for conversation threads

  The workflow assistant currently responds only to the immediate question, and not earlier questions in the same chat session.

- Workflow size

  You might experience different performance levels in the workflow assistant, based on factors such as the number of workflow operations or complexity. The assistant is trained on workflows with different complexity levels but still has limited scope and might not be able to handle very large workflows. These limitations are primarily related to token constraints in the queries sent to Azure OpenAI Service. The Azure Logic Apps team is committed to continuous improvement and enhancing these limitations through iterative updates.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

**Q**: Can the workflow assistant answer questions about any topic?

**A**: The workflow assistant is trained to answer only questions about Azure Logic Apps. To make sure that responses are grounded and relevant to Azure Logic Apps, the assistant was evaluated using valid and harmful prompts from various sources. The assistant is trained to not answer any harmful questions. If you ask questions about Azure that are unrelated to Azure Logic Apps, the assistant gracefully hands off processing to Azure Copilot.

**Q**: How does the workflow assistant use my query to generate responses?

**A**: The workflow is powered by [Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) and [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), which use Azure Logic Apps documentation from reputable sources along with internet data that's used to train GPT 3.5-Turbo. This content is processed into a vectorized format, which is then accessible through a backend system built on Azure App Service. Queries are triggered based on interactions with the workflow designer.

When you enter your question in the assistant's chat box, the Azure Logic Apps backend performs preprocessing and forwards the results to a large language model in Azure OpenAI Service. This model generates responses based on the current context in the form of the workflow definition's JSON code and your prompt. 

**Q**: What data does the workflow assistant collect?

**A**: To provide contextual responses, the workflow assistant relies on your workflow's sanitized JSON definition, which is used only to scope the responses and isn't stored anywhere. The workflow definition is sanitized to make sure that no customer data or secrets are passed as context. For troubleshooting purposes, the assistant collects some telemetry about UI interactions, but omits any customer or personal data.

**Q**: What happens to any personal or customer data entered in the workflow assistant? 

**A**: The workflow assistant doesn't collect, save, store, or share any personal or customer data, including any information in workflow assistant's chat history.

**Q**: Where can I learn about privacy and data protection for Azure?

**A**: The workflow assistant follows responsible practices in accordance with the [Azureâ€¯Privacy policy](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/trusted-cloud/privacy). For more information, see [Azure customer data protection](../security/fundamentals/protection-customer-data.md) and [Microsoft data protection and privacy](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy).

**Q**: Where can I learn about responsible and ethical AI practices at Microsoft?

**A**: The workflow assistant follows responsible and ethical AI practices in accordance with the [Microsoft responsible AI principles and approach](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/principles-and-approach).

**Q**: Does Azure Logic Apps own the workflows suggested by the workflow assistant? 

**A**: The workflow assistant doesn't own the suggestions that the assistant provides to you nor the workflows that you build based on these suggestions.

**Q**: What's the difference between Azure OpenAI Service and ChatGPT?

**A**: [Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) is an enterprise-ready AI technology that's powered and optimized for your business processes and your business data to meet security and privacy requirements.

[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) is built by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) and is a general-purpose large language model (LLM) trained by OpenAI on a massive dataset of text, designed to engage in human-like conversations and answer a wide range of questions on several topics.
