# CONTRL acknowledgments and error codes for EDIFACT messages in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

In Azure Logic Apps, you can create workflows that handle EDIFACT messages for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) communication when you use **EDIFACT** operations. In EDI messaging, acknowledgments provide the status from processing an EDI interchange. When receiving an interchange, the [**EDIFACT Decode** action](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-edifact.md) can return one or more types of acknowledgments to the sender, based on which acknowledgment types are enabled and the specified level of validation.

This topic provides a brief overview about the EDIFACT CONTRL ACK, the CONTRL ACK segments in an interchange, and the error codes used in those segments.

## CONTRL as technical and functional acknowledgment

For EDIFACT-encoded messages, the CONTRL acknowledgment (ACK) works as both a technical acknowledgment *and* functional acknowledgment. The full CONTRL message serves as the functional ACK, while sections in the functional ACK are reused for the technical ACK. For example, if you select both technical and functional ACKs in the agreement properties for the sending partner or in the global properties, the **EDIFACT Decode** action generates two CONTRL messages, a CONTRL technical ACK and a CONTRL functional ACK. The CONTRL ACK conforms to the schema for **EFACT_<*version-number*>_CONTRL.xsd**.

> [!NOTE]
> With EDIFACT message processing in Azure Logic Apps, a CONTRL message, whether for receipt acknowledgment, acceptance, or rejection, is sent as a response to a received 
> interchange that contains only one or more CONTRL messages. In Logic Apps, no CONTRL message is sent as a response to a received interchange that contains only one or more CONTRL messages. 
>
> Errors in received CONTRL messages must be reported by a means other than a CONTRL message. If one or more CONTRL messages are contained in an interchange that contains data messages, 
> the CONTRL message that's generated as a response to that interchange is generated as if no CONTRL messages were contained in the received interchange.

As a technical acknowledgment, the CONTRL message indicates that the interchange recipient received the subject interchange and has the following responsibilities:

* Checked parts of the interchange to confirm the syntactic accuracy of the data elements copied into the reporting Interchange Response (UCI) segment.
* Accepts the responsibility to notify the sender about the acceptance or rejection of the other parts in the interchange.
* Takes reasonable measures to notify the sender.

> [!NOTE]
> A CONTRL technical ACK reports the `Rejected` status only when the incoming EDIFACT message is a duplicate, or errors exist in the envelope, such as an 
> issue with the character set. EDIFACT doesn't report the `Interchange accepted with errors` status in a CONTRL technical ACK, as x12 does using the TA104 
> field in a TA1 acknowledgment. If part of the EDIFACT message is accepted, the CONTRL technical ACK reports `Accepted` status. In some scenarios, 
> if part of the message is rejected, the CONTRL ACK still reports the `Accepted` status. In such scenarios, the UCI5 element might report the error.

As a functional acknowledgment, the CONTRL message reports the status, such as the acceptance or rejection, for the received interchange, group, or message, including any errors or unsupported functionality. The message also indicates that the interchange recipient:

* Received the referenced levels of the acknowledged interchange.
* Checked that no fatal syntactic errors in the acknowledged referenced level prevent further interchange processing.
* Checked that all acknowledged parts of service segments are semantically correct, if no errors are reported.
* Complies with the requested actions in the acknowledged and referenced levels of the service segments.
* Accepted the responsibility to notify the sender by means other than sending a CONTRL message in the following cases:

  * Any syntactic or semantic errors are later found in the relevant part.
  * The part can't be processed for some other reason after the part has been acknowledged in a submitted CONTRL message.

* Takes reasonable measure to make sure such errors are found and to notify the sender.

Rejection implies that the interchange recipient:

* Can't acknowledge the interchange or any relevant parts for reasons indicated in the CONTRL message.
* Won't take any further action on business information contained in the rejected part of the subject interchange.

## CONTRL technical ACK segments

If you select the option to generate a technical acknowledgment in an EDIFACT agreement, or if the **UNB9** message field is set to `2`, a CONTRL message is generated as a technical ACK to report the results from receiving the interchange.

The following table describes the CONTRL technical ACK segments in an interchange and uses the following definitions:

* M = Mandatory
* O = Optional

| Name | Mandatory or optional | Description |
|------|-----------------------|-------------|
| UNH message header | M | The Message Header Segment (UNH) identifies and specifies the message. |
| UCI interchange response | M | Identifies the interchange and indicates the nature of interchange receipt. The UCI segment has a max occurrence of `1`, and as a result, reports the first error found in a control segment. |
| UNT message trailer | M | An error is reported in the UCI5 data element named `Syntax Error Code`. For EDIFACT-encoded messages, no `Accepted with errors` condition exists, as with X12-encoded interchanges. |
||||

### CONTRL technical ACK data elements

The CONTRL technical ACK includes the following data elements:

| Element | Name | Usage |
|---------|------|-------|
| UNH1 | Message reference number | - |
| UNH2 | Message identifier subcomponents | Subcomponents: <p><p>- 1 = CONTRL <br>- 2 = 4 <br>- 3 = 1 <br>- 4 = UN |
| UCI1 | Interchange control number | Mapped from the UNB5 field of the received message. |
| UCI2 | Interchange sender | Mapped from the UNB2 field of the received message. <p><p>- Mandatory: The first subcomponent, or identification. <br>- Optional: The second subcomponent, or code qualifier and the third component, or reverse routing address. |
| UCI3 | Interchange recipient | Mapped from the UNB3 field of the received message. <p><p>- Mandatory: The first subcomponent, or identification. <br>- Optional: The second subcomponent, or code qualifier. |
| UCI4 | Action code | This element is mandatory. Action codes: <p><p>- 8, if the interchange is accepted. <br>- 7, if the interchange is accepted but some transaction sets are rejected. <br>- 4, if the interchange is rejected due to an error in the UNA or UNB segment. |
| UCI5 | Syntax Error Code | This element is conditionally optional and identifies the error condition, if any. |
| UCI6 | Service Segment Tag | This element is conditionally optional and identifies the segment that has the error condition in the UCI5 data element. |
| UCI7 | Data element identification | Identifies the data elements that have the error condition in the UCI5 data element. Subcomponents: <p><p>- Mandatory: Position of erroneous data element in segment. <br>- Conditionally optional: Position of erroneous component data element in segment, and occurrence of erroneous data element in segment. |
| UCI8 | - | - |
| UNT1 | Count of segments | - |
| UNT2 | Message reference number | - |
||||

## CONTRL functional ACK segments

If you select the option to generate a functional acknowledgment in an EDIFACT agreement, or if the **UNB9** message field is set to `1`, a CONTRL message is generated as a functional ACK to report the results from checking the syntax of the interchange.

The following table describes the CONTRL functional ACK segments in an interchange and uses the following definitions:

* M = Mandatory
* O = Optional

| Name | Mandatory or optional | Description |
|------|-----------------------|-------------|
| UNH message header | M | The Message Header Segment (UNH) identifies and specifies the message. |
| UCI segment | M | Identifies the interchange, indicates the status for the interchange receipt, and contains references to the UNA, UNB, and UNZ segments in the received interchange. The UCI segment has a max occurrence of `1`, and as a result, reports the first error found in a control segment. |
| UCF segment | M, if the UNG segment exists | Identifies a group segment, which is encapsulated by the UNG header and UNE trailer, and indicates the nature of any error. |
| UCM segment | M | Identifies a message segment, which is encapsulated by the UNH header and UNT trailer, and indicates the nature of any error. |
| UCS segment | M | Identifies a transaction set and indicates the nature of any error. |
| UCD segment | O, conditionally | Identifies an erroneous composite or component data element and indicates the nature of the error. |
| UNT message trailer | M | If a received CONTRL functional acknowledgment contains only UNH, UCI, and UNT segments, the EDIReceive pipeline processes the acknowledgment as a CONTRL receipt technical ACK. Each segment instance at a reporting level can report only one error, for example, the UCI, UCF, UCM, UCS, and UCD segments. |
||||

### SG loops and CONTRL functional ACK structure

Based on whether the received interchange includes one or more groups, the structure for the CONTRL functional ACK differs.

* If the interchange includes a group, the ACK contains one UCF segment per group. Each UCF segment contains one UCM segment per message. Each UCM segment also includes a series of UCS and UCD segments in tandem.

  The XML form of the ACK message includes the following loop elements:

  * An SG3Loop element that encapsulates each UCF segment.
  * An SG4Loop element that encapsulates each UCM element.
  * An SG5Loop element that encapsulates each pair of UCS and UCD elements.

  SG loop tags don't exist in the native EDI message format.

* If the interchange doesn't include a group, the ACK doesn't contain any UCF segments. Instead, the ACK includes one UCM segment per message. Each UCM segment includes a series of UCS and UCD segments in tandem.

* The XML form of the ACK message includes the following loop elements:

  * An SG1Loop element that encapsulates each UCM element.
  * An SG2Loop element that encapsulates each pair of UCS and UCD elements.

  As with interchanges that include groups, the SG tags don't exist in the native ACK format.

By default and industry usage, SG1/SG4 loops aren't expected for accepted transaction sets. However, to support compliance with standards, you can force generation of SG1/SG4 loops by following these steps:
 
1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your integration account.
1. On the integration account menu, under **Settings**, select **Agreements**.
1. Open your EDIFACT agreement, and select **Send Settings**.
1. Under **Acknowledgement**, select **Acknowledgement (CONTRL)**. You can now select **Generate SG1/SG4 loop for accepted transaction sets**.

   If this checkbox is selected, the receive pipeline generates SG1/SG4 loops whether the transaction set is accepted or rejected. Otherwise, these loops are generated only for erroneous transaction sets where UCM5 is not equal to `7`.

### CONTRL functional ACK data elements

The CONTRL message contains several mandatory data elements that are copied from the received interchange. If the data element in the interchange is missing or is syntactically invalid, a syntactically valid CONTRL message can't be generated. The error must be reported by some means other than a CONTRL message.

The CONTRL functional ACK includes the following data elements:

| Element | Name | Usage |
|---------|------|-------|
| UNH1 | Message reference number | - |

| UCI8 | - | - |
| UCF1 | Group Reference Number | This element is mandatory and is mapped from the UNG5 field in the received message. |
| UCF2 | Application Sender's Identification | This element is conditionally optional and is mapped from the UNG2 field in the received message along with subcomponents. |
| UCF3 | Application Recipient's Identification | This element is conditionally optional and is mapped from the UNG3 field in the received message along with subcomponents. |
| UCF4 | Action Coded | This element is mandatory, and the code applies to this level and all lower levels. Action codes: <p><p>- 7, if the interchange is accepted. <br>- 4, if the interchange is rejected due to an error in the UNA or UNB segment. |

| UCM1 | Message Reference Number| This element is mandatory and is mapped from the UNH1 field in the received message. |
| UCM2 | Message Identifier | This element is conditionally optional and is mapped from the UNH2 field in the received message along with subcomponents. |
| UCM3 | Action Coded | This element is mandatory, and the code applies to this level and all lower levels. Action codes: <p><p>- 7, if the interchange is accepted. <br>- 4, if the interchange is rejected due to an error in the UNA or UNB segment. |
| UCM4 | Syntax Error, Coded | This element is conditionally optional and identifies the error condition in the group, if any. |
| UCM5 | Service Segment Tag | This element is conditionally optional and identifies the UNH or UNT segment in error. |
| UCM7 | Data element identification | Identifies the data elements that have the error condition identified in the UCM5 data element. Subcomponents: <p><p>- Mandatory: Position of erroneous data element in segment, and occurrence of erroneous data element in segment. <br>- Conditionally optional: Position of erroneous component data element in segment. |
| UCS1 | Segment position in message body | This element is mandatory and is the position count of the erroneous segment, starting with UNH as `1`. To report that a segment is missing, this value is the numerical count position of the last segment that was processed prior to the position for where the missing segment is expected to exist. A missing segment group is denoted by identifying the first segment in the group as missing. |
| UCS2 | Syntax Error Coded | This element is conditionally optional and identifies the error condition in the group, if any. |
| UCD1 | Syntax Error Coded| This element is conditionally optional and identifies the error condition in the group, if any. <p><p>**Note**: If an XSD validation failure occurs, the UCD1 data element reports a code value of `12, Invalid Value`. |
| UCD2 | Data element identification | Identifies the data elements that have the error condition identified in the UCD1 data element. Subcomponents: <p><p>- Mandatory: Position of erroneous data element in segment, and occurrence of erroneous data element in segment. <br>- Conditionally optional: Position of erroneous component data element in segment. |
| UNT1 | Count of segments | - |
| UNT2 | Message reference number | - |

## CONTRL ACK error codes

These errors apply at the interchange, group, message, and data level. When a supported error is found, the entire interchange, group, or transaction set is rejected. EDIFACT-encoded interchanges don't have an `Accepted with errors` condition as X12-encoded messages do.

### Standard EDIFACT CONTRL ACK error codes
