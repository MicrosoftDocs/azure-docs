# Exchange AS2 messages in B2B workflows using Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

To send and receive AS2 messages in workflows that you create using Azure Logic Apps, use the *AS2 (v2)* connector. This connector provides actions that support and manage AS2 communication. If you need tracking capabilities, the original *AS2* connector is still available, but is being deprecated.

Except for tracking capabilities, the AS2 (v2) connector provides the same capabilities as the original AS2 connector. The AS2 (v2) connector runs natively with the Azure Logic Apps runtime and offers significant performance improvements in message size, throughput, and latency. Unlike the original AS2 connector, the AS2 (v2) connector doesn't require that you create a connection to your integration account. Instead, as described in the prerequisites, link your integration account to the logic app resource where you plan to use the connector.

This guide shows how to add the encoding and decoding actions for AS2 (v2) and AS2 to an existing logic app workflow. The AS2 (v2) connector doesn't provide any triggers, so you can use any trigger to start your workflow. The examples in this guide use the [Request trigger](../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md).

## Connector technical reference

The AS2 connector has different versions, based on [logic app type and host environment](logic-apps-overview.md#resource-environment-differences).

| Logic app | Environment | Connector version |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Consumption** | Multitenant Azure Logic Apps | AS2 (v2) and AS2 managed connectors, which appear in the connector gallery under **Shared**. The AS2 connector has one trigger and multiple actions. The AS2 (v2) connector provides only actions. You can use any trigger that works for your scenario. For more information, see: <br><br>- [AS2 managed connector reference](/connectors/as2/) <br>- [AS2 (v2) managed connector operations](#as2-v2-operations) <br>- [AS2 message limits](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#b2b-protocol-limits) |
| **Standard** | Single-tenant Azure Logic Apps, App Service Environment v3 (Windows plans only), and hybrid deployment | AS2 (v2) built-in connector, which appears in the connector gallery under **Built-in**, and AS2 managed connector, which appears in the connector gallery under **Shared**. The AS2 connector has one trigger and multiple actions. The AS2 (v2) connector provides only actions. You can use any trigger that works for your scenario. <br><br>The built-in version differs in the following ways: <br><br>- The built-in version can directly access Azure virtual networks. You don't need an on-premises data gateway.<br><br>For more information, see: <br><br>- [AS2 managed connector reference](/connectors/as2/) <br>- [AS2 (v2) built-in connector operations](#as2-v2-operations) <br>- [AS2 message limits](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#b2b-protocol-limits) |

### AS2 (v2) operations

The AS2 (v2) connector has no triggers. The following table describes the actions that the AS2 (v2) connector provides for establishing security and reliability when transmitting messages:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [AS2 Encode action](#encode) | Provides encryption, digital signing, and acknowledgments through Message Disposition Notifications (MDN), which help support nonrepudiation. For example, this action applies AS2/HTTP headers and performs the following tasks when configured: <br><br>- Sign outgoing messages. <br>- Encrypt outgoing messages. <br>- Compress the message. <br>- Transmit the file name in the MIME header. |
| [AS2 Decode action](#decode) | Provides decryption, digital signing, and acknowledgments through Message Disposition Notifications (MDN). For example, this action performs the following tasks when configured: <br><br>- Process AS2/HTTP headers. <br>- Reconcile received MDNs with the original outbound messages. <br>- Update and correlate records in the nonrepudiation database. <br>- Write records for AS2 status reporting. <br>- Output payload contents as base64-encoded.  <br>-  Determine whether MDNs are required. Based on the AS2 agreement, determine whether MDNs should be synchronous or asynchronous. <br>- Generate synchronous or asynchronous MDNs based on the AS2 agreement. <br>- Set the correlation tokens and properties on MDNs. <br>- Verify the signature. <br>- Decrypt the messages. <br>- Decompress the message. <br>- Check and disallow message ID duplicates. |

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription yet, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

- The logic app resource and workflow where you want to use the AS2 operations.

- An [integration account resource](./enterprise-integration/create-integration-account.md) to define and store artifacts for use in enterprise integration and B2B workflows.

  - Both your integration account and logic app resource must exist in the same Azure subscription and Azure region.

  - Defines at least two [trading partners](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-partners.md) that participate in the AS2 operation used in your workflow. The definitions for both partners must use the same *business identity* qualifier, which is **AS2Identity** for this scenario.

  - Defines an [AS2 agreement](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-agreements.md) between the trading partners that participate in your workflow. Each agreement requires a host partner and a guest partner. The content in the messages between you and the other partner must match the agreement type. For information about agreement settings to use when receiving and sending messages, see [AS2 message settings](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-as2-message-settings.md).

- Before you start working with AS2 (v2) or AS2 operations, you must [link your Consumption logic app](enterprise-integration/create-integration-account.md?tabs=consumption#link-account) or [link your Standard logic app](enterprise-integration/create-integration-account.md?tabs=standard#link-account) to an integration account. When you add an AS2 (v2) or AS2 operation, you might also have to create a connection to the integration account:

  | Logic app workflow | Link required? |
  |--------------------|----------------|
  | Consumption | - AS2 (v2) connector: No connection required <br>- AS2 connector: Connection required |
  | Standard | - AS2 (v2) connector: No connection required <br>- AS2 connector: Connection required |

- If you use [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview) for certificate management, check that your vault keys permit the **Encrypt** and **Decrypt** operations. Otherwise, the encoding and decoding actions fail.

  1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your key vault resource. On the resource sidebar, under **Objects**, select **Keys**.

  1. On the **Keys** page, select your key. On the **Versions** page, select the key version that you're using.

  1. On the **Key Version** page, under **Permitted operations**, confirm that **Encrypt** and **Decrypt** are selected.

## Sample

To deploy a fully functioning logic app workflow and sample AS2 (v2) scenario, see the [AS2 (v2) logic app template and scenario](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/logic-app-as2-send-receive/).

## Troubleshoot problems

- Problems when sending signed or encrypted messages

  Consider trying different SHA256 algorithm formats. The AS2 specification doesn't provide any information about SHA256 formats, so each provider uses their own implementation or format.
