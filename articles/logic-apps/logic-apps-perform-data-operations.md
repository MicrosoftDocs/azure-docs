# Perform data operations in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

This how-to guide shows how you can work with data in your logic app workflow in the following ways:

* Create a string or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object from multiple inputs that have different data types. You can then use this string as a single input, rather than repeatedly entering the same inputs.
* Create user-friendly tokens from JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object properties so that you can easily use those properties in your workflow.
* Create an HTML or CSV table from an array.
* Create an array from another array based on a specified filter or condition.
* Create an array based on the specified properties for all the items in another array.
* Create a string from all the items in an array and separate those items using a specified character.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* The logic app workflow where you want to perform the data operation. Both Consumption and Standard logic app workflows support the data operations described in this guide.

  All data operations are available only as actions. So, before you can use these actions, your workflow must already start with a [trigger](logic-apps-overview.md#logic-app-concepts) as the first step and include any other actions required to create the outputs that you want to use in the data operation.

## Data operation actions

The following sections summarize the data operations you can use and are organized based on the source data types that the operations work on, but each description appears alphabetically.

### JSON actions

The following actions help you work with data in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [**Compose**](#compose-action) | Create a message, or string, from multiple inputs that can have various data types. You can then use this string as a single input, rather than repeatedly entering the same inputs. For example, you can create a single JSON message from various inputs. |
| [**Parse JSON**](#parse-json-action) | Create user-friendly data tokens for properties in JSON content so that you can more easily use the properties in your logic apps. |

To create more complex JSON transformations, see [Perform advanced JSON transformations with Liquid templates](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-liquid-transform.md).

### Array actions

The following actions help you work with data in arrays.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [**Create CSV table**](#create-csv-table-action) | Create a comma-separated value (CSV) table from an array. |
| [**Create HTML table**](#create-html-table-action) | Create an HTML table from an array. |
| [**Filter array**](#filter-array-action) | Create an array subset from an array based on the specified filter or condition. |
| [**Join**](#join-action) | Create a string from all the items in an array and separate each item with the specified character. |
| [**Select**](#select-action) | Create an array from the specified properties for all the items in a different array. |

<a name="compose-action"></a>

## Compose action

To construct a single output such as a JSON object from multiple inputs, use the action named **Compose**. Your inputs can have various types such as integers, Booleans, arrays, JSON objects, and any other native type that Azure Logic Apps supports, for example, binary and XML. You can then use the output in actions that follow after the **Compose** action. The **Compose** action also helps you avoid repeatedly entering the same inputs while you build your logic app's workflow.

For example, you can construct a JSON message from multiple variables, such as string variables that store people's first names and last names, and an integer variable that stores people's ages. In this example, the **Compose** action accepts the following inputs:

`{ "age": <ageVar>, "fullName": "<lastNameVar>, <firstNameVar>" }`

And creates the following output:

`{"age":35,"fullName":"Owens,Sophia"}`

To try the **Compose** action, follow these steps by using the workflow designer. Or, if you prefer working in the code view editor, you can copy the example **Compose** and **Initialize variable** action definitions from this guide into your own logic app's underlying workflow definition: [Data operation code examples - Compose](logic-apps-data-operations-code-samples.md#compose-action-example). For more information about the **Compose** action in the underlying JSON workflow definition, see the [Compose action](logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#compose-action).

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or Visual Studio Code, open your logic app workflow in the designer.

   This example uses the Azure portal and a sample workflow with the **Recurrence** trigger followed by several **Variables** actions named **Initialize variable**. These actions are set up to create two string variables and an integer variable.

   | Operation | Properties and values |
   |-----------|-----------------------|
   | **Initialize variable** | - **Name**: firstNameVar <br>- **Type**: String <br>- **Value**: Sophia |
   | **Initialize variable** | - **Name**: lastNameVar <br>- **Type**: String <br>- **Value**: Owens |
   | **Initialize variable** | - **Name**: ageVar <br>- **Type**: Integer <br>- **Value**: 35 |

1. [Follow these general steps to add the **Data Operations** action named **Compose**](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

1. On the designer, select the **Compose** action, if not already selected. In the **Inputs** box, enter the inputs to use for creating the output.

   For this example, follow these steps:

   1. In the **Inputs** box, enter the following sample JSON object, including the spacing as shown:

      ```json
      {
          "age": ,
          "fullName": " , "
      }
      ```

   1. In the JSON object, put your cursor in the corresponding locations, select the dynamic content list (lightning icon), and then select the corresponding variable from the list:

      | JSON property | Variable |
      |---------------|----------|
      | **`age`** | **ageVar** |
      | **`fullName`** | "**lastNameVar**, **firstNameVar**" |

      The following example shows both added and not yet added variables:

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or Visual Studio Code, open your logic app workflow in the designer.

   This example uses the Azure portal and a sample workflow with the **Recurrence** trigger followed by several **Variables** actions named **Initialize variable**. These actions are set up to create two string variables and an integer variable.

   | Operation | Properties and values |
   |-----------|-----------------------|
   | **Initialize variable** | - **Name**: firstNameVar <br>- **Type**: String <br>- **Value**: Sophia |
   | **Initialize variable** | - **Name**: lastNameVar <br>- **Type**: String <br>- **Value**: Owens |
   | **Initialize variable** | - **Name**: ageVar <br>- **Type**: Integer <br>- **Value**: 35 |

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/sample-start-compose-action-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Azure portal, Standard workflow designer, and example workflow for Compose action." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/sample-start-compose-action-standard.png":::

1. [Follow these general steps to add the **Data Operations** action named **Compose**](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=standard#add-action).

1. On the designer, select the **Compose** action, if not already selected. In the **Inputs** box, enter the inputs to use for creating the output.

   For this example, follow these steps:

   1. In the **Inputs** box, enter the following sample JSON object, including the spacing as shown:

      ```json
      {
          "age": ,
          "fullName": " , "
      }
      ```

   1. In the JSON object, put your cursor in the corresponding locations, select the dynamic content list (lightning icon), and then select the corresponding variable from the list:

      | JSON property | Variable |
      |---------------|----------|
      | **`age`** | **ageVar** |
      | **`fullName`** | "**lastNameVar**, **firstNameVar**" |

      The following example shows both added and not yet added variables:

      :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/configure-compose-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow, Compose action, dynamic content list, and selected inputs to use." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/configure-compose-action.png":::

      The following example shows the finished sample **Compose** action: 

      :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/finished-compose-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow and finished example Compose action." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/finished-compose-action.png":::

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

---

### Test your workflow

To confirm whether the **Compose** action creates the expected results, send yourself a notification that includes output from the **Compose** action.

1. In your workflow, add an action that can send you the results from the **Compose** action.

   This example continues by using the Office 365 Outlook action named **Send an email**.

1. In this action, for each box where you want the results to appear, select inside each box, and then select the dynamic content list. From that list, under the **Compose** action, select **Outputs**.

   For this example, the result appears in the email's body, so add the **Outputs** field to the **Body** box.

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/send-email-compose-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows workflow designer, the action named Send an email, and output from the preceding Compose action." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/send-email-compose-action.png":::

1. Save your workflow, and then manually run your workflow.

   - Consumption workflow: On the designer toolbar, select **Run** > **Run**.
   - Standard workflow: On the workflow navigation menu, select **Overview**. On the **Overview** page toolbar, select **Run** > **Run**.

If you used the Office 365 Outlook action, the following example shows the result:

:::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/compose-email-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows email with results from the Compose action.":::

<a name="create-csv-table-action"></a>

## Create CSV table action

To create a comma-separated value (CSV) table that has the properties and values from JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) objects in an array, use the action named **Create CSV table**. You can then use the resulting table in actions that follow the **Create CSV table** action.

To try the  **Create CSV table** action, follow these steps by using the workflow designer. Or, if you prefer working in the code view editor, you can copy the example **Create CSV table** and **Initialize variable** action definitions from this guide into your own logic app's underlying workflow definition: [Data operation code examples - Create CSV table](logic-apps-data-operations-code-samples.md#create-csv-table-action-example). For more information about the **Create CSV table** action in the underlying JSON workflow definition, see the [Table action](logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#table-action).

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or Visual Studio Code, open your logic app workflow in the designer.

   This example uses the Azure portal and a sample workflow with the **Recurrence** trigger followed by an **Initialize variable** action. The action is set up to create a variable where the initial value is an array that has some properties and values in JSON format.

   | Operation | Properties and values |
   |-----------|-----------------------|
   | **Initialize variable** | - **Name**: myJSONArray <br>- **Type**: Array <br>- **Value**: `[ { "Description": "Apples", "Product_ID": 1 }, { "Description": "Oranges", "Product_ID": 2 }]` |

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/sample-start-create-table-action-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow designer, and example workflow for action named Create CSV table." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/sample-start-create-table-action-consumption.png":::

1. [Follow these general steps to add the **Data Operations** action named **Create CSV table**](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

1. On the designer, select the **Create CSV table** action, if not already selected. In the **From** box, enter the array or expression to use for creating the table.

   For this example, select inside the **From** box, and select the dynamic content list (lightning icon). From that list, select the **myJSONArray** variable:

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/configure-create-csv-table-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow, action named Create CSV table, and the selected input to use." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/configure-create-csv-table-action.png":::

   > [!TIP]

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

---

### Customize table format

By default, the **Columns** property is set to automatically create the table columns based on the array items. To specify custom headers and values, follow these steps:

1. If the **Columns** property doesn't appear in the action information box, from the **Advanced parameters** list, select **Columns**.

1. Open the **Columns** list, and select **Custom**.

1. In the **Header** property, specify the custom header text to use instead.

1. In the **Value** property, specify the custom value to use instead.

To return values from the array, you can use the [**`item()`** function](workflow-definition-language-functions-reference.md#item) with the **Create CSV table** action. In a **`For_each`** loop, you can use the [**`items()`** function](workflow-definition-language-functions-reference.md#items).

For example, suppose you want table columns that have only the property values and not the property names from an array. To return only these values, follow these steps for working in designer view or in code view.

This example returns the following result:

```text
Apples,1
Oranges,2
```

#### Work in designer view

In the **Create CSV table** action, keep the **Header** column empty. On each row in the **Value** column, dereference each array property that you want. Each row under **Value** returns all the values for the specified array property and becomes a column in your table.

1. For each array property that you want, in the **Value** column, select inside the edit box, and then select the function icon, which opens the expression editor. Make sure that the **Function** list appears selected.

1. In the expression editor, enter the following expression, but replace `<array-property-name>` with the array property name for the value that you want. When you're done with each expression, select **Add**.

   Syntax: `item()?['<array-property-name>']`

   Examples:

   * `item()?['Description']`
   * `item()?['Product_ID']`

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/csv-table-expression.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows workflow designer, action named Create CSV table, and how to dereference array property named Description." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/csv-table-expression.png":::

   For more information, see [**item()** function](workflow-definition-language-functions-reference.md#item).

1. Repeat the preceding steps for each array property. When you're done, your action looks similar to the following example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/finished-csv-expression.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows action named Create CSV table and function named item()." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/finished-csv-expression.png":::

#### Work in code view

In the action's JSON definition, within the `columns` array, set the `header` property to an empty string. For each `value` property, dereference each array property that you want.

1. From the designer, switch to code view.

   * **Consumption**: On the designer toolbar, select **Code view**.
   * **Standard**: On the workflow navigation menu, under **Developer**, select **Code**.

1. In the code editor, find the action's `columns` array. For each column of array values that you want, add an empty `header` property and the following expression for the `value` property:

   Syntax:

   ```json
   {
      "header": "",
      "value": "@item()?['<array-property-name>']"
   }
   ```

   Example:

   ```json
   "Create_CSV_table": {
      "inputs": {
         "columns": [
            { 
               "header": "",
               "value": "@item()?['Description']"
            },
            { 
               "header": "",
               "value": "@item()?['Product_ID']"
            }
         ],
         "format": "CSV",
         "from": "@variables('myJSONArray')"
      }
   }
   ```

1. Switch back to designer view to review the results.

### Test your workflow

To confirm whether the **Create CSV table** action creates the expected results, send yourself a notification that includes output from the **Create CSV table** action.

1. In your workflow, add an action that can send you the results from the **Create CSV table** action.

   This example continues by using the Office 365 Outlook action named **Send an email**.

1. In this action, for each box where you want the results to appear, select inside each box, which opens the dynamic content list. From that list, under the **Create CSV table** action, select **Output**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/send-email-create-csv-table-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows workflow with action named Send an email. The Body property contains the field named Output from preceding action named Create CSV table." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/send-email-create-csv-table-action.png":::

1. Save your workflow, and then manually run your workflow.

   - Consumption workflow: On the designer toolbar, select **Run** > **Run**.
   - Standard workflow: On the workflow navigation menu, select **Overview**. On the **Overview** page toolbar, select **Run** > **Run**.

If you used the Office 365 Outlook action, the following example shows the result:

:::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/create-csv-table-email-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows email with results from action named Create CSV table." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/create-csv-table-email-results.png":::

> [!NOTE]
>
> If your table is returned with incorrect formatting, see [how to check your table data formatting](#format-table-data).

<a name="create-html-table-action"></a>

## Create HTML table action

To create an HTML table that has the properties and values from JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) objects in an array, use the **Create HTML table** action. You can then use the resulting table in actions that follow the **Create HTML table** action.

To try the **Create HTML table** action, follow these steps by using the workflow designer. Or, if you prefer working in the code view editor, you can copy the example **Create HTML table** and **Initialize variable** action definitions from this guide into your own logic app's underlying workflow definition: [Data operation code examples - Create HTML table](logic-apps-data-operations-code-samples.md#create-html-table-action-example). For more information about the **Create HTML table** action in the underlying JSON workflow definition, see the [Table action](logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#table-action).

1. In the **Value** property, specify the custom value to use instead.

To return values from the array, you can use the [`item()` function](workflow-definition-language-functions-reference.md#item) with the **Create HTML table** action. In a `For_each` loop, you can use the [`items()` function](workflow-definition-language-functions-reference.md#items).

For example, suppose you want table columns that have only the property values and not the property names from an array. To return only these values, follow these steps for working in designer view or in code view.

This example returns the following result:

```text
Apples,1
Oranges,2
```

#### Work in designer view

In the **Create HTML table** action, keep the **Header** column empty. On each row in the **Value** column, dereference each array property that you want. Each row under **Value** returns all the values for the specified array property and becomes a column in your table.

1. For each array property that you want, in the **Value** column, select inside the edit box, and then select the function icon, which opens the expression editor. Make sure that the **Function** list appears selected.

1. In the expression editor, enter the following expression, but replace `<array-property-name>` with the array property name for the value that you want. When you're done with each expression, select **Add**.

   Syntax: `item()?['<array-property-name>']`

   Examples:

   * `item()?['Description']`
   * `item()?['Product_ID']`

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/html-table-expression.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows workflow designer, action named Create HTML table, and how to dereference array property named Description." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/html-table-expression.png":::

   For more information, see [**item()** function](workflow-definition-language-functions-reference.md#item).

1. Repeat the preceding steps for each array property. When you're done, your action looks similar to the following example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/finished-html-expression.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows action named Create HTML table and function named item()." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/finished-html-expression.png":::

#### Work in code view

In the action's JSON definition, within the `columns` array, set the `header` property to an empty string. For each `value` property, dereference each array property that you want.

1. From the designer, switch to code view.

   * **Consumption**: On the designer toolbar, select **Code view**.
   * **Standard**: On the workflow navigation menu, under **Developer**, select **Code**.

1. In the code editor, find the action's `columns` array. For each column of array values that you want, add an empty `header` property and the following expression for the `value` property:

   Syntax:

   ```json
   {
      "header": "",
      "value": "@item()?['<array-property-name>']"
   }
   ```

   Example:

   ```json
   "Create_HTML_table": {
      "inputs": {
         "columns": [
            { 
               "header": "",
               "value": "@item()?['Description']"
            },
            { 
               "header": "",
               "value": "@item()?['Product_ID']"
            }
         ],
         "format": "HTML",
         "from": "@variables('myJSONArray')"
      }
   }
   ```

1. Switch back to designer view to review the results.

### Test your workflow

To confirm whether the **Create HTML table** action creates the expected results, send yourself a notification that includes output from the **Create HTML table** action.

1. In your workflow, add an action that can send you the results from the **Create HTML table** action.

   This example continues by using the Office 365 Outlook action named **Send an email**.

1. In this action, for each box where you want the results to appear, select inside each box, and then select the lightning icon, which opens the dynamic content list. From that list, under the **Create HTML table** action, select **Output**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/send-email-create-html-table-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows workflow with action named Send an email. The Body property contains the Output field from preceding action named Create HTML table." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/send-email-create-html-table-action.png":::

1. Save your workflow, and then manually run your workflow.

   - Consumption workflow: On the designer toolbar, select **Run** > **Run**.
   - Standard workflow: On the workflow navigation menu, select **Overview**. On the **Overview** page toolbar, select **Run** > **Run**.

If you used the Office 365 Outlook action, the following example shows the result:

:::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/create-html-table-email-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows email with results from action named Create HTML table." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/create-html-table-email-results.png":::

<a name="filter-array-action"></a>

## Filter array action

To create a subset array from an existing array where the subset items meet specific criteria, use the **Filter array** action. You can then use resulting filtered array in actions that follow the **Filter array** action.

To try the **Filter array** action, follow these steps by using the workflow designer. Or, if you prefer working in the code view editor, you can copy the example **Filter array** and **Initialize variable** action definitions from this guide into your own logic app's underlying workflow definition: [Data operation code examples - Filter array](logic-apps-data-operations-code-samples.md#filter-array-action-example). For more information about the **Filter array** action in the underlying JSON workflow definition, see the [Query action](logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#query-action).

> [!NOTE]
>
> Any filter text that you use in your condition is case sensitive. Also, this action 
> can't change the format or components of items in the array.
>
> For actions to use the array output from the **Filter array** action, either those 
> actions must accept arrays as input, or you might have to transform the output array 
> into another compatible format.
>
> If you call an HTTP endpoint and receive a JSON response, use the 
> [**Parse JSON** action](#parse-json-action) to process the JSON response. 
> Otherwise, the **Filter array** action can read only the response body 
> and not the structure of the JSON payload.

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or Visual Studio Code, open your logic app workflow in the designer.

   This example uses the Azure portal and a sample workflow with the **Recurrence** trigger followed by an **Initialize variable** action. The action is set up to create where the initial value is an array that has some sample integer values.

   | Operation | Properties and values |
   |-----------|-----------------------|
   | **Initialize variable** | - **Name**: myIntegerArray <br>- **Type**: Array <br>- **Value**: `[1,2,3,4]` |

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Although this example uses a simple integer array, this action is especially useful for JSON 
   > object arrays where you can filter based on the objects' properties and values.

1. [Follow these general steps to find the **Data Operations** action named **Filter array**](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

1. On the designer, select the **Filter array** action, if not already selected. In the **From** box, enter the array or expression to use as the filter.

   For this example, select inside the **From** box, and then select the lightning icon, which opens the dynamic content list. From that list, select the previously created variable:

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/configure-filter-array-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow, action named Filter array, and selected input to use." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/configure-filter-array-action.png":::

1. For the condition, specify the array items to compare, select the comparison operator, and specify the comparison value.

   This example uses the [**item()** function](workflow-definition-language-functions-reference.md#item) to access each item in the array, while the **Filter array** action searches for array items where the value is greater than one. The following screenshot shows the finished example **Filter array** action:

<a name="join-action"></a>

## Join action

To create a string that has all the items from an array and separate those items with a specific delimiter character, use the **Join** action. You can then use the string in actions that follow the **Join** action.

To try the **Join** action, follow these steps by using the workflow designer. Or, if you prefer working in the code view editor, you can copy the example **Join** and **Initialize variable** action definitions from this guide into your own logic app's underlying workflow definition: [Data operation code examples - Join](logic-apps-data-operations-code-samples.md#join-action-example). For more information about the **Join** action in your underlying workflow definition, see the [Join action](logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#join-action).

## Parse JSON action

To reference or access properties in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) content, you can create user-friendly fields or tokens for those properties by using the **Parse JSON** action. That way, you can select those properties from the dynamic content list when you specify inputs for subsequent actions in your workflow. For this action, you can either provide a JSON schema or generate a JSON schema from your sample JSON content or payload.

To try the **Parse JSON** action, follow these steps by using the workflow designer. Or, if you prefer working in the code view editor, you can copy the example **Parse JSON** and **Initialize variable** action definitions from this guide into your own logic app's underlying workflow definition: [Data operation code examples - Parse JSON](logic-apps-data-operations-code-samples.md#parse-json-action-example). 
For more information about this action in your underlying workflow definition, see [Parse JSON action](logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md).

           }
       }
   }
   ```

   If you don't have a schema, you can generate the schema from the JSON object:

   1. In the **Parse JSON** action, under the **Schema** box, select **Use sample payload to generate schema**.

   1. In the **Enter or paste a sample JSON payload** box, enter the JSON content or object, and then select **Done**, for example:

      ```json
      {
          "Member": {
             "Email": "Sophia.Owens@fabrikam.com",
             "FirstName": "Sophia",
             "LastName": "Owens"
          }
      }
      ```

      :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/generate-schema-parse-json-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow, action named Parse JSON, and box named Enter or paste a sample JSON payload, which contains JSON sample to generate the schema." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/generate-schema-parse-json-action.png":::

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

---

### Test your workflow

To confirm whether the **Parse JSON** action creates the expected results, send yourself a notification that includes output from the **Parse JSON** action.

1. In your workflow, add an action that can send you the results from the **Parse JSON** action.

   This example continues by using the Office 365 Outlook action named **Send an email**.

1. In this action, for each box where you want the results to appear, select inside each edit box, and then select the lightning icon, which opens the dynamic content list. From that list, under the **Parse JSON** action, select the properties from the parsed JSON object.

   This example selects the following properties: **Body FirstName**, **Body LastName**, and **Body Email**

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/send-email-parse-json-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow with JSON properties in the action named Send an email." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/send-email-parse-json-action.png":::

   When you're done, the **Send an email** action looks similar to the following example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/send-email-parse-json-action-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows workflow with finished action named Send an email for action named Parse JSON." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/send-email-parse-json-action-complete.png":::

1. Save your workflow, and then manually run your workflow.

   - Consumption workflow: On the designer toolbar, select **Run** > **Run**.
   - Standard workflow: On the workflow navigation menu, select **Overview**. On the **Overview** page toolbar, select **Run** > **Run**.

If you used the Office 365 Outlook action, the following example shows the result:

:::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/parse-json-email-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows email with results from action named Parse JSON." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/parse-json-email-results.png":::

<a name="select-action"></a>

## Select action

By default, the **Select** action creates an array that contains JSON objects built from the values in an existing array. For example, you can create a JSON object for each value in an integer array by specifying the properties that each JSON object must have and mapping the values from the source array to those properties. Although you can change the component JSON objects, the output array always has the same number of items as the source array. To use the output array from the **Select** action, subsequent actions must either accept arrays as input, or you might have to transform the output array into another compatible format.

To try the **Select** action, follow these steps by using the workflow designer. Or, if you prefer working in the code view editor, you can copy the example **Select** and **Initialize variable** action definitions from this guide into your own logic app's underlying workflow definition: [Data operation code examples - Select](logic-apps-data-operations-code-samples.md#select-action-example). For more information about this action in your underlying workflow definition, see [Select action](logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#select-action).

> [!TIP]

> For an example that creates create an array with strings or integers built from the values in a JSON object array, 
> see the **Select** and **Initialize variable** action definitions in 
> [Data operation code examples - Select](logic-apps-data-operations-code-samples.md#select-action-example).

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or Visual Studio Code, open your logic app workflow in the designer.

   This example uses the Azure portal and a sample workflow with the **Recurrence** trigger followed by an **Initialize variable** action. The action is set up for create a variable where the initial value is an array that has some sample integers.

   | Operation | Properties and values |
   |-----------|-----------------------|
   | **Initialize variable** | - **Name**: myIntegerArray <br>- **Type**: Array <br>- **Value**: `[1,2,3,4]` |

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/sample-start-select-action-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Azure portal, Consumption workflow designer, and example workflow for the action named Select." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/sample-start-select-action-consumption.png":::

1. [Follow these general steps to find the **Data Operations** action named **Select**](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

1. On the designer, select the **Select** action, if not already selected. In the **From** box, enter the source array that you want to use.

   For this example, select inside the **From** box, and then select the lightning icon, which opens the dynamic content list. From that list, select the previously created variable:

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/configure-select-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow, action named Select, and the selected source array variable to use." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/configure-select-action.png":::

1. For the **Map** property, in the left column, enter a property name to describe all the values in the source array.

   This example uses **Product_ID** as the property name for the integer values in the source array. So, each value, for example, **1**, **2**, **3**, and **4**, is a product ID.

1. In the right column, enter an expression that specifies the value in the source array for the property name in the left column.

   This example uses the [**item()** function](workflow-definition-language-functions-reference.md#item) to iterate through and access each item in the array.

   1. Select inside the right column, and then select the function icon, which opens the expression editor. Make sure that the **Function** list appears selected.

   1. In the expression editor, enter the function named **item()**, and then select **Add**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/configure-select-action-expression.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow, the action named Select, and the JSON object property and values to create the JSON object array." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/configure-select-action-expression.png":::

   The **Select** action now appears similar to the following example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/finished-select-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Consumption workflow and the finished example action named Select." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/finished-select-action.png":::

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or Visual Studio Code, open your logic app workflow in the designer.

   This example uses the Azure portal and a sample workflow with the **Recurrence** trigger followed by an **Initialize variable** action. The action is set up for create a variable where the initial value is an array that has some sample integers.

   | Operation | Properties and values |
   |-----------|-----------------------|
   | **Initialize variable** | - **Name**: myIntegerArray <br>- **Type**: Array <br>- **Value**: `[1,2,3,4]` |

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/sample-start-select-action-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Azure portal, Standard workflow designer, and example workflow for the action named Select." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/sample-start-select-action-standard.png":::

1. [Follow these general steps to find the **Data Operations** action named **Select**](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=standard#add-action).

1. On the designer, select the **Select** action, if not already selected. In the **From** box, enter the source array that you want to use.

   For this example, select inside the **From** box, and then select the lightning icon, which opens the dynamic content list. From that list, select the previously created variable:

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/configure-select-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Standard workflow, action named Select, and the selected source array variable to use." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/configure-select-action.png":::

1. For the **Map** property, in the left column, enter a property name to describe all the values in the source array.

   This example uses **Product_ID** as the property name for the integer values in the source array. So, each value, for example, **1**, **2**, **3**, and **4**, is a product ID.

1. In the right column, enter an expression that specifies the value in the source array for the property name in the left column.

   This example uses the [`item()` function](workflow-definition-language-functions-reference.md#item) to iterate through and access each item in the array.

   1. Select inside the right column, and then select the function icon, which opens the expression editor. Make sure that the **Function** list appears selected.

   1. In the expression editor, enter the function named **item()**, and then select **Add**.

### Test your workflow

To confirm whether the **Select** action creates the expected results, send yourself a notification that includes output from the **Select** action.

1. In your workflow, add an action that can send you the results from the **Select** action.

1. In this action, complete the following steps:

   1. For each box where you want the results to appear, select inside each box, and then select the function icon, which opens the expression editor. Make sure that the **Function** list appears selected.

   1. To get the array output from the **Select** action, enter the following expression, which uses the [**body()** function](workflow-definition-language-functions-reference.md#body) with the **Select** action name, and select **Add**:

      `body('Select')`

      :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/send-email-select-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows workflow with action named Send an email, and action outputs from the Select action.":::

      The resolved expression specifies to show the outputs from the **Select** action in the email body when sent:

      :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/send-email-select-action-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows workflow and finished action named Send an email for the Select action." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/send-email-select-action-complete.png":::

1. Save your workflow, and then manually run your workflow.

   - Consumption workflow: On the designer toolbar, select **Run** > **Run**.
   - Standard workflow: On the workflow navigation menu, select **Overview**. On the **Overview** page toolbar, select **Run** > **Run**.

If you used the Office 365 Outlook action, the following example shows the result:

:::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/select-email-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows email with results from the Select action." lightbox="media/logic-apps-perform-data-operations/select-email-results.png":::

## Troubleshooting

### Format table data

If your [CSV table](#create-csv-table-action) or [HTML table](#create-html-table-action) is returned with incorrect formatting, make sure your input data has line breaks between rows. 

Incorrect formatting:

```text
Fruit,Number Apples,1 Oranges,2
```

Correct formatting:

```text
Fruit,Number
Apples,1
Oranges,2
```

To add line breaks between rows, add one of the following expressions to your table:

```text
replace(body('Create_CSV_table'),'','<br/>')
```

```text
replace(body('Create_HTML_table'),'','<br/>')
```

For example: 

```json
{
	"Send_an_email_": {
		"inputs": {
			"body": {
				"Body": "<p>Results from Create CSV table action:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n@{replace(body('Create_CSV_table'),'\r\n','<br/>')}</p>",
				"Subject": "Create CSV table results",
				"To": "sophia.owen@fabrikam.com"
			}
		}
	}
}
```
