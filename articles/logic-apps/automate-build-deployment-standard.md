# Automate build and deployment for Standard logic app workflows with Azure DevOps

For Standard logic app workflows that run in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps, you can use Visual Studio Code with the Azure Logic Apps (Standard) extension to locally develop, test, and store your logic app project using any source control system. However, to get the full benefits of easily and consistently deploying your workflows across different environments and platforms, you must also automate your build and deployment process.

The Azure Logic Apps (Standard) extension provides tools for you to create and maintain automated build and deployment processes using Azure DevOps. However, before you start this automation, consider the following elements:

- The Azure logic app resource where you create your workflows

- The Azure-hosted connections that workflows use and are created from Microsoft-managed connectors.

  These connections differ from the connections that directly and natively run with the Azure Logic Apps runtime.

- The specific settings and parameters for the different environments where you want to deploy

The extension helps you complete the following required tasks to automate build and deployment:

- Parameterize connection references at design time. This task simplifies the process of updating references in different environments without breaking local development functionality.

- Generate scripts that automate deployment for your Standard logic app resource, including all dependent resources.

- Generate scripts that automate deployment for Azure-hosted connections.

- Prepare environment-specific parameters that you can inject into the Azure Logic Apps package during the build process without breaking local development functionality. 

- Generate pipelines on demand using Azure DevOps to support infrastructure deployment along with the build and release processes.

This guide shows how to complete the following tasks:

1. Create a logic app workspace and project in Visual Studio Code that includes the files that create pipelines for infrastructure deployment, continuous integration (CI), and continuous deployment (CD).

1. Create a connection between your workspace and Git repository in Azure DevOps.

1. Create pipelines in Azure DevOps.

For more information, see the following documentation:

- [What is Azure DevOps?](/azure/devops/user-guide/what-is-azure-devops)
- [What is Azure Pipelines?](/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines)

## Known issues and limitations

- This capability supports only Standard logic app projects. If your Visual Studio Code workspace contains both a Standard logic app project and a Functions custom code project, both have deployment scripts generated, but custom code projects are currently ignored. The capability to create build pipelines for custom code are on the roadmap.

- The extension creates pipelines for infrastructure deployment, continuous integration (CI), and continuous deployment (CD). However, you're responsible for connecting the pipelines to Azure DevOps and create the relevant triggers.

- Currently, the extension supports only Azure Resource Management templates (ARM templates) for infrastructure deployment scripts. Other templates are in planning.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- Visual Studio Code with the Azure Logic Apps (Standard) extension. To meet these requirements, see the prerequisites for [Create Standard workflows with Visual Studio Code](create-single-tenant-workflows-visual-studio-code.md#prerequisites).

- Azure Logic Apps (Standard) Build and Release tasks for Azure DevOps Tasks. You can find these tasks in the [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=azure%20logic%20apps&target=AzureDevOps&category=Azure%20Pipelines&visibilityQuery=all&sortBy=Relevance).

- An existing [Git repository in Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/repos/git/create-new-repo#create-a-repo-using-the-web-portal) where you can store your logic app project.

- An [Azure Resource Manager service connection with an existing service principal](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure#create-an-azure-resource-manager-service-connection-with-an-existing-service-principal).

- An existing [Azure resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal.md) where you want to deploy your logic app.

## Create a logic app workspace, project, and workflow

1. In Visual Studio Code, on the Activity bar, select the Azure icon.

1. In the **Azure** window, on the **Workspace** toolbar, open the **Azure Logic Apps** menu, and select **Create new logic app workspace**.

   1. Enter your logic app project name.

   1. Select the workflow template. Enter your workflow name.

   1. Select whether to open your workspace in the current Visual Studio Code window or a new window. 

      Visual Studio Code shows your new workspace and logic app project.

1. Follow these steps to open the workflow designer:

   1. In your logic app project, expand the folder with your workflow name.

   1. If not already open, open the **workflow.json** file, open the file's shortcut menu, and select **Open Designer**.

   1. When you're prompted to allow parameterizations for connections when your project loads, select **Yes**.

      This selection allows your project to use parameters in connection definitions so that you can automate build and deployment for different environments.

   1. Follow the prompts to select these items:

      - **Use connectors from Azure**

        > [!NOTE]
        >
        > If you skip this step, you can use only the [built-in connectors that are runtime-hosted](../connectors/built-in.md). 
        > To enable the Microsoft-managed, Azure-hosted connectors at a later time, follow these steps:
        >
        > 1. Open the shortcut menu for the **workflow.json** file, and select **Use Connectors from Azure**.
        >
        > 2. Select an existing Azure resource group that you want to use for your logic app.
        >
        > 3. Reload the workflow designer.

      - The existing Azure resource group that you want to use for your logic app

1. When you're done, reload the workflow designer. If prompted, sign in to Azure.

You can now edit the workflow in any way that you want and locally test your workflow along the way. To create and test a sample workflow, see [Create Standard workflows with Visual Studio Code](create-single-tenant-workflows-visual-studio-code.md).

## Generate deployment scripts

After you create and locally test your workflow, create your deployment scripts.

1. From the blank area under all your project files, open your project's shortcut menu, and select **Generate deployment scripts**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/automate-build-deployment-standard/generate-deployment-scripts.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Visual Studio Code, Explorer icon selected on left menu, logic app project, opened project window shortcut menu, and selected option for Generate deployment scripts." lightbox="media/automate-build-deployment-standard/generate-deployment-scripts.png":::

1. Follow the prompts to complete these steps:

   1. Select the existing Azure resource group to use for your logic app.

   1. Enter a unique name for your logic app resource.

   1. Enter a unique name for your storage account resource.

   1. Enter a unique name to use for your App Service Plan.

   1. Select the workspace folder where you want to generate the files.

      | Deployment folder location | Description |
      |----------------------------|-------------|
      | **New deployment folder** (Default) | Create a new folder in the current workspace. |
      | **Choose a different folder** | Select a different folder in the current workspace. |

   When you're done, Visual Studio Code creates a folder named **deployment/{*logic-app-name*}** at your workspace's root. This folder uses the same logic app name that you provided in these steps.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > The values of variables, app settings, and parameters in the following files are prepopulated 
   > based on the input that you provided in these steps. When you target a different environment, 
   > make sure that you update the values for the created parameters and variable files.
