With Azure Arc-enabled Logic Apps, you can develop and run single-tenant based logic apps anywhere that Kubernetes can run. For example, you can run your logic app workflows on Azure, Azure Kubernetes Service, on premises, and even other cloud providers. This offering provides a centralized single-pane-of-glass management platform through Azure Arc and the Azure portal for the following capabilities:

- Use Azure Logic Apps as your integration platform.
- Connect your workflows to all your services no matter where they're hosted.
- Run your integration solutions directly alongside your services.
- Create and edit workflows using Visual Studio Code.
- Deploy using your choice of pipelines for DevOps.
- Control your infrastructure and resources in Azure, non-Azure, multiple clouds, on premises, and edge environments.

## Why use Azure Arc-enabled Logic Apps

With Azure Arc-enabled Logic Apps, you can create and deploy logic app workflows in the same way as in the single-tenant experience for Azure Logic Apps. You also gain more control and flexibility when you have logic apps running on a Kubernetes infrastructure that you operate and manage.

Minor differences exist between the Azure Arc and single-tenant Azure Logic Apps experiences for creating, designing, and deploying logic apps. When you use Azure Arc-enabled Logic Apps, the major difference is that your logic apps run in a *custom location*. This location is mapped to an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster where you have installed and enabled the Azure App Service platform extensions bundle.

For example, this cluster can be Azure Kubernetes Service, bare-metal Kubernetes, or another setup. The extensions bundle enables you to run platform services such as Azure Logic Apps, Azure Functions, and Azure App Service on your Kubernetes cluster.

## When to use Azure Arc-enabled Logic Apps

Although Kubernetes provides more control and flexibility, you also have operational overhead. If you're satisfied that Azure Logic Apps meets your needs, you're encouraged to continue using this service. However, consider using Azure Arc-enabled Logic Apps when you have the following scenarios:

- You already run all your apps and services on Kubernetes. You want to extend these processes and controls to all your other PaaS services.

- You want to use Azure Logic Apps as your integration platform. However, you need fine grained networking with compute control and flexibility. You don't want to use an App Service Environment (ASE).

- For security reasons, you need control over where your logic apps run, for example, in your own region or in your own datacenter. 

- You want to run your logic apps in multi-cloud scenarios and use Azure Logic Apps as your sole integration platform for all your applications wherever they run.
