# Add conditions to control workflow action execution in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

When you want to set up a condition that returns true or false and have the result determine whether your workflow runs one path of actions or another, add the **Control** action named **Condition** to your workflow. You can also nest conditions inside each other.

For example, suppose you have a workflow that sends too many emails when new items appear on a website's RSS feed. 
You can add the **Condition** action to send email only when the new item includes a specific word.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you want to specify more than two paths from which your workflow can choose
> or condition criteria that's not restricted to only true or false, use a
> [**switch** action](logic-apps-control-flow-switch-statement.md) instead.

This guide shows how to add a condition to your workflow and use the result to help your workflow choose between two action paths.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* Basic knowledge about [logic app workflows](logic-apps-overview.md).

* To follow the example in this how-to guide, create either an [example Consumption logic app workflow](quickstart-create-example-consumption-workflow.md) or an [example Standard logic app workflow](create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal.md) and use either an Outlook.com account or a Microsoft work or school account.

## Add a condition

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Consumption logic app resource.

1. On the sidebar menu, under **Development Tools**, select the designer to open the blank workflow.

   This example uses the **RSS** trigger named **When a feed item is published** to start the workflow. However, you can use any trigger that you want in your own scenarios.

1. Add the trigger that you want by following the [general steps to add a trigger](add-trigger-action-workflow.md?tabs=consumption#add-trigger).

1. Add the **Condition** action to your workflow by following the [general steps to add an action](add-trigger-action-workflow.md?tabs=consumption#add-action).

1. In the **Condition** action, follow these steps to build your condition:

   1. In the left-side box named **Choose a value**, enter the first value or field that you want to compare.

      After you select inside the **Choose a value** box, the options to open the dynamic content list (lightning icon) or expression editor (formula icon) appear.

   1. Select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list.

      From this list, you can select outputs from previous steps in your workflow. This example selects the **RSS** trigger output named **Feed summary**. If you don't see this option, you might need to select **See more**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-control-flow-conditional-statement/edit-condition-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Azure portal, Consumption workflow designer, RSS trigger, and Condition action with criteria construction.":::

   1. From the middle box, select the operation to perform.
   
      This example selects **contains**.

   1. In the right-side box named **Choose a value**, enter the value or field that you want to compare with the first.
   
      This example specifies the following string: **Microsoft**

   The following example shows the complete condition:

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-control-flow-conditional-statement/complete-condition-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Consumption workflow and the complete condition criteria.":::

   - To add another row to your condition, from the **New item** menu, select **Add row**.

   - To add a group with subconditions, from the **New item** menu, select **Add group**.

   - To group existing rows, select the checkboxes for those rows, select the ellipses (...) button for any row, and then select **Make group**.

1. In the **True** and **False** action paths, add the actions that you want to run, based on whether the condition is true or false respectively, for example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-control-flow-conditional-statement/condition-true-false-path-consumption.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Consumption workflow and the condition with true and false paths.":::

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > You can drag existing actions into the **True** and **False** paths.

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Standard logic app resource.

1. On the resource sidebar menu, under **Workflows**, select **Workflows**, and then select your blank workflow.

1. On the workflow sidebar menu, under **Tools**, select the designer to open the workflow.

1. Add the trigger named **When a feed item is published** to your workflow by following the [general steps to add a trigger](add-trigger-action-workflow.md?tabs=standard#add-trigger).

1. Add the **Condition** action to your workflow by following the [general steps to add an action](add-trigger-action-workflow.md?tabs=standard#add-action).

1. In the **Condition** action, follow these steps to build your condition:

   1. In the left-side box named **Choose a value**, enter the first value or field that you want to compare.

      After you select inside the **Choose a value** box, the options to open the dynamic content list (lightning icon) or expression editor (formula icon) appear.

      :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-control-flow-conditional-statement/open-dynamic-content-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Azure portal, Standard workflow designer, RSS trigger, and Condition action with information pane open, and dynamic content button selected.":::

   1. Select the lightning icon to open the dynamic content list.

      From this list, you can select outputs from previous steps in your workflow. This example selects the RSS trigger output named **Feed summary**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-control-flow-conditional-statement/edit-condition-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Azure portal, Standard workflow designer, RSS trigger, and Condition action with criteria construction.":::

   1. From the middle box, select the operation to perform.
   
      This example selects **contains**.

   1. In the right-side box named **Choose a value**, enter the value or field that you want to compare with the first.
   
      This example specifies the following string: **Microsoft**

   The following example shows the complete condition:

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-control-flow-conditional-statement/complete-condition-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Standard workflow and the complete condition criteria.":::

   - To add another row to your condition, from the **New item** menu, select **Add Row**.

   - To add a group with subconditions, from the **New item** menu, select **Add Group**.

   - To group existing rows, select the checkboxes for those rows, select the ellipses (...) button for any row, and then select **Make Group**.

1. In the **True** and **False** action paths, add the actions to run, based on whether the condition is true or false respectively, for example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/logic-apps-control-flow-conditional-statement/condition-true-false-path-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Standard workflow and the condition with true and false paths.":::

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > You can drag existing actions into the **True** and **False** paths.

1. Save your workflow. On the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

This workflow now sends mail only when the new items in the RSS feed meet your condition.

## JSON definition

The following code shows the high-level JSON definition for the **Condition** action. For the full definition, see [If action - Schema reference guide for trigger and action types in Azure Logic Apps](logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md#if-action).
