# Manage logic app workflows in the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

This guide shows how to manage Standard or Consumption logic app workflows through the Azure portal and perform tasks such as edit, disable, enable, and delete workflows.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An existing Standard or Consumption logic app workflow

<a name="find-logic-app"></a>

## Find and open a logic app resource

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) search box, enter **logic apps**, and select **Logic apps**.

1. From the logic apps list, find your logic app resource by either browsing or filtering the list.

1. To open your logic app resource, select the app that you want to manage.

## View logic app properties

1. In the Azure portal, [find and open your logic app resource](#find-logic-app).

1. From your logic app's menu, under **Settings**, select **Properties**.

1. On the **Properties** pane, you can view and copy the following information about your logic app resource, for example:

   **Standard**

   * **Status**
   * **URL**
   * **Virtual IP address**
   * **Mode**
   * **Outbound IP address**
   * **Additional Outbound IP Addresses**
   * **FTP/deployment user**
   * **FTP host name**
   * **FTP diagnostic logs**
   * **FTP host name**
   * **FTPS diagnostic logs**
   * **Resource ID**
   * **Location**
   * **Resource Group**
   * **Subscription name**
   * **Subscription ID**

   **Consumption**

   * **Name**
   * **Resource ID**
   * **Resource group**
   * **Location**
   * **Type** 
   * **Subscription Name**
   * **Subscription ID**
   * **Access Endpoint**
   * **Runtime outgoing IP addresses**
   * **Access endpoint IP addresses**
   * **Connector outgoing IP addresses**

<a name="view-connections"></a>

## View connections

When you create connections in a workflow using [connectors managed by Microsoft](../connectors/managed.md), these connections are actually separate Azure resources with their own resource definitions and are hosted in global, multitenant Azure. Standard logic app workflows can also use [built-in service provider connectors](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/built-in/reference/) that natively run and are powered by the single-tenant Azure Logic Apps runtime. To view and manage these connections, follow these steps, based on the logic app resource type:

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. In the Azure portal, [find and open your logic app resource](#find-logic-app).

1. From the logic app menu, under **Workflows**, select **Connections**.

1. Based on the connection type that you want to view, select one of the following options:

   | Option | Description |
   |--------|-------------|
   | **API Connections** | Connections created by globally hosted, multitenant Azure connectors. To view the underlying connection resource definition, select **JSON View**. |
   | **Service Provider Connections** | Connections created by built-in, service provider connectors, based on the service provider interface implementation. To view more information about a specific connection instance, in the **View Details** column, select the eye icon. To view the selected connection's underlying resource definition, select **JSON View**. |
   | **Function Connections** | Connections to functions in an associated function app. To view more information about a function, in the **View Details** column, select the eye icon. |
   | **JSON View** | The underlying resource definitions for all connections across workflows in the logic app resource |

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. In the Azure portal, [find and open your logic app resource](#find-logic-app).

1. From the logic app menu, under **Development tools**, select **API Connections**.

1. On the **API Connections** page, select a specific connection instance, which shows more information about that connection. To view the underlying connection resource definition, select **JSON View**.

## Disable or enable logic app resources

While a Standard logic app resource can have multiple workflows, a Consumption logic app has only one workflow. So, both logic app resource types have different ways to disable and enable their activity.

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

You can [stop or start a single or multiple Standard logic app](#disable-enable-standard-logic-apps). You can also [restart a single logic app without first stopping](#restart-standard-logic-app). Your single-tenant based logic app can include multiple workflows, so you can either stop the entire logic app or [disable only Standard workflows](#disable-enable-standard-workflows).

> [!NOTE]
>
> The stop logic app and disable workflow operations have different effects. For more information, review 
> [Considerations for stopping Standard logic apps](#considerations-stop-standard-logic-apps) and 
> [considerations for disabling Standard workflows](#considerations-disable-enable-standard-workflows).

<a name="considerations-stop-standard-logic-apps"></a>

#### Considerations for stopping Standard logic apps

Stopping a Standard logic app at the resource level affects workflow instances in the following ways:

* Single-tenant Azure Logic Apps cancels all in-progress and pending runs immediately.

* Single-tenant Azure Logic Apps doesn't create or run new workflow instances.

* Triggers won't fire the next time that their conditions are met. However, trigger states remember the points where the logic app was stopped. So, if you restart the logic app, the triggers fire for all unprocessed items since the last run.

  To stop each workflow from triggering on unprocessed items since the last run, clear the trigger state before you restart the logic app by following these steps:

  1. In the Azure portal, open your logic app.
  1. On the logic app menu, under **Workflows**, select **Workflows**.
  1. Open a workflow, and edit any part of that workflow's trigger.
  1. Save your changes. This step resets the trigger's current state.
  1. Repeat for each workflow.
  1. When you're done, [restart your Standard logic app](#restart-standard-logic-app).

<a name="disable-enable-standard-logic-apps"></a>

#### Disable or enable Standard logic apps

You can stop or start multiple Standard logic apps at the same time, but you can't restart multiple Standard logic apps without stopping them first.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) search box, enter **logic apps**, and select **Logic apps**.

1. On the **Logic apps** page, view only the Standard logic apps using the **Plan** filter.

1. View only the **Enabled** or **Disabled** logic apps using the **Status** filter, which you can add if necessary.

1. In the checkbox column, select the logic apps that you want to stop or start.

   * To stop the selected running logic apps, select **Disable/Stop**. Confirm your selection.
   * To start the selected stopped logic apps, select **Enable/Start**.

1. To confirm whether your operation succeeded or failed, on main Azure toolbar, open the **Notifications** list (bell icon).

<a name="restart-standard-logic-app"></a>

#### Restart a Standard logic app without stopping

You can restart a Standard logic app anytime.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Standard logic app resource.

1. On the logic app menu, select **Overview**.

1. On the **Overview** page toolbar, select **Restart**.

1. To confirm whether your operation succeeded or failed, on main Azure toolbar, open the **Notifications** list (bell icon).

<a name="stop-start-standard-workflows"></a>

#### Stop or start Standard workflows

To stop the trigger from firing the next time when the trigger condition is met, disable your workflow.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The disable workflow and stop logic app operations have different effects. For more information, review 
> [Considerations for stopping Standard logic apps](#considerations-stop-standard-logic-apps) and 
> [Considerations for disabling a Standard workflow](#considerations-disable-enable-standard-workflows).

<a name="considerations-disable-enable-standard-workflows"></a>

##### Considerations for disabling a Standard workflow

Disabling a workflow affects workflow instances in the following ways:

* Single-tenant Azure Logic Apps continues all in-progress and pending workflow runs until they finish. Based on the volume or backlog, this process might take time to complete.

  > [!TIP]
  >
  > To reduce costs resulting from resources and workflow instances that might otherwise take longer 
  > to scale down in nonproduction environments for load and performance testing, you can manually 
  > stop a workflow. This action cancels in-progress and pending workflow instances. For this task, 
  > you have to add the following settings to your Standard logic app resource's host settings.
  >
  > **Important**: Make sure to use the following settings only in nonproduction environments. 
  > Follow each workflow ID with a colon (**:**), and separate workflow IDs with a semicolon (**;**):
  >
  > `"Jobs.SuspendedJobPartitionPrefixes": "<workflow-ID>:;<workflow-ID>:",`
  > `"Jobs.CleanupJobPartitionPrefixes": "<workflow-ID>:;<workflow-ID>:"`
  >
  > For more information, see [Edit host and app settings for Standard logic apps](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md).

* Single-tenant Azure Logic Apps doesn't create or run new workflow instances.

* The trigger won't fire the next time that its conditions are met. However, the trigger state remembers the point at which the workflow was disabled. So, if you re-enable the workflow, the trigger fires for all the unprocessed items since the last run.

  To stop the trigger from firing on unprocessed items since the last run, clear the trigger's state before you reactivate the workflow:

  1. In the workflow, edit any part of the workflow's trigger.
  1. Save your changes. This step resets your trigger's current state.
  1. [Reactivate your workflow](#disable-enable-standard-workflows).

* When a workflow is disabled, you can still resubmit runs.

<a name="disable-enable-standard-workflows"></a>

##### Disable or enable Standard workflows

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Standard logic app resource.

1. On the logic app menu, under **Workflows**, select **Workflows**.

1. In the checkbox column, select the workflow to disable or enable.

1. On the **Workflows** pane toolbar, select **Disable** or **Enable**.

1. To confirm whether your operation succeeded or failed, on main Azure toolbar, open the **Notifications** list (bell icon).

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

You can [stop or start a single or multiple Consumption logic apps at the same time](#disable-enable-consumption-logic-apps). A Consumption logic app has only one workflow, so stopping or starting the logic app resource affects all associated workflow instances.

<a name="considerations-stop-consumption-logic-apps"></a>

#### Considerations for stopping Consumption logic apps

Stopping a Consumption logic app affects workflow instances in the following ways:

* Azure Logic Apps continues all in-progress and pending runs until they finish. Based on the volume or backlog, this process might take time to complete.

* Azure Logic Apps doesn't create or run new workflow instances.

* The trigger won't fire the next time that its conditions are met. However, the trigger state remembers the point at which the logic app was stopped. So, if you reactivate the logic app, the trigger fires for all the unprocessed items since the last run.

  To stop the trigger from triggering on unprocessed items since the last run, clear the trigger's state before you reactivate the logic app:

  1. In the logic app, edit any part of the workflow's trigger.
  1. Save your changes. This step resets your trigger's current state.
  1. [Reactivate your logic app](#disable-enable-consumption-logic-apps).

* When a workflow is disabled, you can still resubmit runs.

<a name="disable-enable-consumption-logic-apps"></a>

### Disable or enable Consumption logic apps

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) search box, enter **logic apps**, and select **Logic apps**.

1. On the **Logic apps** page, view only the Consumption logic apps using the **Plan** filter.

1. View only the **Enabled** or **Disabled** logic apps using the **Status** filter, which you can add if necessary.

1. In the checkbox column, select a single or multiple logic apps that you want to stop or start.

   * To stop the selected running logic apps, select **Disable/Stop**. Confirm your selection.
   * To start the selected stopped logic apps, select **Enable/Start**.

1. To confirm whether your operation succeeded or failed, on main Azure toolbar, open the **Notifications** list (bell icon).

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > If the correct status doesn't appear, refresh the page.

<a name="delete-logic-apps"></a>

## Delete logic apps

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

You can [delete a single or multiple Standard logic apps at the same time](#delete-standard-logic-apps). Your single-tenant based logic app can include multiple workflows, so you can either delete the entire logic app or [delete only workflows](#delete-standard-workflows).

<a name="delete-standard-logic-apps"></a>

#### Delete Standard logic apps

Deleting a Standard logic app resource cancels in-progress and pending runs immediately, but doesn't run cleanup tasks on the storage used by the app.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Although you can [manually recover deleted Standard logic apps](#recover-deleted-standard-logic-apps), 
> using source control to manage your Standard logic apps makes recovery and redeployment much easier.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) search box, enter **logic apps**, and select **Logic apps**.

1. On the **Logic apps** page, view only the Standard logic apps using the **Plan** filter.

1. In the checkbox column, select a single or multiple logic apps to delete. On the toolbar, select **Delete**.

1. When the confirmation box appears, enter **yes**, and select **Delete**.

1. To confirm whether your operation succeeded or failed, on main Azure toolbar, open the **Notifications** list (bell icon).

<a name="delete-standard-workflows"></a>

#### Delete Standard workflows

Deleting a Standard workflow affects workflow instances in the following ways:

* Azure Logic Apps cancels in-progress and pending runs immediately, but runs cleanup tasks on the storage used by the workflow.

* Azure Logic Apps doesn't create or run new workflow instances.

* If you delete a workflow and then recreate the same workflow, the recreated workflow won't have the same metadata as the deleted workflow. To refresh the metadata, you have to resave any workflow that called the deleted workflow. That way, the caller gets the correct information for the recreated workflow. Otherwise, calls to the recreated workflow fail with an **Unauthorized** error. This behavior also applies to workflows that use artifacts in integration accounts and workflows that call Azure functions.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Standard logic app resource.

1. On the logic app menu, under **Workflows**, select **Workflows**. In the checkbox column, select a single or multiple workflows to delete.

1. On the toolbar, select **Delete**.

1. To confirm whether your operation succeeded or failed, on main Azure toolbar, open the **Notifications** list (bell icon).

<a name="recover-deleted-standard-logic-apps"></a>

#### Recover deleted Standard logic apps

Provided that you use source control, you can seamlessly recover a deleted Standard logic app resource that uses the **Workflow Standard** hosting option in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps by redeploying your app. However, to recover a deleted Standard logic app resource that uses the App Service Environment v3 hosting option, before you delete your app, you have to first download the Standard logic app artifacts from the Azure portal. For more information, see [Download Standard logic app artifacts from portal](/azure/logic-apps/set-up-devops-deployment-single-tenant-azure-logic-apps?tabs=github#download-standard-logic-app-artifacts-from-portal).

Before you try to recover a deleted logic app, review the following considerations:

* The run history from the deleted logic app is unavailable in the recovered logic app.

* If your workflow starts with the **Request** trigger, the callback URL for the recovered logic app differs from the URL for the deleted logic app.

If you're not using source control, try the following steps to recover a deleted Standard logic app that uses the **Workflow Standard** hosting option in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps:

1. Confirm that your logic app's storage account still exists. If the storage account was deleted, you have to [first recover the deleted storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-recover.md).

1. On the storage account menu, under **Security + networking**, select **Access keys**.

1. On the **Access keys** page, copy the account's primary connection string, and save for later use, for example:

   **DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<*storage-account-name*>;AccountKey=<*access-key*>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net**

1. On the storage account menu, under **Data storage**, select **File shares**, copy the name for the file share associated with your logic app, and save for later use.

1. Create a new Standard logic app resource using the same hosting plan and pricing tier. You can either use a new name or reuse the name from the deleted logic app.

1. Before you continue, stop the logic app. From the logic app menu, select **Overview**. On the **Overview** page toolbar, select **Stop**.

1. From the logic app menu, under **Settings**, select **Configuration**.

1. On the **Configuration** page, update the following application setting values, and remember to save your changes when finished.

   | App setting | Replacement value |
   |-------------|-------------------|
   | **AzureWebJobsStorage** | Replace the existing value with the previously copied connection string from your storage account. |
   | **WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING** | Replace the existing value with the previously copied string from your storage account. |
   | **WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE** | Replace the existing value with the previously copied file share name. |

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >
   > When you have sensitive information, such as connection strings that include usernames and passwords, 
   > make sure to use the most secure authentication flow available. For example, in Standard logic app workflows, 
   > secure data types, such as `securestring` and `secureobject`, aren't supported. Microsoft recommends that you 
   > authenticate access to Azure resources with a [managed identity](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) 
   > when possible, and assign a role that has the least privilege necessary.
   >
   > If this capability is unavailable, make sure to secure connection strings through other measures, such as 
   > [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview), which you can use with [app settings](edit-app-settings-host-settings.md). 
   > You can then [directly reference secure strings](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references.md), such as connection 
   > strings and keys. Similar to ARM templates, where you can define environment variables at deployment time, you can define 
   > app settings within your [logic app workflow definition](/azure/templates/microsoft.logic/workflows). 
   > You can then capture dynamically generated infrastructure values, such as connection endpoints, storage strings, and more. 
   > For more information, see [Application types for the Microsoft identity platform](/entra/identity-platform/v2-app-types).

1. On your logic app menu, under **Workflows**, select **Connections**.

1. Open each connection and under **Settings**, select **Access policies**.

1. Delete the access policy for the deleted logic app, and then add a new access policy for the replacement logic app.

1. Return to the logic app's **Configuration** page, and add any custom settings that existed on the deleted logic app.

1. When you're done, restart your logic app.

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

You can [delete a single or multiple Consumption logic apps at the same time](#delete-consumption-logic-apps).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> You can't recover deleted Consumption logic app resources.

Deleting a Consumption logic app affects workflow instances in the following ways:

* Azure Logic Apps makes a best effort to cancel any in-progress and pending runs.

  Even with a large volume or backlog, most runs are canceled before they finish or start. However, the cancellation process might take time to complete. Meanwhile, some runs might get picked up for execution while the service works through the cancellation process.

* Azure Logic Apps doesn't create or run new workflow instances.

* If you delete a workflow and then recreate the same workflow, the recreated workflow won't have the same metadata as the deleted workflow. You have to resave any workflow that called the deleted workflow. That way, the caller gets the correct information for the recreated workflow. Otherwise, calls to the recreated workflow fail with an `Unauthorized` error. This behavior also applies to workflows that use artifacts in integration accounts and workflows that call Azure functions.

<a name="delete-consumption-logic-apps"></a>

#### Delete Consumption logic apps

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) search box, enter **logic apps**, and select **Logic apps**.

1. On the **Logic apps** page, view only the Consumption logic apps using the **Plan** filter.

1. In the checkbox column, select a single or multiple logic apps to delete. On the toolbar, select **Delete**.

1. When the confirmation box appears, enter **yes**, and select **Delete**.

1. To confirm whether your operation succeeded or failed, on main Azure toolbar, open the **Notifications** list (bell icon).

<a name="manage-logic-app-versions"></a>

## Manage logic app versions

For Consumption logic apps, you can use the Azure portal for version control. For example, you can find your logic app's version history and publish previous versions, if any exist.

<a name="find-version-history"></a>

### Find and view previous versions

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Consumption logic app.

1. On the logic app menu, under **Development Tools**, select **Versions**.

   ![Screenshot shows Azure portal and Consumption logic app menu with Versions selected, and list of previous logic app versions.](./media/manage-logic-apps-with-azure-portal/logic-apps-menu-versions.png)

1. From the **Version** list, select the logic app version to manage.

   To filter the list, in the **Versions** page search bar, enter the version ID.

   The **History version** page shows the previous version's details in read-only mode. You can select between designer view and code view.

   ![Screenshot shows history version page with designer view and code view options.](./media/manage-logic-apps-with-azure-portal/history-version.png)

<a name="promote-previous-versions"></a>

### Promote previous versions

To publish a previous version of your Consumption logic app, you can promote that version over the current version.

1. In your logic app's version history, [find and select the version that you want to promote](#find-version-history).

1. On the **History version** page, select **Promote**.

   ![Screenshot shows logic app's version history with selected Promote button.](./media/manage-logic-apps-with-azure-portal/promote-button.png)

1. After the workflow designer opens, make any necessary edits to the version that you want to promote.

   You can switch between **Designer** and **Code view** modes. You can also update **Parameters**, **Templates**, and **Connectors**.

   ![Screenshot shows workflow designer with designer and code view options.](./media/manage-logic-apps-with-azure-portal/promote-page.png)

1. To save any updates and finish promotion, on the designer toolbar, select **Save**. To cancel your changes, select **Discard**.

When you next [view your logic app's version history](#find-version-history), the promoted version appears at the top of the list and has a new identifier.
