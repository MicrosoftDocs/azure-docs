# Monitor and collect diagnostic data for workflows in Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

To get richer data for debugging and diagnosing your workflows in Azure Logic Apps, you can log workflow runtime data and events, such as trigger events, run events, and action events, that you can send to a [Log Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#send-to-log-analytics-workspace), Azure [storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-overview.md), Azure [event hub](../event-hubs/event-hubs-features.md#namespace), another partner destination, or all these destinations when you set up and use [Azure Monitor Logs](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-platform-logs).

> [!NOTE]
>
> Azure Monitor Resource Logs aren't 100% lossless. Resource Logs are based on a store and forward architecture designed to affordably move 
> petabytes of data per day at scale. This capability includes built-in redundancy and retries across the platform, but doesn't provide 
> transactional guarantees. Transactional monitoring might reduce the reliability and performance of the monitored service. 
> Also, transient logging errors must halt the upstream service when unable to confirm log delivery. 
> Whenever the Azure Monitor team can confirm a persistent source of data loss, the team considers resolution and prevention its highest priority. 
> However, small data losses might still happen due to temporary, non-repeating service issues distributed across Azure, and not all can be caught.

This how-to guide shows how to complete the following tasks, based on whether you have a Consumption or Standard logic app resource.

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. At Consumption logic app creation, [enable Log Analytics and specify your Log Analytics workspace](#enable-for-new-logic-apps).

   -or-

   For an existing Consumption logic app, [install the Logic Apps Management solution in your Log Analytics workspace](#install-management-solution). This solution provides aggregated information for your logic app runs and includes specific details such as status, execution time, resubmission status, and correlation IDs.

1. [Add a diagnostic setting to enable data collection](#add-diagnostic-setting).

1. [View workflow run status](#view-workflow-run-status).

1. [Send diagnostic data to Azure Storage and Azure Event Hubs](#other-destinations).

1. [Include custom properties in telemetry](#custom-tracking-properties).

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. [Add a diagnostic setting to enable data collection](#add-diagnostic-setting).

1. [View workflow run status](#view-workflow-run-status).

1. [Send diagnostic data to Azure Storage and Azure Event Hubs](#other-destinations).

1. [Include custom properties in telemetry](#custom-tracking-properties).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

  For a Consumption logic app resource, you need Azure subscription Owner or Contributor permissions so you can install the Logic Apps Management solution from the Azure Marketplace. For more information, see the following documentation:

  * [Permission to purchase - Azure Marketplace purchasing](/marketplace/azure-purchasing-invoicing#permission-to-purchase)

  * [Azure roles, Microsoft Entra roles, and classic subscription administrator roles](../role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles.md#azure-roles)

* The destination resource for where you want to send diagnostic data:

  * A [Log Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace)

  * An [Azure storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md)

  * An [Azure event hub](../event-hubs/event-hubs-create.md)

* Your logic app resource and workflow

## Enable Log Analytics

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

For a Consumption logic app, you need to first enable Log Analytics.

<a name="enable-for-new-logic-apps"></a>

#### Enable Log Analytics at logic app creation

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), on the **Create Logic App** pane, follow these steps:

   1. Under **Plan**, make sure to select **Consumption** so that only the options for Consumption workflows appear.

   1. For **Enable log analytics**, select **Yes**.

   1. From the **Log Analytics workspace** list, select the workspace where you want to send the data from your workflow run.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/consumption/create-logic-app-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Azure portal and Consumption logic app creation page.":::

 1. Finish creating your logic app resource.
 
     When you're done, your logic app is associated with your Log Analytics workspace. This step also automatically installs the Logic Apps Management solution in your workspace.

1. After you run your workflow, [view your workflow run status](#view-workflow-run-status).

<a name="install-management-solution"></a>

#### Install Logic Apps Management solution

If you turned on Log Analytics when you created your logic app resource, skip this section. You already have the Logic Apps Management solution installed in your Log Analytics workspace. Otherwise, continue with the following steps for an existing Consumption logic app:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) search box, enter **log analytics workspaces**, and select **Log Analytics workspaces** from the results.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/consumption/find-select-log-analytics-workspaces.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Azure portal search box with log analytics workspaces selected.":::

1. Under **Log Analytics workspaces**, select your workspace.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/consumption/select-log-analytics-workspace.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Azure portal, the Log Analytics workspaces list, and a specific workspace selected.":::

1. On the **Overview** pane, under **Get started with Log Analytics** > **Configure monitoring solutions**, select **View solutions**.

## View workflow run status

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

After your workflow runs, you can view the data about those runs in your Log Analytics workspace.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Log Analytics workspace.

1. On your workspace menu, under **Classic**, select **Workspace summary**. On the **Overview** page, select **Logic Apps Management**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > 
   > If the **Logic Apps Management** tile doesn't immediately show results after a run, 
   > try selecting **Refresh** or wait for a short time before trying again.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/consumption/logic-app-runs-summary.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Azure portal, Log Analytics workspace with Consumption logic app workflow run status and count.":::

   The summary page shows workflows grouped by name or by execution status. The page also shows details about failures in the actions or triggers for the workflow runs.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/consumption/logic-app-runs-summary-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing status summary for Consumption logic app workflow runs.":::

1. To view all the runs for a specific workflow or status, select the row for that workflow or status.

   This example shows all the runs for a specific workflow:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/consumption/logic-app-run-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing runs and status for a specific Consumption logic app workflow.":::

   For actions where you added [tracked properties](#custom-tracking-properties), you can search for the tracked properties using the column filter. To view the properties, in the **Tracked Properties** column, select **View**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/consumption/logic-app-tracked-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing tracked properties for a specific Consumption logic app workflow.":::

1. To filter your results, you can perform both client-side and server-side filtering.

   * **Client-side filter**: For each column, select the filters that you want, for example:

     :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/consumption/filters.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing example client-side filter using column filters.":::

   * **Server-side filter**: To select a specific time window or to limit the number of runs that appear, use the scope control at the top of the page. By default, only 1,000 records appear at a time.

     :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/consumption/change-interval.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing example server-side filter that changes the time window.":::

1. To view all the actions and their details for a specific run, select the row for a logic app workflow run.

   The following example shows all the actions and triggers for a specific logic app workflow run:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/consumption/logic-app-action-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing all operations and details for a specific logic app workflow run.":::

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Log Analytics workspace.

1. On the workspace navigation menu, select **Logs**.

1. On the new query tab, in the left column, under **Tables**, expand **LogManagement**, and select **LogicAppWorkflowRuntime**. If you're working with Azure Government regions, select **Azure Diagnostics** instead.

   In the records pane, under **Results**, the table shows records related to the following events:

   * WorkflowRunStarted
   * WorkflowRunCompleted
   * WorkflowTriggerStarted
   * WorkflowTriggerEnded 
   * WorkflowActionStarted 
   * WorkflowActionCompleted 
   * WorkflowBatchMessageSend 
   * WorkflowBatchMessageRelease 

   For completed events, the **EndTime** column publishes the timestamp for when those finished. This value helps you determine the duration between the start event and the completed event.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/standard/log-analytics-workspace-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Azure portal, Log Analytics workspace, and captured telemetry for Standard logic app workflow run.":::

## Sample queries

In your Log Analytics workspace's query pane, you can enter your own queries to find specific data, for example:

* Select all events for a specific workflow run ID:

  ```
  LogicAppWorkflowRuntime
  | where RunId == "08585258189921908774209033046CU00"
  ```

* List all exceptions:

  ```
  LogicAppWorkflowRuntime
  | where Error != ""
  | sort by StartTime desc
  ```

* Identify actions that have experienced retries:

  ```
  LogicAppWorkflowRuntime
  | where RetryHistory != ""
  | sort by StartTime desc 
  ```

## Send diagnostic data to Azure Storage and Azure Event Hubs

Along with Azure Monitor Logs, you can send the collected data to other destinations, for example:

* [Archive Azure resource logs to storage account](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#send-to-azure-storage)
* [Stream Azure platform logs to Azure Event Hubs](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#send-to-azure-event-hubs)

You can then get real-time monitoring by using telemetry and analytics from other services, such as [Azure Stream Analytics](../stream-analytics/stream-analytics-introduction.md) and [Power BI](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-powerbi), for example:

* [Stream data from Event Hubs to Stream Analytics](../stream-analytics/stream-analytics-define-inputs.md)
* [Analyze streaming data with Stream Analytics and create a real-time analytics dashboard in Power BI](../stream-analytics/stream-analytics-power-bi-dashboard.md)

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Retention periods apply only when you use a storage account.

<a name="custom-tracking-properties"></a>

## Include custom properties in telemetry 

In your workflow, triggers and actions have the capability for you to add the following custom properties so that their values appear along with the emitted telemetry in your Log Analytics workspace.

### Custom tracking ID

Most triggers have a **Custom Tracking Id** property where you can specify a tracking ID using an expression. You can use this expression to get data from the received message payload or to generate unique values, for example:

If you don't specify this custom tracking ID, Azure automatically generates this ID and correlates events across a workflow run, including any nested workflows that are called from the parent workflow. You can manually specify this ID in a trigger by passing a `x-ms-client-tracking-id` header with your custom ID value in the trigger request. You can use a Request trigger, HTTP trigger, or webhook-based trigger.

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/consumption/custom-tracking-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Azure portal, designer for Consumption workflow, and Request trigger with custom tracking ID.":::

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/standard/custom-tracking-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Azure portal, designer for Standard workflow, and Request trigger with custom tracking ID.":::

---

### Tracked properties

Actions have a **Tracked Properties** section where you can specify a custom property name and value by entering an expression or hardcoded value to track specific inputs or outputs, for example:

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/consumption/tracked-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Azure portal, designer for Consumption workflow, and HTTP action with tracked properties.":::

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/standard/tracked-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Azure portal, designer for Standard workflow, and HTTP action with tracked properties.":::

---

Tracked properties can track only a single action's inputs and outputs, but you can use the `correlation` properties of events to correlate across actions in a workflow run.

Tracked properties can only reference the parameters, inputs, and outputs for its own trigger or action.

Tracked properties aren't allowed on a trigger or action that has secure inputs, secure outputs, or both. They're also not allowed to reference another trigger or action that has secure inputs, secure outputs, or both.

The following examples show where custom properties appear in your Log Analytics workspace:

### [Consumption](#tab/consumption)

1. On your Log Analytics workspace menu, under **Classic**, select **Workspace summary**. On the **Overview** page, select **Logic Apps Management**.

1. Select the row for the workflow that you want to review.

1. On the **Runs** page, in the **Logic App Runs** table, find the **Tracking ID** column and the **Tracked Properties** column.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/consumption/logic-app-run-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing runs and status for a specific Consumption workflow.":::

1. To search the tracked properties, use the column filter. To view the properties, select **View**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-workflows-collect-diagnostic-data/consumption/example-tracked-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing example tracked properties for a specific Consumption  workflow.":::

### [Standard](#tab/standard)

The custom tracking ID appears in the **ClientTrackingId** column and tracked properties appear in the **TrackedProperties** column, for example:
