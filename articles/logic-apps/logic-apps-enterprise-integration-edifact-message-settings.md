# Reference for EDIFACT message settings in agreements for Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

This reference describes the properties that you can set in an EDIFACT agreement for specifying how to handle messages between [trading partners](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-partners.md). Set up these properties based on your agreement with the partner that exchanges messages with you.

### Schemas

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **UNH2.1 (Type)** | The transaction set type. |
| **UNH2.2 (Version)** | The message version number that is 1-3 characters. |
| **UNH2.3 (Release)** | The message release number that is 1-3 characters. |
| **UNH2.5 (Associated Assigned Code)** | The assigned code that is alphanumeric and is 1-6 characters. |

### Control Numbers

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Disallow interchange control number duplicates** | Block duplicate interchanges. The EDIFACT decoding action checks that the interchange control number (UNB5) for the received interchange doesn't match a previously processed interchange control number. If a match is detected, the interchange isn't processed. |
| **Check for duplicate UNB5 every (days)** | If you chose to disallow duplicate interchange control numbers, you can specify the number of days between running the check. |
| **Disallow Group control number duplicates** | Block interchanges that have duplicate group control numbers (UNG5). |
| **Disallow Transaction set control number duplicates** | Block interchanges that have duplicate transaction set control numbers (UNH1). |
| **EDIFACT Acknowledgment Control Number** | Assign the transaction set reference numbers to use in an acknowledgment by entering a value for the prefix, a range of reference numbers, and a suffix. |

### Validation

After you finish setting up a validation row, the next row automatically appears. If you don't specify any rules, validation uses the row that's labeled **Default**.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Message Type** | The EDI message type. |
| **EDI Validation** | Run EDI validation on data types as defined by the schema's EDI properties, length restrictions, empty data elements, and trailing separators. |
| **Extended Validation** | If the data type isn't EDI, validation runs on the data element requirement and allowed repetition, enumerations, and data element length validation (min and max). |
| **Allow Leading/Trailing Zeroes** | Keep any extra leading or trailing zero and space characters. Don't remove these characters. |
| **Trim Leading/Trailing Zeroes** | Remove the leading or trailing zero and space characters. |
| **Trailing Separator Policy** | Generate trailing separators. <br><br>- **Not Allowed**: Prohibit trailing delimiters and separators in the received interchange. If the interchange has trailing delimiters and separators, the interchange is declared not valid. <br><br>- **Optional**: Accept interchanges with or without trailing delimiters and separators. <br><br>- **Mandatory**: The received interchange must have trailing delimiters and separators. |

### Internal Settings

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Create empty XML tags if trailing separators are allowed** | The interchange sender includes empty XML tags as trailing separators. |
| **Split Interchange as transaction sets - suspend transaction sets on error** | Parse each transaction set in an interchange into a separate XML document by applying the appropriate envelope to the transaction set. Suspend only the transaction sets that fail validation. |
| **Split Interchange as transaction sets - suspend interchange on error** | Parse each transaction set in an interchange into a separate XML document by applying the appropriate envelope. Suspend the entire interchange when one or more transaction sets in the interchange fail validation. |
| **Preserve Interchange - suspend transaction sets on error** | Keep the interchange intact, create an XML document for the entire batched interchange. Suspend only the transaction sets that fail validation, while continuing to process all other transaction sets. |
| **Preserve Interchange - suspend interchange on error** | Keep the interchange intact, create an XML document for the entire batched interchange. Suspend the entire interchange when one or more transaction sets in the interchange fail validation. |

| **UNB6.2 (Recipient Reference Qualifier)** | An alphanumeric value that is 1-2 characters. |
| **UNB7 (Application Reference ID)** | An alphanumeric value that is 1-14 characters. |

### Acknowledgment

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Receipt of Message (CONTRL)** | The host partner that sends the message requests a technical (CONTRL) acknowledgment from the guest partner. |
| **Acknowledgment (CONTRL)** | The host partner that sends the message expects requests a functional (CONTRL) acknowledgment from the guest partner. |
| **Generate SG1/SG4 loop for accepted transaction sets** | If you chose to request a functional acknowledgment, this setting forces the generation of SG1/SG4 loops in the functional acknowledgments for accepted transaction sets. |

### Schemas

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **UNH2.1 (Type)** | The transaction set type. |
| **UNH2.2 (Version)** | The message version number. |
| **UNH2.3 (Release)** | The message release number. |
| **Schema** | The previously uploaded schema that you want to use in from either resource type: <br><br>- Consumption: An integration account linked to your logic app. <br>- Standard: Your logic app resource |

### Envelopes
