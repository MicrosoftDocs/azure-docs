# Common questions about Azure to Azure shared disks (preview)

This article answers common questions about using shared disks (Azure to Azure) with Azure Site Recovery, focusing on the current capabilities and limitations during the public preview phase.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Does Azure Site Recovery support Linux VMs with shared disks?
No, Azure Site Recovery does not support Linux VMs with shared disks. Only VMs with WSFC-based shared disks are supported.

#### Is PowerShell supported for Azure Site Recovery with shared disks?
No, PowerShell support for shared disks is currently unavailable.

#### Can we enable replication for only some of the VMs attached to a shared disk?
No, enable replication can only be enabled successfully when all the VMs attached to a shared disk are selected.

#### Is it possible to exclude shared disks and enable replication for only some of the VMs in a cluster?
Yes, the first time you don’t select all the VMs in Enable Replication, a warning appears mentioning the unselected VMs attached to the shared disk. If you still proceed, unselect the shared disk replication by selecting ‘No’ for the storage option in Replication Settings tab.
 
####  If the *enable replication* job fails for a cluster, can we restart it after fixing the issue without reselecting clusters again?
Yes, you can restart the job without reselecting clusters, just like other A2A scenarios. However, since the *enable replication* process runs for each node, you need to restart the failed job for all nodes through the Site Recovery Jobs interface.

#### Can new shared disks be added to a protected cluster?
No, if new shared disks need to be added, disable the replication for the already protected cluster. Enable a new cluster protection with a new cluster name for the modified infrastructure.

#### Can we select both crash-consistent and app-consistent recovery points?
Yes, both types of recovery points are generated. However, during Public Preview only crash-consistent and the Latest Processed recovery points are supported. App-consistent recovery points and Latest recovery point will be available as part of General Availability.

#### Can we use recovery plans to failover Azure Site Recovery enabled VMs with shared disks?
No, recovery plans are not supported for shared disks in Azure Site Recovery.

#### Why is there no health status for VMs with shared disks in the monitoring plane, whether test failover is completed or not?
The health status warning due to test failover will be available as part of General Availability.
