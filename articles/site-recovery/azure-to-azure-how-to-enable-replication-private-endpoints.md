# Replicate machines with private endpoints

Azure Site Recovery allows you to use [Azure Private Link](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md) private endpoints for replicating your machines from inside an isolated virtual network. Private endpoint access to a recovery vault is supported in all Azure Commercial & Government regions.

This article provides instructions for you to perform the following steps:

- Create an Azure Backup Recovery Services vault to protect your machines.
- Enable a managed identity for the vault and grant the required permissions to access customer
  storage accounts to replicate traffic from source to target locations. Managed identity access for
  storage is necessary when you're setting up Private Link access to the vault.
- Make DNS changes required for private endpoints
- Create and approve private endpoints for a vault inside a virtual network
- Create private endpoints for the storage accounts. You can continue to allow public or firewalled
  access for storage as needed. Creation of a private endpoint for accessing storage isn't mandatory
  for Azure Site Recovery.
  
Following is a reference architecture on how the replication workflow changes with private endpoints.

## Prerequisites and caveats

- Private endpoints can be created only for new Recovery Services vaults that don't have any items
  registered to the vault. As such, private endpoints **must be created before any items are added
  to the vault**. Review the pricing structure for
  [private endpoints](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/private-link/).
- When a private endpoint is created for a vault, the vault is locked down and **isn't accessible
  from networks other than those networks that have private endpoints**.
- Microsoft Entra ID currently doesn't support private endpoints. As such, IPs and fully
  qualified domain names required for Microsoft Entra ID to work in a region need to be allowed
  outbound access from the secured network. You can also use network security group tag "Azure
  Active Directory" and Azure Firewall tags for allowing access to Microsoft Entra ID, as
  applicable.
- **At least nine IP addresses are required** in the subnets of both your source machines and your
  recovery machines. When you create a private endpoint for the vault, Site Recovery creates five
  private links for access to its microservices. Further, when you enable the replication, it adds
  two additional private links for the source and target region pairing.
- **One additional IP address is required** in both the source and recovery subnets. This IP address
  is needed only when you need to use private endpoints connecting to cache storage accounts.
  Private endpoints for storage can only be created on General Purpose v2 type. Review the pricing
  structure for
  [data transfer on GPv2](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/page-blobs/).

 ## Creating and using private endpoints for Site Recovery

 This section talks about the steps involved in creating and using private endpoints for Azure Site
 Recovery inside your virtual networks.

> [!NOTE]
> It's highly recommended that you follow these steps in the same sequence as provided. Failure to
> do so may lead to the vault being rendered unable to use private endpoints and requiring you to
> restart the process with a new vault.

## Create a Recovery Services vault

A recovery services vault is an entity that contains the replication information of machines and is
used to trigger Site Recovery operations. For more information, see
[Create a Recovery Services vault](./azure-to-azure-tutorial-enable-replication.md#create-a-recovery-services-vault).

## Enable the managed identity for the vault.

A [managed identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) allow the
vault to gain access to the customer's storage accounts. Site Recovery needs to access the source
storage, target storage, and cache/log storage accounts depending on the scenario requirement.
Managed identity access is essential when you're using private links service for the vault.

1. Go to your Recovery Services vault. Select **Identity** under _Settings_.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication-private-endpoints/enable-managed-identity-in-vault.png" alt-text="Shows the Azure portal and the Recovery Services page.":::

1. Change the **Status** to _On_ and select **Save**.

1. An **Object ID** is generated indicating that the vault is now registered with Azure Active
   Directory.

## Create private endpoints for the Recovery Services vault

To enable both failover and failback for Azure virtual machines, you'll need two private endpoints
for the vault. One private endpoint for the protection of machines in the source network and another
for the reprotection of failed over machines in the recovery network.

Ensure that you create a recovery virtual network in your target region as well during this setup
process.

Create the first private endpoint for your vault inside your source virtual network using the
Private Link Center in the portal or through
[Azure PowerShell](../private-link/create-private-endpoint-powershell.md). Create the second private
endpoint for the vault inside your recovery network. Following are the steps to create the private
endpoint in source network. Repeat the same guidance to create the second private endpoint.

1. In the Azure portal search bar, search for and select "Private Link". This action takes you to
   the Private Link Center.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication-private-endpoints/search-private-links.png" alt-text="Shows searching the Azure portal for the Private Link Center.":::

1. On the left navigation bar, select **Private Endpoints**. Once on the Private Endpoints page,
   select **\+Add** to start creating a private endpoint for your vault.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication-private-endpoints/create-private-endpoints.png" alt-text="Shows creating a private endpoint in the Private Link Center.":::

1. Once in the "Create Private Endpoint" experience, you're required to specify details for creating
   your private endpoint connection.

   1. **Basics**: Fill in the basic details for your private endpoints. The region should be the
      same as the source machines.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication-private-endpoints/create-private-endpoints-basic-tab.png" alt-text="Shows the Basic tab, project details, subscription, and other related fields for creating a private endpoint in the Azure portal.":::

   1. **Resource**: This tab requires you to mention the platform-as-a-service resource for which
      you want to create your connection. Select _Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults_ from the
      **Resource type** for your selected subscription. Then, choose the name of your Recovery
      Services vault for **Resource** and set _Azure Site Recovery_ as the **Target sub-resource**.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication-private-endpoints/create-private-endpoints-resource-tab.png" alt-text="Shows the Resource tab, resource type, resource, and target sub-resource fields for linking to a private endpoint in the Azure portal.":::

   1. **Configuration**: In configuration, specify the virtual network and subnet where you want the
      private endpoint to be created. This virtual network is the network where the virtual machine
      is present. Enable integration with private DNS zone by selecting **Yes**. Choose an already
      created DNS zone or create a new one. Selecting **Yes** automatically links the zone to the
      source virtual network and adds the DNS records that are required for DNS resolution of new
      IPs and fully qualified domain names created for the private endpoint.

      Ensure that you choose to create a new DNS zone for every new private endpoint connecting to
      the same vault. If you choose an existing private DNS zone, the previous CNAME records are
      overwritten. Refer to
      [Private endpoint guidance](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md#private-endpoint-properties)
      before you continue.

      If your environment has a hub and spoke model, you need only one private endpoint and only one
      private DNS zone for the entire setup since all your virtual networks already have peering
      enabled between them. For more information, see
      [Private endpoint DNS integration](../private-link/private-endpoint-dns-integration.md#virtual-network-workloads-without-custom-dns-server).

      To manually create the private DNS zone, follow the steps in
      [Create private DNS zones and add DNS records manually](#create-private-dns-zones-and-add-dns-records-manually).

      :::image type="content" source="./media/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication-private-endpoints/create-private-endpoints-configuration-tab.png" alt-text="Shows the Configuration tab with networking and DNS integration fields for configuration of a private endpoint in the Azure portal.":::

   1. **Tags**: Optionally, you can add tags for your private endpoint.

   1. **Review \+ create**: When the validation completes, select **Create** to create the private
      endpoint.

Once the private endpoint is created, five fully qualified domain names are added to the private
endpoint. These links enable the machines in the virtual network to get access to all the required
Site Recovery microservices in the context of the vault. Later, when you enable the replication, two
additional fully qualified domain names are added to the same private endpoint.

The five domain names are formatted with the following pattern:

`{Vault-ID}-asr-pod01-{type}-.{target-geo-code}.privatelink.siterecovery.windowsazure.com`

## Approve private endpoints for Site Recovery

If the user creating the private endpoint is also the owner of the Recovery Services vault, the
private endpoint created above is auto approved within a few minutes. Otherwise, the owner of the
vault must approve the private endpoint before you to use it. To approve or reject a requested
private endpoint connection, go to **Private endpoint connections** under "Settings" on the recovery
vault page.

You can go to the private endpoint resource to review the status of the connection before
proceeding.

## <a name="create-private-endpoints-for-the-cache-storage-account"></a>(Optional) Create private endpoints for the cache storage account

A private endpoint to Azure Storage may be used. Creating private endpoints for storage access is
_optional_ for Azure Site Recovery replication. When creating a private endpoint for storage, the
following requirements apply:

- You need a private endpoint for the cache/log storage account in your source virtual network.
- You need a second private endpoint at the time of reprotection of the failed-over machines in the
  recovery network. This private endpoint is for the new storage account created in the target
  region.

> [!NOTE]
> If private endpoints are not enabled on storage account, protection would still be successful. However, replication traffic would transit to Azure Site Recovery public endpoints. To ensure replication traffic flows via private links, storage account must be enabled with private endpoints.

> [!NOTE]
> Private endpoint for storage can only be created on a **General Purpose v2** storage accounts. For
> pricing information, see
> [Standard page blob prices](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/page-blobs/).

Follow the
[guidance for creation of private storage](../private-link/tutorial-private-endpoint-storage-portal.md#create-storage-account-with-a-private-endpoint)
to create a storage account with private endpoint. Ensure to select **Yes** to integration with
private DNS zone. Select an already created DNS zone or create a new one.

## Grant required permissions to the vault

If your virtual machines are using managed disks, you need to grant the managed identity permissions
only to the cache storage accounts. In case the virtual machines are using unmanaged disks, you need
to grant the managed identity permissions for source, cache, and target storage accounts. In this
case, you need to create the target storage account in advance.

Before enabling replication of virtual machines, the managed identity of the vault must have the
following role permissions depending on the type of storage account:

- Resource Manager based storage accounts (Standard Type):
  - [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor)
  - [Storage Blob Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-contributor)
- Resource Manager based storage accounts (Premium Type):
  - [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor)
  - [Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-owner)
- Classic storage accounts:
  - [Classic Storage Account Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#classic-storage-account-contributor)
  - [Classic Storage Account Key Operator Service Role](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#classic-storage-account-key-operator-service-role)

The following steps describe how to add a role assignment to your storage accounts, one at a time. For detailed steps, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.yml).

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the cache storage account you created.

1. Select **Access control (IAM)**.

1. Select **Add > Add role assignment**.

   :::image type="content" source="~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/media/role-based-access-control/add-role-assignment-menu-generic.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Access control (IAM) page with Add role assignment menu open.":::

1. On the **Role** tab, select one of the roles listed in the beginning of this section.

1. On the **Members** tab, select **Managed identity**, and then select **Select members**.

1. Select your Azure subscription.

1. Select **System-assigned managed identity**, search for a vault, and then select it.

1. On the **Review + assign** tab, select **Review + assign** to assign the role.

In addition to these permissions, you need to allow access to Microsoft trusted services. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Firewalls and virtual networks**.

1. In **Exceptions**, select **Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account**.

## Protect your virtual machines

Once all the above configurations are completed, continue with enabling replication for your virtual
machines. All of the Site Recovery operations work without any additional steps if DNS integration
was used while creating private endpoints on the vault. However, if the DNS zones are manually
created and configured, you need additional steps to add specific DNS records in both source and
target DNS zones after enabling the replication. For details and steps, see
[Create private DNS zones and add DNS records manually](#create-private-dns-zones-and-add-dns-records-manually).

## Create private DNS zones and add DNS records manually

If you didn't select the option to integrate with private DNS zone at the time of creating private
endpoint for the vault, follow the steps in this section.

Create one private DNS zone to allow the mobility agent to resolve private link fully qualified
domain names to private IPs.

1. Create a private DNS zone

   1. Search for "Private DNS zone" in the **All services** search bar and select "Private DNS
      zones" from the drop-down.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication-private-endpoints/search-private-dns-zone.png" alt-text="Shows searching for 'private dns zone' on new resources page in the Azure portal.":::

   1. Once on the "Private DNS zones" page, select the **\+Add** button to start creating a new
      zone.

   1. On the "Create private DNS zone" page, fill in the required details. Enter the name of the
      private DNS zone as `privatelink.siterecovery.windowsazure.com`. You can choose any resource
      group and any subscription to create it.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication-private-endpoints/create-private-dns-zone.png" alt-text="Shows the Basics tab of the Create Private DNS zone page and related project details in the Azure portal.":::

   1. Continue to the **Review \+ create** tab to review and create the DNS zone.

1. Link private DNS zone to your virtual network

   The private DNS zones created above must now be linked to the virtual network where your servers
   currently are. You also need to link the private DNS zone to the target virtual network in
   advance.

   1. Go to the private DNS zone that you created in the previous step and navigate to **Virtual
      network links** on the left side of the page. Once there, select the **\+Add** button.

   1. Fill in the required details. The **Subscription** and **Virtual network** fields must be
      filled with the corresponding details of the virtual network where your servers exist. The
      other fields must be left as is.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication-private-endpoints/add-virtual-network-link.png" alt-text="Shows the page to add a virtual network link with the link name, subscription, and related virtual network in the Azure portal.":::

1. Add DNS records

   Once you've created the required private DNS zones and the private endpoints, you need to add DNS
   records to your DNS zones.

   > [!NOTE]
   > In case you are using a custom private DNS zone, make sure that similar entries are made as
   > discussed below.

   This step requires you to make entries for each fully qualified domain name in your private
   endpoint into your private DNS zone.

   1. Go to your private DNS zone and navigate to the **Overview** section on the left side of the
      page. Once there, select **\+Record set** to start adding records.

   1. In the "Add record set" page that opens, add an entry for each fully qualified domain name and
      private IP as an _A_ type record. The list of fully qualified domain names and IPs can be
      obtained from the "Private Endpoint" page in **Overview**. As shown in the example below, the
      first fully qualified domain name from the private endpoint is added to the record set in the
      private DNS zone.

      These fully qualified domain names match the pattern:
      `{Vault-ID}-asr-pod01-{type}-.{target-geo-code}.privatelink.siterecovery.windowsazure.com`

      :::image type="content" source="./media/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication-private-endpoints/add-record-set.png" alt-text="Shows the page to add a DNS A type record for the fully qualified domain name to the private endpoint in the Azure portal.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > After you enable replication, two more fully qualified domain names are created on the private endpoints in both regions. Ensure that you add the DNS records for these newly created fully qualified domain names as well.
   > Static IP for Azure Site Recovery private endpoint is not supported.
