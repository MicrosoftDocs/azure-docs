# Automate Mobility Service installation

> [!CAUTION]
> This article references CentOS, a Linux distribution that is End Of Life (EOL) status. Please consider your use and plan accordingly. For more information, see the [CentOS End Of Life guidance](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/centos/centos-end-of-life).

This article describes how to automate installation and updates for the Mobility Service agent in [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md).

When you deploy Site Recovery for disaster recovery of on-premises VMware VMs and physical servers to Azure, you install the Mobility Service agent on each machine you want to replicate. The Mobility Service captures data writes on the machine, and forwards them to the Site Recovery process server for replication. You can deploy the Mobility Service in a few ways:

- **Push installation**: Let Site Recovery install  the Mobility service agent when you enable replication for a machine in the Azure portal.
- **Manual installation**: Install the Mobility service manually on each machine. [Learn more](vmware-physical-mobility-service-overview.md) about push and manual installation.
- **Automated deployment**: Automate installation with software deployment tools such as Microsoft Configuration Manager, or third-party tools such as JetPatch. [Learn more](vmware-physical-mobility-service-overview.md)

Automated installation and updating provides a solution if:

- Your organization doesn't allow for push installation on protected servers.
- Your company policy requires passwords to be changed periodically. You have to specify a password for the push installation.
- Your security policy doesn't permit adding firewall exceptions for specific machines.
- You're acting as a hosting service provider and don't want to provide customer machine credentials that are needed for push installation with Site Recovery.
- You need to scale agent installations to lots of servers simultaneously.
- You want to schedule installations and upgrades during planned maintenance windows.

## Prerequisites

To automate the installation, you need the following items:

- A deployed software installation solution such as [Configuration Manager](/configmgr/) or [JetPatch](https://jetpatch.com/microsoft-azure-site-recovery/).
- Deployment prerequisites in place in [Azure](tutorial-prepare-azure.md) and [on-premises](vmware-azure-tutorial-prepare-on-premises.md) for VMware disaster recovery, or for [physical server](physical-azure-disaster-recovery.md) disaster recovery. Review the [support requirements](vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix.md) for disaster recovery.

## Prepare for automated deployment

The following table summarizes tools and processes for automating Mobility Service deployment.

**Tool** | **Details** | **Instructions**
--- | --- | ---
**Configuration Manager** | 1. Verify that you have the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) listed above in place. <br/><br/> 2. Deploy disaster recovery by setting up the source environment, including downloading an OVA file to deploy the Site Recovery configuration server as a VMware VM using an OVF template.<br/><br/> 3. You register the configuration server with the Site Recovery service, set up the target Azure environment, and configure a replication policy.<br/><br/> 4. For automated Mobility Service deployment, you create a network share containing the configuration server passphrase and Mobility Service installation files.<br/><br/> 5. You create a Configuration Manager package containing the installation or updates, and prepare for Mobility Service deployment.<br/><br/> 6. You can then enable replication to Azure for the machines that have the Mobility Service installed. | [Automate with Configuration Manager](#automate-with-configuration-manager)
**JetPatch** | 1. Verify that you have the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) listed above in place. <br/><br/> 2. Deploy disaster recovery by setting up the source environment, including downloading and deploying JetPatch Agent Manager for Azure Site Recovery in your Site Recovery environment, using an OVF template.<br/><br/> 3. You register the configuration server with Site Recovery, set up the target Azure environment, and configure a replication policy.<br/><br/> 4. For automated deployment, initialize and complete the JetPatch Agent Manager configuration.<br/><br/> 5. In JetPatch you can create a Site Recovery policy to automate deployment and upgrade of the Mobility Service agent. <br/><br/> 6. You can then enable replication to Azure for the machines that have the Mobility Service installed. | [Automate with JetPatch Agent Manager](https://jetpatch.com/microsoft-azure-site-recovery-deployment-guide/)<br/><br/> [Troubleshoot agent installation in JetPatch](https://kc.jetpatch.com/hc/articles/360035981812)

## Automate with Configuration Manager

### Prepare the installation files

1. Make sure you have the prerequisites in place.
1. Create a secure network file share (SMB share) that can be accessed by the machine running the configuration server.
1. In Configuration Manager, [categorize the servers](/sccm/core/clients/manage/collections/automatically-categorize-devices-into-collections) on which you want to install or update the Mobility Service. One collection should contain all Windows servers, the other all Linux servers.
1. On the network share, create a folder:

   - For installation on Windows machines, create a folder named _MobSvcWindows_.
   - For installation on Linux machines, create a folder named _MobSvcLinux_.

1. Sign in to the configuration server machine.
1. On the configuration server machine, open an administrative command prompt.
1. To generate the passphrase file, run this command:

    ```Console
    cd %ProgramData%\ASR\home\svsystems\bin
    genpassphrase.exe -v > MobSvc.passphrase
    ```

1. Copy the _MobSvc.passphrase_ file to the Windows folder and the Linux folder.
1. To browse to the folder that contains the installation files, run this command:

    ```Console
    cd %ProgramData%\ASR\home\svsystems\pushinstallsvc\repository
    ```

1. Copy these installation files to the network share:

   - For Windows, copy _Microsoft-ASR_UA_version_Windows_GA_date_Release.exe_ to _MobSvcWindows_.
   - For Linux, copy the following files to _MobSvcLinux_:
     - _Microsoft-ASR_UARHEL6-64release.tar.gz_
     - _Microsoft-ASR_UARHEL7-64release.tar.gz_
     - _Microsoft-ASR_UASLES11-SP3-64release.tar.gz_
     - _Microsoft-ASR_UASLES11-SP4-64release.tar.gz_
     - _Microsoft-ASR_UAOL6-64release.tar.gz_
     - _Microsoft-ASR_UAUBUNTU-14.04-64release.tar.gz_

1. As described in the following procedures, copy the code to the Windows or Linux folders. We're assuming that:

   - The configuration server's IP address is `192.168.3.121`.
   - The secure network file share is `\\ContosoSecureFS\MobilityServiceInstallers`.

### Copy code to the Windows folder

Copy the following code:

- Save the code in the _MobSvcWindows_ folder as _install.bat_.
- Replace the `[CSIP]` placeholders in this script with the actual values of the IP address of your configuration server.
- The script supports new installations of the Mobility Service agent, and updates to agents that are already installed.

REM ==== Check if Mob Svc is already installed =======
REM ==== If not installed no operation required ========
REM ==== Else run uninstall command =====================
REM ==== {275197FC-14FD-4560-A5EB-38217F80CBD1} is ====
REM ==== guid for Mob Svc Installer ====================
whoami >> C:\logfile.log
NET START | FIND "InMage Scout Application Service"
IF  %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 1 (GOTO :INSTALL) ELSE GOTO :UNINSTALL
:NOOPERATION
                echo "No Operation Required." >> c:\logfile.log
                GOTO :ENDSCRIPT
:UNINSTALL
                echo "Uninstall" >> C:\logfile.log
                MsiExec.exe /qn /x {275197FC-14FD-4560-A5EB-38217F80CBD1} /L+*V "C:\ProgramData\ASRSetupLogs\UnifiedAgentMSIUninstall.log"
:ENDSCRIPT
```
