# About the Mobility service for VMware VMs and physical servers

When you set up disaster recovery for VMware virtual machines (VM) and physical servers using [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md), you install the Site Recovery Mobility service on each on-premises VMware VM and physical server. The Mobility service captures data, writes on the machine, and forwards them to the Site Recovery process server. The Mobility service is installed by the Mobility service agent software that you can deploy using the following methods:

- [Push installation](#push-installation): When protection is enabled via the Azure portal, Site Recovery installs the Mobility service on the server.
- Manual installation: You can install the Mobility service manually on each machine through the [user interface (UI)](#install-the-mobility-service-using-ui-classic) or [command prompt](#install-the-mobility-service-using-command-prompt-classic).
- [Automated deployment](vmware-azure-mobility-install-configuration-mgr.md): You can automate the Mobility service installation with software deployment tools such as Configuration Manager.

> [!NOTE]
> The Mobility service uses approximately 6%-10% of memory on source machines for VMware VMs or physical machines.

## Antivirus on replicated machines

If machines that you want to replicate are running antivirus software, exclude the Mobility service's installation folder _C:\ProgramData\ASR\agent_ from antivirus operations. This exclusion ensures that replication works as expected.

## Push installation

Push installation is an integral part of the job that runs from the Azure portal to [enable replication](vmware-azure-enable-replication.md#enable-replication). After choosing the set of VMs you wish to protect and enable replication, the configuration server pushes the Mobility service agent to the servers, installs the agent, and completes the agent's registration with the configuration server.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that all push installation [prerequisites](vmware-azure-install-mobility-service.md) are met.
- Ensure that all server configurations meet the criteria in the [Support matrix for disaster recovery of VMware VMs and physical servers to Azure](vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix.md).
- From 9.36 version onwards, ensure the latest installer for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP4, RHEL 5, Debian 7, Debian 8, Ubuntu 14.04 is [available on the configuration server and scale-out process server](#download-latest-mobility-agent-installer-for-suse-11-sp3-suse-11-sp4-rhel-5-cent-os-5-debian-7-debian-8-debian-9-oracle-linux-6-and-ubuntu-1404-server).
- From 9.52 version onwards, ensure the latest installer for Debian 9, is [available on the configuration server and scale-out process server](#download-latest-mobility-agent-installer-for-suse-11-sp3-suse-11-sp4-rhel-5-cent-os-5-debian-7-debian-8-debian-9-oracle-linux-6-and-ubuntu-1404-server).

The push installation workflow is described in the following sections:

### Mobility service agent version 9.23 and later

For more information about version 9.23, see [Update Rollup 35 for Azure Site Recovery](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4494485/update-rollup-35-for-azure-site-recovery).

During a push installation of the Mobility service, the following steps are performed:

1. The agent is pushed to the source machine. Copying the agent to the source machine can fail due to multiple environmental errors. Refer to [our guidance](vmware-azure-troubleshoot-push-install.md) to troubleshoot push installation failures.
1. After the agent is successfully copied to the server, a prerequisite check is performed on the server.
   - If all prerequisites are met, the installation begins.
   - If one or more [prerequisites](vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix.md) aren't met, the installation fails.
1. As part of the agent installation, the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) provider for Azure Site Recovery is installed. The VSS provider is used to generate application-consistent recovery points. If installation of the VSS provider fails, this step is skipped and the agent installation continues.
1. If the agent installation succeeds but the VSS provider installation fails, then the job status is marked as **Warning**. This doesn't impact crash-consistent recovery point generation.

    - To generate application-consistent recovery points, refer to [our guidance](vmware-physical-manage-mobility-service.md#install-site-recovery-vss-provider-on-source-machine) to complete a manual installation of the Site Recovery VSS provider.
    - If you don't want to generate application-consistent recovery points, [modify the replication policy](vmware-azure-set-up-replication.md#create-a-policy) to turn off application-consistent recovery points.

### Mobility service agent version 9.22 and older

1. The agent is pushed to the source machine. Copying the agent to the source machine can fail due to multiple environmental errors. Refer to [our guidance](vmware-azure-troubleshoot-push-install.md) to troubleshoot push installation failures.
1. After the agent is successfully copied to the server, a prerequisite check is performed on the server.
   - If all prerequisites are met, the installation begins.
   - The installation fails if one or more of the [prerequisites](vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix.md) aren't met.

1. As part of the agent installation, the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) provider for Azure Site Recovery is installed. The VSS provider is used to generate application-consistent recovery points.
   - If the VSS provider installation fails, the agent installation fails. To avoid failure of the agent installation, use [version 9.23](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4494485/update-rollup-35-for-azure-site-recovery) or higher to generate crash-consistent recovery points and do a manual install of the VSS provider.

### Mobility service agent version 9.55 and later

1. The modernized architecture of mobility agent is set as default for the version 9.55 and above. Follow the instructions [here](#install-the-mobility-service-using-ui-modernized) to install the agent.
2. To install the modernized architecture of mobility agent on versions 9.54 and above, follow the instructions [here](#install-the-mobility-service-using-command-prompt-modernized).

## Azure Virtual Machine agent

- **Windows VMs**: From version 9.7.0.0 of the Mobility service, the [Azure VM agent](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/features-windows#azure-vm-agent) is installed by the Mobility service installer. This ensures that when the machine fails over to Azure, the Azure VM meets the agent installation prerequisite for using any VM extension.
- **Linux VMs**: The  [WALinuxAgent](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/update-linux-agent) is automatically installed on the Azure VM after failover.

## Locate installer files

On the configuration server, go to the folder _%ProgramData%\ASR\home\svsystems\pushinstallsvc\repository_. Check which installer you need based on the operating system. The following table summarizes the installer files for each VMware VM and physical server operating system. Before you begin, you can review the [supported operating systems](vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix.md#replicated-machines).

> [!NOTE]
> The file names use the syntax shown in the following table with _version_ and _date_ as placeholders for the real values. The actual file names will look similar to these examples:
> - `Microsoft-ASR_UA_9.30.0.0_Windows_GA_22Oct2019_release.exe`
