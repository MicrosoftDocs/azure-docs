# Manage the configuration server for physical server disaster recovery

You set up an on-premises configuration server when you use the [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md) service for disaster recovery of physical servers to Azure. The configuration server coordinates communications between on-premises machines and Azure, and manages data replication. This article summarizes common tasks for managing the configuration server after it's been deployed.

## Download the latest installation file

The latest version of the configuration server installation file is available in the Site Recovery portal. Additionally, it can be downloaded directly from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://aka.ms/unifiedsetup).

1. Log on to the Azure portal and browse to your Recovery Services Vault.
2. Browse to **Site Recovery Infrastructure** > **Configuration Servers** (under For VMware & Physical Machines).
3. Click the **+Servers** button.
4. On the **Add Server** page, click the Download button to download the Registration key. You need this key during the Configuration Server installation to register it with Azure Site Recovery service.
5. Click the **Download the Microsoft Azure Site Recovery Unified Setup** link to download the latest version of the Configuration Server.

   ![Download Page](./media/physical-manage-configuration-server/downloadcs.png)


## Install and register the server

1. Run the Unified Setup installation file.
2. In **Before You Begin**, select **Install the configuration server and process server**.

    ![Before you start](./media/physical-manage-configuration-server/combined-wiz1.png)

3. In **Third Party Software License**, click **I Accept** to download and install MySQL.
4. In **Internet Settings**, specify how the Provider running on the configuration server connects to Azure Site Recovery over the Internet. Make sure you've allowed the required URLs.

    - If you want to connect with the proxy that's currently set up on the machine, select **Connect to Azure Site Recovery using a proxy server**.
    - If you want the Provider to connect directly, select **Connect directly to Azure Site Recovery without a proxy server**.
    - If the existing proxy requires authentication, or if you want to use a custom proxy for the Provider connection, select **Connect with custom proxy settings**, and specify the address, port, and credentials.
     ![Firewall](./media/physical-manage-configuration-server/combined-wiz4.png)
6. In **Prerequisites Check**, Setup runs a check to make sure that installation can run. If a warning appears about the **Global time sync check**, verify that the time on the system clock (**Date and Time** settings) is the same as the time zone.

    ![Prerequisites](./media/physical-manage-configuration-server/combined-wiz5.png)
7. In **MySQL Configuration**, create credentials for logging on to the MySQL server instance that is installed.

    ![MySQL](./media/physical-manage-configuration-server/combined-wiz6.png)
8. In **Environment Details**, select whether you're going to replicate VMware VMs. If you are, then Setup checks that PowerCLI 6.0 is installed.
9. In **Install Location**, select where you want to install the binaries and store the cache. The drive you select must have at least 5 GB of disk space available, but we recommend a cache drive with at least 600 GB of free space.

    ![Install location](./media/physical-manage-configuration-server/combined-wiz8.png)
10. In **Network Selection**, first select the NIC that the in-built process server uses for discovery and push installation of mobility service on source machines, and then select the NIC that Configuration Server uses for connectivity with Azure. Port 9443 is the default port used for sending and receiving replication traffic, but you can modify this port number to suit your environment's requirements. In addition to the port 9443, we also open port 443, which is used by a web server to orchestrate replication operations. Do not use port 443 for sending or receiving replication traffic.

    ![Network selection](./media/physical-manage-configuration-server/combined-wiz9.png)


11. In **Summary**, review the information and click **Install**. When installation finishes, a passphrase is generated. You will need this when you enable replication, so copy it and keep it in a secure location.


After registration finishes, the server is displayed on the **Settings** > **Servers** blade in the vault.

    ```

## Upgrade a configuration server

You run update rollups to update the configuration server. Updates can be applied for up to N-4 versions. For example:

- If you're running 9.7, 9.8, 9.9, or 9.10 - you can upgrade directly to 9.11.
- If you're running 9.6 or earlier, and you want to upgrade to 9.11, you must first upgrade to version 9.7. before  9.11.

Links to update rollups for upgrading to all versions of the configuration server are available in the [wiki updates page](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/38544.azure-site-recovery-service-updates.aspx).

Upgrade the server as follows:

1. Download the update installer file to the configuration server.
2. Double-click to run the installer.
3. The installer detects the current version running on the machine.
4. Click **OK** to confirm, and run the upgrade. 


## Delete or unregister a configuration server

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure the following before you start decommissioning your Configuration Server.
> 1. [Disable protection](site-recovery-manage-registration-and-protection.md#disable-protection-for-a-vmware-vm-or-physical-server-vmware-to-azure) for all virtual machines under this Configuration Server.
> 2. [Disassociate](vmware-azure-set-up-replication.md#disassociate-or-delete-a-replication-policy) and [Delete](vmware-azure-set-up-replication.md#disassociate-or-delete-a-replication-policy) all Replication policies from the Configuration Server.
> 3. [Delete](vmware-azure-manage-vcenter.md#delete-a-vcenter-server) all vCenters servers/vSphere hosts that are associated to the Configuration Server.


### Delete the Configuration Server from Azure portal

   ```

## Delete or unregister a configuration server (PowerShell)

1. [Install](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) Azure PowerShell module
2. Login into to your Azure account using the command
    
    `Connect-AzAccount –UseDeviceAuthentication`
3. Select the subscription under which the vault is present

     `Get-AzSubscription –SubscriptionName <your subscription name> | Select–AzSubscription`
3.  Now set up your vault context
    
    ```powershell
    $vault = Get–AzRecoveryServicesVault –Name <name of your vault>
    Set-AzRecoveryServicesAsrVaultContext –Vault $vault
    ```
4. Get select your configuration server

    `$Fabric = Get–AzRecoveryServicesAsrFabric –FriendlyName <name of your configuration server>`
6. Delete the Configuration Server

    `Remove–AzRecoveryServicesAsrFabric –Fabric $Fabric –Force`

> [!NOTE]
> The **-Force** option in the Remove-AzRecoveryServicesAsrFabric can be used to force the removal/deletion of the Configuration server.

## Renew TLS/SSL certificates
The configuration server has an inbuilt web server, which orchestrates activities of the Mobility service, process servers, and master target servers connected to it. The web server uses a TLS/SSL certificate to authenticate clients. The certificate expires after three years, and can be renewed at any time.

### Check expiry

For configuration server deployments before May 2016, certificate expiry was set to one year. If you have a certificate is going to expire, the following occurs:

- When the expiry date is two months or less, the service starts sending notifications in the portal, and by email (if you subscribed to Azure Site Recovery notifications).
- A notification banner appears on the vault resource page. Click the banner for more details.
- If you see an **Upgrade Now** button, this indicates that there are some components in your environment that haven't been upgraded to 9.4.xxxx.x or higher versions. Upgrade components before you renew the certificate. You can't renew on older versions.

### Renew the certificate

1. In the vault, open **Site Recovery Infrastructure** > **Configuration Server**, and click the required configuration server.
2. The expiry date appears under **Configuration Server health**
3. Click **Renew Certificates**.
