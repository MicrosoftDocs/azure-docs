# Fail over Hyper-V VMs to Azure

This tutorial describes how to fail over Hyper-V VMs to Azure with [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md). After you've failed over, you fail back to your on-premises site when it's available. In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Verify the Hyper-V VM properties to check conform with Azure requirements.
> * Fail over specific VMs to Azure.


This tutorial is the fifth tutorial in a series. It assumes that you have already completed the tasks in the previous tutorials.    

1. [Prepare Azure](tutorial-prepare-azure.md)
2. [Prepare on-premises Hyper-V](./hyper-v-prepare-on-premises-tutorial.md)
3. Set up disaster recovery for [Hyper-V VMs](./hyper-v-azure-tutorial.md), or for [Hyper-V VMs managed in System Center VMM clouds](./hyper-v-vmm-azure-tutorial.md)
4. [Run a disaster recovery drill](tutorial-dr-drill-azure.md)

[Learn about](failover-failback-overview.md#types-of-failover) different types of failover. If you want to fail over multiple VMs in a recovery plan, review [this article](site-recovery-failover.md).

## Prepare for failover 
Make sure there are no snapshots on the VM, and that the on-premises VM is turned off during failback. It helps ensure data consistency during replication. Don't turn on on-premises VM during failback. 

Failover and failback have three stages:

1. **Failover to Azure**: Failover Hyper-V VMs from the on-premises site to Azure.
2. **Failback to on-premises**: Failover Azure VMs to your on-premises site when the on-premises site is available. It starts synchronizing data from Azure to on-premises and on completion, it brings up the VMs on on-premises.  
3. **Reverse replicate on-premises VMs**: After failed back to on-premises, reverse replicate the on-premises VMs to start replicating them to Azure.

## Verify VM properties

Before failover verify the VM properties, and make sure that the VM meets with [Azure requirements](hyper-v-azure-support-matrix.md#replicated-vms).

In **Protected Items**, click **Replicated Items** > VM.

1. In the **Replicated item** pane, there's a summary of VM information, health status, and the
   latest available recovery points. Click **Properties** to view more details.

1. In **Compute and Network**, you can modify the Azure name, resource group, target size,
   [availability set](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-availability-sets), and managed disk settings.

1. You can view and modify network settings, including the network/subnet in which the Azure VM
   will be located after failover, and the IP address that will be assigned to it.

1. In **Disks**, you can see information about the operating system and data disks on the VM.

## Fail over to Azure

1. In **Settings** > **Replicated items**, click the VM > **Failover**.
2. In **Failover**, select the **Latest** recovery point. 
3. Select **Shut down machine before beginning failover**. Site Recovery attempts to do a shutdown of source VMs before triggering the failover. Failover continues even if shutdown fails. You
   can follow the failover progress on the **Jobs** page.
4. After you verify the failover, click **Commit**. It deletes all the available recovery points.

> [!WARNING]
> **Don't cancel a failover in progress**: If you cancel in progress, failover stops, but the VM won't replicate again.

## Connect to failed-over VM

1. If you want to connect to Azure VMs after failover by using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Secure Shell (SSH), [verify that the requirements have been met](failover-failback-overview.md#connect-to-azure-after-failover).
2. After failover, go to the VM and validate by [connecting](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/connect-logon) to it.
3. Use **Change recovery point** if you want to use a different recovery point after failover. After you commit the failover in the next step, this option will no longer be available.
4. After validation, select **Commit** to finalize the recovery point of the VM after failover.
5. After you commit, all the other available recovery points are deleted. This step completes the failover.

>[!TIP]
> If you encounter any connectivity issues after failover, follow the [troubleshooting guide](site-recovery-failover-to-azure-troubleshoot.md).


## Next steps

After failover, reprotect the Azure VMs so that they replicate from Azure to on-premises. Then, after the VMs are reprotected and replicating to the on-premises site, fail back from Azure when you're ready.
