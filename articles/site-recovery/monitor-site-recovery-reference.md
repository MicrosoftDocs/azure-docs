# Azure Site Recovery monitoring data reference

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-intro](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-intro.md)]

See [Monitor Azure Site Recovery](monitor-site-recovery.md) for details on the data you can collect for Azure Site Recovery and how to use it.

## Metrics

There are no automatically collected metrics for Azure Site Recovery. All the automatically collected metrics for the `Microsoft.RecoveryServices/Vaults` namespace are for the Azure Backup service. For information about Azure Backup metrics, see [Monitor Azure Backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-monitoring-built-in-monitor).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-resource-logs](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-resource-logs.md)]

### Supported resource logs for Microsoft.RecoveryServices/Vaults

Note that some of the following logs apply to Azure Backup and others apply to Azure Site Recovery, as noted in the **Category display name** column.

### Event logs available for Azure Site Recovery

Azure Site Recovery provides the following resource-specific and legacy tables. Each event provides detailed data on a specific set of site recovery related artifacts.

**Resource-specific tables**:

- [AzureSiteRecoveryJobs](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/asrjobs)
- [ASRReplicatedItems](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/ASRReplicatedItems)

**Legacy tables**:

- Azure Site Recovery Events
- Azure Site Recovery Replicated Items  
- Azure Site Recovery Replication Stats
- Azure Site Recovery Points
- Azure Site Recovery Replication Data Upload Rate
- Azure Site Recovery Protected Disk Data Churn
- Azure Site Recovery Replicated Item Details

## Log Analytics data model

This section describes the Log Analytics data model for Azure Site Recover that's added to the Azure Diagnostics table (if your vaults are configured with diagnostics settings to send data to a Log Analytics workspace in Azure Diagnostics mode). You can use this data model to write queries on Log Analytics data to create custom alerts or reporting dashboards.

To understand the fields of each Site Recovery table in Log Analytics, review the details for the Azure Site Recovery Replicated Item Details and Azure Site Recovery Jobs tables. You can find information about the [diagnostic tables](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics).
