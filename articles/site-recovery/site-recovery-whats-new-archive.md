[Update rollup 35](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4494485/update-rollup-35-for-azure-site-recovery) provides the following updates.

**Update** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Providers and agents** | An update to Site Recovery agents and providers (as detailed in the rollup)
**Issue fixes/improvements** | A number of fixes and improvements (as detailed in the rollup)

### VMware/physical server disaster recovery

Features added this month are summarized in the table.

**Feature** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Managed disks** | Replication of on-premises VMware VMs and physical servers is now directly to managed disks in Azure. On-premises data is sent to a cache storage account in Azure, and recovery points are created in managed disks in the target location. This ensures you don't need to manage multiple target storage accounts.
**Configuration server** | Site Recovery now supports configuration servers with multiple NICs. Add additional adapters to the configuration server VM before you register the configuration server in the vault. If you add afterwards, you need to re-register the server in the vault.


## Updates (February 2019)

### Azure VM disaster recovery

Features added this month are summarized in the table.

**Feature** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Network mapping** | For Azure VM disaster recovery, you can now use any available target network when you enable replication.
**Standard SSD** | You can now set up disaster recovery for Azure VMs using [Standard SSD disks](/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#standard-ssds).
**Storage Spaces Direct** | You can set up disaster recovery for apps running on Azure VM apps by using [Storage Spaces Direct](/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-direct-overview) for high availability.  Using Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) together with Site Recovery provides comprehensive protection of Azure VM workloads. S2D lets you host a guest cluster in Azure. This is especially useful when a VM hosts a critical application, such as SAP ASCS layer, SQL Server, or scale-out file server.


### VMware/physical server disaster recovery

Features added this month are summarized in the table.

**Feature** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Linux BTRFS file system** | Site Recovery now supports replication of VMware VMs with the BTRFS file system. Replication isn't supported if:<br/><br/>- The BTRFS file system subvolume is changed after enabling replication.<br/><br/>- The file system is spread over multiple disks.<br/><br/>- The BTRFS file system supports RAID.
**Windows Server 2019** | Support added for machines running Windows Server 2019.


## Updates (January 2019)


### Accelerated networking (Azure VMs)

Accelerated networking enables single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to a VM, improving networking performance. When you enable replication for an Azure VM, Site Recovery detects whether accelerated networking is enabled. If it is, after failover Site Recovery automatically configures accelerated networking on the target replica Azure VM, for both [Windows](../virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-powershell.md#enable-accelerated-networking-on-existing-vms) and [Linux](../virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli.md#enable-accelerated-networking-on-existing-vms).

### VMware VMs/physical servers replication

Features added this month are summarized in the table.

**Feature** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Linux support** |  Support was added for Oracle Linux 6.8, Oracle Linux 6.9 and Oracle Linux 7.0 with the Red Hat Compatible Kernel, and for the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) Release 5.
**LVM** | Support added for LVM and LVM2 volumes.<br/><br/> The /boot directory on a disk partition and on LVM volumes is now supported.
**Directories** | Support was added for these directories set up as separate partitions, or file systems that aren't on the same system disk:<br/><br/> /(root), /boot, /usr, /usr/local, /var, /etc.
**Windows Server 2008** | Support added for dynamic disks.
**Failover** | Improved failover time for VMware VMs where storvsc and vsbus aren't boot drivers.
**UEFI support** | Azure VMs don't support boot type UEFI. You can now migrate on-premises physical servers with UEFI to Azure with Site Recovery. Site Recovery migrates the server by converting the boot type to BIOS before migration. Site Recovery previously supported this conversion for VMs only. Support is available for physical servers running Windows Server 2012 or later.

### Azure VM disaster recovery

Features added this month are summarized in the table.

**Feature** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Linux support** | Support was added for Oracle Linux 6.8, Oracle Linux 6.9 and Oracle Linux 7.0 with the Red Hat Compatible Kernel, and for the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) Release 5.
**Linux BTRFS file system** | Supported for Azure VMs.
**Azure VMs in availability zones** | You can enable replication to another region for Azure VMs deployed in availability zones. You can now enable replication for an Azure VM, and set the target for failover to a single VM instance, a VM in an availability set, or a VM in an availability zone. The setting doesn't affect replication. [Read](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/disaster-recovery-of-zone-pinned-azure-virtual-machines-to-another-region/) the announcement.
**Firewall-enabled storage (portal/PowerShell)** | Support added for [firewall-enabled storage accounts](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md).<br/><br/> You can replicate Azure VMs with unmanaged disks on firewall-enabled storage accounts to another Azure region for disaster recovery.<br/><br/> You can use firewall-enabled storage accounts as target storage accounts for unmanaged disks.<br/><br/> Supported in portal and using PowerShell.

## Updates (December 2018)

### Automatic updates for the Mobility service (Azure VMs)

Site Recovery added an option for automatic updates to the Mobility service extension. The Mobility service extension is installed on each Azure VM replicated by Site Recovery. When you enable replication, you select whether to allow Site Recovery to manage updates to the extension.

Updates don't require a VM restart, and don't affect replication. [Learn more](azure-to-azure-autoupdate.md).

### Pricing calculator for Azure VM disaster recovery

Disaster Recovery of Azure VMs incurs VM licensing costs, and network and storage costs. Azure provides a [pricing calculator](https://aka.ms/a2a-cost-estimator) to help you figure out these costs. Site Recovery now provides an [example pricing estimate](https://aka.ms/a2a-cost-estimator) that prices a sample deployment based on a three-tier app using six VMs with 12 Standard HDD disks and 6 Premium SSD disks.

- The sample presumes a data change of 10 GB a day for standard, and 20 GB for premium.
- For your particular deployment, you can change the variables to estimate costs.
- You can specify the number of VMs, the number and type of managed disks, and the expected total data change rate expected across the VMs.
- Additionally, you can apply a compression factor to estimate bandwidth costs.
