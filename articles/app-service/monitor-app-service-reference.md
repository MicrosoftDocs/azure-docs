<!-- 
IMPORTANT 
To make this template easier to use, first:
1. Search and replace App Service with the official name of your service.
2. Search and replace app-service with the service name to use in GitHub filenames.-->

<!-- VERSION 3.0 2024_01_01
For background about this template, see https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-monitoring?branch=main -->

<!-- Most services can use the following sections unchanged. All headings are required unless otherwise noted.
The sections use #included text you don't have to maintain, which changes when Azure Monitor functionality changes. Add info into the designated service-specific places if necessary. Remove #includes or template content that aren't relevant to your service.

At a minimum your service should have the following two articles:

1. The primary monitoring article (based on the template monitor-service-template.md)
   - Title: "Monitor App Service"
   - TOC title: "Monitor"
   - Filename: "monitor-app-service.md"

2. A reference article that lists all the metrics and logs for your service (based on this template).
   - Title: "App Service monitoring data reference"
   - TOC title: "Monitoring data reference"
   - Filename: "monitor-app-service-reference.md".

# Azure App Service monitoring data reference

<!-- Intro. Required. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-intro.md)]

See [Monitor Azure App Service](monitor-app-service.md) for details on the data you can collect for Azure App Service and how to use it.

<!-- ## Metrics. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro.md)]

<!-- Repeat the following section for each resource type/namespace in your service. -->
### App Service metrics

<!-- Reviewers - I just linked here instead of including the tables, since linking was being done in the v2.3 template article. But looks like a few namespaces have been added, such as containerapps. I listed all namespaces under Midrosoft.Web and also corrected the links, which were broken -->
This table lists all the automatically collected platform metrics for App Service.

|Metric Type | Resource Provider / Type Namespace<br/> and link to individual metrics |
|-------|-----|
| Container apps | [Microsoft.Web/containerapps](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-web-containerapps-metrics)
| App Service Plans | [Microsoft.Web/serverfarms](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-web-serverfarms-metrics)
| Web apps | [Microsoft.Web/sites](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-web-sites-metrics) |
| Staging slots | [Microsoft.Web/sites/slots](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-web-sites-slots-metrics)
| Static sites | [Microsoft.Web/staticsites](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-web-staticsites-metrics)

| App Service Environment Front-end | [Microsoft.Web/hostingEnvironments/multiRolePools](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-web-hostingenvironments-multirolepools-metrics)
| App Service Environment Worker Pools | [Microsoft.Web/hostingEnvironments/workerPools](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-web-hostingenvironments-workerpools-metrics)

<!-- ### Supported metrics for Microsoft.Web/serverfarms
The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.Web/serverfarms resource type.
<!-- For each ### section:
1. Replace the <ResourceType/namespace> placeholder in the heading and introductory sentence. Example: ### Supported metrics for Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices
2. Find the metrics for the resource type at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/metrics-index#supported-metrics-per-resource-type, which is autogenerated from underlying systems. Either link to the listed metrics page(s), OR #include the metrics table(s).
3. Add any further information after each metric #include or link. -->

<!-- Use either the LINK or INCLUDE option and remove the other option.
- LINK to metrics page. Example: - [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-metrics)
- OR INCLUDE metrics table, starting with the metrics tableheader: 
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader.md)]
<!-- Add the table. Select the link in the metrics index, and on the metric page, select Edit to see the #include link that pulls in the metrics table. Use that link to add the #include, with the following format:
[!INCLUDE [<ResourceType>](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-metrics/includes/<resource-type>-metrics-include.md)].
Example #include: [!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-metrics/includes/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-metrics-include.md)]

<!-- ## Metric dimensions. Required section. -->

<!-- Use one of the following includes, depending on whether you have metrics with dimensions.
- If you have metrics with dimensions, use the following include and list the metrics with dimensions after the include. For an example, see https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/monitor-storage-reference#metrics-dimensions. Questions: email azmondocs@microsoft.com. 
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions.md)]

<!-- ## Azure Monitor Logs tables. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-logs-tables](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-logs-tables.md)]
<!-- Find the table(s) for your service at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/tables-resourcetype. These files are auto generated from the REST API.
NOTE: Also refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics#azure-diagnostics-mode to see whether your service uses the AzureDiagnostics table in Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics. 
Link to the service-specific tables. If your service uses the AzureDiagnostics table, list the fields you use and what they're for. If your service uses both tables, list both types of information. Add any further information after each table link, such as descriptions and usage, or information not found in the tables. Example:
### Storage Accounts
Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts
- [StorageBlobLogs](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/storagebloblogs) -->
