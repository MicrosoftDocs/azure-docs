# Configure your App Service or Azure Functions app to use Google login

[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-authentication](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-authentication.md)]

This topic shows you how to configure Azure App Service or Azure Functions to use Google as an authentication provider.

To complete the procedure in this topic, you must have a Google account that has a verified email address. To create a new Google account, go to [accounts.google.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268302).

## <a name="register"> </a>Register your application with Google

1. Follow the Google documentation at [Sign In with Google for Web - Setup](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/fedcm-migration) to create a client ID and client secret. There's no need to make any code changes. Just use the following information:
    - For **Authorized JavaScript Origins**, use `https://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net` with the name of your app in *\<app-name>*.
    - For **Authorized Redirect URI**, use `https://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/google/callback`.
1. Copy the App ID and the App secret values.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The App secret is an important security credential. Do not share this secret with anyone or distribute it within a client application.

## <a name="secrets"> </a>Add Google information to your application

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal] and navigate to your app.
1. Select **Authentication** in the menu on the left. Click **Add identity provider**.
1. Select **Google** in the identity provider dropdown. Paste in the App ID and App Secret values that you obtained previously.

    The secret will be stored as a slot-sticky [application setting](./configure-common.md#configure-app-settings) named `GOOGLE_PROVIDER_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET`. You can update that setting later to use [Key Vault references](./app-service-key-vault-references.md) if you wish to manage the secret in Azure Key Vault.

1. If this is the first identity provider configured for the application, you will also be prompted with an **App Service authentication settings** section. Otherwise, you may move on to the next step.
    
    These options determine how your application responds to unauthenticated requests, and the default selections will redirect all requests to log in with this new provider. You can change customize this behavior now or adjust these settings later from the main **Authentication** screen by choosing **Edit** next to **Authentication settings**. To learn more about these options, see [Authentication flow](overview-authentication-authorization.md#authentication-flow).

1. Click **Add**.

> [!NOTE]
> For adding scope: You can define what permissions your application has in the provider's registration portal. The app can request scopes at login time which leverage these permissions.

You are now ready to use Google for authentication in your app. The provider will be listed on the **Authentication** screen. From there, you can edit or delete this provider configuration.
