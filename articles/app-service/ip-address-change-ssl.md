# How to prepare for a TLS/SSL IP address change

If you received a notification that the TLS/SSL IP address of your Azure App Service app is changing, follow the instructions in this article to release existing TLS/SSL IP address and assign a new one.

> [!NOTE] 
> Service Endpoint is not currently supported when enabling IP Based SSL on App Service TLS/SSL bindings. 


## Release TLS/SSL IP addresses and assign new ones

1.	Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2.	In the left-hand navigation menu, select **App Services**.

3.	Select your App Service app from the list.

4.	Under the **Settings** header, click **Custom domain** in the left navigation.

5. In the **Custom domains** section, look for the domain with the Binding type of IP Based SSL. Click the three ellipses for that domain and select **Update binding**. In the editor that opens, choose **SNI SSL** for the TLS/SSL type and click **Update**.

6.	In the **Custom domains** section, select the same host name record. In the editor that opens, this time choose **IP Based SSL** for the TLS/SSL type and click **Update**. When you see the operation success message, youâ€™ve acquired a new IP address.

7.	If an A record (DNS record pointing directly to your IP address) is configured in your Domain Registration Portal (third party DNS Provider or Azure DNS), replace the existing IP address with the newly generated one. You can find the new IP address by following the instructions in the next section.

## Find the new SSL IP address in the Azure Portal

1.	Wait a few minutes, and then open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2.	In the left-hand navigation menu, select **App Services**.

3.	Select your App Service app from the list.

4.	Under the **Settings** header, click **Properties** in the left navigation, and find the section labeled **Virtual IP address**.

5. Copy the IP address and reconfigure your domain record or IP mechanism.
