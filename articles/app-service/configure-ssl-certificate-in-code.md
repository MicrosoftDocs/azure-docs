# Use TLS/SSL certificates in your application code

In your application code, you can access the [public or private certificates you add to App Service](configure-ssl-certificate.md). Your app code may act as a client and access an external service that requires certificate authentication, or it may need to perform cryptographic tasks. This how-to guide shows how to use public or private certificates in your application code.

This approach to using certificates in your code makes use of the TLS functionality in App Service, which requires your app to be in **Basic** tier or higher. If your app is in **Free** or **Shared** tier, you can [include the certificate file in your app repository](#load-certificate-from-file).

When you let App Service manage your TLS/SSL certificates, you can maintain the certificates and your application code separately and safeguard your sensitive data.

## Prerequisites

To follow this how-to guide:

- [Create an App Service app](./index.yml)
- [Add a certificate to your app](configure-ssl-certificate.md)

## Find the thumbprint

In the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure portal</a>, from the left menu, select **App Services** > **\<app-name>**.

From the left navigation of your app, select **Certificates**, then select **Bring your own certificates (.pfx)** or **Public key certificates (.cer)**.

Find the certificate you want to use and copy the thumbprint.

## Make the certificate accessible

To access a certificate in your app code, add its thumbprint to the `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` app setting, by running the following command in the <a target="_blank" href="https://shell.azure.com" >Cloud Shell</a>:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES=<comma-separated-certificate-thumbprints>
```

To make all your certificates accessible, set the value to `*`.

> [!NOTE]
> When `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` is set `*`, all previously added certificates are accessible to application code. If you add a certificate to your app later, restart the app to make the new certificate accessible to your app. For more information, see [When updating (renewing) a certificate](#when-updating-renewing-a-certificate).

## Load certificate in Windows apps

The `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` app setting makes the specified certificates accessible to your Windows hosted app in the Windows certificate store, in [Current User\My](/windows-hardware/drivers/install/local-machine-and-current-user-certificate-stores).

In C# code, you access the certificate by the certificate thumbprint. The following code loads a certificate with the thumbprint `E661583E8FABEF4C0BEF694CBC41C28FB81CD870`.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

string certThumbprint = "E661583E8FABEF4C0BEF694CBC41C28FB81CD870";
bool validOnly = false;

using (X509Store certStore = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.CurrentUser))
{
  certStore.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);

  X509Certificate2Collection certCollection = certStore.Certificates.Find(
                              X509FindType.FindByThumbprint,
                              // Replace below with your certificate's thumbprint
                              certThumbprint,
                              validOnly);
  // Get the first cert with the thumbprint
  X509Certificate2 cert = certCollection.OfType<X509Certificate2>().FirstOrDefault();

  if (cert is null)
      throw new Exception($"Certificate with thumbprint {certThumbprint} was not found");

  // Use certificate
  Console.WriteLine(cert.FriendlyName);
  
  // Consider to call Dispose() on the certificate after it's being used, available in .NET 4.6 and later
}
```

In Java code, you access the certificate from the "Windows-MY" store using the Subject Common Name field (see [Public key certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate)). The following code shows how to load a private key certificate:

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import java.security.KeyStore;
import java.security.cert.Certificate;
import java.security.PrivateKey;

...
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance("Windows-MY");
ks.load(null, null); 
Certificate cert = ks.getCertificate("<subject-cn>");
PrivateKey privKey = (PrivateKey) ks.getKey("<subject-cn>", ("<password>").toCharArray());

// Use the certificate and key
...
```

For languages that don't support or offer insufficient support for the Windows certificate store, see [Load certificate from file](#load-certificate-from-file).

## Load certificate from file

If you need to load a certificate file that you upload manually, it's better to upload the certificate using [FTPS](deploy-ftp.md) instead of [Git](deploy-local-git.md), for example. You should keep sensitive data like a private certificate out of source control.

> [!NOTE]
> ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core on Windows must access the certificate store even if you load a certificate from a file. To load a certificate file in a Windows .NET app, load the current user profile with the following command in the <a target="_blank" href="https://shell.azure.com" >Cloud Shell</a>:
>
> ```azurecli-interactive
> az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings WEBSITE_LOAD_USER_PROFILE=1
> ```
>
> This approach to using certificates in your code makes use of the TLS functionality in App Service, which requires your app to be in **Basic** tier or higher.

The following C# example loads a public certificate from a relative path in your app:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

...
var bytes = File.ReadAllBytes("~/<relative-path-to-cert-file>");
var cert = new X509Certificate2(bytes);

// Use the loaded certificate
```

To see how to load a TLS/SSL certificate from a file in Node.js, PHP, Python, or Java, see the documentation for the respective language or web platform.

## Load certificate in Linux/Windows containers

The `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` app setting makes the specified certificates accessible to your Windows or Linux custom containers (including built-in Linux containers) as files. The files are found under the following directories:

| Container platform | Public certificates | Private certificates |
| - | - | - |
| Windows container | `C:\appservice\certificates\public` | `C:\appservice\certificates\private` |
| Linux container | `/var/ssl/certs` | `/var/ssl/private` |

The certificate file names are the certificate thumbprints. 

> [!NOTE]
> App Service inject the certificate paths into Windows containers as the following environment variables `WEBSITE_PRIVATE_CERTS_PATH`, `WEBSITE_INTERMEDIATE_CERTS_PATH`, `WEBSITE_PUBLIC_CERTS_PATH`, and `WEBSITE_ROOT_CERTS_PATH`. It's better to reference the certificate path with the environment variables instead of hardcoding the certificate path, in case the certificate paths change in the future.
>

In addition, [Windows Server Core  and Windows Nano Server containers](configure-custom-container.md#supported-parent-images) load the certificates into the certificate store automatically, in **LocalMachine\My**. To load the certificates, follow the same pattern as [Load certificate in Windows apps](#load-certificate-in-windows-apps). For Windows Nano based containers, use these file paths [Load the certificate directly from file](#load-certificate-from-file).

### [Linux](#tab/linux)

The following C# code shows how to load a public certificate in a Linux app.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

...
var bytes = File.ReadAllBytes("/var/ssl/certs/<thumbprint>.der");
var cert = new X509Certificate2(bytes);

// Use the loaded certificate
```

The following C# code shows how to load a private certificate in a Linux app.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;
...
var bytes = File.ReadAllBytes("/var/ssl/private/<thumbprint>.p12");
var cert = new X509Certificate2(bytes);

// Use the loaded certificate
```

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

The following C# example shows how to load a public certificate in a .NET Framework app in a Windows Server Core Container.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

string certThumbprint = "E661583E8FABEF4C0BEF694CBC41C28FB81CD870";
bool validOnly = false;

using (X509Store certStore = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.LocalMachine))
{
  certStore.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);

  X509Certificate2Collection certCollection = certStore.Certificates.Find(
                              X509FindType.FindByThumbprint,
                              // Replace below with your certificate's thumbprint
                              certThumbprint,
                              validOnly);
  // Get the first cert with the thumbprint
  X509Certificate2 cert = certCollection.OfType<X509Certificate2>().FirstOrDefault();

  if (cert is null)
      throw new Exception($"Certificate with thumbprint {certThumbprint} was not found");

  // Use certificate
  Console.WriteLine(cert.FriendlyName);
  
  // Consider to call Dispose() on the certificate after it's being used, available in .NET 4.6 and later
}
```

The following C# example shows how to load a public certificate in a .NET Core app in a Windows Server Core or Windows Nano Server Container.

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

string Thumbprint = "C0CF730E216F5D690D1834446554DF5DC577A78B";

using X509Store store = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.LocalMachine);
{
    store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);
    
    // Get the first cert with the thumbprint
    var certificate = store.Certificates.OfType<X509Certificate2>()
        .First(c => c.Thumbprint == Thumbprint) ?? throw new Exception($"Certificate with thumbprint {Thumbprint} was not found");

    // Use certificate
    ViewData["certificateDetails"] = certificate.IssuerName.Name.ToString();
}
```

## When updating (renewing) a certificate

When you renew a certificate and add it to your app, it gets a new thumbprint, which also needs to be [made accessible](#make-the-certificate-accessible). How it works depends on your certificate type.

If you manually upload the [public](configure-ssl-certificate.md#upload-a-public-certificate) or [private](configure-ssl-certificate.md#upload-a-private-certificate) certificate:

- If you list thumbprints explicitly in `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES`, add the new thumbprint to the app setting.
- If `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` is set to `*`, restart the app to make the new certificate accessible.

If you renew a certificate [in Key Vault](configure-ssl-certificate.md#renew-a-certificate-imported-from-key-vault), such as with an [App Service certificate](configure-ssl-app-service-certificate.md#renew-an-app-service-certificate), the daily sync from Key Vault makes the necessary update automatically when synchronizing your app with the renewed certificate.

- If `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` contains the old thumbprint of your renewed certificate, the daily sync updates the old thumbprint to the new thumbprint automatically.
- If `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` is set to `*`, the daily sync makes the new certificate accessible automatically.
