# Tutorial: Access Azure services from a JavaScript web app

[!INCLUDE [tutorial-content-above-code](./includes/tutorial-dotnet-storage-managed-identity/introduction.md)]

## Access Blob Storage
The `DefaultAzureCredential` class from [@azure/identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/identity/identity/README.md) package is used to get a token credential for your code to authorize requests to Azure Storage. The `BlobServiceClient` class from [@azure/storage-blob](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/storage/storage-blob) package is used to upload a new blob to storage. Create an instance of the `DefaultAzureCredential` class, which uses the managed identity to fetch tokens and attach them to the blob service client. The following code example gets the authenticated token credential and uses it to create a service client object, which uploads a new blob.

## JavaScript example

```nodejs
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { BlobServiceClient } = require("@azure/storage-blob");
const defaultAzureCredential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

// Some code omitted for brevity.

async function uploadBlob(accountName, containerName, blobName, blobContents) {
    const blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(
        `https://${accountName}.blob.core.windows.net`,
        defaultAzureCredential
    );

    const containerClient = blobServiceClient.getContainerClient(containerName);

    try {
        await containerClient.createIfNotExists();
        const blockBlobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient(blobName);
        const uploadBlobResponse = await blockBlobClient.upload(blobContents, blobContents.length);
        console.log(`Upload block blob ${blobName} successfully`, uploadBlobResponse.requestId);
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
    }
}
```
