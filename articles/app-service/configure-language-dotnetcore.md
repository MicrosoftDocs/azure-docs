# Configure an ASP.NET Core app for Azure App Service

> [!NOTE]
> For ASP.NET in .NET Framework, see [Configure an ASP.NET app for Azure App Service](configure-language-dotnet-framework.md). If your ASP.NET Core app runs in a custom Windows or Linux container, see [Configure a custom container for Azure App Service](configure-custom-container.md).

ASP.NET Core apps must be deployed to Azure App Service as compiled binaries. The Visual Studio publishing tool builds the solution and then deploys the compiled binaries directly. The App Service deployment engine deploys the code repository first and then compiles the binaries.

This guide provides key concepts and instructions for ASP.NET Core developers. If this is your first time using Azure App Service, first follow the [ASP.NET Core quickstart](quickstart-dotnetcore.md) and [ASP.NET Core with SQL Database tutorial](tutorial-dotnetcore-sqldb-app.md).

## Show supported .NET Core runtime versions

In App Service, the Windows instances already have all the supported .NET Core versions installed. To see the .NET Core runtime and SDK versions that are available to you, go to `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole` and run the following command in the browser-based console:

```azurecli-interactive
dotnet --info
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

## Show .NET Core version

To show the current .NET Core version, run the following command in [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --query linuxFxVersion
```

To show all supported .NET Core versions, run the following command in [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp list-runtimes --os linux | grep DOTNET
```

::: zone-end

## Set .NET Core version

::: zone pivot="platform-windows"  

Set the target framework in the project file for your ASP.NET Core project. For more information, see [Select the .NET Core version to use](/dotnet/core/versions/selection).

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

To set the .NET Core version to 8.0, run the following command in [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --linux-fx-version "DOTNETCORE|8.0"
```

::: zone-end

## Customize build automation

If you deploy your app by using Git or ZIP packages [with build automation enabled](deploy-zip.md#enable-build-automation-for-zip-deploy), the App Service build automation follows this sequence:

1. Run custom script if specified by `PRE_BUILD_SCRIPT_PATH`.
1. To restore NuGet dependencies, run `dotnet restore`.
1. To build a binary for production, run `dotnet publish`.
1. Run custom script if specified by `POST_BUILD_SCRIPT_PATH`.

`PRE_BUILD_COMMAND` and `POST_BUILD_COMMAND` are environment variables that are empty by default. To run prebuild commands, define `PRE_BUILD_COMMAND`. To run post-build commands, define `POST_BUILD_COMMAND`.

The following example specifies the two variables to a series of commands, separated by commas.

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings PRE_BUILD_COMMAND="echo foo, scripts/prebuild.sh"
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings POST_BUILD_COMMAND="echo foo, scripts/postbuild.sh"
```

For other environment variables that you can use to customize build automation, see [Oryx configuration](https://github.com/microsoft/Oryx/blob/master/doc/configuration.md).

For more information on how App Service runs and builds ASP.NET Core apps in Linux, see [Oryx documentation: How .NET Core apps are detected and built](https://github.com/microsoft/Oryx/blob/master/doc/runtimes/dotnetcore.md).

## Access environment variables

In App Service, you can [set app settings](configure-common.md#configure-app-settings) outside your app code. You can then access them in any class by using the standard ASP.NET Core dependency injection pattern:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

namespace SomeNamespace 
{
    public class SomeClass
    {
        private IConfiguration _configuration;
    
        public SomeClass(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            _configuration = configuration;
        }
    
        public SomeMethod()
        {
            // retrieve nested App Service app setting
            var myHierarchicalConfig = _configuration["My:Hierarchical:Config:Data"];
            // retrieve App Service connection string
            var myConnString = _configuration.GetConnectionString("MyDbConnection");
        }
    }
}
```

If you configure an app setting with the same name in App Service and in `appsettings.json`, for example, the App Service value takes precedence over the `appsettings.json` value. By using the local `appsettings.json` value, you can debug the app locally, but by using the App Service value, you can run the app in production with production settings. Connection strings work the same way. By using this method, you can keep your application secrets outside your code repository and access the appropriate values without changing your code.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also consider more secure connectivity options that don't require connection secrets. For more information, see [Secure connectivity to Azure services and databases from Azure App Service](tutorial-connect-overview.md).

::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

The [hierarchical configuration data](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/#hierarchical-configuration-data) in `appsettings.json` is accessed by using the `__` (double underscore) delimiter that's standard on Linux to .NET Core. To override a specific hierarchical configuration setting in App Service, set the app setting name with the same delimited format in the key. You can run the following example in [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings My__Hierarchical__Config__Data="some value"
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-windows"

The [hierarchical configuration data](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/#hierarchical-configuration-data) in `appsettings.json` is accessed by using the `:` delimiter that's standard to .NET Core. To override a specific hierarchical configuration setting in App Service, set the app setting name with the same delimited format in the key. You can run the following example in [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings My:Hierarchical:Config:Data="some value"
```
::: zone-end

## Deploy multi-project solutions

When a Visual Studio solution includes multiple projects, the Visual Studio publish process automatically selects the project to deploy. When you deploy to the App Service deployment engine, such as with Git, or with ZIP deploy [with build automation enabled](deploy-zip.md#enable-build-automation-for-zip-deploy), the App Service deployment engine picks the first website or web application project that it finds as the App Service app. You can specify which project App Service should use by specifying the `PROJECT` app setting. For example, run the following command in [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --settings PROJECT="<project-name>/<project-name>.csproj"
```

## Access diagnostic logs

ASP.NET Core offers a [built-in logging provider for App Service](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/#azure-app-service). In your project's `program.cs` file, add the provider to your application through the `ConfigureLogging` extension method, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureLogging(logging =>
        {
            logging.AddAzureWebAppDiagnostics();
        })
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
        });
```

You can then configure and generate logs with the [standard .NET Core pattern](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging).

For more information on troubleshooting ASP.NET Core apps in App Service, see [Troubleshoot ASP.NET Core on Azure App Service and IIS](/aspnet/core/test/troubleshoot-azure-iis).

## Access a detailed exceptions page

When your ASP.NET Core app generates an exception in the Visual Studio debugger, the browser displays a detailed exception page, but in App Service that page is replaced by a generic "HTTP 500" or "An error occurred while processing your request." To display the detailed exception page in App Service, add the `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` app setting to your app by running the following command in <a target="_blank" href="https://shell.azure.com" >Cloud Shell</a>.

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT="Development"
```

## Detect HTTPS session

In App Service, [TLS/SSL termination](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy) happens at the network load balancers, so all HTTPS requests reach your app as unencrypted HTTP requests. If your app logic needs to know if user requests are encrypted, configure the Forwarded Headers Middleware in `Startup.cs`:

- Configure the middleware with [`ForwardedHeadersOptions`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.forwardedheadersoptions) to forward the `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers in `Startup.ConfigureServices`.
- Add private IP address ranges to the known networks, so that the middleware can trust the App Service load balancer.
- Invoke the [`UseForwardedHeaders`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.forwardedheadersextensions.useforwardedheaders) method in `Startup.Configure` before calling other middleware.

When you assemble the three elements, your code looks like the following example:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc();

    services.Configure<ForwardedHeadersOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.ForwardedHeaders =
            ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto;
        // These three subnets encapsulate the applicable Azure subnets. At the moment, it's not possible to narrow it down further.
        options.KnownNetworks.Add(new IPNetwork(IPAddress.Parse("::ffff:10.0.0.0"), 104));
        options.KnownNetworks.Add(new IPNetwork(IPAddress.Parse("::ffff:192.168.0.0"), 112));
        options.KnownNetworks.Add(new IPNetwork(IPAddress.Parse("::ffff:172.16.0.0"), 108));
    });
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseForwardedHeaders();

    ...

    app.UseMvc();
}
```
