# Configure an ASP.NET Core app for Azure App Service

> [!NOTE]
> For ASP.NET in .NET Framework, see [Configure an ASP.NET app for Azure App Service](configure-language-dotnet-framework.md). If your ASP.NET Core app runs in a custom Windows or Linux container, see [Configure a custom container for Azure App Service](configure-custom-container.md).

ASP.NET Core apps must be deployed to Azure App Service as compiled binaries. The Visual Studio publishing tool builds the solution and then deploys the compiled binaries directly, whereas the App Service deployment engine deploys the code repository first and then compiles the binaries.

This guide provides key concepts and instructions for ASP.NET Core developers. If you've never used Azure App Service, follow the [ASP.NET Core quickstart](quickstart-dotnetcore.md) and [ASP.NET Core with SQL Database tutorial](tutorial-dotnetcore-sqldb-app.md) first.

## Show supported .NET Core runtime versions

In App Service, the Windows instances already have all the supported .NET Core versions installed. To show the .NET Core runtime and SDK versions available to you, navigate to `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole` and run the following command in the browser-based console:

```azurecli-interactive
dotnet --info
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

## Show .NET Core version

To show the current .NET Core version, run the following command in the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --query linuxFxVersion
```

To show all supported .NET Core versions, run the following command in the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp list-runtimes --os linux | grep DOTNET
```

::: zone-end

## Set .NET Core version

::: zone pivot="platform-windows"  

Set the target framework in the project file for your ASP.NET Core project. For more information, see [Select the .NET Core version to use](/dotnet/core/versions/selection) in .NET Core documentation.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

Run the following command in the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) to set the .NET Core version to 8.0:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --linux-fx-version "DOTNETCORE|8.0"
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-linux"

## Customize build automation

> [!NOTE]
> Building .NET 9 (STS) apps with Windows App Service using MSBuild or SCM_DO_BUILD is not yet supported. Support for these build scenarios will come after the initial GA date and by December 4th, 2024. Deployments that build outside of App Service through Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps are fully supported.

If you deploy your app using Git, or zip packages [with build automation enabled](deploy-zip.md#enable-build-automation-for-zip-deploy), the App Service build automation steps through the following sequence:

1. Run custom script if specified by `PRE_BUILD_SCRIPT_PATH`.
1. Run `dotnet restore` to restore NuGet dependencies.
1. Run `dotnet publish` to build a binary for production.
1. Run custom script if specified by `POST_BUILD_SCRIPT_PATH`.

`PRE_BUILD_COMMAND` and `POST_BUILD_COMMAND` are environment variables that are empty by default. To run prebuild commands, define `PRE_BUILD_COMMAND`. To run post-build commands, define `POST_BUILD_COMMAND`.

The following example specifies the two variables to a series of commands, separated by commas.

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings PRE_BUILD_COMMAND="echo foo, scripts/prebuild.sh"
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings POST_BUILD_COMMAND="echo foo, scripts/postbuild.sh"
```

For other environment variables to customize build automation, see [Oryx configuration](https://github.com/microsoft/Oryx/blob/master/doc/configuration.md).

For more information on how App Service runs and builds ASP.NET Core apps in Linux, see [Oryx documentation: How .NET Core apps are detected and built](https://github.com/microsoft/Oryx/blob/master/doc/runtimes/dotnetcore.md).

## Access environment variables

In App Service, you can [set app settings](configure-common.md#configure-app-settings) outside of your app code. Then you can access them in any class using the standard ASP.NET Core dependency injection pattern:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

namespace SomeNamespace 
{
    public class SomeClass
    {
        private IConfiguration _configuration;
    
        public SomeClass(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            _configuration = configuration;
        }
    
        public SomeMethod()
        {
            // retrieve nested App Service app setting
            var myHierarchicalConfig = _configuration["My:Hierarchical:Config:Data"];
            // retrieve App Service connection string
            var myConnString = _configuration.GetConnectionString("MyDbConnection");
        }
    }
}
```

If you configure an app setting with the same name in App Service and in *appsettings.json*, for example, the App Service value takes precedence over the *appsettings.json* value. The local *appsettings.json* value lets you debug the app locally, but the App Service value lets you run the app in production with production settings. Connection strings work in the same way. This way, you can keep your application secrets outside of your code repository and access the appropriate values without changing your code.

> [!NOTE]
> Consider more secure connectivity options that don't require connection secrets at all. For more information, see [Secure connectivity to Azure services and databases from Azure App Service](tutorial-connect-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Note the [hierarchical configuration data](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/#hierarchical-configuration-data) in *appsettings.json* is accessed using the `__` (double underscore) delimiter that's standard on Linux to .NET Core. To override a specific hierarchical configuration setting in App Service, set the app setting name with the same delimited format in the key. you can run the following example in the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings My__Hierarchical__Config__Data="some value"
```
::: zone-end

```
::: zone-end

## Deploy multi-project solutions

When a Visual Studio solution includes multiple projects, the Visual Studio publish process already includes selecting the project to deploy. When you deploy to the App Service deployment engine, such as with Git, or with ZIP deploy [with build automation enabled](deploy-zip.md#enable-build-automation-for-zip-deploy), the App Service deployment engine picks the first Web Site or Web Application Project it finds as the App Service app. You can specify which project App Service should use by specifying the `PROJECT` app setting. For example, run the following command in the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --settings PROJECT="<project-name>/<project-name>.csproj"
```

## Access diagnostic logs

ASP.NET Core provides a [built-in logging provider for App Service](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/#azure-app-service). In *Program.cs* of your project, add the provider to your application through the `ConfigureLogging` extension method, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureLogging(logging =>
        {
            logging.AddAzureWebAppDiagnostics();
        })
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
        });
```

You can then configure and generate logs with the [standard .NET Core pattern](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging).

For more information on troubleshooting ASP.NET Core apps in App Service, see [Troubleshoot ASP.NET Core on Azure App Service and IIS](/aspnet/core/test/troubleshoot-azure-iis)

## Get detailed exceptions page

When your ASP.NET Core app generates an exception in the Visual Studio debugger, the browser displays a detailed exception page, but in App Service that page is replaced by a generic **HTTP 500** or **An error occurred while processing your request.** To display the detailed exception page in App Service, Add the `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` app setting to your app by running the following command in the <a target="_blank" href="https://shell.azure.com" >Cloud Shell</a>.

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT="Development"
```

## Detect HTTPS session

In App Service, [TLS/SSL termination](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy) happens at the network load balancers, so all HTTPS requests reach your app as unencrypted HTTP requests. If your app logic needs to know if the user requests are encrypted or not, configure the Forwarded Headers Middleware in *Startup.cs*:

- Configure the middleware with [ForwardedHeadersOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.forwardedheadersoptions) to forward the `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers in `Startup.ConfigureServices`.
- Add private IP address ranges to the known networks, so that the middleware can trust the App Service load balancer.
- Invoke the [UseForwardedHeaders](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.forwardedheadersextensions.useforwardedheaders) method in `Startup.Configure` before calling other middleware.

Putting all three elements together, your code looks like the following example:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc();

    services.Configure<ForwardedHeadersOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.ForwardedHeaders =
            ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto;
        // These three subnets encapsulate the applicable Azure subnets. At the moment, it's not possible to narrow it down further.
        options.KnownNetworks.Add(new IPNetwork(IPAddress.Parse("::ffff:10.0.0.0"), 104));
        options.KnownNetworks.Add(new IPNetwork(IPAddress.Parse("::ffff:192.168.0.0"), 112));
        options.KnownNetworks.Add(new IPNetwork(IPAddress.Parse("::ffff:172.16.0.0"), 108));
    });
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseForwardedHeaders();

    ...

    app.UseMvc();
}
```
