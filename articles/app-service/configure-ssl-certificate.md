# Add and manage TLS/SSL certificates in Azure App Service

You can add digital security certificates to [use in your application code](configure-ssl-certificate-in-code.md) or to [help secure custom Domain Name System (DNS) names](configure-ssl-bindings.md) in [Azure App Service](overview.md). App Service provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service. The certificates are currently called Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates. They were previously known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates. These private or public certificates help you to secure internet connections. The certificates encrypt data sent between your browser, websites that you visit, and the website server.

The following table lists the options for you to add certificates in App Service.

|Option|Description|
|-|-|
| Create a free App Service managed certificate | A private certificate that's free of charge and easy to use if you need to improve security for your [custom domain](app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain.md) in App Service. |
| Import an App Service certificate | Azure manages the private certificate. It combines the simplicity of automated certificate management and the flexibility of renewal and export options. |
| Import a certificate from Azure Key Vault | Useful if you use [Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/) to manage your [PKCS12 certificates](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12). See [Private certificate requirements](#private-certificate-requirements). |
| Upload a private certificate | If you already have a private certificate from a non-Microsoft provider, you can upload it. See [Private certificate requirements](#private-certificate-requirements). |
| Upload a public certificate | Public certificates aren't used to secure custom domains, but you can load them into your code if you need them to access remote resources. |

## Prerequisites

- [Create an App Service app](./index.yml). The app's [App Service plan](overview-hosting-plans.md) must be in the Basic, Standard, Premium, or Isolated tier. To update the tier, see [Scale up an app](manage-scale-up.md#scale-up-your-pricing-tier).
- For a private certificate, make sure that it satisfies all [requirements from App Service](#private-certificate-requirements).
- *Free certificate only*:

  - Map the domain where you want the certificate to App Service. For more information, see [Tutorial: Map an existing custom DNS name to Azure App Service](app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain.md).
  - For a root domain (like contoso.com), make sure that your app doesn't have any [IP restrictions](app-service-ip-restrictions.md) configured. Both certificate creation and its periodic renewal for a root domain depend on your app being reachable from the internet.

## Private certificate requirements

The [free App Service managed certificate](#create-a-free-managed-certificate) and the [App Service certificate](configure-ssl-app-service-certificate.md) already satisfy the requirements of App Service. If you choose to upload or import a private certificate to App Service, your certificate must meet the following requirements:

* Be exported as a [password-protected PFX file](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=X.509&section=4#Certificate_filename_extensions).
* Contain all intermediate certificates and the root certificate in the certificate chain.

If you want to help secure a custom domain in a TLS binding, the certificate must meet these extra requirements:

* Contain an [extended key usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=X.509&section=4#Extensions_informing_a_specific_usage_of_a_certificate) for server authentication (OID = 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1).
* Be signed by a trusted certificate authority.

> [!NOTE]
> **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) certificates** work with App Service when uploaded as a PFX, but currently cannot be imported from Key Vault. They aren't covered by this article. For the exact steps to create ECC certificates, work with your certificate authority.

After you add a private certificate to an app, the certificate is stored in a deployment unit that's bound to the App Service plan's resource group, region, and operating system (OS) combination. Internally, it's called a *webspace*. That way, the certificate is accessible to other apps in the same resource group, region, and OS combination. Private certificates uploaded or imported to App Service are shared with app services in the same deployment unit.

You can add up to 1,000 private certificates per webspace.

## Create a free managed certificate

The free App Service managed certificate is a turnkey solution that helps to secure your custom DNS name in App Service. App Service manages this TLS/SSL server certificate without any action from you.

Before you create a free managed certificate, make sure that you [meet the prerequisites](#prerequisites) for your app.

DigiCert issues free certificates. For some domains, you must explicitly allow DigiCert as a certificate issuer by creating a [Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) domain record](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_Certification_Authority_Authorization) with the value `0 issue digicert.com`.

Azure fully manages the certificates for you, so any aspect of the managed certificate, including the root issuer, can change at any time. Certificate renewals change both public and private key parts. All of these certificate changes are outside of your control. Make sure to avoid hard dependencies and *pinning* practice certificates to the managed certificate or any part of the certificate hierarchy. If you need the certificate pinning behavior, add a certificate to your custom domain by using any other available method in this article.

The free certificate comes with the following limitations:

- Doesn't support wildcard certificates.
- Doesn't support use as a client certificate by using certificate thumbprints, which is planned for deprecation and removal.
- Doesn't support private DNS.
- Isn't exportable.
- Isn't supported in App Service Environment.
- Supports only alphanumeric characters, dashes (-), and periods (.).
- Supports custom domains of a length up to 64 characters.

### [Apex domain](#tab/apex)

- Must have an A record pointing to your web app's IP address.
- Must be on apps that are publicly accessible.
- Isn't supported with root domains that are integrated with Azure Traffic Manager.
- Must meet all the preceding criteria for successful certificate issuances and renewals.

### [Subdomain](#tab/subdomain)

- Must have CNAME mapped _directly_ to `<app-name>.azurewebsites.net` or [trafficmanager.net](configure-domain-traffic-manager.md#enable-custom-domain). Mapping to an intermediate CNAME value blocks certificate issuance and renewal.
- Must be on apps that are publicly accessible.
- Must meet all the preceding criteria for successful certificate issuance and renewals.

1. To help secure a custom domain with this certificate, you must create a certificate binding. Follow the steps in [Secure a custom DNS name with a TLS/SSL binding in Azure App Service](configure-ssl-bindings.md).

## Import a certificate from Key Vault

If you use Key Vault to manage your certificates, you can import a PKCS12 certificate into App Service from Key Vault if you meet the [requirements](#private-certificate-requirements).

### Authorize App Service to read from the vault

By default, the App Service resource provider doesn't have access to your key vault. To use a key vault for a certificate deployment, you must authorize read access for the resource provider (App Service) to the key vault. You can grant access with an access policy or role-based access control (RBAC).

### [RBAC permissions](#tab/rbac)

| Resource provider | Service principal app ID / assignee | Key Vault RBAC role |
|--|--|--|
| Azure App Service or `Microsoft.Azure.WebSites` | - `abfa0a7c-a6b6-4736-8310-5855508787cd` for Azure Cloud Services <br><br>- `6a02c803-dafd-4136-b4c3-5a6f318b4714` for Azure Cloud Services for Government | Certificate User |

The service principal app ID or assignee value is the ID for the App Service resource provider. When access is granted by using RBAC, the corresponding object ID of the service principal app ID is specific to the tenant. To learn how to authorize Key Vault permissions for the App Service resource provider by using an access policy, see [Provide access to Key Vault keys, certificates, and secrets with Azure role-based access control](/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide?tabs=azure-portal#key-vault-scope-role-assignment).

### [Access policy permissions](#tab/accesspolicy)

| Resource provider | Service principal app ID | Key Vault secret permissions | Key Vault certificate permissions |
|--|--|--|--|
| Microsoft Azure App Service or `Microsoft.Azure.WebSites` | - `abfa0a7c-a6b6-4736-8310-5855508787cd` for Azure Cloud Services <br><br>- `6a02c803-dafd-4136-b4c3-5a6f318b4714` for Azure Cloud Services for Government | Get | Get |

The service principal app ID or assignee value is the ID for the App Service resource provider. To learn how to authorize Key Vault permissions for the App Service resource provider by using an access policy, see [Assign a Key Vault access policy](/azure/key-vault/general/assign-access-policy?tabs=azure-portal).

Don't delete these access policy permissions from the key vault. If you do, App Service can't sync your web app with the latest Key Vault certificate version.

If Key Vault is configured to disable public access, select the **Allow trusted Microsoft services to bypass this firewall** checkbox to ensure that Microsoft services are allowed access. For more information, see [Key Vault firewall-enabled trusted services only](/azure/key-vault/general/network-security?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_KeyVault#key-vault-firewall-enabled-trusted-services-only).

### Import a certificate from your vault to your app

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), on the left pane, select **App Services** > *\<app-name>*.

1. On the left pane of your app, select **Certificates** > **Bring your own certificates (.pfx)** > **Add certificate**.

1. Under **Source**, select **Import from Key Vault**.

1. Choose **Select key vault certificate**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-ssl-certificate/import-key-vault-cert.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the app management page with Certificates, Bring your own certificates (.pfx), and Import from Key Vault selected.":::

1. To help you select the certificate, use the following table:

   | Setting | Description |
   |-|-|
   | **Subscription** | The subscription associated with the key vault. |
   | **Key Vault** | The key vault that has the certificate you want to import. |
   | **Certificate** | From this list, select a PKCS12 certificate that's in the vault. All PKCS12 certificates in the vault are listed with their thumbprints, but not all are supported in App Service. |

1. After you finish with your selection, choose **Select** > **Validate**, and then select **Add**.

   After the operation finishes, the certificate appears in the **Bring your own certificates (.pfx)** list. If the import fails with an error, the certificate doesn't meet the [requirements for App Service](#private-certificate-requirements).

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-ssl-certificate/import-app-service-cert-finished.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Bring your own certificates (.pfx) pane with the imported certificate listed.":::

   If you update your certificate in Key Vault with a new certificate, App Service automatically syncs your certificate within 24 hours.

1. To help secure a custom domain with this certificate, you must create a certificate binding. Follow the steps in [Secure a custom DNS name with a TLS/SSL binding in Azure App Service](configure-ssl-bindings.md).

## Upload a private certificate

After you get a certificate from your certificate provider, make the certificate ready for App Service by following the steps in this section.

#### Merge intermediate certificates

If your certificate authority gives you multiple certificates in the certificate chain, you must merge the certificates by following the same order.

1. In a text editor, open each received certificate.

1. To store the merged certificate, create a file named _mergedcertificate.crt_.

1. Copy the content for each certificate into this file. Make sure to follow the certificate sequence specified by the certificate chain. Start with your certificate and end with the root certificate, for example:

   ```
   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
   <your entire Base64 encoded SSL certificate>
   -----END CERTIFICATE-----

   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
   <The entire Base64 encoded intermediate certificate 1>
   -----END CERTIFICATE-----

   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
   <The entire Base64 encoded intermediate certificate 2>
   -----END CERTIFICATE-----

   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
   <The entire Base64 encoded root certificate>
   -----END CERTIFICATE-----
   ```

#### Export the merged private certificate to .pfx

Now, export your merged TLS/SSL certificate with the private key that was used to generate your certificate request. If you generated your certificate request by using OpenSSL, then you created a private key file.

OpenSSL v3 changed the default cipher from 3DES to AES256. Use the command line `-keypbe PBE-SHA1-3DES -certpbe PBE-SHA1-3DES -macalg SHA1` to override the change.

OpenSSL v1 uses 3DES as the default, so the .pfx files that are generated are supported without any special modifications.

1. To export your certificate to a .pfx file, run the following command. Replace the placeholders _&lt;private-key-file>_ and _&lt;merged-certificate-file>_ with the paths to your private key and your merged certificate file.

   ```bash
   openssl pkcs12 -export -out myserver.pfx -inkey <private-key-file> -in <merged-certificate-file>  
   ```

1. When you're prompted, specify a password for the export operation. When you upload your TLS/SSL certificate to App Service later, you must provide this password.

1. If you used IIS or _Certreq.exe_ to generate your certificate request, install the certificate to your local computer, and then [export the certificate to a .pfx file](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc754329(v=ws.11)).

#### Upload the certificate to App Service

You're now ready to upload the certificate to App Service.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), on the left pane, select **App Services** > *\<app-name>*.

1. On the left pane of your app, select **Certificates** > **Bring your own certificates (.pfx)** > **Upload certificate (.pfx)**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-ssl-certificate/upload-private-cert.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the app management page with Certificates, Bring your own certificates (.pfx), and Upload certificate .pfx selected.":::

1. To help you upload the .pfx certificate, use the following table:

   | Setting | Description |
   |-|-|
   | **PFX certificate file** | Select your .pfx file. |
   | **Certificate password** | Enter the password that you created when you exported the .pfx file. |
   | **Certificate friendly name** | The certificate name that appears in your web app. |

1. After you finish with your selection, choose **Select** > **Validate**, and then select **Add**.

   After the operation finishes, the certificate appears in the **Bring your own certificates (.pfx)** list.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-ssl-certificate/import-app-service-cert-finished.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Bring your own certificates pane with the uploaded certificate listed.":::

1. To provide security for a custom domain with this certificate, you must create a certificate binding. Follow the steps in [Secure a custom DNS name with a TLS/SSL binding in Azure App Service](configure-ssl-bindings.md).

## Upload a public certificate

Public certificates are supported in the *.cer* format.

After you upload a public certificate to an app, it's accessible only by the app to which it's uploaded. Public certificates must be uploaded to each individual web app that needs access. For scenarios specific to App Service Environment, refer to [the documentation for certificates and App Service Environment](../app-service/environment/overview-certificates.md).
>
> You can upload up to 1,000 public certificates per App Service plan.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), on the left pane, select **App Services** > *\<app-name>*.

1. On the left pane of your app, select **Certificates** > **Public key certificates (.cer)** > **Add certificate**.

1. To help you upload the .cer certificate, use the following table:

   | Setting | Description |
   |-|-|
   | **.cer certificate file** | Select your .cer file. |
   | **Certificate friendly name** | The certificate name that appears in your web app. |

1. After you finish, select **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-ssl-certificate/upload-public-cert.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the app management page. It shows the public key certificate to upload and its name.":::

1. After the certificate is uploaded, copy the certificate thumbprint, and then review [Make the certificate accessible](configure-ssl-certificate-in-code.md#make-the-certificate-accessible).

## Renew an expiring certificate

Before a certificate expires, make sure to add the renewed certificate to App Service. Update any certificate bindings where the process depends on the certificate type. For example, a [certificate imported from Key Vault](#import-a-certificate-from-key-vault), including an [App Service certificate](configure-ssl-app-service-certificate.md), automatically syncs to App Service every 24 hours and updates the TLS/SSL binding when you renew the certificate.

For an [uploaded certificate](#upload-a-private-certificate), there's no automatic binding update. Based on your scenario, review the corresponding section:

- [Renew an uploaded certificate](#renew-an-uploaded-certificate)
- [Renew an App Service certificate](configure-ssl-app-service-certificate.md#renew-an-app-service-certificate)
- [Renew a certificate imported from Key Vault](#renew-a-certificate-imported-from-key-vault)

#### Renew an uploaded certificate

When you replace an expiring certificate, the way you update the certificate binding with the new certificate might adversely affect the user experience. For example, your inbound IP address might change when you delete a binding, even if that binding is IP based. This result is especially effective when you renew a certificate that's already in an IP-based binding.

To avoid a change in your app's IP address, and to avoid downtime for your app because of HTTPS errors, follow these steps:

1. [Upload the new certificate](#upload-a-private-certificate).

1. Go to the **Custom domains** page for your app, select the **...** button, and then select **Update binding**.

1. Select the new certificate, and then select **Update**.

1. Delete the existing certificate.

#### Renew a certificate imported from Key Vault

To renew an App Service certificate, see [Renew an App Service certificate](configure-ssl-app-service-certificate.md#renew-an-app-service-certificate).

To renew a certificate that you imported into App Service from Key Vault, see [Renew your Azure Key Vault certificate](/azure/key-vault/certificates/overview-renew-certificate).

After the certificate renews in your key vault, App Service automatically syncs the new certificate and updates any applicable certificate binding within 24 hours. To sync manually, follow these steps:

1. Go to your app's **Certificate** page.

1. Under **Bring your own certificates (.pfx)**, select the **...** button for the imported key vault certificate, and then select **Sync**.

## Frequently asked questions

### How can I automate the process of adding a bring-your-own certificate to an app?

- [Azure CLI: Bind a custom TLS/SSL certificate to a web app](scripts/cli-configure-ssl-certificate.md)
- [Azure PowerShell: Bind a custom TLS/SSL certificate to a web app by using PowerShell](scripts/powershell-configure-ssl-certificate.md)

### Can I use a private CA certificate for inbound TLS on my app?

You can use a private certificate authority (CA) certificate for inbound TLS in [App Service Environment version 3](./environment/overview-certificates.md). This action isn't possible in App Service (multitenant). For more information on App Service multitenant versus single tenant, see [App Service Environment v3 and App Service public multitenant comparison](./environment/ase-multi-tenant-comparison.md).

### Can I make outbound calls by using a private CA client certificate from my app?

This capability is supported for Windows container apps only in multitenant App Service. You can make outbound calls by using a private CA client certificate with both code-based and container-based apps in [App Service Environment version 3](./environment/overview-certificates.md). For more information on App Service multitenant versus single tenant, see [App Service Environment v3 and App Service public multitenant comparison](./environment/ase-multi-tenant-comparison.md).

### Can I load a private CA certificate in my App Service trusted root store?

You can load your own CA certificate into the trusted root store in [App Service Environment version 3](./environment/overview-certificates.md). You can't modify the list of trusted root certificates in App Service (multitenant). For more information on App Service multitenant versus single tenant, see [App Service Environment v3 and App Service public multitenant comparison](./environment/ase-multi-tenant-comparison.md).

### Can App Service certificates be used for other services?

Yes. You can export and use App Service certificates with Azure Application Gateway or other services. For more information, see the blog article [Creating a local PFX copy of App Service Certificate](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2017/02/24/Creating-a-local-PFX-copy-of-App-Service-Certificate.html).
