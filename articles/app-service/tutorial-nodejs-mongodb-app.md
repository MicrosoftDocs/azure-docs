# Tutorial: Deploy a Node.js + MongoDB web app to Azure

[Azure App Service](overview.md) provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service using the Linux operating system. This tutorial shows how to create a secure Node.js app in Azure App Service that's connected to a [Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB](/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/mongodb-introduction) database. When you're finished, you'll have an Express.js app running on Azure App Service on Linux.

:::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-nodejs-mongodb-app/azure-portal-browse-app-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Node.js application storing data in Cosmos DB.":::

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a secure-by-default architecture for Azure App Service and Azure Cosmos DB with MongoDB API.
> * Secure connection secrets using a managed identity and Key Vault references.
> * Deploy a Node.js sample app to App Service from a GitHub repository.
> * Access App Service app settings in the application code.
> * Make updates and redeploy the application code.
> * Stream diagnostic logs from App Service.
> * Manage the app in the Azure portal.
> * Provision the same architecture and deploy by using Azure Developer CLI.
> * Optimize your development workflow with GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot.

## Prerequisites

::: zone pivot="azure-portal"  

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure account, you [can create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/java/).
* A GitHub account. you can also [get one for free](https://github.com/join).
* Knowledge of Express.js development.
* **(Optional)** To try GitHub Copilot, a [GitHub Copilot account](https://docs.github.com/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-code-suggestions-in-your-editor). A 30-day free trial is available.

## Skip to the end

You can quickly deploy the sample app in this tutorial and see it running in Azure. Just run the following commands in the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com), and follow the prompt:

```bash
mkdir msdocs-nodejs-mongodb-azure-sample-app
cd msdocs-nodejs-mongodb-azure-sample-app
azd init --template msdocs-nodejs-mongodb-azure-sample-app
azd up
```

## 1. Run the sample

First, you set up a sample data-driven app as a starting point. For your convenience, the [sample repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-nodejs-mongodb-azure-sample-app), includes a [dev container](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers) configuration. The dev container has everything you need to develop an application, including the database, cache, and all environment variables needed by the sample application. The dev container can run in a [GitHub codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview), which means you can run the sample on any computer with a web browser.

## 2. Create App Service and Azure Cosmos DB

In this step, you create the Azure resources. The steps used in this tutorial create a set of secure-by-default resources that include App Service and Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB. For the creation process, you'll specify:

* The **Name** for the web app. It's used as part of the DNS name for your app in the form of `https://<app-name>-<hash>.<region>.azurewebsites.net`.
* The **Region** to run the app physically in the world. It's also used as part of the DNS name for your app.
* The **Runtime stack** for the app. It's where you select the version of Node to use for your app.
* The **Hosting plan** for the app. It's the pricing tier that includes the set of features and scaling capacity for your app.
* The **Resource Group** for the app. A resource group lets you group (in a logical container) all the Azure resources needed for the application.

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and follow these steps to create your Azure App Service resources.

:::row:::
    :::column span="2":::
        **Step 1:** In the Azure portal:
        1. Enter "web app database" in the search bar at the top of the Azure portal.
        1. Select the item labeled **Web App + Database** under the **Marketplace** heading.
        You can also navigate to the [creation wizard](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customportal=false#create/Microsoft.AppServiceWebAppDatabaseV3) directly.

## 3. Secure connection secrets

The creation wizard generated the connectivity string for you already as an [app setting](configure-common.md#configure-app-settings). However, the security best practice is to keep secrets out of App Service completely. You'll move your secrets to a key vault and change your app setting to a [Key Vault reference](app-service-key-vault-references.md) with the help of Service Connectors.

:::row:::
    :::column span="2":::
        **Step 1:** In the App Service page:
        1. In the left menu, select **Settings > Environment variables**. 
        1. Next to **AZURE_COSMOS_CONNECTIONSTRING**, select **Show value**.
        This connection string lets you connect to the Cosmos DB database secured behind a private endpoint. However, the secret is saved directly in the App Service app, which isn't the best. You'll change this.

    :::column:::
        :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-nodejs-mongodb-app/azure-portal-secure-connection-secrets-1.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to see the value of an app setting." lightbox="./media/tutorial-nodejs-mongodb-app/azure-portal-secure-connection-secrets-1.png":::
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
    :::column span="2":::
        **Step 2:** Create a key vault for secure management of secrets.
        1. In the top search bar, type "*key vault*", then select **Marketplace** > **Key Vault**.
        1. In **Resource Group**, select **msdocs-expressjs-mongodb-tutorial**.
        1. In **Key vault name**, type a name that consists of only letters and numbers.
        1. In **Region**, set it to the sample location as the resource group.

        **Step 3:**
        1. Select the **Networking** tab.
        1. Unselect **Enable public access**.
        1. Select **Create a private endpoint**.
        1. In **Resource Group**, select **msdocs-expressjs-mongodb-tutorial**.
        1. In **Key vault name**, type a name that consists of only letters and numbers.
        1. In **Region**, set it to the sample location as the resource group.
        1. In the dialog, in **Location**, select the same location as your App Service app.
        1. In **Resource Group**, select **msdocs-expressjs-mongodb-tutorial**.
        1. In **Name**, type **msdocs-expressjs-mongodb-XYZVaultEndpoint**.
        1. In **Virtual network**, select **msdocs-expressjs-mongodb-XYZVnet**.
        1. In **Subnet**, **msdocs-expressjs-mongodb-XYZSubnet**.
        1. Select **OK**.
        1. Select **Review + create**, then select **Create**. Wait for the key vault deployment to finish. You should see "Your deployment is complete."

:::row:::
    :::column span="2":::
        **Step 4:**
        1. In the top search bar, type *msdocs-expressjs-mongodb*, then the App Service resource called **msdocs-expressjs-mongodb-XYZ**.
        1. In the App Service page, in the left menu, select **Settings > Service Connector**. There's already a connector, which the app creation wizard created for you.
        1. Select checkbox next to the connector, then select **Edit**.
        1. In the **Basics** tab, set **Client type** to **Node.js**.
        1. Select the **Authentication** tab.
        1. Select **Store Secret in Key Vault**.
        1. Under **Key Vault Connection**, select **Create new**. 
        A **Create connection** dialog is opened on top of the edit dialog.

    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
    :::column span="2":::
        **Step 5:** In the **Create connection** dialog for the Key Vault connection:
        1. In **Key Vault**, select the key vault you created earlier.
        1. Select **Review + Create**. You should see that **System assigned managed identity** is set to **Selected**.
        1. When validation completes, select **Create**.

:::row-end:::
:::row:::
    :::column span="2":::
        **Step 6:** You're back in the edit dialog for **defaultConnector**.
        1. In the **Authentication** tab, wait for the key vault connector to be created. When it's finished, the **Key Vault Connection** dropdown automatically selects it.
        1. Select **Next: Networking**.
        1. Select **Configure firewall rules to enable access to target service**. If you see the message, "No Private Endpoint on the target service," ignore it. The app creation wizard already secured the Cosmos DB database with a private endpoint.
        1. Select **Save**. Wait until the **Update succeeded** notification appears.

        **Step 7:** To verify your changes: 
        1. From the left menu, select **Environment variables** again.
        1. Next to the app setting **AZURE_COSMOS_CONNECTIONSTRING**, select **Show value**. The value should be `@Microsoft.KeyVault(...)`, which means that it's a [key vault reference](app-service-key-vault-references.md) because the secret is now managed in the key vault.

## 4. Deploy sample code

In this step, you configure GitHub deployment using GitHub Actions. It's just one of many ways to deploy to App Service, but also a great way to have continuous integration in your deployment process. By default, every `git push` to your GitHub repository kicks off the build and deploy action.

:::row:::
    :::column span="2":::
        **Step 1:** In the left menu, select **Deployment** > **Deployment Center**.

:::row-end:::
:::row:::
    :::column span="2":::
        **Step 2:** In the Deployment Center page:
        1. In **Source**, select **GitHub**. By default, **GitHub Actions** is selected as the build provider.        
        1. Sign in to your GitHub account and follow the prompt to authorize Azure.
        1. In **Organization**, select your account.
        1. In **Repository**, select **msdocs-nodejs-mongodb-azure-sample-app**.
        1. In **Branch**, select **starter-no-infra**. This is the same branch that you worked in with your sample app, without any Azure-related files or configuration.
        1. For **Authentication type**, select **User-assigned identity**.
        1. In the top menu, select **Save**. App Service commits a workflow file into the chosen GitHub repository, in the `.github/workflows` directory.
        By default, the deployment center [creates a user-assigned identity](#i-dont-have-permissions-to-create-a-user-assigned-identity) for the workflow to authenticate using Microsoft Entra (OIDC authentication). For alternative authentication options, see [Deploy to App Service using GitHub Actions](deploy-github-actions.md).

        1. Say, "*I have a connection string variable in Azure called AZURE_COSMOS_CONNECTIONSTRING.". Copilot might give you a code suggestion similar to the one in the **Option 2: without GitHub Copilot** steps below and even tell you to make the change in [app.js](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-nodejs-mongodb-azure-sample-app/blob/main/app.js).
        1. Open *app.js* in the explorer and add the code suggestion in the `getApp` method.
        GitHub Copilot doesn't give you the same response every time, you might need to ask more questions to fine-tune its response. For tips, see [What can I do with GitHub Copilot in my codespace?](#what-can-i-do-with-github-copilot-in-my-codespace).

## 6. Stream diagnostic logs

Azure App Service captures all messages logged to the console to assist you in diagnosing issues with your application. The sample app outputs console log messages in each of its endpoints to demonstrate this capability. For example, the `get` endpoint outputs a message about the number of tasks retrieved from the database and an error message appears if something goes wrong.

## 7. Inspect deployed files using Kudu

Azure App Service provides a web-based diagnostics console named [Kudu](./resources-kudu.md) that lets you examine the server hosting environment for your web app. Using Kudu, you can view the files deployed to Azure, review the deployment history of the application, and even open an SSH session into the hosting environment.

## 2. Create Azure resources and deploy a sample app

In this step, you create the Azure resources and deploy a sample app to App Service on Linux. The steps used in this tutorial create a set of secure-by-default resources that include App Service and Azure Cosmos DB.

The dev container already has the [Azure Developer CLI](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) (AZD).

1. From the repository root, run `azd init`.

    ```bash
    azd init --template nodejs-app-service-cosmos-redis-infra
    ```

1. When prompted, give the following answers:
    
    |Question  |Answer  |
    |---------|---------|
    |The current directory is not empty. Would you like to initialize a project here in '\<your-directory>'?     | **Y**        |
    |What would you like to do with these files?     | **Keep my existing files unchanged**        |
    |Enter a new environment name     | Type a unique name. The AZD template uses this name as part of the DNS name of your web app in Azure (`<app-name>-<hash>.azurewebsites.net`). Alphanumeric characters and hyphens are allowed.          |

1. Sign into Azure by running the `azd auth login` command and following the prompt:

    ```bash
    azd auth login
    ```  

1. Create the necessary Azure resources and deploy the app code with the `azd up` command. Follow the prompt to select the desired subscription and location for the Azure resources.

    ```bash
    azd up
    ```  

    The `azd up` command takes about 15 minutes to complete (the Redis cache takes the most time). It also compiles and deploys your application code, but you'll modify your code later to work with App Service. While it's running, the command provides messages about the provisioning and deployment process, including a link to the deployment in Azure. When it finishes, the command also displays a link to the deploy application.

    This AZD template contains files (*azure.yaml* and the *infra* directory) that generate a secure-by-default architecture with the following Azure resources:

    - **Resource group**: The container for all the created resources.
    - **App Service plan**: Defines the compute resources for App Service. A Linux plan in the *B1* tier is created.
    - **App Service**: Represents your app and runs in the App Service plan.
    - **Virtual network**: Integrated with the App Service app and isolates back-end network traffic.
    - **Azure Cosmos DB account with MongoDB API**: Accessible only from behind its private endpoint. A database is created for you on the server.
    - **Azure Cache for Redis**: Accessible only from within the virtual network.
    - **Key vault**: Accessible only from behind its private endpoint. Used to manage secrets for the App Service app.
    - **Private endpoints**: Access endpoints for the key vault, the database server, and the Redis cache in the virtual network.
    - **Private DNS zones**: Enable DNS resolution of the Cosmos DB database, the Redis cache, and the key vault in the virtual network.
    - **Log Analytics workspace**: Acts as the target container for your app to ship its logs, where you can also query the logs.

    Once the command finishes creating resources and deploying the application code the first time, the deployed sample app doesn't work yet because you must make small changes to make it connect to the database in Azure.

## 3. Verify connection strings

The AZD template you use generated the connectivity variables for you already as [app settings](configure-common.md#configure-app-settings) and outputs the them to the terminal for your convenience. App settings are one way to keep connection secrets out of your code repository.

1. In the AZD output, find the app setting `AZURE_COSMOS_CONNECTIONSTRING`. Only the setting names are displayed. They look like this in the AZD output:

    <pre>
    App Service app has the following app settings:
            - AZURE_COSMOS_CONNECTIONSTRING
            - AZURE_REDIS_CONNECTIONSTRING
            - AZURE_KEYVAULT_RESOURCEENDPOINT
            - AZURE_KEYVAULT_SCOPE
    </pre>

    `AZURE_COSMOS_CONNECTIONSTRING` contains the connection string to the Cosmos DB database in Azure. You need to use it in your code later. 

1. For your convenience, the AZD template shows you the direct link to the app's app settings page. Find the link and open it in a new browser tab.

## 4. Modify sample code and redeploy

# [With GitHub Copilot](#tab/copilot)

1. In the GitHub codespace, start a new chat session by clicking the **Chat** view, then clicking **+**. 

1. Ask, "*@workspace How does the app connect to the database?*" Copilot might point you to the *app.js* file and the `mongoose.connect` call.

1. Say, "*I have a connection string variable in Azure called AZURE_COSMOS_CONNECTIONSTRING.*". Copilot might give you a code suggestion similar to the one in the **Option 2: without GitHub Copilot** steps below and even tell you to make the change in [app.js](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-nodejs-mongodb-azure-sample-app/blob/main/app.js).

1. Open *app.js* in the explorer and add the code suggestion in the `getApp` method.

    GitHub Copilot doesn't give you the same response every time, you might need to ask more questions to fine-tune its response. For tips, see [What can I do with GitHub Copilot in my codespace?](#what-can-i-do-with-github-copilot-in-my-codespace).

1. Back in the codespace terminal, run `azd deploy`.

    ```bash
    azd deploy
    ```

# [Without GitHub Copilot](#tab/nocopilot)

1. From the explorer, open *app.js* and see that the app creates a Mongoose connection using `MONGODB_URI` (Line 16).

1. Change `process.env.MONGODB_URI` to `process.env.AZURE_COSMOS_CONNECTIONSTRING || process.env.MONGODB_URI`.

    This change makes it possible to pick the right environment variable for the MongoDB connection string, regardless of whether you're running locally or in Azure. You can use the same variable name for both environments, but that's beyond the scope of the tutorial.

1. Back in the codespace terminal, run `azd deploy`.
 
    ```bash
    azd deploy
    ```

-----

> [!TIP]
> You can also just use `azd up` always, which does all of `azd package`, `azd provision`, and `azd deploy`.

Having issues? Check the [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting).

## 5. Browse to the app

1. In the AZD output, find the URL of your app and navigate to it in the browser. The URL looks like this in the AZD output:

    <pre>
    Deploying services (azd deploy)
    
      (✓) Done: Deploying service web
      - Endpoint: https://&lt;app-name>-&lt;hash>.azurewebsites.net/
    </pre>

2. Add a few tasks to the list.

## Troubleshooting

- [The portal deployment view for Azure Cosmos DB shows a Conflict status](#the-portal-deployment-view-for-azure-cosmos-db-shows-a-conflict-status)
- [The browser page of the deployed app says "Something went wrong."](#the-browser-page-of-the-deployed-app-says-something-went-wrong)

#### The portal deployment view for Azure Cosmos DB shows a Conflict status

Depending on your subscription and the region you select, you might see the deployment status for Azure Cosmos DB to be `Conflict`, with the following message in Operation details:

`Sorry, we are currently experiencing high demand in <region> region, and cannot fulfill your request at this time.`

The error is most likely caused by a limit on your subscription for the region you select. Try choosing a different region for your deployment.

#### The browser page of the deployed app says "Something went wrong."

You probably still need to make the connection string changes in your application code. See [4. Deploy sample code](#4-deploy-sample-code).

- [What can I do with GitHub Copilot in my codespace?](#what-can-i-do-with-github-copilot-in-my-codespace)

#### How much does this setup cost?

Pricing for the created resources is as follows:

- The App Service plan is created in **Basic** tier and can be scaled up or down. See [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/).
- The Azure Cosmos DB server is created in a single region and can be distributed to other regions. See [Azure Cosmos DB pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cosmos-db/).
- The virtual network doesn't incur a charge unless you configure extra functionality, such as peering. See [Azure Virtual Network pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-network/).
- The private DNS zone incurs a small charge. See [Azure DNS pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/dns/). 

#### How do I connect to the Azure Cosmos DB server that's secured behind the virtual network with other tools?

- For basic access from a command-line tool, you can run `mongosh` from the app's SSH terminal. The app's container doesn't come with `mongosh`, so you must [install it manually](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/). Remember that the installed client doesn't persist across app restarts.
- To connect from a MongoDB GUI client, your machine must be within the virtual network. For example, it could be an Azure VM that's connected to one of the subnets, or a machine in an on-premises network that has a [site-to-site VPN](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md) connection with the Azure virtual network.
- To connect from the MongoDB shell from the Azure Cosmos DB management page in the portal, your machine must also be within the virtual network. You could instead open the Azure Cosmos DB server's firewall for your local machine's IP address, but it increases the attack surface for your configuration.

#### How does local app development work with GitHub Actions?

Take the autogenerated workflow file from App Service as an example, each `git push` kicks off a new build and deployment run. From a local clone of the GitHub repository, you make the desired updates push it to GitHub. For example:

```terminal
git add .
git commit -m "<some-message>"
git push origin main
```

#### Why is the GitHub Actions deployment so slow?

The autogenerated workflow file from App Service defines build-then-deploy, two-job run. Because each job runs in its own clean environment, the workflow file ensures that the `deploy` job has access to the files from the `build` job:

- At the end of the `build` job, [upload files as artifacts](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts).
- At the beginning of the `deploy` job, download the artifacts.

Most of the time taken by the two-job process is spent uploading and download artifacts. If you want, you can simplify the workflow file by combining the two jobs into one, which eliminates the need for the upload and download steps.

#### I don't have permissions to create a user-assigned identity

See [Set up GitHub Actions deployment from the Deployment Center](deploy-github-actions.md#set-up-github-actions-deployment-from-the-deployment-center).

#### What can I do with GitHub Copilot in my codespace?

You might notice that the GitHub Copilot chat view was already there for you when you created the codespace. For your convenience, we include the GitHub Copilot chat extension in the container definition (see *.devcontainer/devcontainer.json*). However, you need a [GitHub Copilot account](https://docs.github.com/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-code-suggestions-in-your-editor) (30-day free trial available). 

A few tips for you when you talk to GitHub Copilot:

- In a single chat session, the questions and answers build on each other and you can adjust your questions to fine-tune the answer you get.
- By default, GitHub Copilot doesn't have access to any file in your repository. To ask questions about a file, open the file in the editor first.
- To let GitHub Copilot have access to all of the files in the repository when preparing its answers, begin your question with `@workspace`. For more information, see [Use the @workspace agent](https://github.blog/2024-03-25-how-to-use-github-copilot-in-your-ide-tips-tricks-and-best-practices/#10-use-the-workspace-agent).
- In the chat session, GitHub Copilot can suggest changes and (with `@workspace`) even where to make the changes, but it's not allowed to make the changes for you. It's up to you to add the suggested changes and test it.

Here are some other things you can say to fine-tune the answer you get:

* @workspace Where is MONGODB_URI defined?
* Which file do I make the change in?
* Will this change break my app when running locally?
