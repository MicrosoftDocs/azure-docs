In the preceding steps, you created Azure resources in a resource group. 

1. Delete the resource group by running the following command in the Cloud Shell. This command may take a minute to run.


    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group delete --name myAuthResourceGroup
    ```


1. Use the authentication apps' **Client ID**, you previously found and made note of in the `Enable authentication and authorization` sections for the backend and frontend apps.
1. Delete app registrations for both frontend and backend apps.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    # delete app - do this for both frontend and backend client ids
    az ad app delete <client-id>
    ```
