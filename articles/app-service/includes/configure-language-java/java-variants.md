Azure App Service runs Java web applications on a fully managed service in three variants:

* Java SE - Can run an app deployed as a JAR package that contains an embedded server (such as Spring Boot, Dropwizard, Quarkus, or one with an embedded Tomcat or Jetty server).   
* Tomcat - The built-in Tomcat server can run an app deployed as a WAR package.
* JBoss EAP - Supported for Linux apps in the Free, Premium v3, and Isolated v2 pricing tiers only. The built-in JBoss EAP server can run an app deployed as a WAR or EAR package.
