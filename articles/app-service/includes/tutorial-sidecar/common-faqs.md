### How do sidecar containers handle internal communication?

Sidecar containers share the same network host as the main container, so the main container and other sidecar containers can reach any port on the sidecar with `localhost:<port>`. The example *startup.sh* uses `localhost:4318` to access port 4318 on the otel-collector sidecar.

In the **Edit container** dialog, the **Port** setting isn't currently used by App Service. You can use it as part of the sidecar metadata, such as to indicate which port the sidecar is listening to.

### Can a sidecar container receive internet requests?

No. App Service routes internet requests only to the main container. For code-based Linux apps, the built-in Linux container is the main container, and any sidecar [`sitecontainers`](/azure/templates/microsoft.web/sites/sitecontainers) should be added with `IsMain=false`.

For custom containers, all except one of the [`sitecontainers`](/azure/templates/microsoft.web/sites/sitecontainers) should have `IsMain=false`. For more information on configuring `IsMain`, see [Microsoft.Web sites/sitecontainers](/azure/templates/microsoft.web/sites/sitecontainers).

### How do I use volume mounts?

The volume mounts feature lets you share non-persistent files and directories between containers within your web app. To add or configure volume mounts, use **Volume mounts** on the **Add container** or **Edit container** page.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/tutorial-custom-container-sidecar/configure-volume-mounts.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a volume mount configuration for a sidecar container.":::

- **Volume sub path** is an automatically created logical directory path that isn't referenced within the container. Containers that are configured with the same volume sub path can share files and directories.
- **Container mount path** is a directory path that you reference within the container. The container mount path is mapped to the volume sub path.

For example, suppose you configure the following volume mounts:

| Sidecar name | Volume sub path | Container mount path | Read-only |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| Container1 | /directory1/directory2 | /container1Vol | False |
| Container2 | /directory1/directory2 | /container2Vol | True |
| Container3 | /directory1/directory2/directory3 | /container3Vol | False |
| Container4 | /directory4 | /container1Vol | False |

Based on these settings, the following conditions apply:
- If Container1 creates */container1Vol/myfile.txt*, Container2 can read the file via */container2Vol/myfile.txt*.
- If Container1 creates */container1Vol/directory3/myfile.txt*, Container2 can read the file via */container2Vol/directory3/myfile.txt*, and Container3 can read and write to the file via */container3Vol/myfile.txt*.
- Container4 doesn't share a volume mount in common with any of the other containers.

> [!Note]
> For code-based Linux apps, the built-in Linux container can't use volume mounts.
