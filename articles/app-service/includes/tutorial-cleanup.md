## Clean up resources

If you're finished with this tutorial and no longer need the web app or associated resources, clean up the resources you created.

### Delete the resource group

In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the portal menu and select the resource group that contains your app service and app service plan.

Select **Delete resource group** to delete the resource group and all the resources.
