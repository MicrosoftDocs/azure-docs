Hosting your own small language model (SLM) offers several advantages:

- Full control over your data. Sensitive information isn't exposed to external services, which is critical for industries with strict compliance requirements.
- Self-hosted models can be fine-tuned to meet specific use cases or domain-specific requirements. 
- Minimized network latency and faster response times for a better user experience.
- Full control over resource allocation, ensuring optimal performance for your application.
