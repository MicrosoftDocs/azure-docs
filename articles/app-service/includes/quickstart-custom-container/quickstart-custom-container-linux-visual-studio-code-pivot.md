[Azure App Service](../../overview.md) on Linux provides predefined application stacks on Linux with support for languages such as .NET, Java, Node.js, and PHP. You can also use a custom Docker image to run your web app on an application stack that isn't already defined in Azure. This quickstart shows you how to deploy an image from an [Azure Container Registry (ACR)](/azure/container-registry/) to App Service.

For more information about containerized applications in a serverless environment, see [Container Apps](../../../container-apps/overview.md).

## Prerequisites

- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?utm_source=campaign&utm_campaign=vscode-tutorial-docker-extension&mktingSource=vscode-tutorial-docker-extension).
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- The [Azure App Service extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice). You can use this extension to create, manage, and deploy Linux Web Apps on the Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS).
- The [Docker extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker). You can use this extension to simplify the management of local Docker images and commands and to deploy built app images to Azure.

## Create a container registry

This quickstart uses Azure Container Registry as the registry. You can use other registries, but the steps might differ slightly.

Create a container registry by following the instructions in [Quickstart: Create a private container registry using the Azure portal](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to set the **Admin User** option to **Enable** when you create the Azure container registry. You can also set it from the **Access keys** section of your registry page in the Azure portal. This setting is required for App Service access. For managed identity, see [Deploy from ACR tutorial](../../tutorial-custom-container.md?pivots=container-linux#vi-configure-the-web-app).

## Sign in

1. Launch Visual Studio Code.
1. Select the **Azure** logo in the [Activity Bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface), navigate to **ACCOUNTS & TENANTS**. Select **Sign in to Azure** and follow the instructions.

1. In the [Status Bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) at the bottom, verify your Azure account email address. In the **APP SERVICE** explorer, your subscription should be displayed.

1. In the Activity Bar, select the **Docker** logo. In the **REGISTRIES** explorer, verify that the container registry you created appears.

## Check prerequisites

Verify that Docker is installed and running. The following command displays the Docker version if it's running.

```bash
docker --version
```

## Create and build image

1. In Visual Studio Code, open an empty folder and add a file called *Dockerfile*. In the Dockerfile, paste the content based on your desired language framework:

   # [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

   In this Dockerfile, the parent image is one of the built-in .NET containers of App Service.

   <!-- https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/appsvc%2Fdotnetcore/tags/list -->
   ```dockerfile
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/appsvc/dotnetcore:lts

   ENV PORT 8080
   EXPOSE 8080

   ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS "http://*:${PORT}"

   ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "/defaulthome/hostingstart/hostingstart.dll"]
   ```

   # [Node.js](#tab/node)

   In this Dockerfile, the parent image is one of the built-in Node.js containers of App Service.

   <!-- https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/appsvc%2Fnode/tags/list -->
   ```dockerfile
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/appsvc/node:10-lts

   ENV HOST 0.0.0.0
   ENV PORT 8080
   EXPOSE 8080

   ENTRYPOINT ["pm2", "start", "--no-daemon", "/opt/startup/default-static-site.js"]
   ```

   # [Python](#tab/python)

   In this Dockerfile, the parent image is one of the built-in Python containers of App Service.

   <!-- https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/appsvc%2Fpython/tags/list -->
   ```dockerfile
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/appsvc/python:latest

   ENV PORT 8080
   EXPOSE 8080

   ENTRYPOINT ["gunicorn", "--timeout", "600", "--access-logfile", "'-'", "--error-logfile", "'-'", "--chdir=/opt/defaultsite", "application:app"]
   ```

   # [Java](#tab/java)

   In this Dockerfile, the parent image is one of the built-in Java containers of App Service. You can find the source files for it at [java/tree/dev/java11-alpine](https://github.com/Azure-App-Service/java/tree/dev/java11-alpine). Its [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Azure-App-Service/java/blob/dev/java11-alpine/Dockerfile) copies a simple Java app into `/tmp/appservice`. Your Dockerfile starts that app.

   <!-- https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/azure-app-service%2Fjava/tags/list -->
   ```dockerfile
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/azure-app-service/java:11-java11_stable

   ENV PORT 80
   EXPOSE 80

   ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-Dserver.port=80", "-jar", "/tmp/appservice/parkingpage.jar"]
   ```

1. [Open the Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette), and type **Docker Images: Build Image**. Select **Enter** to run the command.

1. In the image tag box, specify the tag you want in the following format: `<acr-name>.azurecr.io/<image-name>:<tag>`, where `<acr-name>` is the name of the container registry you created. Select **Enter**.

1. When the image finishes building, select **Refresh** at the top of the **IMAGES** explorer and verify that the image built successfully.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/quickstart-docker/built-image.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the built image with tag.":::

## Deploy to container registry

1. In the Activity Bar, select the **Docker** icon. In the **IMAGES** explorer, find the image you built.
1. Expand the image, right-click on the tag you want, and select **Push**.
1. Make sure the image tag begins with `<acr-name>.azurecr.io` and press **Enter**.
1. When Visual Studio Code finishes pushing the image to your container registry, select **Refresh** at the top of the **REGISTRIES** explorer and verify that the image is pushed successfully.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/quickstart-docker/image-in-registry.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the image deployed to Azure container registry.":::

## Deploy to App Service

1. In the **REGISTRIES** explorer, expand the image, right-click the tag, and select **Deploy Image to Azure App Service**.
1. Follow the prompts to choose a subscription, a globally unique app name, a resource group, and an App Service plan. Choose **B1 Basic** for the pricing tier, and a region near you.

After deployment, your app is available at `http://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net`.

A **Resource Group** is a named collection of all your application's resources in Azure. For example, a Resource Group can contain a reference to a website, a database, and an Azure Function.

An **App Service Plan** defines the physical resources that to use to host your website. This quickstart uses a **Basic** hosting plan on **Linux** infrastructure, which means the site is hosted on a Linux machine alongside other websites. If you start with the **Basic** plan, you can use the Azure portal to scale up so that yours is the only site running on a machine. For pricing, see [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux).

## Browse the website

The **Output** panel shows the status of the deployment operations. When the operation completes, select **Open Site** in the pop-up notification to open the site in your browser.

Congratulations, you've successfully completed this quickstart.

The App Service app pulls from the container registry every time it starts. If you rebuild your image, you just need to push it to your container registry, and the app pulls in the updated image when it restarts. To tell your app to pull in the updated image immediately, restart it.
