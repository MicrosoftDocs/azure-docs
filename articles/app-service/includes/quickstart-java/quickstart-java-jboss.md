[Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/) provides a highly scalable, self-patching web app hosting service. In this quickstart, you use the [Maven Plugin for Azure App Service Web Apps](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins/blob/develop/azure-webapp-maven-plugin/README.md) to deploy a Java web application to a Linux JBoss EAP server in Azure App Service.

If Maven isn't your preferred development tool, check out similar articles for Java developers:
+ [Gradle](../../configure-language-java-deploy-run.md#gradle)
+ [IntelliJ IDEA](/azure/developer/java/toolkit-for-intellij/create-hello-world-web-app)
+ [Eclipse](/azure/developer/java/toolkit-for-eclipse/create-hello-world-web-app)
+ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-webapp)

## Prerequisites

- [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

- Run the commands in this quickstart by using Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive shell that you can use through your browser to work with Azure services. To use Cloud Shell:

  1. Select the following **Launch Cloud Shell** button or go to https://shell.azure.com to open Cloud Shell in your browser.
  
     :::image type="icon" source="~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/media/cloud-shell/launch-cloud-shell-button.png" alt-text="Button to launch the Azure Cloud Shell." border="false" link="https://shell.azure.com":::

  1. Sign in to Azure if necessary, and make sure you're in the **Bash** environment of Cloud Shell.
  1. Select **Copy** in a code block, paste the code into Cloud Shell, and run it.

## Create a Java app

1. Clone the Pet Store demo application.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-java-quickstart
   ```

1. Change directory to the completed `petstore-ee7` project and build it.

   ```bash
   cd app-service-java-quickstart
   git checkout 20230308
   cd petstore-ee7
   mvn clean install
   ```

   If you see a message about being in detached HEAD state, you can ignore it. You don't make any Git commit in this quickstart, so detached HEAD state is appropriate.
   
   > [!TIP]
   > The `petstore-ee7` sample requires Java 11 or newer. The `booty-duke-app-service` sample project requires Java 17. If your installed version of Java is less than 17, run the build from within the *petstore-ee7* directory instead of at the top level.

## Configure the Maven plugin

The App Service deployment process uses your Azure credentials from Cloud Shell automatically. The Maven plugin authenticates with OAuth or device sign-in. For more information, see [Authentication](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins/wiki/Authentication).

Run the following Maven command to configure the deployment by setting the App Service operating system, Java version, and Jbosseap version.

```bash
mvn com.microsoft.azure:azure-webapp-maven-plugin:2.14.1:config
```

1. For **Create new run configuration**, type **Y** and then press **Enter**.
1. For **Define value for OS**, type **2** for Linux, and then press **Enter**.
1. For **Define value for javaVersion**, type **2** for Java 17, and then press **Enter**. If you select Java 21, you don't see **Jbosseap** as an option later.
1. For **Define value for webContainer**, type **4** for Jbosseap 7, and then press **Enter**.
1. For **Define value for pricingTier**, type **1** for P1v3, and then press **Enter**.
1. For **Confirm**, type **Y** and then press **Enter**.

The output should look similar to the following code:

```bash
Please confirm webapp properties
AppName : petstoreee7-1745409173307
ResourceGroup : petstoreee7-1745409173307-rg
Region : centralus
PricingTier : P1v3
OS : Linux
Java Version: Java 17
Web server stack: Jbosseap 4
Deploy to slot : false
Confirm (Y/N) [Y]: 
[INFO] Saving configuration to pom.
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  01:36 min
[INFO] Finished at: 2025-04-23T11:54:22Z
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

After you confirm your choices, the plugin adds the plugin element and required settings to your project's *pom.xml* file, which configures your web app to run in App Service.

The relevant portion of the *pom.xml* file should look similar to the following example.

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
            <artifactId>>azure-webapp-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>x.xx.x</version>
            <configuration>
                <schemaVersion>v2</schemaVersion>
                <resourceGroup>petstoreee7-1745409173307-rg</resourceGroup>
                <appName>petstoreee7-1745409173307</appName>
            ...
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

The values for `<appName>` and `<resourceGroup>`, `petstoreee7-1745409173307` and `petstoreee7-1745409173307-rg` in the demo app, are used later.

You can modify the configurations for App Service directly in your *pom.xml* file.

- For the complete list of configurations, see [Common Configurations](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins/wiki/Common-Configuration).
- For configurations specific to App Service, see [Azure Web App: Configuration Details](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins/wiki/Azure-Web-App:-Configuration-Details).

## Deploy the app

With all the configuration ready in your *pom.xml* file, you can deploy your Java app to Azure with the following single command.

```bash
# Disable testing, as it requires Wildfly to be installed locally.
mvn package azure-webapp:deploy -DskipTests
```

Once you select from a list of available subscriptions, Maven deploys to Azure App Service. When deployment completes, your application is ready.

For this demo app, the URL is `http://petstoreee7-1745409173307.azurewebsites.net`. When you open the URL with your local web browser, you should see the following app:

![Screenshot of Maven Hello World web app running in Azure App Service.](../../media/quickstart-java/jboss-sample-in-app-service.png)

Congratulations! You deployed a Java app to App Service.

## Clean up resources

You created the resources for this tutorial in an Azure resource group. If you no longer need them, you can delete the resource group and all its resources by running the following Azure CLI command in Cloud Shell.

```azurecli
az group delete --name petstoreee7-1745409173307-rg  --yes
```
The command might take a while to run.
