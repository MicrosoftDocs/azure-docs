In the Deployment Center page:

1. Select **Logs**. A deployment run is already started.

1. In the log item for the deployment run, select **Build/Deploy Logs**.

    You're taken to your GitHub repository and see that the GitHub action is running. The workflow file defines two separate stages, build and deploy.
