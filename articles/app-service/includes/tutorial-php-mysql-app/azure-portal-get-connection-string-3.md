Back in the Application settings tab:

1. Scroll to the bottom and select the connection string **defaultConnection**. It was generated by the creation wizard and contains the username and password you need.

1. In the **Value** field, select the **Copy** button and paste the value in a text file for later. It's in the following format (line breaks for clarity):

    ```
    Database=mysql;
    Server=<database-server-domain-name>;
    User Id=<username>;
    Password=<password>
    ```

1. Select **Cancel**.
