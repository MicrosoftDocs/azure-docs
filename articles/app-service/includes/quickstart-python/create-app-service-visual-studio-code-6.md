Select the App Service plan (pricing tier) for this web app. The App Service plan controls how many resources (CPU/memory) are available to your app and how much you pay.<br>
<br>
For this example, select the **Basic (B1)** pricing tier. This plan will incur a small charge against your Azure subscription but is recommended for better performance over the Free (F1) tier.
