The App Service plan controls the amount of resources (CPU/memory) that are available to your app and the cost of those resources.<br>
<br>
For this example, under **Dev/Test**, select the **Basic B1** plan. The Basic B1 plan will incur a small charge against your Azure account but is recommended for better performance over the Free F1 plan.<br>
<br>
When finished, select **Select** to apply your changes.
