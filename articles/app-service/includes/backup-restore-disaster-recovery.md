## Back up and restore vs. disaster recovery

| Platform | Back up and restore guidance  | Disaster recovery guidance |
|------|-----|-----|
|App Service web apps<br>(Free and Shared pricing tiers)|If you have web applications deployed to the Free or Shared tier and require access to back up and restore capabilities for these web apps, [scale up](../manage-scale-up.md) to the Basic tier or higher.|[Bring App Service resources back online in a different Azure region during a regional disaster](../manage-disaster-recovery.md).<br><br>Starting March 31, 2025, App Service applications won't be placed in disaster recovery mode during a disaster in an Azure region as explained in the [recover from region-wide failure](../manage-disaster-recovery.md) article. We recommend that you implement [commonly used disaster recovery techniques](../overview-disaster-recovery.md) to prevent downtime and data loss during a regional disaster.|
|App Service web apps<br>(Basic, Standard, and Premium pricing tiers)|In Azure App Service, You can make on-demand custom backups or utilize automatic backups. You can restore a backup by overwriting an existing app or by restoring to a new app or slot.<br><br>Refer to [Back up and restore your app in Azure App Service](../manage-backup.md) for more info.|Current guidance regarding how to bring App Service resources back online in a different Azure region during a regional disaster is available at [Recover from region-wide failure - Azure App Service](../manage-disaster-recovery.md). <br><br>Starting March 31, 2025, Azure App Service web applications will no longer be placed in disaster recovery mode during a disaster in an Azure region as explained in the [recover from region-wide failure](../manage-disaster-recovery.md) article. We encourage you to implement [commonly used disaster recovery techniques](../overview-disaster-recovery.md) to prevent loss of functionality or data for your web apps if there's a regional disaster.|
|App Service Environment (V2 and V3)|In Azure App Service Environment, You can make on-demand custom backups or use automatic backups. Automatic backups can be restored to a target app within the same App Service Environment, not in another App Service Environment. Custom backups can be restored to a target app in another App Service Environment (such as from a V2 App Service Environment to a V3 App Service Environment). Backups can be restored to a target app of the same OS platform as the source app.<br><br>Refer to [Back up and restore your app in Azure App Service](../manage-backup.md) for more details.| We encourage you to implement disaster recovery guidance for web apps deployed to App Service Environment using [commonly used disaster recovery techniques](../overview-disaster-recovery.md).  |
|Azure Functions:<br/>Dedicated plan|When you run your function app in a [Dedicated (App Service) plan](../../azure-functions/dedicated-plan.md), required function app content is maintained using built-in storage. In a Dedicated plan, you can make on-demand custom backups or use automatic backups. You can restore a backup by overwriting an existing app or by restoring to a new app or slot.<br><br>For more information, see [Back up and restore your app in Azure App Service](../manage-backup.md).<br/><br/>Azure Files isn't used by a Dedicated plan, but if you have misconfigured your app [with an Azure Files connection](../../azure-functions/functions-app-settings.md#website_contentazurefileconnectionstring), backup isn't supported. | Current guidance regarding how to bring function app resources in a Dedicated plan back online in a different Azure region during a regional disaster is available at [Recover from region-wide failure - Azure App Service](../manage-disaster-recovery.md).<br><br>Starting March 31, 2025, App Service applications won't be placed in disaster recovery mode during a disaster in an Azure region as explained in the [recover from region-wide failure](../manage-disaster-recovery.md) article. You should instead [plan for reliability in your function apps](../../reliability/reliability-functions.md).<br><br>You can also refer to [commonly used disaster recovery techniques](../overview-disaster-recovery.md) for function apps in a Dedicated plan. |
|Azure Functions:<br/>Flex Consumption,<br/>Consumption, and Premium plans |Function apps that run in a [Flex Consumption plan](../../azure-functions/consumption-plan.md), in a [Consumption plan](../../azure-functions/consumption-plan.md), or in a [Premium plan](../../azure-functions/functions-premium-plan.md) can't use custom or automatic backup functionality in App Service. In these dynamic scale plans, function app content is maintained in Azure Storage. Use [Azure Storage redundancy](../../storage/common/storage-redundancy.md) options to ensure your storage account meets its availability and durability targets during an outage.<br><br>You can also [download your existing function app project as a .zip file](../../azure-functions/deployment-zip-push.md) from the Azure portal. | We strongly encourage you to [plan for reliability in your function apps](../../reliability/reliability-functions.md).|
