[Azure App Service](../../overview.md) provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service.  This quickstart tutorial shows how to deploy a PHP app to Azure App Service on Windows.

You create the web app using the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli) in Cloud Shell, and you use Git to deploy sample PHP code to the web app.

![Sample app running in Azure](../../media/quickstart-php/hello-world-in-browser.png)

You can follow the steps here using a Mac, Windows, or Linux machine. Once the prerequisites are installed, it takes about five minutes to complete the steps.

> [!NOTE]
> [After November 28, 2022, PHP will only be supported on App Service on Linux.](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-linux-docs/blob/master/Runtime_Support/php_support.md#end-of-life-for-php-74)

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart:

* <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Install Git</a>
* <a href="https://php.net/manual/install.php" target="_blank">Install PHP</a>

## Download the sample locally

1. In a terminal window, run the following commands. It will clone the sample application to your local machine, and navigate to the directory containing the sample code.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/php-docs-hello-world
    cd php-docs-hello-world
    ```
    
1. Make sure the default branch is `main`.

    ```bash
    git branch -m main
    ```
    
    > [!TIP]
    > The branch name change isn't required by App Service. However, since many repositories are changing their default branch to `main`, this quickstart also shows you how to deploy a repository from `main`.
    
## Run the app locally

1. Run the application locally so that you see how it should look when you deploy it to Azure. Open a terminal window and use the `php` command to launch the built-in PHP web server.

    ```bash
    php -S localhost:8080
    ```
    
1. Open a web browser, and navigate to the sample app at `http://localhost:8080`.

    You see the **Hello World!** message from the sample app displayed in the page.
    
    ![Sample app running locally](../../media/quickstart-php/localhost-hello-world-in-browser.png)
    
1. In your terminal window, press **Ctrl+C** to exit the web server.

## Create a web app

1. In the Cloud Shell, create a web app in the `myAppServicePlan` App Service plan with the [`az webapp create`](/cli/azure/webapp#az_webapp_create) command.

    In the following example, replace `<app-name>` with a globally unique app name (valid characters are `a-z`, `0-9`, and `-`). The runtime is set to `PHP|7.4`. To see all supported runtimes, run [`az webapp list-runtimes`](/cli/azure/webapp#az_webapp_list_runtimes).

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az webapp create --resource-group myResourceGroup --plan myAppServicePlan --name <app-name> --runtime 'PHP|8.1' --deployment-local-git
    ```
    
    When the web app has been created, the Azure CLI shows output similar to the following example:

    <pre>
    Local git is configured with url of 'https://&lt;username&gt;@&lt;app-name&gt;.scm.azurewebsites.net/&lt;app-name&gt;.git'
    {
      "availabilityState": "Normal",
      "clientAffinityEnabled": true,
      "clientCertEnabled": false,
      "cloningInfo": null,
      "containerSize": 0,
      "dailyMemoryTimeQuota": 0,
      "defaultHostName": "&lt;app-name&gt;.azurewebsites.net",
      "enabled": true,
      &lt; JSON data removed for brevity. &gt;
    }
    </pre>
    
    You've created an empty new web app, with git deployment enabled.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The URL of the Git remote is shown in the `deploymentLocalGitUrl` property, with the format `https://<username>@<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/<app-name>.git`. Save this URL as you need it later.
    >

1. Browse to your newly created web app. Replace _&lt;app-name>_ with your unique app name created in the prior step.

    ```bash
    http://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net
    ```

    Here's what your new web app should look like:

## Browse to the app

Browse to the deployed application using your web browser.

```
http://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net
```

The PHP sample code is running in an Azure App Service web app.

![Sample app running in Azure](../../media/quickstart-php/hello-world-in-browser.png)

**Congratulations!** You've deployed your first PHP app to App Service.

## Update locally and redeploy the code

1. Using a local text editor, open the `index.php` file within the PHP app, and make a small change to the text within the string next to `echo`:

    ```php
    echo "Hello Azure!";
    ```

1. In the local terminal window, commit your changes in Git, and then push the code changes to Azure.

    ```bash
    git commit -am "updated output"
    git push azure main
    ```

1. Once deployment has completed, return to the browser window that opened during the **Browse to the app** step, and refresh the page.

## Manage your new Azure app

1. Go to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure portal</a> to manage the web app you created. Search for and select **App Services**.

    ![Search for App Services, Azure portal, create PHP web app](../../media/quickstart-php/navigate-to-app-services-in-the-azure-portal.png)

2. Select the name of your Azure app.

    ![Portal navigation to Azure app](../../media/quickstart-php/php-docs-hello-world-app-service-list.png)

    Your web app's **Overview** page will be displayed. Here, you can perform basic management tasks like **Browse**, **Stop**, **Restart**, and **Delete**.

    ![App Service page in Azure portal](../../media/quickstart-php/php-docs-hello-world-app-service-detail.png)

    The web app menu provides different options for configuring your app.
