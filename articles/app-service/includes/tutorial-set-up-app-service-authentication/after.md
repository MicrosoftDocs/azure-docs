## 1. Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## 2. Create and publish a web app on App Service

For this tutorial, you need a web app deployed to App Service. You can use an existing web app, or you can follow one of the quickstarts to create and publish a new web app to App Service:

* [ASP.NET Core](../../quickstart-dotnetcore.md)
* [Node.js](../../quickstart-nodejs.md) 
* [Python](../../quickstart-python.md)
* [Java](../../quickstart-java.md)

Whether you use an existing web app or create a new one, take note of the following: 

* **Web app name**.
* **Resource group** that the web app is deployed to. 

You need these names throughout this tutorial. 

## 3. Configure authentication and authorization

Now that you have a web app running on App Service, enable authentication and authorization. You use Microsoft Entra as the identity provider. For more information, see [Configure Microsoft Entra authentication for your App Service application](../../configure-authentication-provider-aad.md).

# [Workforce configuration](#tab/workforce-configuration)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) menu, select **Resource groups**, or search for and select **Resource groups** from any page.

1. In **Resource groups**, find and select your resource group. In **Overview**, select your app's management page.

    :::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting your app's management page." source="../../media/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service/select-app-service.png":::
    
1. On your app's left menu, select **Authentication**, and then select **Add identity provider**.

1. In the **Add an identity provider** page, select **Microsoft** as the **Identity provider** to sign in Microsoft and Microsoft Entra identities.

1. For **Tenant type**, select **Workforce configuration (current tenant)** for employees and business guests.

1. For **App registration** > **App registration type**, select **Create new app registration** to create a new app registration in Microsoft Entra.

1. Enter a display **Name** for your application. Users of your application might see the display name when they use the app, for example during sign-in.

1. For **Client secret expiration**, select **Recommended: 180 days**.

1. For **App registration** > **Supported account types**, select **Current tenant-single tenant** so only users in your organization can sign in to the web app.

1. In the **Additional checks** section, select:

    - **Allow requests only from this application itself** for **Client application requirement**
    - **Allow requests from any identity** for **Identity requirement**
    - **Allow requests only from the issuer tenant** for **Tenant requirement** 

1. In the **App Service authentication settings** section, set:
    - **Require authentication** for **Authentication**
    - **HTTP 302 Found redirect: recommended for websites** for **Unauthenticated requests**
    - **Token store** box

1. At the bottom of the **Add an identity provider** page, select **Add** to enable authentication for your web app.

    :::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot that shows configuring authentication." source="../../media/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service/configure-authentication.png":::
    
    You now have an app that's secured by the App Service authentication and authorization.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To allow accounts from other tenants, change the 'Issuer URL' to 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0' by editing your 'Identity Provider' from the 'Authentication' blade.
    >

# [External configuration](#tab/external-configuration)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) menu, select **Resource groups**, or search for and select **Resource groups** from any page.

1. In **Resource groups**, find and select your resource group. In **Overview**, select your app's management page.

    :::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting your app's management page." source="../../media/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service/select-app-service.png":::
    
1. On your app's left menu, select **Authentication**, and then select **Add identity provider**.

1. In the **Add an identity provider** page, select **Microsoft** as the **Identity provider** to sign in Microsoft and Microsoft Entra identities.

1. For **Tenant type**, select **External configuration** for external users.

1. Select **Create new app registration** to create a new app registration.

1. Select an existing tenant to use from the drop-down, or select **Create new** to create a new [external tenant](/entra/external-id/customers/quickstart-tenant-setup).

    :::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Select a tenant dropdown." source="../../media/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service/configure-authentication-external-select.png":::

1. (Optional) In the **Create a tenant** page, add the *Tenant Name** and **Domain Name**.  Select a **Location** and select **Review and create** and then **Create**.

    :::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot the Create a tenant page." source="../../media/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service/configure-authentication-external-create-tenant.png":::

1. Select **Configure** to configure external authentication.

1. The browser opens **Configure customer authentication**.  In **Setup sign-in**, select **Create new** to create a sign-in experience for your external users.

1. Enter a **Name** for the user flow.

1. For this quickstart, select **Email and password** which allows new users to sign up and sign in using an email address as the sign-in name and a password as their first factor credential.

1. Select **Create** to create the user flow.

    :::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot that shows creating a user flow." source="../../media/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service/configure-authentication-external-user-flow.png":::

1. Select **Next** to customize branding.

1. Add your company logo, select a background color, and select a sign-in layout.

    :::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the customized branding tab." source="../../media/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service/configure-authentication-branding.png":::

1. Select **Next**.  If the tenant you selected already has a branding configuration you will need to confirm that you want to override it.

1. Select **Configure** in the **Review** tab to confirm external tenant update. 

1. The browser returns to the **Add an identity provider** page.

1. In the **Additional checks** section, select:

    - **Allow requests only from this application itself** for **Client application requirement**
    - **Allow requests from any identity** for **Identity requirement**
    - **Allow requests only from the issuer tenant** for **Tenant requirement**    

1. In the **App Service authentication settings** section, set:
    - **Require authentication** for **Authentication**
    - **HTTP 302 Found redirect: recommended for websites** for **Unauthenticated requests**
    - **Token store** box

1. At the bottom of the **Add an identity provider** page, select **Add** to enable authentication for your web app.

## 4. Verify limited access to the web app

When you enabled the App Service authentication/authorization module in the previous section, an app registration was created in your workforce or external tenant. The app registration has the display name you created in a previous step. 

1. To check the settings, sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Application Developer](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-developer).  If you chose external configuration, use the **Settings** icon  in the top menu to switch to the external tenant with your web app from the **Directories** + **subscriptions** menu.   When you are in the correct tenant:

1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations** and select **Applications** > **App registrations** from the menu. 
1. Select the app registration that was created. 
1. In the overview, verify that **Supported account types** is set to **My organization only**.
    
1. To verify that access to your app is limited to users in your organization, go to your web app **Overview** and select the **Default domain** link.  Or, start a browser in incognito or private mode and go to `https://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net` (see [note at top](#dnl-note)).

    :::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot that shows verifying access." source="../../media/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service/verify-access.png":::

1. You should be directed to a secured sign-in page, verifying that unauthenticated users aren't allowed access to the site.
1. Sign in as a user in your organization to gain access to the site.
    You can also start up a new browser and try to sign in by using a personal account to verify that users outside the organization don't have access.
