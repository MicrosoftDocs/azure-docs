## Automatic authentication provided by App Service

App Service provides built-in authentication and authorization support, so you can sign in users with no code in your web app. Using the optional App Service authentication/authorization module simplifies authentication and authorization for your app. When you're ready for custom authentication and authorization, you build on this architecture.

App service authentication provides:

* Easily turn on and configure through the Azure portal and app settings. 
* No SDKs, specific languages, or changes to application code are required.​ 
* Several identity providers are supported:
    * Microsoft Entra
    * Microsoft Account
    * Facebook
    * Google
    * X

When the authentication/authorization module is enabled, every incoming HTTP request passes through it before being handled by your app code.​​ To learn more, see [Authentication and authorization in Azure App Service](../../overview-authentication-authorization.md).
