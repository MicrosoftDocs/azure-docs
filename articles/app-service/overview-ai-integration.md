# Integrate AI into your Azure App Service applications

This article guides you to language-specific tutorials and resources to help you build intelligent applications with App Service.

Azure App Service makes it easy to integrate AI capabilities into your web applications across multiple programming languages and frameworks. Whether you want to use powerful Azure OpenAI models, deploy local small language models (SLMs) directly with your apps, or implement advanced patterns like retrieval augmented generation (RAG), App Service provides the flexible, secure platform you need for AI-powered applications.

App Service offers several advantages for developing and deploying AI-powered applications:

- **Native integration with Azure AI services** - Seamlessly connect to Azure OpenAI and other AI services using managed identities for secure, passwordless authentication
- **Local SLM support** - Use sidecar extensions to deploy smaller language models directly with your application
- **Enterprise-grade security** - Implement network isolation, end-to-end encryption, and role-based access control
- **Simplified DevOps with GitHub integration** - Streamline CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, leverage GitHub Codespaces with integrated GitHub Copilot for AI-assisted development, and create end-to-end workflows from development to production deployment

## .NET applications
