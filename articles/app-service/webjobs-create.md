# Run background tasks with WebJobs

This article explains how to deploy WebJobs by using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to upload an executable or script. WebJobs is a feature of [Azure App Service](index.yml) that allows you to run a program or script in the same instance as a web app. All app service plans support WebJobs. There's no extra cost to use WebJobs.

## Overview

WebJobs is a feature of [Azure App Service](index.yml) that enables you to run a program or script in the same instance as a web app. All app service plans support WebJobs. There's no extra cost to use WebJobs.

If you're using Visual Studio instead of the Azure App Service to develop and deploy WebJobs, see [Develop and deploy WebJobs using Visual Studio](webjobs-dotnet-deploy-vs.md).

Azure Functions provides another way to run programs and scripts. For a comparison between WebJobs and Functions, see [Choose the right integration and automation services in Azure](../azure-functions/functions-compare-logic-apps-ms-flow-webjobs.md).

## WebJob types

[!INCLUDE [webjob-types](./includes/webjobs-create/webjob-types.md)]

### Continuous vs. triggered WebJobs

The following table describes the differences between *continuous* and *triggered* WebJobs:

|Continuous  |Triggered  |
|---------|---------|
| Starts immediately when the WebJob is created. To keep the job from ending, the program or script typically does its work inside an endless loop. If the job does end, you can restart it. Typically used with WebJobs SDK. | Starts only when triggered manually or on a schedule. |
| Runs on all instances that the web app runs on. You can optionally restrict the WebJob to a single instance. |Runs on a single instance that Azure selects for load balancing.|
| Supports remote debugging. | Doesn't support remote debugging.|
| Code is deployed under `\site\wwwroot\app_data\Jobs\Continuous`. | Code is deployed under `\site\wwwroot\app_data\Jobs\Triggered`. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you have source control configured for your application, Webjobs should be deployed as part of the source control integration. After source control is configured for your application, a WebJob can't be added from the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to the **App Service** page of your App Service web app, API app, or mobile app.

1. Under **Settings** in the left pane, select **WebJobs**, then select **Add**.

   | Setting      | Sample value   | Description  |
   | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------ |
   | **Name** | myContinuousWebJob | A unique WebJob name. Must start with a letter or a number and must not contain special characters other than `"-"` and `"_"`. |
   | **File Upload** | ConsoleApp.zip | A *.zip* file that contains your executable or script file and any supporting files needed to run the program or script. The supported executable or script file types are listed in the [Supported file types](#acceptablefiles) section. |
   | **Type** | Continuous | The [WebJob types](#webjob-types) are described earlier in this article. |
   | **Scale** | Multi Instance | Available only for Continuous WebJobs. Determines whether the program or script runs on all instances or one instance.

## NCRONTAB expressions

An NCRONTAB expression is similar to a CRON expression, but includes an additional sixth field at the beginning for time precision in seconds. You can enter an [NCRONTAB expression](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-timer.md#ncrontab-expressions) in the portal or include a `settings.job` file at the root of your WebJob *.zip* file, as in the following example:

```json
{
    "schedule": "0 */15 * * * *"
}
```

To learn more, see [Scheduling a triggered WebJob](webjobs-dotnet-deploy-vs.md#scheduling-a-triggered-webjob).

[!INCLUDE [webjobs-cron-timezone-note](../../includes/webjobs-cron-timezone-note.md)]

## Manage WebJobs

You can manage the run state of individual WebJobs running in your site by using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Go to **Settings** > **WebJobs**, choose the WebJob, and you can start and stop the WebJob. You can also view and modify the password of the webhook that runs the WebJob.  

You can also [configure an app setting](configure-common.md#configure-app-settings) named `WEBJOBS_STOPPED` with a value of `1` to stop all WebJobs running on your site. You can use this method to prevent conflicting WebJobs from running both in staging and production slots. You can similarly use a value of `1` for the `WEBJOBS_DISABLE_SCHEDULE` setting to disable triggered WebJobs in the site or a staging slot. For slots, remember to enable the **Deployment slot setting** option so that the setting itself doesn't get swapped.

## <a name="ViewJobHistory"></a> View the job history

1. For the WebJob you want to see, select **Logs**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/webjobs-create/open-logs.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to access logs for a WebJob." lightbox="media/webjobs-create/open-logs.png":::

1. In the **WebJob Details** page, select a time to see details for one run.

    :::image type="content" source="media/webjobs-create/webjob-details-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to choose a WebJob run to see its detailed logs." lightbox="media/webjobs-create/webjob-details-page.png":::

1. In the **WebJob Run Details** page, you can select **download** to get a text file of the logs, or select the **WebJobs** breadcrumb link at the top of the page to see logs for a different WebJob.

## WebJob status

The following is a list of common WebJob states:

- **Initializing**: The app has started and the WebJob is going through its initialization process.
- **Starting**: The WebJob is starting up.
- **Running**: The WebJob is running.
- **PendingRestart**: A continuous WebJob exits in less than two minutes since it started for any reason, and App Service waits 60 seconds before restarting the WebJob. If the continuous WebJob exits after the two-minute mark, App Service doesn't wait the 60 seconds and restarts the WebJob immediately. 
- **Stopped**: The WebJob was stopped (usually from the Azure portal) and is currently not running and won't run until you start it again manually, even for a continuous or scheduled WebJob.
- **Aborted**: This can occur for many of reasons, such as when a long-running WebJob reaches the time-out marker.
