# Run background tasks with WebJobs in Azure App Service

Deploy WebJobs by using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to upload an executable or script. You can run background tasks in the Azure App Service.

If instead of the Azure App Service, you're using Visual Studio to develop and deploy WebJobs, see [Deploy WebJobs using Visual Studio](webjobs-dotnet-deploy-vs.md).

> [!NOTE]
> WebJobs for **Windows container**, **Linux code**, and **Linux container** is in preview. WebJobs for Windows code is generally available and not in preview.

## Overview

WebJobs is a feature of [Azure App Service](index.yml) that enables you to run a program or script in the same instance as a web app. All app service plans support WebJobs. There's no extra cost to use WebJobs.

[!INCLUDE [regionalization-note](./includes/regionalization-note.md)]

You can use the Azure WebJobs SDK with WebJobs to simplify many programming tasks. For more information, see [What is the WebJobs SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/wiki).

Azure Functions provides another way to run programs and scripts. For a comparison between WebJobs and Functions, see [Choose between Flow, Logic Apps, Functions, and WebJobs](../azure-functions/functions-compare-logic-apps-ms-flow-webjobs.md).

## WebJob types

### <a name="acceptablefiles"></a>Supported file types for scripts or programs

### [Windows code](#tab/windowscode)
The following file types are supported:<br>
**.cmd**, **.bat**, **.exe** (using Windows cmd)<br>**.ps1** (using PowerShell)<br>**.sh** (using Bash)<br>**.js** (using Node.js)<br>**.jar** (using Java)<br><br>The necessary runtimes to run these file types are already installed on the web app instance.
### [Windows container](#tab/windowscontainer)
> [!NOTE]
> WebJobs for Windows container is in preview.
>

The following file types are supported:<br>
**.cmd**, **.bat**, **.exe** (using Windows cmd)<br><br>In addition to these file types, WebJobs written in the language runtime of the Windows container app.<br>Example: .jar and .war scripts if the container is a Java app.
### [Linux code](#tab/linuxcode)
> [!NOTE]
> WebJobs for Linux code is in preview. 
>

**.sh** scripts are supported.<br><br>In addition to shell scripts, WebJobs written in the language of the selected runtime are also supported.<br>Example: Python (.py) scripts if the main site is a Python code app.
### [Linux container](#tab/linuxcontainer)
> [!NOTE]
> WebJobs for Linux container is in preview. 
>

**.sh** scripts are supported. <br><br>In addition to shell scripts, WebJobs written in the language runtime of the Linux container app are also supported. <br>Example: Node (.js) scripts if the site is a Node.js app.

### Continuous vs. triggered WebJobs

The following table describes the differences between *continuous* and *triggered* WebJobs:

|Continuous  |Triggered  |
|---------|---------|
| Starts immediately when the WebJob is created. To keep the job from ending, the program or script typically does its work inside an endless loop. If the job does end, you can restart it. Typically used with WebJobs SDK. | Starts only when triggered manually or on a schedule. |
| Runs on all instances that the web app runs on. You can optionally restrict the WebJob to a single instance. |Runs on a single instance that Azure selects for load balancing.|
| Supports remote debugging. | Doesn't support remote debugging.|
| Code is deployed under `\site\wwwroot\app_data\Jobs\Continuous`. | Code is deployed under `\site\wwwroot\app_data\Jobs\Triggered`. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you have source control configured for your application, Webjobs should be deployed as part of the source control integration. After source control is configured for your application, a WebJob can't be added from the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to the **App Service** page of your App Service web app, API app, or mobile app.

1. From the left pane, select **WebJobs**, then select **Add**.

   | **Type** | Continuous | The [WebJob types](#webjob-types) are described earlier in this article. |
   | **Scale** | Multi Instance | Available only for Continuous WebJobs. Determines whether the program or script runs on all instances or one instance. The option to run on multiple instances doesn't apply to the Free or Shared [pricing tiers](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio). | 

1. The new WebJob appears on the **WebJobs** page. If you see a message that says the WebJob was added, but you don't see it, select **Refresh**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/webjobs-create/scheduled-webjob-run.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to run a manually scheduled WebJob in the Azure portal.":::

## NCRONTAB expressions

You can enter a [NCRONTAB expression](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-timer.md#ncrontab-expressions) in the portal or include a `settings.job` file at the root of your WebJob *.zip* file, as in the following example:

```json
{
    "schedule": "0 */15 * * * *"
}
```

To learn more, see [Scheduling a triggered WebJob](webjobs-dotnet-deploy-vs.md#scheduling-a-triggered-webjob).

[!INCLUDE [webjobs-cron-timezone-note](../../includes/webjobs-cron-timezone-note.md)]

## Manage WebJobs

You can manage the running state individual WebJobs running in your site in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Go to **Settings** > **WebJobs**, choose the WebJob, and you can start and stop the WebJob. You can also view and modify the password of the webhook that runs the WebJob.  

You can also [add an application setting](configure-common.md#configure-app-settings) named `WEBJOBS_STOPPED` with a value of `1` to stop all WebJobs running on your site. You can use this method to prevent conflicting WebJobs from running both in staging and production slots. You can similarly use a value of `1` for the `WEBJOBS_DISABLE_SCHEDULE` setting to disable triggered WebJobs in the site or a staging slot. For slots, remember to enable the **Deployment slot setting** option so that the setting itself doesn't get swapped.    

## <a name="ViewJobHistory"></a> View the job history

1. For the WebJob you want to see, select **Logs**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/webjobs-create/open-logs.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to access logs for a WebJob.":::
   
2. In the **WebJob Details** page, select a time to see details for one run.
   
    :::image type="content" source="media/webjobs-create/webjob-details-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to choose a WebJob run to see its detailed logs.":::

3. In the **WebJob Run Details** page, you can select **download** to get a text file of the logs, or select the **WebJobs** breadcrumb link at the top of the page to see logs for a different WebJob.

## WebJob statuses

The following is a list of common WebJob statuses:

- **Initializing**  The app has started and the WebJob is going through its initialization process.
- **Starting**  The WebJob is starting up.
- **Running**  The WebJob is running.
- **PendingRestart**  A continuous WebJob exits in less than two minutes since it started for any reason, and App Service waits 60 seconds before restarting the WebJob. If the continuous WebJob exits after the two-minute mark, App Service doesn't wait the 60 seconds and restarts the WebJob immediately. 
- **Stopped**  The WebJob was stopped (usually from the Azure portal) and is currently not running and won't run until you start it again manually, even for a continuous or scheduled WebJob.
- **Aborted**  This can occur for many of reasons, such as when a long-running WebJob reaches the timeout marker.
