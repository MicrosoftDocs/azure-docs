# Create a web app and deploy code to a staging environment

This sample script creates a web app in App Service with an additional deployment slot called "staging", and then deploys a sample app to the "staging" slot.

Before running this script, ensure that a connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command. 

This sample works in a Bash shell. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows client, see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-cli-options.md).

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/deploy-deployment-slot/deploy-deployment-slot.sh "Create a web app and deploy code to a staging environment")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the follow command can be used to remove the Resource Group, App Service app, and all related resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```
