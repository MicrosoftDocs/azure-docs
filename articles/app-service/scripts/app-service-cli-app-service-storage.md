# Connect a web app to a storage account

In this scenario you will learn how to create an Azure storage account and an Azure web app. Then you will link the storage account to the web app using app settings.

Before running this script, ensure that a connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command.

This sample works in a Bash shell. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows client, see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-cli-options.md).

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/connect-to-storage/connect-to-storage.sh "Azure Storage")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the follow command can be used to remove the Resource Group, App Service app, and all related resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, web app, storage account and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| [az appservice plan create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/appservice/plan#create) | Creates an App Service plan. This is like a server farm for your Azure web app. |
