# Scale an App Service app manually using Azure CLI

This sample script creates a resource group, an App Service plan, and an app. It then scales the App Service plan from a single instance to multiple instances.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, you need Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/scale-manual/scale-manual.sh "Manual Scale")]
