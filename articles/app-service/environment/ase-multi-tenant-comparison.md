# App Service Environment v3 and App Service public multitenant comparison

An App Service Environment is an Azure App Service feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for running App Service apps securely at high scale. Compared to the public multitenant offering, where the supporting infrastructure is shared with other customers, an App Service Environment provides enhanced security, isolation, and network access control.

This article compares the differentiating features of App Service Environment v3 and the public multitenant offering of App Service.

## Hosting

|Feature  |App Service Environment v3  |App Service public multitenant  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Hosting environment|[Fully isolated and dedicated compute](overview.md).|[Shared environment](../../app-service/overview.md). Workers running your apps are dedicated, but the supporting infrastructure is shared with other customers. |
|Hardware|[Virtual machine scale sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview).|[Virtual machine scale sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview).|
|[Pricing tiers](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/windows/) |Isolated v2.        |Free, Basic, Standard, Premium v2, Premium v3, Premium v4.        |
|Dedicated host group|[Available](overview.md#dedicated-environment). |Not available. |
|Remote file storage|Fully dedicated to the App Service Environment. |Remote file storage for the application is dedicated, but the storage is hosted on a shared file server. |
|Private inbound configuration|Yes, using the internal load balancer (ILB) App Service Environment variation. |Yes, via private endpoint. |
|Planned maintenance|[Manual upgrade preference is available](how-to-upgrade-preference.md). |[The platform handles maintenance](../../app-service/routine-maintenance.md). |
|Aggregate storage limit for remote file shares|1 TB for all apps in App Service Environment v3.|250 GB for all apps in a single App Service plan. 500 GB for all apps across all App Service plans in a single resource group.|

## Scaling

Both App Service Environment v3 and the public multitenant offering run on [virtual machine scale sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview). Both offerings benefit from the capabilities that scale sets provide.

However, App Service Environment v3 is a dedicated environment. Even though it can scale out to more instances than the public multitenant offering, scaling out to multiple instances can be slower than the public multitenant offering.

|Feature  |App Service Environment v3  |App Service public multitenant  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Maximum instance count|100 instances per App Service plan. Maximum of 200 instances across all plans in a single App Service Environment v3.|30 instances per App Service plan. This limit can't be raised.|
|Scaling speed|Slower scaling times due to the dedicated nature of the environment.|Faster scaling times due to the shared nature of the environment.|

## Certificates and domains

|Feature  |App Service Environment v3  |App Service public multitenant  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Custom domains|A [custom domain suffix](how-to-custom-domain-suffix.md) can be added to the App Service Environment, and all apps inherit the domain suffix. Custom domains can also be added directly to the apps. |[Custom domains](../../app-service/tutorial-secure-domain-certificate.md) can be added directly to the apps.|
|Custom domain on private DNS (no domain verification required)|Yes, on an ILB App Service Environment.|No. The custom domain needs to resolve via public DNS.|
|Inbound TLS|Yes. You can manage SSL certificates directly within the environment, including the ability to upload and bind custom SSL certificates.|Yes. You can bring your own certificate or use an Azure-provided certificate. |
|Inbound TLS using certificates issued by private certificate authority (CA)|Supported.|Not supported.|
|Outbound calls using client certificates issued by private CA|[Supported only from custom code in Windows code-based apps](overview-certificates.md#private-client-certificate). You can load your own root CA certificate into the trusted root store.|Not supported for source-code based deployments. Supported if you deploy by using either Windows containers or Linux containers. (You can install arbitrary dependencies, including private CA-issued client certificates, inside a custom container for both platform variants.)|
|App Service managed certificates|[Not supported](overview-certificates.md#limitations).|[Supported](../../app-service/configure-ssl-app-service-certificate.md).|
|Certificates shared across apps|Yes.|No. You must upload the certificate to every app.|
|Public certificate limit|1,000 public certificates per App Service plan.|1,000 public certificates per App Service plan.|
|End-to-end TLS encryption for inbound calls|Supported.|Supported in preview for Linux, but not supported on Windows.|
|Changing TLS cipher suite order|[Supported](app-service-app-service-environment-custom-settings.md#change-tls-cipher-suite-order).|[Supported with the minimum TLS cipher suite feature](../../app-service/configure-ssl-bindings.md#enforce-tls-versions).|

## Networks

|Feature  |App Service Environment v3  |App Service public multitenant  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Virtual network integration|Yes. App Service Environment v3 is deployed into a subnet in your virtual network by default. |Supported, but [must be explicitly enabled](../../app-service/networking-features.md).|
|Private endpoint support|Yes, but [must be explicitly enabled in the App Service Environment](networking.md#private-endpoint). |Yes, but [must be explicitly enabled](../../app-service/networking-features.md#private-endpoint). |
|IP access restrictions for inbound traffic|Yes, but [must be explicitly enabled](../../app-service/networking-features.md#access-restrictions). |Yes, but [must be explicitly enabled](../../app-service/networking-features.md#access-restrictions). |
|Network security group (NSG) integration|Supports inbound and outbound traffic control. |Can use NSG for inbound traffic control via the subnet that sourced the IP of a private endpoint. (Note that the feature requires private endpoints.) Supports outbound network restrictions with NSG on the virtual network integration subnet. |
|User-defined route (UDR) integration|Supports outbound traffic routing, but [must be explicitly enabled](networking.md#network-routing). |Supports outbound traffic routing, but [must be explicitly enabled](../../app-service/networking-features.md). |
|Routing outbound traffic over a virtual network|Yes. All apps are in the same subnet, and all outbound traffic is routed through the virtual network by default. |[Supported](../../app-service/overview-vnet-integration.md#routes). |
|[Blocking inbound traffic to App Service functionality hosted on non-HTTP ports](../../app-service/networking-features.md#app-service-ports)|Supported. NSG can be used to block inbound traffic to non-HTTP ports. |Not supported. In some cases (FTP and remote debugging), functionality can be explicitly disabled on a per-application basis. However, inbound network traffic can't be blocked via NSGs because the underlying App Service platform that hosts the infrastructure owns the listed ports. |
|Pulling Docker containers over a virtual network|Supported. Uses the subnet of the App Service Environment.|[Supported](../../app-service/overview-vnet-integration.md#container-image-pull).|
|Azure Functions storage account access over a virtual network|Supported. Uses the subnet of the App Service Environment.|[Supported](../../app-service/overview-vnet-integration.md#content-share).|
|Backup/restore over a virtual network|Supported. Uses the subnet of the App Service Environment.|[Supported](../../app-service/overview-vnet-integration.md#backuprestore).|
|Maximum outbound TCP/IP connections per virtual machine instance|16,000.|1,920 per P1V3 instance. 3,968 per P2V3 instance. 8,064 per P3V3 instance.|
|Maximum source network address translation (SNAT) ports per virtual machine instance|Dynamic: 256 to 1,024, depending on the total instance count.|128 per instance.|

## Pricing

App Service Environment v3 tends to be more expensive than the public multitenant offering, due to the dedicated nature of the infrastructure. For both offerings, you pay for only the resources that you use. Reserved instances and savings plans are available for both offerings to save money on long-term commitments.

|---------|---------|---------|
|Pricing     |[Pay per instance](overview.md#pricing).|[Pay per instance](../../app-service/overview-hosting-plans.md).|
|Reserved instances|[Available](overview.md#pricing).|[Available](../../app-service/overview-hosting-plans.md).|
|Savings plans|[Available](overview.md#pricing).|[Available](../../app-service/overview-hosting-plans.md).|
|Availability zone pricing|[There's a minimum charge of 18 cores.](overview.md#pricing) There's no added charge for availability zone support if you have 18 or more cores across your App Service plan instances. If you have fewer than 18 cores across your App Service plans in the zone-redundant App Service Environment, the difference between 18 cores and the sum of the cores from the running instance count is charged as Windows I1v2 instances.|[Three-instance minimum enforced per App Service plan](../../reliability/reliability-app-service.md#cost).|
