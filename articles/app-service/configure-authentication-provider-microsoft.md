# Configure your App Service or Azure Functions app to use Microsoft Account login

[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-authentication](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-authentication.md)]

This topic shows you how to configure Azure App Service or Azure Functions to use Microsoft Entra ID to support personal Microsoft account logins.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While the Microsoft Account provider is still supported, it is recommended that apps instead use the [Microsoft identity platform provider (Microsoft Entra ID)](./configure-authentication-provider-aad.md). The Microsoft identity platform offers support for both organizational accounts and personal Microsoft accounts.

## <a name="register-microsoft-account"> </a>Register your app with Microsoft Account

To register your app with Microsoft Account: 

1. Go to [**App registrations**](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) in the Azure portal. If needed, sign in with your Microsoft account.
1. Select **New registration**, then enter an application name.
1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)**
1. In **Redirect URIs**, select **Web**, and then enter `https://<app-domain-name>/.auth/login/aad/callback`. Replace *\<app-domain-name>* with the domain name of your app.  For example, `https://contoso.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback`. Be sure to use the HTTPS scheme in the URL.

1. Select **Register**.
1. Copy the **Application (Client) ID**. You'll need it later.
1. From the left pane, select **Certificates & secrets** > **New client secret**. Enter a description, select the validity duration, and select **Add**.
1. Copy the value that appears on the **Certificates & secrets** page. After you leave the page, it won't be displayed again.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The client secret value (password) is an important security credential. Do not share the password with anyone or distribute it within a client application.

## <a name="secrets"> </a>Add Microsoft Account information to your App Service application

To add Microsoft Account information to your App Service application: 

1. Go to your application in the [Azure portal].
1. Select **Settings** > **Authentication / Authorization**, and make sure that **App Service Authentication** is **On**.
1. Under **Authentication Providers**, select **Microsoft Entra ID**. Select **Advanced** under **Management mode**. Paste in the Application (client) ID and client secret that you obtained earlier. Use **`https://login.microsoftonline.com/9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad/v2.0`** for the **Issuer Url** field.
1. Select **OK**.

   App Service provides authentication, but doesn't restrict authorized access to your site content and APIs. You must authorize users in your app code.

1. (Optional) To restrict access to Microsoft account users, set **Action to take when request is not authenticated** to **Log in with Microsoft Entra ID**. When you set this functionality, your app requires all requests to be authenticated. It also redirects all unauthenticated requests to use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication. Note that because you have configured your **Issuer Url** to use the Microsoft Account tenant, only personal accounts will successfully authenticate.

   > [!CAUTION]
   > Restricting access in this way applies to all calls to your app, which might not be desirable for apps that have a publicly available home page, as in many single-page applications. For such applications, **Allow anonymous requests (no action)** might be preferred so that the app manually starts authentication itself. For more information, see [Authentication flow](overview-authentication-authorization.md#authentication-flow).

1. Select **Save**.

You are now ready to use Microsoft Account for authentication in your app.
