# Tutorial: Build a chatbot with Azure App Service and Azure OpenAI (Flask)

In this tutorial, you'll build an intelligent AI application by integrating Azure OpenAI with a Python web application and deploying it to Azure App Service. You'll create a Flask app that sends chat completion requests to a model in Azure OpenAI.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an Azure OpenAI resource and deploy a language model.
> * Build a Flask application that connects to Azure OpenAI.
> * Deploy the application to Azure App Service.
> * Implement passwordless secure authentication both in the development environment and in Azure.

## Prerequisites

- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with an active subscription
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) for using GitHub Codespaces

## 1. Create an Azure OpenAI resource

[!INCLUDE [tutorial-ai-openai-chatbot/create-openai-resource](includes/tutorial-ai-openai-chatbot/create-openai-resource.md)]

## 2. Create and set up a Flask app

1. In your codespace terminal, create a virtual environment and install the PIP packages you need.

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install flask openai azure.identity dotenv
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

4. In the workspace root, create an *app.py* and copy the following code into it, for a simple chat completion call with Azure OpenAI.

    ```python
    import os
    from flask import Flask, render_template, request
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider
    from openai import AzureOpenAI
    
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    # Initialize the Azure OpenAI client with Microsoft Entra authentication
    token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(
        DefaultAzureCredential(), "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"
    )
    client = AzureOpenAI(
        api_version="2024-10-21",
        azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
        azure_ad_token_provider=token_provider,
    )
    
    @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def index():
        response = None
        if request.method == 'POST': # Handle form submission
            user_message = request.form.get('message')
            if user_message:
                try:
                    # Call the Azure OpenAI API with the user's message
                    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
                        model="gpt-4o-mini",
                        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_message}]
                    )
                    ai_message = completion.choices[0].message.content
                    response = ai_message
                except Exception as e:
                    response = f"Error: {e}"
        return render_template('index.html', response=response)
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run()
    ```
    
5. Create a *templates* directory and an *index.html* file in it. Copy the following code into it for a simple chat interface:

    ```html
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Azure OpenAI Chat</title>
        <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous">
    </head>
    <body>
        <main class="container py-4">
            <h1 class="mb-4 text-primary">Azure OpenAI Chat</h1>
            <form method="post" action="/" class="mb-3">
                <div class="input-group">
                    <input type="text" name="message" class="form-control" placeholder="Type your message..." required>
                    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Send</button>
                </div>
            </form>
            <div class="card p-3">
                {% if response %}
                    <div class="alert alert-info mt-3">{{ response }}</div>
                {% endif %}
            </div>
        </main>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    
6. In the terminal, retrieve your OpenAI endpoint:

    ```bash
    az cognitiveservices account show \
      --name $OPENAI_SERVICE_NAME \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --query properties.endpoint \
      --output tsv
    ```

7. Run the app by adding `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` with its value from the CLI output:

   ```bash
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<output-from-previous-cli-command> flask run
   ```

8. Select **Open in browser** to launch the app in a new browser tab. Submit a question and see if you get a response message.

## 3. Deploy to Azure App Service and configure OpenAI connection

Now that your app works locally, let's deploy it to Azure App Service and set up a service connection to Azure OpenAI using managed identity.

1. First, deploy your app to Azure App Service using the Azure CLI command `az webapp up`. This command creates a new web app and deploys your code to it:

    ```azurecli
    az webapp up \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --location $LOCATION \
      --name $APPSERVICE_NAME \
      --plan $APPSERVICE_NAME \
      --sku B1 \
      --os-type Linux \
      --track-status false
    ```

   This command might take a few minutes to complete. It creates a new web app in the same resource group as your OpenAI resource.

2. After the app is deployed, create a service connection between your web app and the Azure OpenAI resource using managed identity:

    ```azurecli
    az webapp connection create cognitiveservices \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --name $APPSERVICE_NAME \
      --target-resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --account $OPENAI_SERVICE_NAME \
      --connection azure-openai \
      --system-identity
    ```

   This command creates a connection between your web app and the Azure OpenAI resource by: 

    - Generating system-assigned managed identity for the web app.
    - Adding the Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor role to the managed identity for the Azure OpenAI resource.
    - Adding the `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` app setting to your web app.

3. Open the deployed web app in the browser. Find the URL of the deployed web app in the terminal output. Open your web browser and navigate to it.

    ```azurecli
    az webapp browse
    ```

4. Type a message in the textbox and select "**Send**, and give the app a few seconds to reply with the message from Azure OpenAI.

Your app is now deployed and connected to Azure OpenAI with managed identity.

### What if I want to connect to OpenAI instead of Azure OpenAI?

To connect to OpenAI instead, use the following code:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="<openai-api-key>"
)
```

For more information, see [How to switch between OpenAI and Azure OpenAI endpoints with Python](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/switching-endpoints).

When working with connection secrets in App Service, you should use [Key Vault references](app-service-key-vault-references.md) instead of storing secrets directly in your codebase. This ensures that sensitive information remains secure and is managed centrally.

---

### Can I connect to Azure OpenAI with an API key instead?

Yes, you can connect to Azure OpenAI using an API key instead of managed identity. This approach is supported by the Azure OpenAI SDKs and Semantic Kernel. 

- For details on using API keys with Semantic Kernel: [Semantic Kernel C# Quickstart](/semantic-kernel/get-started/quick-start-guide?pivots=programming-language-python).
- For details on using API keys with the Azure OpenAI client library: [Quickstart: Get started using chat completions with Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/ai-services/openai/chatgpt-quickstart?pivots=programming-language-python).

When working with connection secrets in App Service, you should use [Key Vault references](app-service-key-vault-references.md) instead of storing secrets directly in your codebase. This ensures that sensitive information remains secure and is managed centrally.

---

### How does DefaultAzureCredential work in this tutorial?

The `DefaultAzureCredential` simplifies authentication by automatically selecting the best available authentication method:

- **During local development**: After you run `az login`, it uses your local Azure CLI credentials.
- **When deployed to Azure App Service**: It uses the app's managed identity for secure, passwordless authentication.

This approach lets your code run securely and seamlessly in both local and cloud environments without modification.
