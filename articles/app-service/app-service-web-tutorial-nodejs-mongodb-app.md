# Tutorial: Build a Node.js and MongoDB web app in Azure

> [!NOTE]
> This article deploys an app to App Service on Windows. To deploy to App Service on _Linux_, see [Build a Node.js and MongoDB web app in Azure App Service on Linux](./containers/tutorial-nodejs-mongodb-app.md).
>

Azure Web Apps provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service. This tutorial shows how to create a Node.js web app in Azure and connect it to a MongoDB database. When you're done, you'll have a MEAN application (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js) running in [Azure App Service](app-service-web-overview.md). For simplicity, the sample application uses the [MEAN.js web framework](http://meanjs.org/).

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial:

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)
1. [Install Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/)
1. [Install Bower](https://bower.io/) (required by [MEAN.js](http://meanjs.org/docs/0.5.x/#getting-started))
1. [Install Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) (required by [MEAN.js](http://meanjs.org/docs/0.5.x/#getting-started))
1. [Install and run MongoDB Community Edition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) 

## Test local MongoDB

Open the terminal window and `cd` to the `bin` directory of your MongoDB installation. You can use this terminal window to run all the commands in this tutorial.

Run `mongo` in the terminal to connect to your local MongoDB server.

```bash
mongo
```

If your connection is successful, then your MongoDB database is already running. If not, make sure that your local MongoDB database is started by following the steps at [Install MongoDB Community Edition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/). Often, MongoDB is installed, but you still need to start it by running `mongod`. 

When you're done testing your MongoDB database, type `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. 

## Create local Node.js app

In this step, you set up the local Node.js project.

### Clone the sample application

In the terminal window, `cd` to a working directory.  

Run the following command to clone the sample repository. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/meanjs.git
```

This sample repository contains a copy of the [MEAN.js repository](https://github.com/meanjs/mean). It is modified to run on App Service (for more information, see the MEAN.js repository [README file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/meanjs/blob/master/README.md)).

### Run the application

Run the following commands to install the required packages and start the application.

```bash
cd meanjs
npm install
npm start
```

When the app is fully loaded, you see something similar to the following message:

```console
--
MEAN.JS - Development Environment

Environment:     development
Server:          http://0.0.0.0:3000
Database:        mongodb://localhost/mean-dev
App version:     0.5.0
MEAN.JS version: 0.5.0
--
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in a browser. Click **Sign Up** in the top menu and create a test user. 

The MEAN.js sample application stores user data in the database. If you are successful at creating a user and signing in, then your app is writing data to the local MongoDB database.

![MEAN.js connects successfully to MongoDB](./media/app-service-web-tutorial-nodejs-mongodb-app/mongodb-connect-success.png)

Select **Admin > Manage Articles** to add some articles.

To stop Node.js at any time, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. 

> [!NOTE]
> The [Node.js quickstart](app-service-web-get-started-nodejs.md) mentions the need for a web.config in the root app directory. However, in this tutorial, this web.config file will be automatically generated by App Service when you deploy your files using [local Git deployment](app-service-deploy-local-git.md) instead of ZIP file deployment. 

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

## Create production MongoDB

In this step, you create a MongoDB database in Azure. When your app is deployed to Azure, it uses this cloud database.

For MongoDB, this tutorial uses [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/documentdb/). Cosmos DB supports MongoDB client connections.

### Create a resource group

[!INCLUDE [Create resource group](../../includes/app-service-web-create-resource-group-no-h.md)] 

### Create a Cosmos DB account

> [!NOTE]
> There is a cost to creating the Azure Cosmos DB databases in this tutorial in your own Azure subscription. To use a free Azure Cosmos DB account for seven days, you can use the [Try Azure Cosmos DB for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cosmosdb/) experience. Just click the **Create** button in the MongoDB tile to create a free MongoDB database on Azure. Once the database is created, navigate to **Connection String** in the portal and retrieve your Azure Cosmos DB connection string for use later in the tutorial.
>

In the Cloud Shell, create a Cosmos DB account with the [`az cosmosdb create`](/cli/azure/cosmosdb?view=azure-cli-latest#az-cosmosdb-create) command.

In the following command, substitute a unique Cosmos DB name for the *\<cosmosdb_name>* placeholder. This name is used as the part of the Cosmos DB endpoint, `https://<cosmosdb_name>.documents.azure.com/`, so the name needs to be unique across all Cosmos DB accounts in Azure. The name must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-) character, and must be between 3 and 50 characters long.

```azurecli-interactive
az cosmosdb create --name <cosmosdb_name> --resource-group myResourceGroup --kind MongoDB
```

The *--kind MongoDB* parameter enables MongoDB client connections.

When the Cosmos DB account is created, the Azure CLI shows information similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "consistencyPolicy":
  {
    "defaultConsistencyLevel": "Session",
    "maxIntervalInSeconds": 5,
    "maxStalenessPrefix": 100
  },
  "databaseAccountOfferType": "Standard",
  "documentEndpoint": "https://<cosmosdb_name>.documents.azure.com:443/",
  "failoverPolicies": 
  ...
  < Output truncated for readability >
}
```

## Connect app to production MongoDB

In this step, you connect your MEAN.js sample application to the Cosmos DB database you just created, using a MongoDB connection string. 

### Retrieve the database key

To connect to the Cosmos DB database, you need the database key. In the Cloud Shell, use the [`az cosmosdb list-keys`](/cli/azure/cosmosdb?view=azure-cli-latest#az-cosmosdb-list-keys) command to retrieve the primary key.

```azurecli-interactive
az cosmosdb list-keys --name <cosmosdb_name> --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

The Azure CLI shows information similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "primaryMasterKey": "RS4CmUwzGRASJPMoc0kiEvdnKmxyRILC9BWisAYh3Hq4zBYKr0XQiSE4pqx3UchBeO4QRCzUt1i7w0rOkitoJw==",
  "primaryReadonlyMasterKey": "HvitsjIYz8TwRmIuPEUAALRwqgKOzJUjW22wPL2U8zoMVhGvregBkBk9LdMTxqBgDETSq7obbwZtdeFY7hElTg==",
  "secondaryMasterKey": "Lu9aeZTiXU4PjuuyGBbvS1N9IRG3oegIrIh95U6VOstf9bJiiIpw3IfwSUgQWSEYM3VeEyrhHJ4rn3Ci0vuFqA==",
  "secondaryReadonlyMasterKey": "LpsCicpVZqHRy7qbMgrzbRKjbYCwCKPQRl0QpgReAOxMcggTvxJFA94fTi0oQ7xtxpftTJcXkjTirQ0pT7QFrQ=="
}
```

Copy the value of `primaryMasterKey`. You need this information in the next step.

<a name="devconfig"></a>
### Configure the connection string in your Node.js application

In your local MEAN.js repository, in the _config/env/_ folder, create a file named _local-production.js_. By default, _.gitignore_ is configured to keep this file out of the repository. 

Copy the following code into it. Be sure to replace the two *\<cosmosdb_name>* placeholders with your Cosmos DB database name, and replace the *\<primary_master_key>* placeholder with the key you copied in the previous step.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  db: {
    uri: 'mongodb://<cosmosdb_name>:<primary_master_key>@<cosmosdb_name>.documents.azure.com:10250/mean?ssl=true&sslverifycertificate=false'
  }
};
```

The `ssl=true` option is required because [Cosmos DB requires SSL](../cosmos-db/connect-mongodb-account.md#connection-string-requirements). 

Save your changes.

### Test the application in production mode 

Run the following command to minify and bundle scripts for the production environment. This process generates the files needed by the production environment.

```bash
gulp prod
```

Run the following command to use the connection string you configured in _config/env/local-production.js_.

```bash
# Bash
NODE_ENV=production node server.js

# Windows PowerShell
$env:NODE_ENV = "production" 
node server.js
```

`NODE_ENV=production` sets the environment variable that tells Node.js to run in the production environment.  `node server.js` starts the Node.js server with `server.js` in your repository root. This is how your Node.js application is loaded in Azure. 

When the app is loaded, check to make sure that it's running in the production environment:

```console
--
MEAN.JS

Environment:     production
Server:          http://0.0.0.0:8443
Database:        mongodb://<cosmosdb_name>:<primary_master_key>@<cosmosdb_name>.documents.azure.com:10250/mean?ssl=true&sslverifycertificate=false
App version:     0.5.0
MEAN.JS version: 0.5.0
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8443` in a browser. Click **Sign Up** in the top menu and create a test user. If you are successful creating a user and signing in, then your app is writing data to the Cosmos DB database in Azure. 

In the terminal, stop Node.js by typing `Ctrl+C`. 

## Deploy app to Azure

In this step, you deploy your MongoDB-connected Node.js application to Azure App Service.

### Configure a deployment user

[!INCLUDE [Configure deployment user](../../includes/configure-deployment-user-no-h.md)]

### Create an App Service plan

[!INCLUDE [Create app service plan no h](../../includes/app-service-web-create-app-service-plan-no-h.md)]

<a name="create"></a>
### Create a web app

[!INCLUDE [Create web app](../../includes/app-service-web-create-web-app-nodejs-no-h.md)] 

### Configure an environment variable

By default, the MEAN.js project keeps _config/env/local-production.js_ out of the Git repository. So for your Azure web app, you use app settings to define your MongoDB connection string.

To set app settings, use the [`az webapp config appsettings set`](/cli/azure/webapp/config/appsettings?view=azure-cli-latest#az-webapp-config-appsettings-set) command in the Cloud Shell. 

The following example configures a `MONGODB_URI` app setting in your Azure web app. Replace the *\<app_name>*, *\<cosmosdb_name>*, and *\<primary_master_key>* placeholders.

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config appsettings set --name <app_name> --resource-group myResourceGroup --settings MONGODB_URI="mongodb://<cosmosdb_name>:<primary_master_key>@<cosmosdb_name>.documents.azure.com:10250/mean?ssl=true"
```

In Node.js code, you access this app setting with `process.env.MONGODB_URI`, just like you would access any environment variable. 

In your local MEAN.js repository, open _config/env/production.js_ (not _config/env/local-production.js_), which has production-environment specific configuration. The default MEAN.js app is already configured to use the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable that you created.

```javascript
db: {
  uri: ... || process.env.MONGODB_URI || ...,
  ...
},
```

### Push to Azure from Git

[!INCLUDE [app-service-plan-no-h](../../includes/app-service-web-git-push-to-azure-no-h.md)]

```bash
Counting objects: 5, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Writing objects: 100% (5/5), 489 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.

remote: Updating branch 'master'.

.
.
.
remote: Deployment successful.
To https://<app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/<app_name>.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
``` 

You may notice that the deployment process runs [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) after `npm install`. App Service does not run Gulp or Grunt tasks during deployment, so this sample repository has two additional files in its root directory to enable it: 

- _.deployment_ - This file tells App Service to run `bash deploy.sh` as the custom deployment script.
- _deploy.sh_ - The custom deployment script. If you review the file, you will see that it runs `gulp prod` after `npm install` and `bower install`. 

You can use this approach to add any step to your Git-based deployment. If you restart your Azure web app at any point, App Service doesn't rerun these automation tasks.

### Browse to the Azure web app 

Browse to the deployed web app using your web browser. 

```bash 
http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net 
``` 

Click **Sign Up** in the top menu and create a dummy user. 

If you are successful and the app automatically signs in to the created user, then your MEAN.js app in Azure has connectivity to the MongoDB (Cosmos DB) database.

Select **Admin > Manage Articles** to add some articles. 

**Congratulations!** You're running a data-driven Node.js app in Azure App Service.

## Update data model and redeploy

In this step, you change the `article` data model and publish your change to Azure.

### Update the data model

Open _modules/articles/server/models/article.server.model.js_.

In `ArticleSchema`, add a `String` type called `comment`. When you're done, your schema code should look like this:

```javascript
var ArticleSchema = new Schema({
  ...,
  user: {
    type: Schema.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User'
  },
  comment: {
    type: String,
    default: '',
    trim: true
  }
});
```

### Update the articles code

Update the rest of your `articles` code to use `comment`.

There are five files you need to modify: the server controller and the four client views. 

Open _modules/articles/server/controllers/articles.server.controller.js_.

In the `update` function, add an assignment for `article.comment`. The following code shows the completed `update` function:

```javascript
exports.update = function (req, res) {
  var article = req.article;

  article.title = req.body.title;
  article.content = req.body.content;
  article.comment = req.body.comment;

  ...
};
```

Open _modules/articles/client/views/view-article.client.view.html_.

Just above the closing `</section>` tag, add the following line to display `comment` along with the rest of the article data:

```HTML
<p class="lead" ng-bind="vm.article.comment"></p>
```

Open _modules/articles/client/views/list-articles.client.view.html_.

Just above the closing `</a>` tag, add the following line to display `comment` along with the rest of the article data:

```HTML
<p class="list-group-item-text" ng-bind="article.comment"></p>
```

Open _modules/articles/client/views/admin/list-articles.client.view.html_.

Inside the `<div class="list-group">` element and just above the closing `</a>` tag, add the following line to display `comment` along with the rest of the article data:

```HTML
<p class="list-group-item-text" data-ng-bind="article.comment"></p>
```

Open _modules/articles/client/views/admin/form-article.client.view.html_.

Find the `<div class="form-group">` element that contains the submit button, which looks like this:

```HTML
<div class="form-group">
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default">{{vm.article._id ? 'Update' : 'Create'}}</button>
</div>
```

Just above this tag, add another `<div class="form-group">` element that lets people edit the `comment` field. Your new element should look like this:

```HTML
<div class="form-group">
  <label class="control-label" for="comment">Comment</label>
  <textarea name="comment" data-ng-model="vm.article.comment" id="comment" class="form-control" cols="30" rows="10" placeholder="Comment"></textarea>
</div>
```

### Test your changes locally

Save all your changes.

In the local terminal window, test your changes in production mode again.

```bash
# Bash
gulp prod
NODE_ENV=production node server.js

# Windows PowerShell
gulp prod
$env:NODE_ENV = "production" 
node server.js
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8443` in a browser and make sure that you're signed in.

Select **Admin > Manage Articles**, then add an article by selecting the **+** button.

You see the new `Comment` textbox now.

![Added comment field to Articles](./media/app-service-web-tutorial-nodejs-mongodb-app/added-comment-field.png)

In the terminal, stop Node.js by typing `Ctrl+C`. 

### Publish changes to Azure

In the local terminal window, commit your changes in Git, then push the code changes to Azure.

```bash
git commit -am "added article comment"
git push azure master
```

Once the `git push` is complete, navigate to your Azure web app and try out the new functionality.

![Model and database changes published to Azure](media/app-service-web-tutorial-nodejs-mongodb-app/added-comment-field-published.png)

If you added any articles earlier, you still can see them. Existing data in your Cosmos DB is not lost. Also, your updates to the data schema and leaves your existing data intact.

## Stream diagnostic logs 

While your Node.js application runs in Azure App Service, you can get the console logs piped to your terminal. That way, you can get the same diagnostic messages to help you debug application errors.

To start log streaming, use the [`az webapp log tail`](/cli/azure/webapp/log?view=azure-cli-latest#az-webapp-log-tail) command in the Cloud Shell.

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp log tail --name <app_name> --resource-group myResourceGroup
``` 

Once log streaming has started, refresh your Azure web app in the browser to get some web traffic. You now see console logs piped to your terminal.

Stop log streaming at any time by typing `Ctrl+C`. 

## Manage your Azure web app

Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to see the web app you created.

From the left menu, click **App Services**, then click the name of your Azure web app.

![Portal navigation to Azure web app](./media/app-service-web-tutorial-nodejs-mongodb-app/access-portal.png)

By default, the portal shows your web app's **Overview** page. This page gives you a view of how your app is doing. Here, you can also perform basic management tasks like browse, stop, start, restart, and delete. The tabs on the left side of the page show the different configuration pages you can open.
