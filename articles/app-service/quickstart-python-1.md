# Quickstart: Create a Python app in Azure App Service on Linux

In this quickstart, you deploy a Python web app to [App Service on Linux](overview.md#app-service-on-linux), Azure's highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service. You use the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) locally from a Windows, Linux, or macOS environment to deploy a sample with either the Flask or Django frameworks. The web app you configure uses a free App Service tier, so you incur no costs in the course of this article.

> [!TIP]
> If you prefer to deploy apps through an IDE, see **[Deploy Python apps to App Service from Visual Studio Code](/azure/developer/python/tutorial-deploy-app-service-on-linux-01)**.

## Set up your initial environment

1. Have an Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).
1. Install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python</a>.
1. Install the <a href="/cli/azure/install-azure-cli" target="_blank">Azure CLI</a> 2.0.80 or higher, with which you run commands in any shell to provision and configure Azure resources.

Open a terminal window and check your Python version is 3.6 or higher:

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```bash
python3 --version
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```cmd
py -3 --version
```

# [Cmd](#tab/cmd)

```cmd
py -3 --version
```

---

Check that your Azure CLI version is 2.0.80 or higher:

```azurecli
az --version
```

Then sign in to Azure through the CLI:

```azurecli
az login
```

This command opens a browser to gather your credentials. When the command finishes, it shows JSON output containing information about your subscriptions.

Once signed in, you can run Azure commands with the Azure CLI to work with resources in your subscription.

## Clone the sample

Clone the sample repository using the following command and navigate into the sample folder. ([Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you don't have git already.)

::: zone pivot="python-framework-flask"
```terminal
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-docs-hello-world
```

Then navigate into that folder:

```terminal
cd python-docs-hello-world
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="python-framework-django"
```terminal
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-docs-hello-django
```

Then navigate into that folder:

```terminal
cd python-docs-hello-django
```
::: zone-end

The sample contains framework-specific code that Azure App Service recognizes when starting the app. For more information, see [Container startup process](configure-language-python.md#container-startup-process).

## Deploy the sample

Deploy the code in your local folder (*python-docs-hello-world*) using the `az webapp up` command:

```azurecli
az webapp up --sku B1 --name <app-name>
```

- If the `az` command isn't recognized, be sure you have the Azure CLI installed as described in [Set up your initial environment](#set-up-your-initial-environment).
- If the `webapp` command isn't recognized, because that your Azure CLI version is 2.0.80 or higher. If not, [install the latest version](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
- Replace `<app_name>` with a name that's unique across all of Azure (*valid characters are `a-z`, `0-9`, and `-`*). A good pattern is to use a combination of your company name and an app identifier.
- The `--sku B1` argument creates the web app on the Basic pricing tier, which incurs a small hourly cost. Omit this argument to use a faster premium tier.
- You can optionally include the argument `--location <location-name>` where `<location_name>` is an available Azure region. You can retrieve a list of allowable regions for your Azure account by running the [az account list-locations](/cli/azure/appservice#az-appservice-list-locations) command.
- If you see the error, "Could not auto-detect the runtime stack of your app," make sure you're running the command in the *python-docs-hello-world* folder (Flask) or the *python-docs-hello-django* folder (Django) that contains the *requirements.txt* file. (See [Troubleshooting auto-detect issues with az webapp up](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-linux-docs/blob/master/AzWebAppUP/runtime_detection.md) (GitHub).)

The command may take a few minutes to complete. While running, it provides messages about creating the resource group, the App Service plan and hosting app, configuring logging, then performing ZIP deployment. It then gives the message, "You can launch the app at http://&lt;app-name&gt;.azurewebsites.net", which is the app's URL on Azure.

## Browse to the app

Browse to the deployed application in your web browser at the URL `http://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net`. It takes a few moments to start the app initially.

The Python sample code is running a Linux container in App Service using a built-in image.

## Run the sample 

::: zone pivot="python-framework-flask"
1. Make sure you're in the *python-docs-hello-world* folder. 

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

    [!include [virtual environment setup](../../includes/app-service-quickstart-python-venv.md)]

    If you encounter "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'.", make sure you're in the *python-docs-hello-world* folder.

1. Run the development server.

    ```terminal  
    flask run
    ```
    
    By default, the server assumes that the app's entry module is in *app.py*, as used in the sample. (If you use a different module name, set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to that name.)

1. Open a web browser and go to the sample app at `http://localhost:5000/`. The app displays the message **Hello, World!**.

    ![Run a sample Python app locally](./media/quickstart-python/run-hello-world-sample-python-app-in-browser-localhost.png)
    
1. In your terminal window, press **Ctrl**+**C** to exit the development server.
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="python-framework-django"
1. Make sure you're in the *python-docs-hello-django* folder. 

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

    [!include [virtual environment setup](../../includes/app-service-quickstart-python-venv.md)]

    If you encounter "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'.", make sure you're in the *python-docs-hello-django* folder.
    
1. Run the development server.

    # [Bash](#tab/bash)

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py runserver
    ```

    # [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

    ```powershell
    py -3 manage.py runserver
    ```

    # [Cmd](#tab/cmd)

    ```cmd
    py -3 manage.py runserver
    ```

    ---    

1. Open a web browser and go to the sample app at `http://localhost:8000/`. The app displays the message **Hello, World!**.

    ![Run a sample Python app locally](./media/quickstart-python/run-hello-world-sample-python-app-in-browser-localhost.png)
    
1. In your terminal window, press **Ctrl**+**C** to exit the development server.
::: zone-end

## Redeploy updates

In this section, you make a small code change and then redeploy the code to Azure. The code change includes a `print` statement to generate logging output that you work with in the next section.

::: zone pivot="python-framework-flask"
Open *app.py* in an editor and update the `hello` function to match the following code. 

```python
def hello():
    print("Handling request to home page.")
    return "Hello, Azure!"
```
::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="python-framework-django"
Open *hello/views.py* in an editor and update the `hello` function to match the following code.

```python
def hello(request):
    print("Handling request to home page.")
    return HttpResponse("Hello, Azure!")
```
::: zone-end
    
Save your changes, then redeploy the app using the `az webapp up` command again:

```azurecli
az webapp up
```

This command uses values that are cached locally in the *.azure/config* file, including the app name, resource group, and App Service plan.

Once deployment is complete, switch back to the browser window open to `http://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net`. Refresh the page, which should display the modified message:

![Run an updated sample Python app in Azure](./media/quickstart-python/run-updated-hello-world-sample-python-app-in-browser.png)

> [!TIP]
> Visual Studio Code provides powerful extensions for Python and Azure App Service, which simplify the process of deploying Python web apps to App Service. For more information, see [Deploy Python apps to App Service from Visual Studio Code](/azure/python/tutorial-deploy-app-service-on-linux-01).

## Stream logs

You can access the console logs generated from inside the app and the container in which it runs. Logs include any output generated using `print` statements.

To stream logs, run the [az webapp log tail](/cli/azure/webapp/log#az-webapp-log-tail) command:

```azurecli
az webapp log tail
```

You can also include the `--logs` parameter with then `az webapp up` command to automatically open the log stream on deployment.

Refresh the app in the browser to generate console logs, which include messages describing HTTP requests to the app. If no output appears immediately, try again in 30 seconds.

You can also inspect the log files from the browser at `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/logs/docker`.

To stop log streaming at any time, press **Ctrl**+**C** in the terminal.

## Manage the Azure app

Go to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure portal</a> to manage the app you created. Search for and select **App Services**.

![Navigate to App Services in the Azure portal](./media/quickstart-python/navigate-to-app-services-in-the-azure-portal.png)

Select the name of your Azure app.

![Navigate to your Python app in App Services in the Azure portal](./media/quickstart-python/navigate-to-app-in-app-services-in-the-azure-portal.png)

Selecting the app opens its **Overview** page, where you can perform basic management tasks like browse, stop, start, restart, and delete.

![Manage your Python app in the Overview page in the Azure portal](./media/quickstart-python/manage-an-app-in-app-services-in-the-azure-portal.png)

The App Service menu provides different pages for configuring your app.

## Clean up resources

In the preceding steps, you created Azure resources in a resource group. The resource group has a name like "appsvc_rg_Linux_CentralUS" depending on your location. If you keep the web app running, you will incur some ongoing costs (see [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/)).

If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, delete the resource group by running the following command:

```azurecli
az group delete --no-wait
```

The command uses the resource group name cached in the *.azure/config* file.

The `--no-wait` argument allows the command to return before the operation is complete.
