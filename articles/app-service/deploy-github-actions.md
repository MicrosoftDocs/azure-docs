# Deploy to App Service using GitHub Actions

Get started with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions) to automate your workflow and deploy to [Azure App Service](overview.md) from GitHub. 

## Prerequisites 

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- A GitHub account. If you don't have one, sign up for [free](https://github.com/join).  
- A working Azure App Service app. 
    - .NET: [Create an ASP.NET Core web app in Azure](quickstart-dotnetcore.md)
    - ASP.NET: [Create an ASP.NET Framework web app in Azure](quickstart-dotnet-framework.md)
    - JavaScript: [Create a Node.js web app in Azure App Service](quickstart-nodejs.md)  
    - Java: [Create a Java app on Azure App Service](quickstart-java.md)
    - Python: [Create a Python app in Azure App Service](quickstart-python.md)

## Workflow file overview

A workflow is defined by a YAML (.yml) file in the `/.github/workflows/` path in your repository. This definition contains the various steps and parameters that make up the workflow.

The file has three sections:

|Section  |Tasks  |
|---------|---------|
|**Authentication** | 1. Define a service principal or publish profile. <br /> 2. Create a GitHub secret. |
|**Build** | 1. Set up the environment. <br /> 2. Build the web app. |
|**Deploy** | 1. Deploy the web app. |

## Use the Deployment Center

You can quickly get started with GitHub Actions by using the App Service Deployment Center. This will automatically generate a workflow file based on your application stack and commit it to your GitHub repository in the correct directory.

1. Navigate to your webapp in the Azure portal
1. On the left side, click **Deployment Center**
1. Under **Continuous Deployment (CI / CD)**, select **GitHub**
1. Next, select **GitHub Actions**
1. Use the dropdowns to select your GitHub repository, branch, and application stack
    - If the selected branch is protected, you can still continue to add the workflow file. Be sure to review your branch protections before continuing.
1. On the final screen, you can review your selections and preview the workflow file that will be committed to the repository. If the selections are correct, click **Finish**

This will commit the workflow file to the repository. The workflow to build and deploy your app will start immediately.

## Set up a workflow manually

You can also deploy a workflow without using the Deployment Center. To do so, you will need to first generate deployment credentials. 

## Generate deployment credentials

The recommended way to authenticate with Azure App Services for GitHub Actions is with a publish profile. You can also authenticate with a service principal but the process requires more steps. 

Save your publish profile credential or service principal as a [GitHub secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) to authenticate with Azure. You'll access the secret within your workflow. 

# [Publish profile](#tab/applevel)

A publish profile is an app-level credential. Set up your publish profile as a GitHub secret. 

1. Go to your app service in the Azure portal. 

1. On the **Overview** page, select **Get Publish profile**.

1. Save the downloaded file. You'll use the contents of the file to create a GitHub secret.

> [!NOTE]
> As of October 2020, Linux web apps will need the app setting `WEBSITE_WEBDEPLOY_USE_SCM` set to `true` **before downloading the publish profile**. This requirement will be removed in the future.

# [Service principal](#tab/userlevel)

You can create a [service principal](../active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals.md#service-principal-object) with the [az ad sp create-for-rbac](/cli/azure/ad/sp#az_ad_sp_create_for_rbac) command in the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/). Run this command with [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) in the Azure portal or by selecting the **Try it** button.

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "myApp" --role contributor \
                            --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<app-name> \
                            --sdk-auth
```

In the example above, replace the placeholders with your subscription ID, resource group name, and app name. The output is a JSON object with the role assignment credentials that provide access to your App Service app similar to below. Copy this JSON object for later.

```output 
  {
    "clientId": "<GUID>",
    "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
    "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
    "tenantId": "<GUID>",
    (...)
  }
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is always a good practice to grant minimum access. The scope in the previous example is limited to the specific App Service app and not the entire resource group.

---

## Configure the GitHub secret


# [Publish profile](#tab/applevel)

In [GitHub](https://github.com/), browse your repository, select **Settings > Secrets > Add a new secret**.

To use [app-level credentials](#generate-deployment-credentials), paste the contents of the downloaded publish profile file into the secret's value field. Name the secret `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE`.

When you configure your GitHub workflow, you use the `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` in the deploy Azure Web App action. For example:
    
```yaml
- uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
  with:
    publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
```

# [Service principal](#tab/userlevel)

In [GitHub](https://github.com/), browse your repository, select **Settings > Secrets > Add a new secret**.

To use [user-level credentials](#generate-deployment-credentials), paste the entire JSON output from the Azure CLI command into the secret's value field. Give the secret the name `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.

When you configure the workflow file later, you use the secret for the input `creds` of the Azure Login action. For example:

```yaml
- uses: azure/login@v1
  with:
    creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
```

---

## Set up the environment

Setting up the environment can be done using one of the setup actions.

|**Language**  |**Setup Action**  |
|---------|---------|
|**.NET**     | `actions/setup-dotnet` |
|**ASP.NET**     | `actions/setup-dotnet` |
|**Java**     | `actions/setup-java` |
|**JavaScript** | `actions/setup-node` |
|**Python**     | `actions/setup-python` |

The following examples show how to set up the environment for the different supported languages:

**.NET**

```yaml
    - name: Setup Dotnet 3.3.x
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
      with:
        dotnet-version: '3.3.x'
```

**ASP.NET**

```yaml
    - name: Install Nuget
      uses: nuget/setup-nuget@v1
      with:
        nuget-version: ${{ env.NUGET_VERSION}}
```

**Java**

```yaml
    - name: Setup Java 1.8.x
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
      with:
        # If your pom.xml <maven.compiler.source> version is not in 1.8.x,
        # change the Java version to match the version in pom.xml <maven.compiler.source>
        java-version: '1.8.x'
```

**JavaScript**

```yaml
env:
  NODE_VERSION: '14.x'                # set this to the node version to use

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    name: Build and Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@main
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
```
**Python**

```yaml
    - name: Setup Python 3.x 
      uses: actions/setup-python@v1
      with:
        python-version: 3.x
```

## Build the web app

The process of building a web app and deploying to Azure App Service changes depending on the language. 

The following examples show the part of the workflow that builds the web app, in different supported languages.

For all languages, you can set the web app root directory with `working-directory`. 

**.NET**

The environment variable `AZURE_WEBAPP_PACKAGE_PATH` sets the path to your web app project. 

```yaml
- name: dotnet build and publish
  run: |
    dotnet restore
    dotnet build --configuration Release
    dotnet publish -c Release -o '${{ env.AZURE_WEBAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}/myapp' 
```
**ASP.NET**

You can restore NuGet dependencies and run msbuild with `run`. 

```yaml
- name: NuGet to restore dependencies as well as project-specific tools that are specified in the project file
  run: nuget restore

- name: Add msbuild to PATH
  uses: microsoft/setup-msbuild@v1.0.0

- name: Run msbuild
  run: msbuild .\SampleWebApplication.sln
```

**Java**

```yaml
- name: Build with Maven
  run: mvn package --file pom.xml
```

**JavaScript**

For Node.js, you can set `working-directory` or change for npm directory in `pushd`. 

```yaml
- name: npm install, build, and test
  run: |
    npm install
    npm run build --if-present
    npm run test --if-present
  working-directory: my-app-folder # set to the folder with your app if it is not the root directory
```

**Python**

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Deploy to App Service

To deploy your code to an App Service app, use the `azure/webapps-deploy@v2` action. This action has four parameters:

| **Parameter**  | **Explanation**  |
|---------|---------|
| **app-name** | (Required) Name of the App Service app | 
| **publish-profile** | (Optional) Publish profile file contents with Web Deploy secrets |
| **package** | (Optional) Path to package or folder. The path can include *.zip, *.war, *.jar, or a folder to deploy |
| **slot-name** | (Optional) Enter an existing slot other than the production [slot](deploy-staging-slots.md) |


# [Publish profile](#tab/applevel)
