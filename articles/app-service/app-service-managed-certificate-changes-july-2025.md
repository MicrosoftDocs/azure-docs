# App Service Managed Certificate (ASMC) changes – July 28, 2025

Starting July 28, 2025, Azure App Service Managed Certificates (ASMC) are subject to new issuance and renewal requirements due to DigiCert’s migration to a new validation platform. This change is driven by industry-wide compliance with Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration (MPIC).

For a detailed explanation of the underlying changes at DigiCert, refer to [changes to the managed Transport Layer Security (TLS) feature](../security/fundamentals/managed-tls-changes.md).

## What’s changing

**Validation method update**: ASMC now uses HTTP Token validation for both apex and subdomains. Previously, subdomains were validated using CNAME records, which did not require public access. With HTTP Token, DigiCert must reach a specific endpoint on your app to verify domain ownership.

App Service automatically places the required token at the correct path for validation. This process applies to both initial certificate issuance and renewals, meaning:

- The customer experience for requesting an ASMC or proving domain ownership remains unchanged.
- All API and CLI request payloads for ASMC creation or renewal are unaffected.
- No customer action is needed to place or manage the token.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While App Service continues to handle token placement automatically during renewals, DigiCert must still reach the validation endpoint on your app. Public access is still required at the time of renewal. If your app is not publicly accessible, renewal fails even if the token is correctly placed.

## Impacted scenarios

You can't create or renew ASMCs if your:
- Site is not publicly accessible:
   - Public accessibility to your app is required. If your app is only accessible through private configurations, such as requiring a client certificate, disabling public network access, using private endpoints, or applying IP restrictions, you can't create or renew a managed certificate.
   - Other configurations that restrict public access, such as firewalls, authentication gateways, or custom access policies, may also affect eligibility for managed certificate issuance or renewal.

- Site is an Azure Traffic Manager "nested" or "external" endpoint:
   - Only "Azure Endpoints" on Traffic Manager is supported for certificate creation and renewal.
   - "Nested endpoints" and "External endpoints" is not supported.
- Site relies on _*.trafficmanager.net_ domains:
   - Certificates for _*.trafficmanager.net_ domains is not supported for creation or renewal.

Existing certificates remain valid until expiration (up to six months), but will not renew automatically if your configuration is unsupported.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the new changes, all existing ASMC requirements still apply. Refer to [App Service Managed Certificate documentation](configure-ssl-certificate.md#create-a-free-managed-certificate) for more information.

## Identify impacted resources
You can use [Azure Resource Graph (ARG)](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customPortal=false#view/HubsExtension/ArgQueryBlade) queries to help identify resources that may be affected under each scenario. These queries are provided as a starting point and may not capture every configuration. Review your environment for any unique setups or custom configurations. 

### Scenario 1: Site is not publicly accessible
This ARG query retrieves a list of sites that either have the public network access property disabled or are configured to use client certificates. It then filters for sites that are using App Service Managed Certificates (ASMC) for their custom hostname SSL bindings. These certificates are the ones that could be affected by the upcoming changes. However, this query does not provide complete coverage, as there may be other configurations impacting public access to your app that are not included here. Ultimately, this query serves as a helpful guide for users, but a thorough review of your environment is recommended. You can copy this query, paste it into [ARG Explorer](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customPortal=false#view/HubsExtension/ArgQueryBlade), and then click "Run query" to view the results for your environment. 

> [!NOTE]
> ARG can only retrive site property values (ie. client certificate and public network access), however it cannot retrieve any site config values (ie. IP restrictions). If you would like to retrive both site properties and site config values as well, you can refer to this [PowerShell script from GitHub](https://github.com/nimccoll/AppServiceManagedCertificates).
> 

```kql
// ARG Query: Identify App Service sites that commonly restrict public access and use ASMC for custom hostname SSL bindings 
resources 
| where type == "microsoft.web/sites" 
// Extract relevant properties for public access and client certificate settings 
| extend  
    publicNetworkAccess = tolower(tostring(properties.publicNetworkAccess)), 
    clientCertEnabled = tolower(tostring(properties.clientCertEnabled)) 
// Filter for sites that either have public network access disabled  
// or have client certificates enabled (both can restrict public access) 
| where publicNetworkAccess == "disabled"  
    or clientCertEnabled != "false" 
// Expand the list of SSL bindings for each site 
| mv-expand hostNameSslState = properties.hostNameSslStates 
| extend  
    hostName = tostring(hostNameSslState.name), 
    thumbprint = tostring(hostNameSslState.thumbprint) 
// Only consider custom domains (exclude default *.azurewebsites.net) and sites with an SSL certificate bound 
| where tolower(hostName) !endswith "azurewebsites.net" and isnotempty(thumbprint) 
// Select key site properties for output 
| project siteName = name, siteId = id, siteResourceGroup = resourceGroup, thumbprint, publicNetworkAccess, clientCertEnabled 
// Join with certificates to find only those using App Service Managed Certificates (ASMC) 
// ASMCs are identified by the presence of the "canonicalName" property 
| join kind=inner ( 
    resources 
    | where type == "microsoft.web/certificates" 
    | extend  
        certThumbprint = tostring(properties.thumbprint), 
        canonicalName = tostring(properties.canonicalName) // Only ASMC uses the "canonicalName" property 
    | where isnotempty(canonicalName) 
    | project certName = name, certId = id, certResourceGroup = tostring(properties.resourceGroup), certExpiration = properties.expirationDate, certThumbprint, canonicalName 
) on $left.thumbprint == $right.certThumbprint 
// Final output: sites with restricted public access and using ASMC for custom hostname SSL bindings 
| project siteName, siteId, siteResourceGroup, publicNetworkAccess, clientCertEnabled, thumbprint, certName, certId, certResourceGroup, certExpiration, canonicalName
```

### Scenario 2: Site is an Azure Traffic Manager "nested" or "external" endpoint
If your App Service uses custom domains routed through **Azure Traffic Manager**, you may be impacted if your profile includes **external** or **nested endpoints**. These endpoint types are not supported for certificate issuance or renewal under the new validation.

To help identify affected Traffic Manager profiles across your subscriptions, we recommend using [this PowerShell script](https://github.com/nimccoll/NonAzureTrafficManagerEndpoints) developed by the Microsoft team. It scans for profiles with non-Azure endpoints and outputs a list of potentially impacted resources.

> [!NOTE]
> You need at least Reader access to all subscriptions to run the script successfully.
> 

To run the script:
1. Download the [PowerShell script from GitHub](https://github.com/nimccoll/NonAzureTrafficManagerEndpoints).
1. Open PowerShell and navigate to the script location.
1. Run the script.
   ```
   .\TrafficManagerNonAzureEndpoints.ps1
   ```

### Scenario 3: Site relies on _*.trafficmanager.net_ domains
This ARG query helps you identify App Service Managed Certificates (ASMC) that were issued to _*.trafficmanager.net domains_. In addition, it also checks whether any web apps are currently using those certificates for custom domain SSL bindings. You can copy this query, paste it into [ARG Explorer](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customPortal=false#view/HubsExtension/ArgQueryBlade), and then click "Run query" to view the results for your environment. 

```kql
// ARG Query: Identify App Service Managed Certificates (ASMC) issued to *.trafficmanager.net domains 
// Also checks if any web apps are currently using those certificates for custom domain SSL bindings 
resources 
| where type == "microsoft.web/certificates" 
// Extract the certificate thumbprint and canonicalName (ASMCs have a canonicalName property) 
| extend  
    certThumbprint = tostring(properties.thumbprint), 
    canonicalName = tostring(properties.canonicalName) // Only ASMC uses the "canonicalName" property 
// Filter for certificates issued to *.trafficmanager.net domains 
| where canonicalName endswith "trafficmanager.net" 
// Select key certificate properties for output 
| project certName = name, certId = id, certResourceGroup = tostring(properties.resourceGroup), certExpiration = properties.expirationDate, certThumbprint, canonicalName 
// Join with web apps to see if any are using these certificates for SSL bindings 
| join kind=leftouter ( 
    resources 
    | where type == "microsoft.web/sites" 
    // Expand the list of SSL bindings for each site 
    | mv-expand hostNameSslState = properties.hostNameSslStates 
    | extend  
        hostName = tostring(hostNameSslState.name), 
        thumbprint = tostring(hostNameSslState.thumbprint) 
    // Only consider bindings for *.trafficmanager.net custom domains with a certificate bound 
    | where tolower(hostName) endswith "trafficmanager.net" and isnotempty(thumbprint) 
    // Select key site properties for output 
    | project siteName = name, siteId = id, siteResourceGroup = resourceGroup, thumbprint 
) on $left.certThumbprint == $right.thumbprint 
// Final output: ASMCs for *.trafficmanager.net domains and any web apps using them 
| project certName, certId, certResourceGroup, certExpiration, canonicalName, siteName, siteId, siteResourceGroup
```

## Mitigation guidance

### Scenario 1: Site is not publicly accessible

Apps that are not accessible from the public internet cannot create or renew ASMCs. These configurations may include restrictions enforced through private endpoints, firewalls, IP filtering, client certificates, authentication gateways, or custom access policies.

We recognize that making applications publicly accessible may conflict with customer security policies or introduce risk. The recommended mitigation is to replace ASMC with a custom certificate and update the TLS/SSL binding for your custom domain.

**Recommended steps:**

1. **Acquire a certificate for your custom domain**  
   You may use any certificate provider that meets your security and operational requirements. The certificate should be compatible with Azure App Service and ideally stored in Azure Key Vault for easier management.

2. **Add the certificate to the site**  
   After acquiring a certificate for your custom domain, you need to upload it to your App Service app and configure it for use. After acquiring a certificate for your custom domain, you need to upload it to your App Service app and configure it for use.
   > [!TIP]  
   > Make sure to [authorized App Service to read the certificates from Key vault](configure-ssl-certificate.md#authorize-app-service-to-read-from-the-vault). Use the specific identity listed in the documentation and not the Managed Identity of the site.
   - [REST API: Import KV certificate to site](/rest/api/appservice/certificates/create-or-update)
   - [CLI: Import KV certificate to site](/cli/azure/webapp/config/ssl#az-webapp-config-ssl-import)

4. **Update the custom domain binding**  
   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > **To avoid any service downtime, do not delete the TLS/SSL binding**. You can update the binding with the new certificate thumbprint or name that was added to the web app without deleting the current binding.

   - [REST API: Update hostname binding](/rest/api/appservice/web-apps/create-or-update-host-name-binding)
   - [CLI: Update hostname binding](/cli/azure/webapp/config/ssl#az-webapp-config-ssl-bind)

5. **Remove other dependencies on ASMC**

   - **Custom domain TLS/SSL bindings**  
     Determine whether ASMCs are actively used for TLS/SSL bindings in your web app's custom domain configuration. If so, follow the steps above to replace the certificate and update the binding.

   - **Certificate used in application code**  
     Certificates may be used in application code for tasks such as authentication. If your app uses the `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` setting to load ASMCs, update your code to use the new certificate instead.

6. **Delete ASMC resources**  
   After confirming that your environment or services no longer depend on ASMC, delete the ASMCs associated with your site.  
   Deleting ASMCs helps prevent accidental reuse, which could result in service downtime when the certificate fails to renew.

   - [REST API: Delete Certificate](/rest/api/appservice/certificates/delete)
   - [CLI: Delete certificate](/cli/azure/webapp/config/ssl#az-webapp-config-ssl-delete)

**Temporary mitigation: DigiCert IP allowlisting**  
Some customers may choose to allowlist [DigiCert’s domain validation IPs](https://knowledge.digicert.com/alerts/ip-address-domain-validation) as a short-term workaround. This may help maintain certificate issuance while transitioning away from using ASMC for websites that aren’t publicly accessible.
> [!NOTE]
> Allowlisting DigiCert's IP isn’t an official or supported long-term solution. Microsoft’s stance remains that **public access is required** to avoid potential service disruptions. Keep in mind:
>
> - DigiCert manages its own IPs and may change them without notice.
> - Microsoft doesn’t control DigiCert’s infrastructure and can’t guarantee the documentation stay up to date.
> - Microsoft doesn’t provide alerts if DigiCert updates its IPs.
> - Use this approach at your own risk.

For guidance on configuring access restrictions, refer to [set up Azure App Service access restrictions](app-service-ip-restrictions.md).


### Scenario 2: Site is an Azure Traffic Manager "nested" or "external" endpoint

Only "Azure Endpoints" are supported. "Nested" and "External" endpoints are not supported for ASMC validation.

**Recommended mitigation:**

- Switch to Azure Endpoints or use a custom domain secured with a custom certificate.
- For guidance on using App Service as an Azure Traffic Manager endpoint, refer to [App Service and Traffic Manager Profiles](web-sites-traffic-manager.md#app-service-and-traffic-manager-profiles).


### Scenario 3: Site relies on _*.trafficmanager.net_ domains

Certificates for `*.trafficmanager.net` domains are not supported. If your app relies on this domain and uses ASMC, you need to remove that dependency and secure your app using a custom domain and certificate.

**Recommended steps:**

1. **Add a custom domain to the site**  
   You can configure a custom domain that points to your `trafficmanager.net` endpoint and secure it with your own certificate.
   
    - If the custom domain is not yet live or does not currently serve traffic, refer to [set up custom domain name for your app](app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain.md).
    - If the domain is already active and serving traffic, refer to [migrate an active domain](manage-custom-dns-migrate-domain.md).

   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > If the site restricts public access, do not use ASMC to secure the custom domain. This scenario is impacted by the validation change and will result in certificate issuance or renewal failure.

3. **Acquire a certificate for the custom domain**  
   You may use any certificate provider that meets your security and operational requirements. The certificate should be compatible with Azure App Service and ideally stored in Azure Key Vault for easier management.

4. **Add the certificate to the site**  
   > [!TIP]  
   > Make sure to [authorized App Service to read the certificates from Key vault](configure-ssl-certificate.md#authorize-app-service-to-read-from-the-vault). Use the specific identity listed in the documentation—not the Managed Identity of the site.

   - [CLI: Import KV certificate to site](/cli/azure/webapp/config/ssl#az-webapp-config-ssl-import)

5. **Create a custom domain binding**

   - [REST API: Create hostname binding](/rest/api/appservice/web-apps/create-or-update-host-name-binding)
   - [CLI: Update Create hostname binding](/cli/azure/webapp/config/ssl#az-webapp-config-ssl-bind)

6. **Remove other dependencies on ASMC**

   - **Custom domain TLS/SSL bindings**  
     Determine whether ASMCs are actively used for TLS/SSL bindings in your web app's custom domain configuration. If so, follow the steps above to replace the certificate and update the binding.

   - **Certificate used in application code**  
     Certificates may be used in application code for tasks such as authentication. If your app uses the `WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES` setting to load ASMCs, update your code to use the new certificate instead.

   - [CLI: Delete certificate](/cli/azure/webapp/config/ssl#az-webapp-config-ssl-delete)


## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

**Why is public access now required?**  
Due to MPIC compliance, App Service is migrating to Http Token validation for all ASMC creation and renewal requests. DigiCert must verify domain ownership by reaching a specific endpoint on your app. A successful validation with Http token is only possible if the app is publicly accessible. 

**Can I still use CNAME records?**  
Yes, you can still use CNAME records for domain name system (DNS) routing and for verifying domain ownership.

**What if I allowlist DigiCert IP addresses?**  
Allowlisting DigiCert’s domain validation IPs may work as a temporary workaround. However, Microsoft cannot guarantee that these IPs won’t change. DigiCert may update them without notice, and Microsoft does not maintain documentation for these IPs. Customers are responsible for monitoring and maintaining this configuration.

**Are certificates for \*.azurewebsites.net impacted?**  
No, these changes do not apply to the *.azurewebsites.net certificates. ASMC is only issued to customer’s custom domain and not the default hostname.
