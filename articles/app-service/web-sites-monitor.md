# Azure App Service quotas and alerts
[Azure App Service](./overview.md) provides
built-in monitoring functionality for web apps, mobile, and API apps in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

In the Azure portal, you can review *quotas* and *metrics* for an app and App Service plan, and set up *alerts* and *autoscaling* rules based metrics.

## Understand quotas

Apps that are hosted in App Service are subject to certain limits on the resources they can use. The limits are defined by the App Service plan that's associated with the app.

[!INCLUDE [app-service-dev-test-note](../../includes/app-service-dev-test-note.md)]

If the app is hosted in a *Free* or *Shared* plan, the limits
on the resources that the app can use are defined by quotas.

If the app is hosted in a *Basic*, *Standard*, or *Premium* plan, the limits on the resources that they can use are set by the *size* (Small, Medium, Large) and *instance count* (1, 2, 3, and so on) of the App Service plan.

Quotas for Free or Shared apps are:

| Quota | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **CPU (Short)** | The amount of CPU allowed for this app in a 5-minute interval. This quota resets every five minutes. |
| **CPU (Day)** | The total amount of CPU allowed for this app in a day. This quota resets every 24 hours at midnight UTC. |
| **Memory** | The total amount of memory allowed for this app. |
| **Bandwidth** | The total amount of outgoing bandwidth allowed for this app in a day. This quota resets every 24 hours at midnight UTC. |
| **Filesystem** | The total amount of storage allowed. |

The only quota applicable to apps that are hosted in *Basic*, *Standard*, and
*Premium* is Filesystem.

For more information about the specific quotas, limits, and features available to the various App Service SKUs, see [Azure Subscription service limits](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md#azure-app-service-limits).

### Quota enforcement

If an app exceeds the *CPU (short)*, *CPU (Day)*, or *bandwidth* quota, the app is stopped until the quota resets. During this time, all incoming requests result in an HTTP 403 error.

![403 error message][http403]

If the app Memory quota is exceeded, the app is stopped temporarily.

If the Filesystem quota is exceeded, any write operation fails. Write operation failures include any writes to logs.

You can increase or remove quotas from your app by upgrading your App Service plan.

## Understand metrics

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Average Response Time** will be deprecated to avoid confusion with metric aggregations. Use **Response Time** as a replacement.

> [!NOTE]
> Metrics for an app include the requests to the app's SCM site(Kudu).  This includes requests to view the site's logstream using Kudu.  Logstream requests may span several minutes, which will affect the Request Time metrics.  Users should be aware of this relationship when using these metrics with autoscale logic.
> 
> **HTTP Server Errors** only records requests that reach the backend service (the worker(s) hosting the app). If the requests are failing at the FrontEnd, they are not recorded as HTTP Server Errors. The [Health Check feature](./monitor-instances-health-check.md) / Application Insights availability tests can be used for outside in monitoring.

Metrics provide information about the app or the App Service plan's behavior.

For a list of available metrics for apps or for App Service plans, see [Supported metrics for Microsoft.Web](monitor-app-service-reference.md#supported-metrics-for-microsoftweb).

> [!NOTE]
> App Service plan metrics are available only for plans in *Basic*, *Standard*, *Premium*, and *Isolated* tiers.

### CPU time vs CPU percentage
<!-- To do: Fix Anchor (#CPU-time-vs.-CPU-percentage) -->

There are two metrics that reflect CPU usage:

**CPU Time**: Useful for apps hosted in Free or Shared plans, because one of their quotas is defined in CPU minutes used by the app.

**CPU percentage**: Useful for apps hosted in Basic, Standard, and Premium plans, because they can be scaled out. CPU percentage is a good indication of the overall usage across all instances.

## Metrics granularity and retention policy
Metrics for an app and app service plan are logged and aggregated by the service and [retained according to these rules](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics#retention-of-metrics).

## Monitoring quotas and metrics in the Azure portal
To review the status of the various quotas and metrics that affect an app, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

![Quotas chart in the Azure portal][quotas]

To find quotas, select **Settings** > **Quotas**. On the chart, you can review: 
1. The quota name.
1. Its reset interval.
1. Its current limit.
1. Its current value.

![Metric chart in the Azure portal][metrics]
You can access metrics directly from the resource **Overview** page. Here you'll see charts representing some of the apps metrics.

Clicking on any of those charts will take you to the metrics view where you can create custom charts, query different metrics and much more. 

To learn more about metrics, see [Monitor service metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/data-platform).

## Alerts and autoscale

Metrics for an app or an App Service plan can be hooked up to alerts. For more information, see [Alerts](monitor-app-service.md#alerts).

App Service apps hosted in Basic or higher App Service plans support autoscale. With autoscale, you can configure rules that monitor the App Service plan metrics. Rules can increase or decrease the instance count, which can provide additional resources as needed. Rules can also help you save money when the app is over-provisioned.

For more information about autoscale, see [How to scale](/azure/azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-get-started) and [Best practices for Azure Monitor autoscaling](/azure/azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-best-practices).
