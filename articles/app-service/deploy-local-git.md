# Local Git deployment to Azure App Service

This how-to guide shows you how to deploy your app to [Azure App Service](overview.md) from a Git repository on your local computer.

> [!NOTE]
> This deployment method requires [SCM basic authentication](configure-basic-auth-disable.md), which is less secure than [other deployment methods](deploy-authentication-types.md). When Local Git deployment doesn't work, you can't configure Local Git deployment in the app's Deployment Center.

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps in this how-to guide:

- [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]
  
- [Install Git](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads).

- Have a local Git repository with code you want to deploy. To download a sample repository, run the following command in your local terminal window:
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world.git
  ```

[!INCLUDE [Prepare repository](../../includes/app-service-deploy-prepare-repo.md)]

## Configure a deployment user

See [Configure deployment credentials for Azure App Service](deploy-configure-credentials.md). You can use either user-scope credentials or application-scope credentials.

## Create a Git enabled app

If you already have an App Service app and want to configure local Git deployment for it, see [Configure an existing app](#configure-an-existing-app) instead.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Run [`az webapp create`](/cli/azure/webapp#az-webapp-create) with the `--deployment-local-git` option. For example:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp create --resource-group <group-name> --plan <plan-name> --name <app-name> --runtime "<runtime-flag>" --deployment-local-git
```

The output contains a URL like: `https://<deployment-username>@<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/<app-name>.git`. Use this URL to deploy your app in the next step.

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Run [New-AzWebApp](/powershell/module/az.websites/new-azwebapp) from the root of your Git repository. For example:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzWebApp -Name <app-name>
```

When your run this cmdlet from a directory that's a Git repository, it automatically creates a Git remote to your App Service app for you, named `azure`.

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

In the portal, you need to create an app first, then configure deployment for it. See [Configure an existing app](#configure-an-existing-app).

-----

## Configure an existing app

If you don't have an app yet, see [Create a Git enabled app](#create-a-git-enabled-app) instead.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Run [`az webapp deployment source config-local-git`](/cli/azure/webapp/deployment/source#az-webapp-deployment-source-config-local-git). For example:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp deployment source config-local-git --name <app-name> --resource-group <group-name>
```

The output contains a URL like: `https://<deployment-username>@<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/<app-name>.git`. Use this URL to deploy your app in the next step.

> [!TIP]
> This URL contains the user-scope deployment username. If you like, you can [use the application-scope credentials](deploy-configure-credentials.md#appscope) instead. 

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Set the `scmType` of your app by running the [Set-AzResource](/powershell/module/az.resources/set-azresource) cmdlet.

```powershell-interactive
$PropertiesObject = @{
    scmType = "LocalGit";
}

Set-AzResource -PropertyObject $PropertiesObject -ResourceGroupName <group-name> `
-ResourceType Microsoft.Web/sites/config -ResourceName <app-name>/web `
-ApiVersion 2015-08-01 -Force
```

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your app's management page.

1. From the left menu, select **Deployment Center** > **Settings**. Select **Local Git** in **Source**, then select **Save**.

    ![Shows how to enable local Git deployment for App Service in the Azure portal](./media/deploy-local-git/enable-portal.png)

1. In the Local Git section, copy the **Git Clone Uri** for later. This Uri doesn't contain any credentials.

-----

## Deploy the web app

1. In a local terminal window, change the directory to the root of your Git repository, and add a Git remote using the URL you got from your app. If your chosen method doesn't give you a URL, use `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/<app-name>.git` with your app name in `<app-name>`.
   
   ```bash
   git remote add azure <url>
   ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you [created a Git-enabled app in PowerShell using New-AzWebApp](#create-a-git-enabled-app), the remote is already created for you.
   
1. Push to the Azure remote with `git push azure master` (see [Change deployment branch](#change-deployment-branch)). 
   
1. In the **Git Credential Manager** window, enter your [user-scope or application-scope credentials](#configure-a-deployment-user), not your Azure sign-in credentials.

    If your Git remote URL already contains the username and password, you won't be prompted. 
   
1. Review the output. You might see runtime-specific automation, such as MSBuild for ASP.NET, `npm install` for Node.js, and `pip install` for Python. 
   
1. Browse to your app in the Azure portal to verify that the content is deployed.

## Change deployment branch

When you push commits to your App Service repository, App Service deploys the files in the `master` branch by default. Because many Git repositories are moving away from `master` to `main`, you need to make sure that you push to the right branch in the App Service repository in one of two ways:

- Deploy to `master` explicitly with a command like:

    ```bash
    git push azure main:master
    ```

- Change the deployment branch by setting the `DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH` app setting, then push commits to the custom branch. To do it with Azure CLI:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az webapp config appsettings set --name <app-name> --resource-group <group-name> --settings DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH='main'
    git push azure main
    ```

    You can also change the `DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH` app setting in the Azure portal, by selecting **Environment variables** under **Settings** and adding a new App setting with a name of `DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH` and value of `main`.

## Troubleshoot deployment

You might see the following common error messages when you use Git to publish to an App Service app in Azure:

|Message|Cause|Resolution|
|---|---|---|
|`Unable to access '[siteURL]': Failed to connect to [scmAddress]`|The app isn't up and running.|Start the app in the Azure portal. Git deployment isn't available when the web app is stopped.|
|`Couldn't resolve host 'hostname'`|The address information for the `azure` remote is incorrect.|Use the `git remote -v` command to list all remotes, along with the associated URL. Verify that the URL for the `azure` remote is correct. If needed, remove and recreate this remote using the correct URL.|
|`No refs in common and none specified; doing nothing. Perhaps you should specify a branch such as 'main'.`|You didn't specify a branch during `git push`, or you haven't set the `push.default` value in `.gitconfig`.|Run `git push` again, specifying the main branch: `git push azure main`.|
|`Error - Changes committed to remote repository but deployment to website failed.`|You pushed a local branch that doesn't match the app deployment branch on `azure`.|Verify that current branch is `master`. To change the default branch, use `DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH` application setting (see [Change deployment branch](#change-deployment-branch)). |
|`src refspec [branchname] does not match any.`|You tried to push to a branch other than main on the `azure` remote.|Run `git push` again, specifying the main branch: `git push azure main`.|
|`RPC failed; result=22, HTTP code = 5xx.`|This error can happen if you try to push a large git repository over HTTPS.|Change the git configuration on the local machine to make the `postBuffer` bigger. For example: `git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000`.|
|`Error - Changes committed to remote repository but your web app not updated.`|You deployed a Node.js app with a _package.json_ file that specifies additional required modules.|Review the `npm ERR!` error messages before this error for more context on the failure. The following are the known causes of this error, and the corresponding `npm ERR!` messages:<br /><br />**Malformed package.json file**: `npm ERR! Couldn't read dependencies.`<br /><br />**Native module doesn't have a binary distribution for Windows**:<br />`npm ERR! \cmd "/c" "node-gyp rebuild"\ failed with 1` <br />or <br />`npm ERR! [modulename@version] preinstall: \make \|\| gmake\` |
