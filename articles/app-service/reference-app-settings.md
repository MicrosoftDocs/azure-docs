# Environment variables and app settings in Azure App Service

[!INCLUDE [regionalization-note](./includes/regionalization-note.md)]

In [Azure App Service](overview.md), certain settings are available to the deployment or runtime environment as environment variables. Some of these settings can be customized when you set them manually as [app settings](configure-common.md#configure-app-settings). This reference shows the variables you can use or customize.

## App environment

The following environment variables are related to the app environment in general.

| Setting name| Description | Example |
|-|-|-|
| `WEBSITE_SITE_NAME` | Read-only. App name. ||
| `WEBSITE_RESOURCE_GROUP` | Read-only. Azure resource group name that contains the app resource. ||
| `WEBSITE_OWNER_NAME` | Read-only. Contains the Azure subscription ID that owns the app, the resource group, and the webspace. ||
| `REGION_NAME` | Read-only. Region name of the app. ||
| `WEBSITE_PLATFORM_VERSION` | Read-only. App Service platform version. ||
| `HOME` | Read-only. Path to the home directory (for example, `D:\home` for Windows). ||
| `SERVER_PORT` | Read-only. The port the app should listen to. | |
| `WEBSITE_WARMUP_PATH`  | A relative path to ping to warm up the app, beginning with a slash. The default is `/`, which pings the root path. The specific path can be pinged by an unauthenticated client, such as Azure Traffic Manager, even if [App Service authentication](overview-authentication-authorization.md) is set to reject unauthenticated clients. (NOTE: This app setting doesn't change the path used by AlwaysOn.) ||
| `WEBSITE_COMPUTE_MODE` | Read-only. Specifies whether app runs on dedicated (`Dedicated`) or shared (`Shared`) VM/s. ||
| `WEBSITE_SKU` | Read-only. SKU of the app. Possible values are `Free`, `Shared`, `Basic`, and `Standard`. ||
| `SITE_BITNESS` | Read-only. Shows whether the app is 32-bit (`x86`) or 64-bit (`AMD64`). ||
| `WEBSITE_HOSTNAME` | Read-only. Primary hostname for the app. Custom hostnames aren't accounted for here. ||
| `WEBSITE_VOLUME_TYPE` | Read-only. Shows the storage volume type currently in use. ||
| `WEBSITE_NPM_DEFAULT_VERSION` | Default npm version the app is using. ||
| `WEBSOCKET_CONCURRENT_REQUEST_LIMIT` | Read-only. Limit for websocket's concurrent requests. For **Standard** tier and above, the value is `-1`, but there's still a per VM limit based on your VM size (see [Cross VM Numerical Limits](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Azure-Web-App-sandbox#cross-vm-numerical-limits)). ||
| `WEBSITE_PRIVATE_EXTENSIONS` | Set to `0` to disable the use of private site extensions. ||
| `WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE` | By default, the time zone for the app is always UTC. You can change it to any of the valid values that are listed in [Default Time Zones](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/default-time-zones). If the specified value isn't recognized, UTC is used. | `Atlantic Standard Time` |
| `WEBSITE_ADD_SITENAME_BINDINGS_IN_APPHOST_CONFIG` | After slot swaps, the app may experience unexpected restarts. This is because after a swap, the hostname binding configuration goes out of sync, which by itself doesn't cause restarts. However, certain underlying storage events (such as storage volume failovers) may detect these discrepancies and force all worker processes to restart. To minimize these types of restarts, set the app setting value to `1`on all slots (default is`0`). However, don't set this value if you're running a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) application. For more information, see [Troubleshoot swaps](deploy-staging-slots.md#troubleshoot-swaps)||
| `WEBSITE_PROACTIVE_AUTOHEAL_ENABLED` | By default, a VM instance is proactively "autohealed" when it's using more than 90% of allocated memory for more than 30 seconds, or when 80% of the total requests in the last two minutes take longer than 200 seconds. If a VM instance has triggered one of these rules, the recovery process is an overlapping restart of the instance. Set to `false` to disable this recovery behavior. The default is `true`. For more information, see [Proactive Auto Heal](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2017/08/17/Introducing-Proactive-Auto-Heal.html). ||
| `WEBSITE_PROACTIVE_CRASHMONITORING_ENABLED` | Whenever the w3wp.exe process on a VM instance of your app crashes due to an unhandled exception for more than three times in 24 hours, a debugger process is attached to the main worker process on that instance, and collects a memory dump when the worker process crashes again. This memory dump is then analyzed and the call stack of the thread that caused the crash is logged in your App Service's logs. Set to `false` to disable this automatic monitoring behavior. The default is `true`. For more information, see [Proactive Crash Monitoring](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2021/03/01/Proactive-Crash-Monitoring-in-Azure-App-Service.html). ||
| `WEBSITE_DAAS_STORAGE_SASURI` | During crash monitoring (proactive or manual), the memory dumps are deleted by default. To save the memory dumps to a storage blob container, specify the SAS URI.  ||
| `WEBSITE_CRASHMONITORING_ENABLED` | Set to `true` to enable [crash monitoring](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2020/08/11/Crash-Monitoring-Feature-in-Azure-App-Service.html) manually. You must also set `WEBSITE_DAAS_STORAGE_SASURI` and `WEBSITE_CRASHMONITORING_SETTINGS`. The default is `false`. This setting has no effect if remote debugging is enabled. Also, if this setting is set to `true`, [proactive crash monitoring](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2020/08/11/Crash-Monitoring-Feature-in-Azure-App-Service.html) is disabled. ||
| `WEBSITE_CRASHMONITORING_SETTINGS` | A JSON with the following format:`{"StartTimeUtc": "2020-02-10T08:21","MaxHours": "<elapsed-hours-from-StartTimeUtc>","MaxDumpCount": "<max-number-of-crash-dumps>"}`. Required to configure [crash monitoring](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2020/08/11/Crash-Monitoring-Feature-in-Azure-App-Service.html) if `WEBSITE_CRASHMONITORING_ENABLED` is specified. To only log the call stack without saving the crash dump in the storage account, add `,"UseStorageAccount":"false"` in the JSON. ||
| `REMOTEDEBUGGINGVERSION` | Remote debugging version. ||
| `WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING` | By default, App Service creates a shared storage for you at app creation. To use a custom storage account instead, set to the connection string of your storage account. For functions, see [App settings reference for Functions](../azure-functions/functions-app-settings.md#website_contentazurefileconnectionstring). | `DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<name>;AccountKey=<key>` |
| `WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE` | When you use specify a custom storage account with `WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING`, App Service creates a file share in that storage account for your app. To use a custom name, set this variable to the name you want. If a file share with the specified name doesn't exist, App Service creates it for you. | `myapp123` |
| `WEBSITE_SCM_ALWAYS_ON_ENABLED` | Read-only. Shows whether Always On is enabled (`1`) or not (`0`). ||
| `WEBSITE_SCM_SEPARATE_STATUS` | Read-only. Shows whether the Kudu app is running in a separate process (`1`) or not (`0`). ||
| `WEBSITE_DNS_ATTEMPTS` | Number of times to try name resolve. ||
| `WEBSITE_DNS_TIMEOUT` | Number of seconds to wait for name resolve ||

## Variable prefixes

The following table shows environment variable prefixes that App Service uses for various purposes.

| Setting name | Description |
|-|-|
| `APPSETTING_` | Signifies that a variable is set by the customer as an app setting in the app configuration. It's injected into a .NET app as an app setting. |
| `MAINSITE_` | Signifies a variable is specific to the app itself. |
| `SCMSITE_` | Signifies a variable is specific to the Kudu app. |
| `SQLCONNSTR_` | Signifies a SQL Server connection string in the app configuration. It's injected into a .NET app as a connection string. |
| `SQLAZURECONNSTR_` | Signifies an Azure SQL Database connection string in the app configuration. It's injected into a .NET app as a connection string. |
| `POSTGRESQLCONNSTR_` | Signifies a PostgreSQL connection string in the app configuration. It's injected into a .NET app as a connection string. |
| `CUSTOMCONNSTR_` | Signifies a custom connection string in the app configuration. It's injected into a .NET app as a connection string. |

## Deployment

The following environment variables are related to app deployment. For variables related to App Service build automation, see [Build automation](#build-automation).

| Setting name| Description |
|-|-|
| `DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH`| For [local Git](deploy-local-git.md) or [cloud Git](deploy-continuous-deployment.md) deployment (such as GitHub), set to the branch in Azure you want to deploy to. By default, it's `master`. |
| `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`| Set to `1` to run the app from a local ZIP package, or set to the URL of an external URL to run the app from a remote ZIP package. For more information, see [Run your app in Azure App Service directly from a ZIP package](deploy-run-package.md). |
| `WEBSITE_USE_ZIP` | Deprecated. Use `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`. |
| `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_ZIP` | Deprecated. Use `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`. | 
| `SCM_MAX_ZIP_PACKAGE_COUNT`| Your app keeps 5 of the most recent zip files deployed using [zip deploy](deploy-zip.md). You can keep more or less by setting the app setting to a different number. |
| `WEBSITE_WEBDEPLOY_USE_SCM` | Set to `false` for WebDeploy to stop using the Kudu deployment engine. The default is `true`. To deploy to Linux apps using Visual Studio (WebDeploy/MSDeploy), set it to `false`. |
| `MSDEPLOY_RENAME_LOCKED_FILES` | Set to `1` to attempt to rename DLLs if they can't be copied during a WebDeploy deployment. This setting isn't applicable if `WEBSITE_WEBDEPLOY_USE_SCM` is set to `false`. |
| `WEBSITE_DISABLE_SCM_SEPARATION` | By default, the main app and the Kudu app run in different sandboxes. When you stop the app, the Kudu app is still running, and you can continue to use Git deploy and MSDeploy. Each app has its own local files. Turning off this separation (setting to `true`) is a legacy mode that's no longer fully supported. |
| `WEBSITE_ENABLE_SYNC_UPDATE_SITE` | Set to `1` ensure that REST API calls to update `site` and `siteconfig` are completely applied to all instances before returning. The default is `1` if deploying with an ARM template, to avoid race conditions with subsequent ARM calls. |
| `WEBSITE_START_SCM_ON_SITE_CREATION` | In an ARM template deployment, set to `1` in the ARM template to pre-start the Kudu app as part of app creation. |
| `WEBSITE_START_SCM_WITH_PRELOAD` | For Linux apps, set to `true` to force preloading the Kudu app when Always On is enabled by pinging its URL. The default is `false`. For Windows apps, the Kudu app is always preloaded. |

## Build automation

# [Kudu (Windows)](#tab/kudu)

Kudu build configuration applies to native Windows apps and is used to control the behavior of Git-based (or ZIP-based) deployments.

| Setting name| Description | Example |
|-|-|-|
| `SCM_BUILD_ARGS` | Add things at the end of the msbuild command line, such that it overrides any previous parts of the default command line. | To do a clean build: `-t:Clean;Compile`|
| `SCM_SCRIPT_GENERATOR_ARGS` | Kudu uses the `azure site deploymentscript` command described [here](http://blog.amitapple.com/post/38418009331/azurewebsitecustomdeploymentpart2) to generate a deployment script. It automatically detects the language framework type and determines the parameters to pass to the command. This setting overrides the automatically generated parameters. | To treat your repository as plain content files: `--basic -p <folder-to-deploy>` |
| `SCM_TRACE_LEVEL` | Build trace level. The default is `1`. Set to higher values, up to 4, for more tracing. | `4` |
| `SCM_COMMAND_IDLE_TIMEOUT` | Time out in seconds for each command that the build process launches to wait before without producing any output. After that, the command is considered idle and killed. The default is `60` (one minute). In Azure, there's also a general idle request timeout that disconnects clients after 230 seconds. However, the command will still continue running server-side after that. | |
| `SCM_LOGSTREAM_TIMEOUT` | Time-out of inactivity in seconds before stopping log streaming. The default is `1800` (30 minutes).| |
| `SCM_SITEEXTENSIONS_FEED_URL` | URL of the site extensions gallery. The default is `https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/`. The URL of the old feed is `http://www.siteextensions.net/api/v2/`. | |
| `SCM_USE_LIBGIT2SHARP_REPOSITORY` | Set to `0` to use git.exe instead of libgit2sharp for git operations. | |
| `WEBSITE_LOAD_USER_PROFILE` | In case of the error `The specified user does not have a valid profile.` during ASP.NET build automation (such as during Git deployment), set this variable to `1` to load a full user profile in the build environment. This setting is only applicable when `WEBSITE_COMPUTE_MODE` is `Dedicated`. | |
| `WEBSITE_SCM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_IN_MINUTES` | Time out in minutes for the SCM (Kudu) site. The default is `20`. | |
| `SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT` | With [ZIP deploy](deploy-zip.md), the deployment engine assumes that a ZIP file is ready to run as-is and doesn't run any build automation. To enable the same build automation as in [Git deploy](deploy-local-git.md), set to `true`. |

## Domain and DNS

| Setting name| Description | Example |
|-|-|-|
| `WEBSITE_DNS_SERVER` | IP address of primary DNS server for outgoing connections (such as to a back-end service). The default DNS server for App Service is Azure DNS, whose IP address is `168.63.129.16`. If your app uses [VNet integration](./overview-vnet-integration.md) or is in an [App Service environment](environment/intro.md), it inherits the DNS server configuration from the VNet by default. | `10.0.0.1` |
| `WEBSITE_DNS_ALT_SERVER` | IP address of fallback DNS server for outgoing connections. See `WEBSITE_DNS_SERVER`. | |
| `WEBSITE_ENABLE_DNS_CACHE` | Allows successful DNS resolutions to be cached. By Default expired DNS cache entries will be flushed & in addition to the existing cache to be flushed every 4.5 mins. | |

| `WEBSITE_LOCAL_CACHE_READWRITE_OPTION` | Read-write options of the local cache. Available options are: <br/>- `ReadOnly`: Cache is read-only.<br/>- `WriteButDiscardChanges`: Allow writes to local cache but discard changes made locally. |
| `WEBSITE_LOCAL_CACHE_SIZEINMB` | Size of the local cache in MB. Default is `1000` (1 GB). |
| `WEBSITE_LOCALCACHE_READY` | Read-only flag indicating if the app using local cache. |
| `WEBSITE_DYNAMIC_CACHE` | Due to network file shared nature to allow access for multiple instances, the dynamic cache improves performance by caching the recently accessed files locally on an instance. Cache is invalidated when file is modified. The cache location is `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\local\DynamicCache` (same `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\local` quota is applied). To enable full content caching, set to `1`, which includes both file content and directory/file metadata (timestamps, size, directory content). To conserve local disk use, set to `2` to cache only directory/file metadata (timestamps, size, directory content). To turn off caching, set to `0`. For Windows apps and for [Linux apps created with the WordPress template](quickstart-wordpress.md), the default is `1`. For all other Linux apps, the default is `0`. |

## Networking

The following environment variables are related to [hybrid connections](app-service-hybrid-connections.md) and [VNET integration](./overview-vnet-integration.md).

| Setting name | Description |
|-|-|
| `WEBSITE_RELAYS` | Read-only. Data needed to configure the Hybrid Connection, including endpoints and service bus data. |
| `WEBSITE_REWRITE_TABLE` | Read-only. Used at runtime to do the lookups and rewrite connections appropriately. | 
| `WEBSITE_VNET_ROUTE_ALL` | By default, if you use [regional VNet Integration](./overview-vnet-integration.md#regional-virtual-network-integration), your app only routes RFC1918 traffic into your VNet. Set to `1` to route all outbound traffic into your VNet and be subject to the same NSGs and UDRs. The setting lets you access non-RFC1918 endpoints through your VNet, secure all outbound traffic leaving your app, and force tunnel all outbound traffic to a network appliance of your own choosing. |
| `WEBSITE_PRIVATE_IP` | Read-only. IP address associated with the app when [integrated with a VNet](./overview-vnet-integration.md). For Regional VNet Integration, the value is an IP from the address range of the delegated subnet, and for Gateway-required VNet Integration, the value is an IP from the address range of the point-to-site address pool configured on the Virtual Network Gateway. This IP is used by the app to connect to the resources through the VNet. Also, it can change within the described address range. |
| `WEBSITE_PRIVATE_PORTS` | Read-only. In VNet integration, shows which ports are useable by the app to communicate with other nodes. |
| `WEBSITE_CONTENTOVERVNET` | If you are mounting an Azure File Share on the App Service and the Storage account is restricted to a VNET, ensure to enable this setting with a value of `1`. |

<!-- | WEBSITE_SLOT_POLL_WORKER_FOR_CHANGE_NOTIFICATION | Poll worker before pinging the site to detect when change notification has been processed. |

## Key vault references

The following environment variables are related to [key vault references](app-service-key-vault-references.md).

| Setting name | Description |
|-|-|
| `WEBSITE_KEYVAULT_REFERENCES` | Read-only. Contains information (including statuses) for all Key Vault references that are currently configured in the app. |
| `WEBSITE_SKIP_CONTENTSHARE_VALIDATION` | If you set the shared storage connection of your app (using `WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING`) to a Key Vault reference, the app can't resolve the key vault reference at app creation or update if one of the following conditions is true: <br/>- The app accesses the key vault with a system-assigned identity.<br/>- The app accesses the key vault with a user-assigned identity, and the key vault is [locked with a VNet](/azure/key-vault/general/overview-vnet-service-endpoints).<br/>To avoid errors at create or update time, set this variable to `1`. |
| `WEBSITE_DELAY_CERT_DELETION` | This env var can be set to 1 by users in order to ensure that a certificate that a worker process is dependent upon isn't deleted until it exits. |
<!-- | `WEBSITE_ALLOW_DOUBLE_ESCAPING_URL` | TODO | -->

## CORS

The following environment variables are related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration.

| Setting name | Description |
|-|-|
| `WEBSITE_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Read-only. Shows the allowed origins for CORS. |
| `WEBSITE_CORS_SUPPORT_CREDENTIALS` | Read-only. Shows whether setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header to `true` is enabled (`True`) or not (`False`). |

## Authentication & Authorization

The following environment variables are related to [App Service authentication](overview-authentication-authorization.md).

| Setting name| Description|
|-|-|
| `WEBSITE_AUTH_DISABLE_IDENTITY_FLOW`  | When set to `true`, disables assigning the thread principal identity in ASP.NET-based web applications (including v1 Function Apps). This is designed to allow developers to protect access to their site with auth, but still have it use a separate sign-in mechanism within their app logic. The default is `false`. |
| `WEBSITE_AUTH_HIDE_DEPRECATED_SID` | `true` or `false`. The default value is `false`. This is a setting for the legacy Azure Mobile Apps integration for Azure App Service. Setting this to `true` resolves an issue where the SID (security ID) generated for authenticated users might change if the user changes their profile information. Changing this value may result in existing Azure Mobile Apps user IDs changing. Most apps don't need to use this setting. |
| `WEBSITE_AUTH_NONCE_DURATION`| A _timespan_ value in the form `_hours_:_minutes_:_seconds_`. The default value is `00:05:00`, or 5 minutes. This setting controls the lifetime of the [cryptographic nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) generated for all browser-driven logins. If a sign-in fails to complete in the specified time, the sign-in flow will be retried automatically. This application setting is intended for use with the V1 (classic) configuration experience. If using the V2 authentication configuration schema, you should instead use the `login.nonce.nonceExpirationInterval` configuration value. |
| `WEBSITE_AUTH_PRESERVE_URL_FRAGMENT` | When set to `true` and users select on app links that contain URL fragments, the sign-in process will ensure that the URL fragment part of your URL doesn't get lost in the sign-in redirect process. For more information, see [Customize sign-in and sign-out in Azure App Service authentication](configure-authentication-customize-sign-in-out.md#preserve-url-fragments). |
| `WEBSITE_AUTH_USE_LEGACY_CLAIMS` | To maintain backward compatibility across upgrades, the authentication module uses the legacy claims mapping of short to long names in the `/.auth/me` API, so certain mappings are excluded (e.g. "roles"). To get the more modern version of the claims mappings, set this variable to `False`. In the "roles" example, it would be mapped to the long claim name "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role". |
| `WEBSITE_AUTH_DISABLE_WWWAUTHENTICATE` | `true` or `false`. The default value is `false`. When set to `true`, removes the [`WWW-Authenticate`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/WWW-Authenticate) HTTP response header from module-generated HTTP 401 responses. This application setting is intended for use with the V1 (classic) configuration experience. If using the V2 authentication configuration schema, you should instead use the `identityProviders.azureActiveDirectory.login.disableWwwAuthenticate` configuration value. |
| `WEBSITE_AUTH_STATE_DIRECTORY`  | A local file system directory path where tokens are stored when the file-based token store is enabled. The default value is `%HOME%\Data\.auth`. This application setting is intended for use with the V1 (classic) configuration experience. If using the V2 authentication configuration schema, you should instead use the `login.tokenStore.fileSystem.directory` configuration value. |
| `WEBSITE_AUTH_TOKEN_CONTAINER_SASURL` | A fully qualified blob container URL. Instructs the auth module to store and load all encrypted tokens to the specified blob storage container instead of using the default local file system.  |
| `WEBSITE_AUTH_TOKEN_REFRESH_HOURS` | Any positive decimal number. The default value is `72` (hours). This setting controls the amount of time after a session token expires that the `/.auth/refresh` API can be used to refresh it. Refresh attempts after this period will fail and end users will be required to sign-in again. This application setting is intended for use with the V1 (classic) configuration experience. If using the V2 authentication configuration schema, you should instead use the `login.tokenStore.tokenRefreshExtensionHours` configuration value. |
| `WEBSITE_AUTH_TRACE_LEVEL`| Controls the verbosity of authentication traces written to [Application Logging](troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs.md#enable-application-logging-windows). Valid values are `Off`, `Error`, `Warning`, `Information`, and `Verbose`. The default value is `Verbose`. |
| `WEBSITE_AUTH_VALIDATE_NONCE`| `true` or `false`. The default value is `true`. This value should never be set to `false` except when temporarily debugging [cryptographic nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) validation failures that occur during interactive logins. This application setting is intended for use with the V1 (classic) configuration experience. If using the V2 authentication configuration schema, you should instead use the `login.nonce.validateNonce` configuration value. |
| `WEBSITE_AUTH_V2_CONFIG_JSON` | This environment variable is populated automatically by the Azure App Service platform and is used to configure the integrated authentication module. The value of this environment variable corresponds to the V2 (non-classic) authentication configuration for the current app in Azure Resource Manager. It's not intended to be configured explicitly. |
| `WEBSITE_AUTH_ENABLED` | Read-only. Injected into a Windows or Linux app to indicate whether App Service authentication is enabled. |
| `WEBSITE_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | By default, the automatically generated key is used as the encryption key. To override, set to a desired key. This is recommended if you want to share tokens or sessions across multiple apps. If specified, it supersedes the `MACHINEKEY_DecryptionKey` setting. |
| `WEBSITE_AUTH_SIGNING_KEY` | By default, the automatically generated key is used as the signing key. To override, set to a desired key. This is recommended if you want to share tokens or sessions across multiple apps. If specified, it supersedes the `MACHINEKEY_ValidationKey` setting. |

When you're scaling up or out, App Service pings the Health check path to ensure new instances are ready. For more information, see [Health check](monitor-instances-health-check.md).|
| `WEBSITE_HEALTHCHECK_MAXUNHEALTHYWORKERPERCENT` | To avoid overwhelming healthy instances, no more than half of the instances will be excluded. For example, if an App Service Plan is scaled to four instances and three are unhealthy, at most two will be excluded. The other two instances (one healthy and one unhealthy) will continue to receive requests. In the worst-case scenario where all instances are unhealthy, none will be excluded. To override this behavior, set to a value between `1` and `100`. A higher value means more unhealthy instances will be removed. The default is `50` (50%). |

## Webjobs

The following environment variables are related to [WebJobs](webjobs-create.md).

| Setting name| Description |
|-|-|
| `WEBJOBS_RESTART_TIME`|For continuous jobs, delay in seconds when a job's process goes down for any reason before relaunching it. |
| `WEBJOBS_IDLE_TIMEOUT`| For triggered jobs, timeout in seconds, after which the job is aborted if it's in idle, has no CPU time or output. |
| `WEBJOBS_HISTORY_SIZE`| For triggered jobs, maximum number of runs kept in the history directory per job. The default is `50`. |
| `WEBJOBS_STOPPED`| Set to `1` to disable running any job, and stop all currently running jobs. |
| `WEBJOBS_DISABLE_SCHEDULE`| Set to `1` to turn off all scheduled triggering. Jobs can still be manually invoked. |
| `WEBJOBS_ROOT_PATH`| Absolute or relative path of webjob files. For a relative path, the value is combined with the default root path (`D:/home/site/wwwroot/` or `/home/site/wwwroot/`). |
| `WEBJOBS_LOG_TRIGGERED_JOBS_TO_APP_LOGS`| Set to true to send output from triggered WebJobs to the application logs pipeline (which supports file system, blobs, and tables). |
| `WEBJOBS_SHUTDOWN_FILE` | File that App Service creates when a shutdown request is detected. It's the web job process's responsibility to detect the presence of this file and initiate shutdown. When using the WebJobs SDK, this part is handled automatically. |
| `WEBJOBS_PATH` | Read-only. Root path of currently running job (will be under some temporary directory). |
| `WEBJOBS_NAME` | Read-only. Current job name. |
| `WEBJOBS_TYPE` | Read-only. Current job type (`triggered` or `continuous`). |
| `WEBJOBS_DATA_PATH` | Read-only. Current job metadata path to contain the job's logs, history, and any artifact of the job. |
| `WEBJOBS_RUN_ID` | Read-only. For triggered jobs, current run ID of the job. |

## Functions

| Setting name | Description |
|-|-|
| `WEBSITE_FUNCTIONS_ARMCACHE_ENABLED` | Set to `0` to disable the functions cache. |
| `WEBSITE_MAX_DYNAMIC_APPLICATION_SCALE_OUT` | [App settings reference for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-app-settings.md) |
|`AzureWebJobsSecretStorageType` | [App settings reference for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-app-settings.md) |
| `FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION` | [App settings reference for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-app-settings.md) |
| `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME` | [App settings reference for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-app-settings.md) |
| `AzureWebJobsStorage` | [App settings reference for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-app-settings.md) |
| `WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING` | [App settings reference for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-app-settings.md) |
| `WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE` | [App settings reference for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-app-settings.md) |
| `WEBSITE_CONTENTOVERVNET` | [App settings reference for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-app-settings.md) |
| `WEBSITE_ENABLE_BROTLI_ENCODING` | [App settings reference for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-app-settings.md) |
| `WEBSITE_USE_PLACEHOLDER` | [App settings reference for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-app-settings.md) |
| `WEBSITE_PLACEHOLDER_MODE` | Read-only. Shows whether the function app is running on a placeholder host (`generalized`) or its own host (`specialized`). |
| `WEBSITE_DISABLE_ZIP_CACHE` | When your app runs from a [ZIP package](deploy-run-package.md) ( `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE=1`), the five most recently deployed ZIP packages are cached in the app's file system (D:\home\data\SitePackages). Set this variable to `1` to disable this cache. For Linux consumption apps, the ZIP package cache is disabled by default. |
<!--
| `FUNCTIONS_RUNTIME_SCALE_MONITORING_ENABLED` | TODO |
| `WEBSITE_SKIP_FUNCTION_APP_WARMUP` | Apps can use appsetting to opt out of warmup. Restricted to linux only since this is primarily for static sites that use Linux dynamic function apps. Linux dynamic sites are used as placeholder sites for static sites. Function apps don't get specialized until static sites are deployed. This allows function apps used by static sites to skip warmup and using up containers before any content is deployed. TODO |
 WEBSITE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_IN_MINUTES | removed WEBSITE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_IN_MINUTES because they aren't used in Linux Consumption.???
| `WEBSITE_DISABLE_FUNCTIONS_STARTUPCONTEXT_CACHE`| This env var can be set to 1 by users in order to avoid using the Functions StartupContext Cache feature. |
| `WEBSITE_CONTAINER_READY` | The env var is set to '1' to indicate to the Functions Runtime that it can proceed with initializing/specializing 
        // itself. For placeholders, it is set once specialization is complete on DWAS side and detours are reinitialized. For 
        // non-placeholder function apps, it is simply set to 1 when the process is started, because detours are initialized 
        // as part of starting the process (when PicoHelper.dll is loaded, well before any managed code is running).
        // NOTE: This is set on all sites, irrespective of whether it is a Functions site, because the EnvSettings module depends 
        // upon it to decide when to inject the app-settings.|
| `WEBSITE_PLACEHOLDER_PING_PATH` | This env var can be used to set a special warmup ping path on placeholder template sites. |
| ` WEBSITE_PLACEHOLDER_DISABLE_AUTOSPECIALIZATION` | This env var can be used to disable specialization from being enabled automatically for a given placeholder template site. |
| `WEBSITE_FUNCTIONS_STARTUPCONTEXT_CACHE` | This env var is set only during specialization of a placeholder, to indicate to the Functions Runtime that
        // some function-app related data needed at startup, like secrets, are available in a file at the path specified
        // by this env var. |
WEBSITE_ENABLE_COLD_START_PROFILING | This env var can be set to 1 by internal SLA sites in order to trigger collection of perf profiles, if feature is enabled on the stamp. |
WEBSITE_CURRENT_STAMPNAME | these environments contain the stamp name used for various scale decisions |
WEBSITE_HOME_STAMPNAME | these environments contain the stamp name used for various scale decisions |
WEBSITE_ELASTIC_SCALING_ENABLED
WEBSITE_FILECHANGEAUDIT_ENABLED
| `WEBSITE_HTTPSCALEV2_ENABLED` | This is the default behavior for both v1 and v2 Azure Functions apps. | 
WEBSITE_CHANGEANALYSISSCAN_ENABLED
WEBSITE_DISABLE_CHILD_SPECIALIZATION
