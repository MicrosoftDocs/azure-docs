# Create a WordPress site

[WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org) is an open source Content Management System (CMS) used by over 40% of the web to create websites, blogs, and other applications. WordPress can be run on a few different Azure services: [AKS](/azure/mysql/flexible-server/tutorial-deploy-wordpress-on-aks), [Virtual Machines](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-lamp-stack#install-wordpress), [Azure Container Apps](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/apptemplate-wordpress-on-ACA) and Azure App Service. For a full list of WordPress options on Azure, see [WordPress on Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?search=wordpress&page=1).

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to create and deploy your first [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org/) site to [Azure App Service on Linux](overview.md#app-service-on-linux) with [Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server](/azure/mysql/flexible-server/) using the [WordPress Azure Marketplace item by App Service](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/WordPress.WordPress?tab=Overview). This quickstart uses the **Standard** tier for your app and a **Burstable, B2s** tier for your database, and incurs a cost for your Azure Subscription. For pricing, visit [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/), [Azure Database for MySQL pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/mysql/flexible-server/), [Content Delivery Network pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/), and [Azure Blob Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/).

To complete this quickstart, you need an Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs).

## Create WordPress site using Azure portal

1. To start creating the WordPress site, browse to [https://portal.azure.com/#create/WordPress.WordPress](https://portal.azure.com/#create/WordPress.WordPress).

## Manage the MySQL flexible server, username, or password

- The MySQL Flexible Server is created behind a private [Virtual Network](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md) and can't be accessed directly. To access or manage the database, use phpMyAdmin that's deployed with the WordPress site. You can access phpMyAdmin by following these steps:
    - Navigate to the URL: https://`<sitename>`.azurewebsites.net/phpmyadmin
    - Login with the flexible server's username and password

- Database username and password of the MySQL Flexible Server are generated automatically. To retrieve these values after the deployment go to Application Settings section of the Configuration page in Azure App Service. The WordPress configuration is modified to use these [Application Settings](reference-app-settings.md#wordpress) to connect to the MySQL database.

- To change the MySQL database password, see [Reset admin password](/azure/mysql/flexible-server/how-to-manage-server-portal#reset-admin-password). Whenever the MySQL database credentials are changed, the [Application Settings](reference-app-settings.md#wordpress) need to be updated. The [Application Settings for MySQL database](reference-app-settings.md#wordpress) begin with the **`DATABASE_`** prefix. For more information on updating MySQL passwords, see [WordPress on App Service](https://github.com/Azure/wordpress-linux-appservice/blob/main/WordPress/changing_mysql_database_password.md).

## Change WordPress admin password

The [Application Settings](reference-app-settings.md#wordpress) for WordPress admin credentials are only for deployment purposes. Modifying these values has no effect on the WordPress installation. To change the WordPress admin password, see [resetting your password](https://wordpress.org/support/article/resetting-your-password/#to-change-your-password). The [Application Settings for WordPress admin credentials](reference-app-settings.md#wordpress) begin with the **`WORDPRESS_ADMIN_`** prefix. For more information on updating the WordPress admin password, see [Changing WordPress Admin Credentials](https://github.com/Azure/wordpress-linux-appservice/blob/main/WordPress/changing_wordpress_admin_credentials.md).

## Migrate to App Service on Linux

There's a couple approaches when migrating your WordPress app to App Service on Linux. You could use a WP plugin or migrate manually using FTP and a MySQL client. Additional documentation, including [Migrating to App Service](https://github.com/Azure/wordpress-linux-appservice/blob/main/WordPress/wordpress_migration_linux_appservices.md), can be found at [WordPress - App Service on Linux](https://github.com/Azure/wordpress-linux-appservice/tree/main/WordPress).
