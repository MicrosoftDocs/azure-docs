# Supported Types for Named Entity Recognition Version 3 (Preview)

The Text Analytics API provides the ability to identify and disambiguate entities found in text. [Named Entity Recognition](how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-entity-linking.md) (NER) is the ability to identify different entities in text and categorize them into pre-defined classes.

## Entity types

The supported entity types and sub-types (where applicable) are listed below:

#### [General](#tab/general)

[!INCLUDE [supported entity types - general](./includes/entity-types/general-entities.md)]

#### [Personal information](#tab/personal)

[!INCLUDE [supported entity types - personally identifying information](./includes/entity-types/personal-information-entities.md)]
