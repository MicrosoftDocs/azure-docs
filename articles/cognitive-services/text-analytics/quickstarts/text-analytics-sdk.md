# Quickstart: Use the Text Analytics client library for detecting language

Get started with the Text Analytics client library. Follow these steps to install the package and try out the example code for basic tasks.

Use the Text Analytics client library to perform:

* Sentiment analysis
* Language detection
* Entity recognition
* Key phrase extraction

> [!TIP]
> Want to use the Text Analytics REST API instead? Use these links to find sample code for sending REST requests in: [Java](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/dotnet/Language/SentimentV3.cs), [Python](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/dotnet/Language/SentimentV3.cs), [Ruby](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/dotnet/Language/SentimentV3.cs), [Node.js](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/dotnet/Language/SentimentV3.cs), [Go](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/dotnet/Language/SentimentV3.cs)

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Azure CLI](../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md#clean-up-resources)
