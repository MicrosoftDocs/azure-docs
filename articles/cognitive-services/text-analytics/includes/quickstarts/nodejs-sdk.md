[Reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-cognitiveservices-textanalytics) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-node/tree/master/lib/services/cognitiveServicesTextAnalytics) | [Package (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-cognitiveservices-textanalytics) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-node-sdk-samples/)

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* The current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setting up

### Create a Text Analytics Azure resource

Azure Cognitive Services are represented by Azure resources that you subscribe to. Create a resource for Text analytics using the [Azure portal](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md) or [Azure CLI](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md) on your local machine. You can also:

* Get a [trial key](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/#decision) valid for 7 days for free. After signing up it will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/).  
* View your resource on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

After you get a key from your trial subscription or resource, [create an environment variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication) for the key, named `TEXTANALYTICS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`.

### Create a new Node.js application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

```console
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
```

Run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a `package.json` file. 

```console
npm init
```

Create a file named `index.js` and import the following libraries:

```javascript
const CognitiveServicesCredentials = require("@azure/ms-rest-js");
const TextAnalyticsAPIClient = require("@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics");
```

Create variables for your resource's Azure endpoint and subscription key. Obtain these values from the environment variables TEXT_ANALYTICS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY and TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT. If you created these environment variables after you began editing the application, you will need to close and reopen the editor, IDE, or shell you are using to access the variables.

[!INCLUDE [text-analytics-find-resource-information](../find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```javascript
const key_var = 'TEXT_ANALYTICS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY';
if (!process.env[key_var]) {
    throw new Error('please set/export the following environment variable: ' + key_var);
}
const subscription_key = process.env[key_var];

const endpoint_var = 'TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT';
if (!process.env[endpoint_var]) {
    throw new Error('please set/export the following environment variable: ' + endpoint_var);
}
const endpoint = process.env[endpoint_var];
```

### Install the client library

Install the `@azure/ms-rest-js` and `@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics` NPM packages:

```console
npm install @azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics @azure/ms-rest-js
```

Your app's `package.json` file will be updated with the dependencies.

## Object model

The Text Analytics client is a [TextAnalyticsClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-cognitiveservices-textanalytics/textanalyticsclient?view=azure-node-latest) object that authenticates to Azure using your key. The client provides several methods for analyzing text, as a single string, or a batch.

Text is sent to the API as a list of `documents`, which are `dictionary` objects containing a combination of `id`, `text`, and `language` attributes depending on the method used. The `text` attribute stores the text to be analyzed in the origin `language`, and the `id` can be any value. 

The response object is a list containing the analysis information for each document. 

## Code examples

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Sentiment Analysis](#sentiment-analysis)
* [Language detection](#language-detection)
* [Entity recognition](#entity-recognition)
* [Key phrase extraction](#key-phrase-extraction)


## Authenticate the client

Create a new [TextAnalyticsClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-cognitiveservices-textanalytics/textanalyticsclient?view=azure-node-latest) object with `credentials` and `endpoint` as a parameter.

```javascript
const creds = new CognitiveServicesCredentials.ApiKeyCredentials({ inHeader: { 'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key } });
const client = new TextAnalyticsAPIClient.TextAnalyticsClient(creds, endpoint);
```

## Sentiment analysis

Create a list of objects, containing the documents you want to analyze.

```javascript
const inputDocuments = {documents:[
    {language:"en", id:"1", text:"I had the best day of my life."}
]}
```

Call `client.sentiment` and get the result. Then iterate through the results, and print each document's ID, and sentiment score. A score closer to 0 indicates a negative sentiment, while a score closer to 1 indicates a positive sentiment.

```javascript
const operation = client.sentiment({multiLanguageBatchInput: inputDocuments})
operation
.then(result => {
    console.log(result.documents);
})
.catch(err => {
    throw err;
});
```

Run your code with `node index.js` in your console window.

### Output

```console
[ { id: '1', score: 0.8723785877227783 } ]
```

## Language detection

Create a list of objects containing your documents.

```javascript
// The documents to be submitted for language detection. The ID can be any value.
const inputDocuments = {
    documents: [
        { id: "1", text: "This is a document written in English." }
    ]
    };
```

Call `client.detectLanguage()` and get the result. Then iterate through the results, and print each document's ID, and the first returned language.

```javascript
const operation = client.detectLanguage({
    languageBatchInput: inputDocuments
});
operation
    .then(result => {
    result.documents.forEach(document => {
        console.log(`ID: ${document.id}`);
        document.detectedLanguages.forEach(language =>
        console.log(`\tLanguage: ${language.name}`)
        );
    });
    })
    .catch(err => {
    throw err;
    });
```

Run your code with `node index.js` in your console window.

### Output

```console
===== LANGUAGE EXTRACTION ======
ID: 1 Language English
```

## Entity recognition

Create a list of objects, containing your documents.

```javascript
const inputDocuments = {
    documents: [
        { language: "en", id: "1", text: "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800" }
    ]
}
```

Call `client.entities()` and get the result. Then iterate through the results, and print each document's ID. For each detected entity, print its wikipedia name, the type and sub-types (if exists) as well as the locations in the original text.

```javascript
const operation = client.entities({
    multiLanguageBatchInput: inputDocuments
});
operation
    .then(result => {
    result.documents.forEach(document => {
        console.log(`Document ID: ${document.id}`)
        document.entities.forEach(e =>{
        console.log(`\tName: ${e.name} Type: ${e.type} Sub Type: ${e.type}`)
        e.matches.forEach(match => (
            console.log(`\t\tOffset: ${match.offset} Length: ${match.length} Score: ${match.entityTypeScore}`)
        ))
        })
    });
    })
    .catch(err => {
    throw err;
    });
```

Run your code with `node index.js` in your console window.

### Output

```console
Document ID: 1
    Name: Microsoft Type: Organization Sub Type: Organization
            Offset: 0 Length: 9 Score: 1
    Name: Bill Gates Type: Person Sub Type: Person
            Offset: 25 Length: 10 Score: 0.999786376953125
    Name: Paul Allen Type: Person Sub Type: Person
            Offset: 40 Length: 10 Score: 0.9988105297088623
    Name: April 4 Type: Other Sub Type: Other
            Offset: 54 Length: 7 Score: 0.8
    Name: April 4, 1975 Type: DateTime Sub Type: DateTime
            Offset: 54 Length: 13 Score: 0.8
    Name: BASIC Type: Other Sub Type: Other
            Offset: 89 Length: 5 Score: 0.8
    Name: Altair 8800 Type: Other Sub Type: Other
            Offset: 116 Length: 11 Score: 0.8
```

## Key phrase extraction

Create a list of objects, containing your documents.

```javascript
    let inputLanguage = {
    documents: [
        {language:"en", id:"1", text:"My cat might need to see a veterinarian."}
    ]
    };
```

Call `client.keyPhrases()` and get the result. Then iterate through the results and print each document's ID, and any detected key phrases.

```javascript
    let operation = client.keyPhrases({
    multiLanguageBatchInput: inputLanguage
    });
    operation
    .then(result => {
        console.log(result.documents);
    })
    .catch(err => {
        throw err;
    });
```

Run your code with `node index.js` in your console window.

### Output

```console
[
    { id: '1', keyPhrases: [ 'cat', 'veterinarian' ] }
]
```

## Run the application

Run the application with the `node` command on your quickstart file.

```console
node index.js
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
