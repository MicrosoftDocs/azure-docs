Start using the Text Analytics API with one of the options below.
* <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/?api=text-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get a trial key (opens in a new tab)</a>
    * No Azure subscription needed. 
    * Valid for seven days, for free. After signing up, a trial key and endpoint will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/). 
    * This is a great option if you want to try the Text Analytics API, but don’t have an Azure subscription.

* <a href="https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Create a Text Analytics resource (opens in a new tab)</a>
    * Available through the Azure portal until you delete the resource.
    * Use the free pricing tier to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

* <a href="https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Create a Multi-Service resource (opens in a new tab)</a>
    * Available through the Azure portal until you delete the resource.  
    * Use the same key and endpoint for your applications, across multiple Cognitive Services.
