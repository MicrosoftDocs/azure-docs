Start using the Text Analytics API with one of the options below.


* <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/?api=text-analytics" title="Create a trial Text Analytics resource" target="_blank">Create a trial resource <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a>
    * No Azure subscription needed. 
    * Valid for seven days, for free. After signing up, a trial key and endpoint will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/). 
    * This is a great option if you want to try the Text Analytics API, but don’t have an Azure subscription.
