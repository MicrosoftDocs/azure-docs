summary: "The Azure Face service provides AI algorithms that detect, recognize, and analyze human faces in images. Facial recognition software is important in many different scenarios, such as identity verification, touchless access control, and face blurring for privacy. \n\nOn June 11, 2020, Microsoft announced that it will not sell facial recognition technology to police departments in the United States until strong regulation, grounded in human rights, has been enacted. As such, customers may not use facial recognition features or features included in Azure Services, such as Face or Azure Video Analyzer for Media, if a customer is, or is allowing use of such services by or for, a police department in the United States."
