In this quickstart, you'll learn how to call the Computer Vision REST API to do a number of tasks. With the [Analyze Image](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-1-ga/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499f21b) method, you can extract visual features based on image content.

In this quickstart, you generate a thumbnail from an image using the Computer Vision REST API. You specify the desired height and width, which can differ in aspect ration from the input image. Computer Vision uses smart cropping to intelligently identify the area of interest and generate cropping coordinates around that region.


## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/) 
* [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) installed
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision"  title="Create a Computer Vision resource"  target="_blank">create a Computer Vision resource <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
  * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Computer Vision service. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
  * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Analyze an image

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following command into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in the command where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `<subscriptionKey>` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace the first part of the request URL (`westcentralus`) with the text in your own endpoint URL.
        [!INCLUDE [Custom subdomains notice](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains-note.md)]
    1. Optionally, change the image URL in the request body (`http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Shaki_waterfall.jpg\`) to the URL of a different image to be analyzed.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. Paste the command from the text editor into the command prompt window, and then run the command.

```bash
curl -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <subscriptionKey>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v3.1/analyze?visualFeatures=Categories,Description&details=Landmarks" -d "{\"url\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Shaki_waterfall.jpg\"}"
```

### Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample application parses and displays a successful response in the command prompt window, similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "outdoor_water",
      "score": 0.9921875,
      "detail": {

  }
}
```


# Quickstart: Extract printed text (OCR) using the Computer Vision REST API and cURL

In this quickstart, you'll extract printed text with optical character recognition (OCR) from an image using the Computer Vision REST API. With the [OCR](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-1-ga/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499f20d) method, you can detect printed text in an image and extract recognized characters into a machine-usable character stream.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/) 
* [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/)
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision"  title="Create a Computer Vision resource"  target="_blank">create a Computer Vision resource <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
  * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Computer Vision service. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
  * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Read printed text with OCR

```

## Generate a thumbnail

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following command into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in the command where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `<subscriptionKey>` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace the value of `<thumbnailFile>` with the path and name of the file in which to save the thumbnail.
    1. Replace the first part of the request URL (`westcentralus`) with the text in your own endpoint URL.
        [!INCLUDE [Custom subdomains notice](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains-note.md)]
    1. Optionally, change the image URL in the request body (`https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Shorkie_Poo_Puppy.jpg/1280px-Shorkie_Poo_Puppy.jpg\`) to the URL of a different image from which to generate a thumbnail.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. Paste the command from the text editor into the command prompt window.
1. Press enter to run the program.

    ```bash
    curl -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <subscriptionKey>" -o <thumbnailFile> -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v3.1/generateThumbnail?width=100&height=100&smartCropping=true" -d "{\"url\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Shorkie_Poo_Puppy.jpg/1280px-Shorkie_Poo_Puppy.jpg\"}"
    ```

### Examine the response

A successful response writes the thumbnail image to the file specified in `<thumbnailFile>`. If the request fails, the response contains an error code and a message to help determine what went wrong. If the request seems to succeed but the created thumbnail is not a valid image file, it might be that your subscription key is not valid.


## Next steps
