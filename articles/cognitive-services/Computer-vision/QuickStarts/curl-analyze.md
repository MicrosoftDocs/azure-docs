# Quickstart: Analyze a remote image using the Computer Vision REST API and cURL

In this quickstart, you analyze a remotely stored image to extract visual features using Computer Vision's REST API. With the [Analyze Image](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa) method, you can extract visual features based on image content.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=cognitive-services) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/windows).
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. You can get a free trial key from [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=computer-vision). Or, follow the instructions in [Create a Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) to subscribe to Computer Vision and get your key.

## Create and run the sample command

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following command into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in the command where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `<subscriptionKey>` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace the request URL (`https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/analyze`) with the endpoint URL for the [Analyze Image](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa) method from the Azure region where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
    1. Optionally, change the language parameter of the request URL (`language=en`) to use a different supported language.
    1. Optionally, change the image URL in the request body (`http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Shaki_waterfall.jpg\`) to the URL of a different image to be analyzed.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. Paste the command from the text editor into the command prompt window, and then run the command.

```bash
curl -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <subscriptionKey>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/analyze?visualFeatures=Categories,Description&details=Landmarks&language=en" -d "{\"url\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Shaki_waterfall.jpg\"}"
```

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample application parses and displays a successful response in the command prompt window, similar to the following example:

```json
