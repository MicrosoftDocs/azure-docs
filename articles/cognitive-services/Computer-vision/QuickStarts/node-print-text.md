# Quickstart: Extract printed text (OCR) using the Computer Vision REST API and Node.js

In this quickstart, you extract printed text with optical character recognition (OCR) from an image by using Computer Vision's REST API. With the [OCR](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc) method, you can detect printed text in an image and extract recognized characters into a machine-usable character stream.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=cognitive-services) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 4.x or later installed.
- You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. You can get a free trial key from [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=computer-vision). Or, follow the instructions in [Create a Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) to subscribe to Computer Vision and get your key.

## Create and run the sample

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Install the npm [`request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) package.
   1. Open a command prompt window as an administrator.
   1. Run the following command:

      ```console
      npm install request
      ```

   1. After the package is successfully installed, close the command prompt window.

1. Copy the following code into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in code where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `subscriptionKey` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace the value of `uriBase` with the endpoint URL for the [OCR](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc) method from the Azure region where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
    1. Optionally, replace the value of `imageUrl` with the URL of a different image from which you want to extract printed text.
1. Save the code as a file with a `.js` extension. For example, `get-printed-text.js`.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `node` command to run the file. For example, `node get-printed-text.js`.

```javascript
'use strict';

const request = require('request');

// Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
const subscriptionKey = '<Subscription Key>';

// You must use the same location in your REST call as you used to get your
// subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys from
// westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URL below with "westus".
const uriBase =
    'https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/ocr';

const imageUrl = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/' +
    'Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png/338px-Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png';

// Request parameters.
const params = {
    'language': 'unk',
    'detectOrientation': 'true',
};

const options = {
    uri: uriBase,
    qs: params,
    body: '{"url": ' + '"' + imageUrl + '"}',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key' : subscriptionKey
    }
};

request.post(options, (error, response, body) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log('Error: ', error);
    return;
  }
  let jsonResponse = JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(body), null, '  ');
  console.log('JSON Response\n');
  console.log(jsonResponse);
});
```

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample parses and displays a successful response in the command prompt window, similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "language": "en",
  "orientation": "Up",
  "textAngle": 0,
  "regions": [
    {
      "boundingBox": "21,16,304,451",

              "boundingBox": "28,16,288,41",
              "text": "NOTHING"
            }
          ]
        },
        {

            }
          ]
        },

              "text": "ATOMS"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "boundingBox": "22,253,297,32",
          "words": [
            {
              "boundingBox": "22,253,105,32",
              "text": "AND"
            },
            {
              "boundingBox": "144,253,175,32",
              "text": "EMPTY"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "boundingBox": "21,298,304,60",
          "words": [
            {
              "boundingBox": "21,298,304,60",
              "text": "SPACE."
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "boundingBox": "26,387,294,37",
          "words": [
            {
              "boundingBox": "26,387,210,37",
              "text": "Everything"
            },
            {
              "boundingBox": "249,389,71,27",
              "text": "else"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "boundingBox": "127,431,198,36",
          "words": [
            {
              "boundingBox": "127,431,31,29",
              "text": "is"
            },
            {
              "boundingBox": "172,431,153,36",
              "text": "opinion."
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the file, and then uninstall the npm `request` package. To uninstall the package, do the following steps:

1. Open a command prompt window as an administrator.
2. Run the following command:

   ```console
   npm uninstall request
   ```

3. After the package is successfully uninstalled, close the command prompt window.
