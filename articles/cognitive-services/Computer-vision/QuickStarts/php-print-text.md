# Quickstart: Extract printed text (OCR) using the Computer Vision REST API and PHP

In this quickstart, you extract printed text with optical character recognition (OCR) from an image by using Computer Vision's REST API. With the [OCR](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc) method, you can detect printed text in an image and extract recognized characters into a machine-usable character stream.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=cognitive-services) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [PHP](https://secure.php.net/downloads.php) installed.
- You must have [Pear](https://pear.php.net) installed.
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. You can get a free trial key from [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=computer-vision). Or, follow the instructions in [Create a Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) to subscribe to Computer Vision and get your key.

## Create and run the sample

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Install the PHP5 [`HTTP_Request2`](https://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request2) package.
   1. Open a command prompt window as an administrator.
   1. Run the following command:

      ```console
      pear install HTTP_Request2
      ```

   1. After the package is successfully installed, close the command prompt window.

1. Copy the following code into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in code where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `subscriptionKey` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace the value of `uriBase` with the endpoint URL for the [OCR](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc) method from the Azure region where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
    1. Optionally, replace the value of `imageUrl` with the URL of a different image from which you want to extract printed text.
1. Save the code as a file with a `.php` extension. For example, `get-printed-text.php`.
1. Open a browser window with PHP support.
1. Drag and drop the file into the browser window.

```php
<?php
<html>
<head>
    <title>OCR Sample</title>
</head>
<body>
<?php
// Replace <Subscription Key> with a valid subscription key.
$ocpApimSubscriptionKey = '<Subscription Key>';

// You must use the same location in your REST call as you used to obtain
// your subscription keys. For example, if you obtained your subscription keys
// from westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URL below with "westus".
$uriBase = 'https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/';

$imageUrl = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/' .
    'Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png/338px-Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png';

require_once 'HTTP/Request2.php';

$request = new Http_Request2($uriBase . 'ocr');
$url = $request->getUrl();

$headers = array(
    // Request headers
    'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
    'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key' => $ocpApimSubscriptionKey
);
$request->setHeader($headers);

$parameters = array(
    // Request parameters
    'language' => 'unk',
    'detectOrientation' => 'true'
);
$url->setQueryVariables($parameters);

$request->setMethod(HTTP_Request2::METHOD_POST);

// Request body parameters
$body = json_encode(array('url' => $imageUrl));

// Request body
$request->setBody($body);

try
{
    $response = $request->send();
    echo "<pre>" .
        json_encode(json_decode($response->getBody()), JSON_PRETTY_PRINT) . "</pre>";
}
catch (HttpException $ex)
{
    echo "<pre>" . $ex . "</pre>";
}
?>
</body>
</html>
```

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample website parses and displays a successful response in the browser window, similar to the following example:

```json
{
    "language": "en",
    "orientation": "Up",
    "textAngle": 0,
    "regions": [
        {
            "boundingBox": "21,16,304,451",
            "lines": [

                        }

                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the file, and then uninstall the PHP5 `HTTP_Request2` package. To uninstall the package, do the following steps:

1. Open a command prompt window as an administrator.
2. Run the following command:

   ```console
   pear uninstall HTTP_Request2
   ```

3. After the package is successfully uninstalled, close the command prompt window.

## Next steps

Explore the Computer Vision API to analyze an image, detect celebrities and landmarks, create a thumbnail, and extract printed and handwritten text.
