# Quickstart: Extract printed text (OCR) using the Computer Vision REST API and Python

In this quickstart, you extract printed text with optical character recognition (OCR) from an image by using Computer Vision's REST API. With the [OCR](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc) method, you can detect printed text in an image and extract recognized characters into a machine-usable character stream.

You can run this quickstart in a step-by step fashion using a Jupyter notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org). To launch Binder, select the following button:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/cognitive-services-notebooks/master?filepath=VisionAPI.ipynb)

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed if you want to run the sample locally.
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. You can get a free trial key from [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=computer-vision). Or, follow the instructions in [Create a Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) to subscribe to Computer Vision and get your key.

## Create and run the sample

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in code where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `subscription_key` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace the value of `vision_base_url` with the endpoint URL for the Computer Vision resource in the Azure region where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
    1. Optionally, replace the value of `image_url` with the URL of a different image from which you want to extract printed text.
1. Save the code as a file with an `.py` extension. For example, `get-printed-text.py`.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `python` command to run the sample. For example, `python get-printed-text.py`.

```python
import requests
# If you are using a Jupyter notebook, uncomment the following line.
# %matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.patches import Rectangle
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
subscription_key = "<Subscription Key>"
assert subscription_key

# You must use the same region in your REST call as you used to get your
# subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys from
# westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URI below with "westus".
#
# Free trial subscription keys are generated in the "westus" region.
# If you use a free trial subscription key, you shouldn't need to change
# this region.
vision_base_url = "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/"

ocr_url = vision_base_url + "ocr"

# Set image_url to the URL of an image that you want to analyze.
image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/" + \
    "Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png/338px-Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png"

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key}
params = {'language': 'unk', 'detectOrientation': 'true'}
data = {'url': image_url}
response = requests.post(ocr_url, headers=headers, params=params, json=data)
response.raise_for_status()

analysis = response.json()

# Extract the word bounding boxes and text.
line_infos = [region["lines"] for region in analysis["regions"]]
word_infos = []
for line in line_infos:
    for word_metadata in line:
        for word_info in word_metadata["words"]:
            word_infos.append(word_info)
word_infos

# Display the image and overlay it with the extracted text.
plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))
image = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(image_url).content))
ax = plt.imshow(image, alpha=0.5)
for word in word_infos:
    bbox = [int(num) for num in word["boundingBox"].split(",")]
    text = word["text"]
    origin = (bbox[0], bbox[1])
    patch = Rectangle(origin, bbox[2], bbox[3],
                      fill=False, linewidth=2, color='y')
    ax.axes.add_patch(patch)
    plt.text(origin[0], origin[1], text, fontsize=20, weight="bold", va="top")
plt.axis("off")
```

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample webpage parses and displays a successful response in the command prompt window, similar to the following example:

```json

  "language": "en",
  "orientation": "Up",
  "textAngle": 0,
