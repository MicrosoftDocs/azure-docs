# Quickstart: Extract printed text (OCR) using the Computer Vision REST API and Python

> [!NOTE]
> If you're extracting English language text, consider using the new [Read operation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/concept-recognizing-text). A [Python quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/quickstarts/python-hand-text) is available. 

In this quickstart, you will extract printed text with optical character recognition (OCR) from an image using the Computer Vision REST API. With the [OCR](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc) method, you can detect printed text in an image and extract recognized characters into a machine-usable character stream.

You can run this quickstart in a step-by step fashion using a Jupyter notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org). To launch Binder, select the following button:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/cognitive-services-notebooks/master?filepath=VisionAPI.ipynb)

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed if you want to run the sample locally.
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. You can get a free trial key from [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=computer-vision). Or, follow the instructions in [Create a Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) to subscribe to Computer Vision and get your key. Then, [create environment variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication) for the key and service endpoint string, named `COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` and `COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT`, respectively.

## Create and run the sample

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into a text editor.
1. Optionally, replace the value of `image_url` with the URL of a different image from which you want to extract printed text.
1. Save the code as a file with an `.py` extension. For example, `get-printed-text.py`.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `python` command to run the sample. For example, `python get-printed-text.py`.

```python
import os
import sys
import requests
# If you are using a Jupyter notebook, uncomment the following line.
# %matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.patches import Rectangle
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Add your Computer Vision subscription key and endpoint to your environment variables.
if 'COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY' in os.environ:
    subscription_key = os.environ['COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY']
else:
    print("\nSet the COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY environment variable.\n**Restart your shell or IDE for changes to take effect.**")
    sys.exit()

if 'COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT' in os.environ:
    endpoint = os.environ['COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT']

ocr_url = endpoint + "vision/v3.0/ocr"

# Set image_url to the URL of an image that you want to analyze.
image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/" + \
    "Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png/338px-Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png"

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key}
params = {'language': 'unk', 'detectOrientation': 'true'}
data = {'url': image_url}
response = requests.post(ocr_url, headers=headers, params=params, json=data)
response.raise_for_status()

analysis = response.json()

# Extract the word bounding boxes and text.
line_infos = [region["lines"] for region in analysis["regions"]]
word_infos = []
for line in line_infos:
    for word_metadata in line:
        for word_info in word_metadata["words"]:
            word_infos.append(word_info)
word_infos

# Display the image and overlay it with the extracted text.
plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))
image = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(image_url).content))
ax = plt.imshow(image, alpha=0.5)
for word in word_infos:
    bbox = [int(num) for num in word["boundingBox"].split(",")]
    text = word["text"]
    origin = (bbox[0], bbox[1])
    patch = Rectangle(origin, bbox[2], bbox[3],
                      fill=False, linewidth=2, color='y')
    ax.axes.add_patch(patch)
    plt.text(origin[0], origin[1], text, fontsize=20, weight="bold", va="top")
plt.show()
plt.axis("off")
```

## Upload image from local storage

If you want to analyze a local image, set the Content-Type header to application/octet-stream, and set the request body to a byte array instead of JSON data.

```python
image_path = "<path-to-local-image-file>"
# Read the image into a byte array
image_data = open(image_path, "rb").read()
# Set Content-Type to octet-stream
headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key, 'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream'}
# put the byte array into your post request
response = requests.post(ocr_url, headers=headers, params=params, data = image_data)
```


## Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample webpage parses and displays a successful response in the command prompt window, similar to the following example:

```json

  "language": "en",
  "orientation": "Up",
  "textAngle": 0,
