# Quickstart: Extract printed text (OCR) - REST, Python - Computer Vision

In this quickstart, you extract printed text, also known as optical character recognition (OCR), from an image using Computer Vision.

You can run this quickstart in a step-by step fashion using a Jupyter notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org). To launch Binder, select the following button:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/cognitive-services-notebooks/master?filepath=VisionAPI.ipynb)

## Prerequisites

To use Computer Vision, you need a subscription key; see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## Extract printed text

With the [OCR method](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc), you can detect printed text in an image and extract recognized characters into a machine-usable character stream.

To run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code to a new Python script file.
1. Replace `<Subscription Key>` with your valid subscription key.
1. Change the `vision_base_url` value to the location where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
1. Optionally, change the `image_url` value to another image.
1. Run the script.

The following code uses the Python `requests` library to call the Computer Vision Analyze Image API. It returns the results as a JSON object. The API key is passed in via the `headers` dictionary.

## OCR request

```python
import requests
# If you are using a Jupyter notebook, uncomment the following line.
#%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.patches import Rectangle
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
subscription_key = "<Subscription Key>"
assert subscription_key

# You must use the same region in your REST call as you used to get your
# subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys from
# westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URI below with "westus".
#
# Free trial subscription keys are generated in the westcentralus region.
# If you use a free trial subscription key, you shouldn't need to change
# this region.
vision_base_url = "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/"

ocr_url = vision_base_url + "ocr"

# Set image_url to the URL of an image that you want to analyze.
image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/" + \
    "Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png/338px-Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png"

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key}
params  = {'language': 'unk', 'detectOrientation': 'true'}
data    = {'url': image_url}
response = requests.post(ocr_url, headers=headers, params=params, json=data)
response.raise_for_status()

analysis = response.json()

# Extract the word bounding boxes and text.
line_infos = [region["lines"] for region in analysis["regions"]]
word_infos = []
for line in line_infos:
    for word_metadata in line:
        for word_info in word_metadata["words"]:
            word_infos.append(word_info)
word_infos

# Display the image and overlay it with the extracted text.
plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))
image = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(image_url).content))
ax = plt.imshow(image, alpha=0.5)
for word in word_infos:
    bbox = [int(num) for num in word["boundingBox"].split(",")]
    text = word["text"]
    origin = (bbox[0], bbox[1])
    patch  = Rectangle(origin, bbox[2], bbox[3], fill=False, linewidth=2, color='y')
    ax.axes.add_patch(patch)
    plt.text(origin[0], origin[1], text, fontsize=20, weight="bold", va="top")
plt.axis("off")
```

## OCR response

A successful response is returned in JSON, for example:

```json

  "language": "en",
