# Quickstart: Extract printed and handwritten text using the Computer Vision REST API and Python

In this quickstart, you'll extract printed and handwritten text from an image using the Computer Vision REST API. With the [Read](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-ga/operations/5d986960601faab4bf452005) and [Get Read Result](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-ga/operations/5d9869604be85dee480c8750) methods, you can detect text in an image and extract recognized characters into a machine-readable character stream. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [Read](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-ga/operations/5d986960601faab4bf452005) method runs asynchronously. This method does not return any information in the body of a successful response. Instead, the Batch Read method returns a URI in the value of the `Operation-Location` response header field. You can then call this URI, which represents the [Get Read Result](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-ga/operations/5d9869604be85dee480c8750) API, to both check the status and return the results of the Read method call.

You can run this quickstart in a step-by step fashion using a Jupyter notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org). To launch Binder, select the following button:

[![The launch Binder button](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/cognitive-services-notebooks/master?filepath=VisionAPI.ipynb)

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=cognitive-services) before you begin.

- You must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed if you want to run the sample locally.
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. You can get a free trial key from [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=computer-vision). Or, follow the instructions in [Create a Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) to subscribe to Computer Vision and get your key. 
- [Create environment variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication) for the key and service endpoint string, named `COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` and `COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT`, respectively.

## Create and run the sample


To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into a text editor.
1. Optionally, replace the value of `image_url` with the URL of a different image from which you want to extract text.
1. Save the code as a file with an `.py` extension. For example, `get-text.py`.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `python` command to run the sample. For example, `python get-text.py`.

```python
import json
import os
import sys
import requests
import time
# If you are using a Jupyter notebook, uncomment the following line.
# %matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.patches import Polygon
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

missing_env = False
# Add your Computer Vision subscription key and endpoint to your environment variables.
if 'COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT' in os.environ:
    endpoint = os.environ['COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT']
else:
    print("From Azure Cogntivie Service, retrieve your endpoint and subscription key.")
    print("\nSet the COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT environment variable, such as \"https://westus2.api.cognitive.microsoft.com\".\n")
    missing_env = True

if 'COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY' in os.environ:
    subscription_key = os.environ['COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY']
else:
    print("From Azure Cogntivie Service, retrieve your endpoint and subscription key.")
    print("\nSet the COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY environment variable, such as \"1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef\".\n")
    missing_env = True

if missing_env:
    print("**Restart your shell or IDE for changes to take effect.**")
    sys.exit()

text_recognition_url = endpoint + "/vision/v3.0/read/analyze"

# Set image_url to the URL of an image that you want to recognize.
image_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/master/articles/cognitive-services/Computer-vision/Images/readsample.jpg"

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key}
data = {'url': image_url}
response = requests.post(
    text_recognition_url, headers=headers, json=data)
response.raise_for_status()

# Extracting text requires two API calls: One call to submit the
# image for processing, the other to retrieve the text found in the image.

# Holds the URI used to retrieve the recognized text.
operation_url = response.headers["Operation-Location"]

# The recognized text isn't immediately available, so poll to wait for completion.
analysis = {}
poll = True
while (poll):
    response_final = requests.get(
        response.headers["Operation-Location"], headers=headers)
    analysis = response_final.json()
    
    print(json.dumps(analysis, indent=4))

    time.sleep(1)
    if ("analyzeResult" in analysis):
        poll = False
    if ("status" in analysis and analysis['status'] == 'failed'):
        poll = False

polygons = []
if ("analyzeResult" in analysis):
    # Extract the recognized text, with bounding boxes.
    polygons = [(line["boundingBox"], line["text"])
                for line in analysis["analyzeResult"]["readResults"][0]["lines"]]

# Display the image and overlay it with the extracted text.
image = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(image_url).content))
ax = plt.imshow(image)
for polygon in polygons:
    vertices = [(polygon[0][i], polygon[0][i+1])
                for i in range(0, len(polygon[0]), 2)]
    text = polygon[1]
    patch = Polygon(vertices, closed=True, fill=False, linewidth=2, color='y')
    ax.axes.add_patch(patch)
    plt.text(vertices[0][0], vertices[0][1], text, fontsize=20, va="top")
plt.show()
```

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample webpage parses and displays a successful response in the command prompt window, similar to the following example:
