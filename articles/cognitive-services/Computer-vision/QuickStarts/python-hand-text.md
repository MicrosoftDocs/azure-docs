# Quickstart: Extract handwritten text using the REST API and Python in Computer Vision

In this quickstart, you extract handwritten text from an image by using Computer Vision's REST API. With the [Recognize Text](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/587f2c6a154055056008f200) and the [Get Recognize Text Operation Result](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/587f2cf1154055056008f201) methods, you can detect handwritten text in an image, then extract recognized characters into a machine-usable character stream.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unlike the [OCR](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc) method, the [Recognize Text](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/587f2c6a154055056008f200) method runs asynchronously. This method does not return any information in the body of a successful response. Instead, the Recognize Text method returns a URI in the value of the `Operation-Content` response header field. You can then call this URI, which represents the [Get Recognize Text Operation Result](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/587f2cf1154055056008f201) method, to both check the status and return the results of the Recognize Text method call.

You can run this quickstart in a step-by step fashion using a Jupyter notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org). To launch Binder, select the following button:

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=cognitive-services) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed if you want to run the sample locally.
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. To get a subscription key, see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## Create and run the sample

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in code where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `subscription_key` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace the value of `vision_base_url` with the endpoint URL for the Computer Vision resource in the Azure region where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
    1. Optionally, replace the value of `image_url` with the URL of a different image from which you want to extract handwritten text.
1. Save the code as a file with an `.py` extension. For example, `get-handwritten-text.py`.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `python` command to run the sample. For example, `python get-handwritten-text.py`.

```python
import requests
import time
# If you are using a Jupyter notebook, uncomment the following line.
#%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.patches import Polygon
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
subscription_key = "<Subscription Key>"
assert subscription_key

# You must use the same region in your REST call as you used to get your
# subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys from
# westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URI below with "westus".
#
# Free trial subscription keys are generated in the westcentralus region.
# If you use a free trial subscription key, you shouldn't need to change
# this region.
vision_base_url = "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/"

text_recognition_url = vision_base_url + "recognizeText"

# Set image_url to the URL of an image that you want to analyze.
image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/" + \
    "Cursive_Writing_on_Notebook_paper.jpg/800px-Cursive_Writing_on_Notebook_paper.jpg"

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key}
# Note: The request parameter changed for APIv2.
# For APIv1, it is 'handwriting': 'true'.
params  = {'mode': 'Handwritten'}
data    = {'url': image_url}
response = requests.post(
    text_recognition_url, headers=headers, params=params, json=data)
response.raise_for_status()

# Extracting handwritten text requires two API calls: One call to submit the
# image for processing, the other to retrieve the text found in the image.

# Holds the URI used to retrieve the recognized text.
operation_url = response.headers["Operation-Location"]

# The recognized text isn't immediately available, so poll to wait for completion.
analysis = {}
poll = True
while (poll):
    response_final = requests.get(
        response.headers["Operation-Location"], headers=headers)
    analysis = response_final.json()
    time.sleep(1)
    if ("recognitionResult" in analysis):
        poll= False 
    if ("status" in analysis and analysis['status'] == 'Failed'):
        poll= False

polygons=[]
if ("recognitionResult" in analysis):
    # Extract the recognized text, with bounding boxes.
    polygons = [(line["boundingBox"], line["text"])
        for line in analysis["recognitionResult"]["lines"]]

# Display the image and overlay it with the extracted text.
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 15))
image = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(image_url).content))
ax = plt.imshow(image)
for polygon in polygons:
    vertices = [(polygon[0][i], polygon[0][i+1])
        for i in range(0, len(polygon[0]), 2)]
    text     = polygon[1]
    patch    = Polygon(vertices, closed=True, fill=False, linewidth=2, color='y')
    ax.axes.add_patch(patch)
    plt.text(vertices[0][0], vertices[0][1], text, fontsize=20, va="top")
_ = plt.axis("off")
```

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample webpage parses and displays a successful response in the command prompt window, similar to the following example:

```json
