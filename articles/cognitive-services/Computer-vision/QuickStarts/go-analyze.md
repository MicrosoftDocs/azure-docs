# Quickstart: Analyze a remote image using the REST API and Go in Computer Vision

In this quickstart, you analyze a remotely stored image to extract visual features by using Computer Vision's REST API. With the [Analyze Image](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa) method, you can extract visual features based on image content.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=cognitive-services) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed.
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. To get a subscription key, see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## Create and run the sample

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in code where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `subscriptionKey` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace the value of `uriBase` with the endpoint URL for the [Analyze Image](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa) method from the Azure region where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
    1. Optionally, replace the value of `imageUrl` with the URL of a different image that you want to analyze.
1. Save the code as a file with a `.go` extension. For example, `analyze-image.go`.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, run the `go build` command to compile the package from the file. For example, `go build analyze-image.go`.
1. At the prompt, run the compiled package. For example, `analyze-image`.

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "net/http"
    "strings"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
    const subscriptionKey = "<Subscription Key>"

    // You must use the same Azure region in your REST API method as you used to
    // get your subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys
    // from the West US region, replace "westcentralus" in the URL
    // below with "westus".
    //
    // Free trial subscription keys are generated in the West Central US region.
    // If you use a free trial subscription key, you shouldn't need to change
    // this region.
    const uriBase =
        "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/analyze"
    const imageUrl =
        "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Shaki_waterfall.jpg"

    const params = "?visualFeatures=Description&details=Landmarks&language=en"
    const uri = uriBase + params
    const imageUrlEnc = "{\"url\":\"" + imageUrl + "\"}"

    reader := strings.NewReader(imageUrlEnc)

    // Create the HTTP client
    client := &http.Client{
        Timeout: time.Second * 2,
    }

    // Create the POST request, passing the image URL in the request body
    req, err := http.NewRequest("POST", uri, reader)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Add request headers
    req.Header.Add("Content-Type", "application/json")
    req.Header.Add("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", subscriptionKey)

    // Send the request and retrieve the response
    resp, err := client.Do(req)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    defer resp.Body.Close()

    // Read the response body
    // Note, data is a byte array
    data, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Parse the JSON data from the byte array
    var f interface{}
    json.Unmarshal(data, &f)

    // Format and display the JSON result
    jsonFormatted, _ := json.MarshalIndent(f, "", "  ")
    fmt.Println(string(jsonFormatted))
}
```

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample application parses and displays a successful response in the command prompt window, similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "detail": {
        "landmarks": []
      },
      "name": "outdoor_water",
      "score": 0.9921875
    }
  ],
  "description": {
    "captions": [
      {
        "confidence": 0.916458423253597,
        "text": "a large waterfall over a rocky cliff"
      }
    ],
    "tags": [
      "nature",
      "water",
      "waterfall",
      "outdoor",
      "rock",
      "mountain",
      "rocky",
      "grass",
      "hill",
      "covered",
      "hillside",
      "standing",
      "side",
      "group",
      "walking",
      "white",
      "man",
      "large",
      "snow",
      "grazing",
      "forest",
      "slope",
      "herd",
      "river",
      "giraffe",
      "field"
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "format": "Jpeg",
    "height": 959,
    "width": 1280
  },
  "requestId": "a92f89ab-51f8-4735-a58d-507da2213fc2"
}
```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the compiled package and the file from which the package was compiled, then close the command prompt window and the text editor.

## Next steps

Explore the Computer Vision API used to analyze an image, detect celebrities and landmarks, create a thumbnail, and extract printed and handwritten text. To rapidly experiment with the Computer Vision API, try the [Open API testing console](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa/console).
