# Quickstart: Analyze a local image using the Computer Vision REST API and Python

In this quickstart, you'll analyze a locally stored image to extract visual features using the Computer Vision REST API. With the [Analyze Image](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa) method, you can extract visual features based on image content.

You can run this quickstart in a step-by step fashion using a Jupyter notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org). To launch Binder, select the following button:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/cognitive-services-notebooks/master?filepath=VisionAPI.ipynb)

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed if you want to run the sample locally.
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. You can get a free trial key from [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=computer-vision). Or, follow the instructions in [Create a Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) to subscribe to Computer Vision and get your key. Then, [create environment variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication) for the key and service endpoint string, named `COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` and `COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT`, respectively.
- You must have the following Python packages installed. You can use [pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) to install Python packages.
    - requests
    - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
    - [pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)

## Create and run the sample

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into a text editor.
1. Replace the value of `image_path` with the path and file name of a different image that you want to analyze.
1. Save the code as a file with an `.py` extension. For example, `analyze-local-image.py`.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `python` command to run the sample. For example, `python analyze-local-image.py`.

```python
import os
import sys
import requests
# If you are using a Jupyter notebook, uncomment the following line.
# %matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Add your Computer Vision subscription key and endpoint to your environment variables.
if 'COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY' in os.environ:
    subscription_key = os.environ['COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY']
else:
    print("\nSet the COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY environment variable.\n**Restart your shell or IDE for changes to take effect.**")
    sys.exit()

if 'COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT' in os.environ:
    endpoint = os.environ['COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT']

analyze_url = endpoint + "vision/v3.0/analyze"

# Set image_path to the local path of an image that you want to analyze.
# Sample images are here, if needed:
# https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/tree/master/ComputerVision/Images
image_path = "C:/Documents/ImageToAnalyze.jpg"

# Read the image into a byte array
image_data = open(image_path, "rb").read()
headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key,
           'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream'}
params = {'visualFeatures': 'Categories,Description,Color'}
response = requests.post(
    analyze_url, headers=headers, params=params, data=image_data)
response.raise_for_status()

# The 'analysis' object contains various fields that describe the image. The most
# relevant caption for the image is obtained from the 'description' property.
analysis = response.json()
print(analysis)
image_caption = analysis["description"]["captions"][0]["text"].capitalize()

# Display the image and overlay it with the caption.
image = Image.open(BytesIO(image_data))
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis("off")
_ = plt.title(image_caption, size="x-large", y=-0.1)
plt.show()
```

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample webpage parses and displays a successful response in the command prompt window, similar to the following example:

```json

  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "outdoor_",
      "score": 0.00390625,

      }
    },
    {
      "name": "outdoor_street",
      "score": 0.33984375,
      "detail": {
        "landmarks": []

    }

      }
    ]
  },
  "color": {

    "dominantColors": [

    ],

  }
}
```

## Next steps

Next, explore a Python application that uses Computer Vision to perform optical character recognition (OCR); create smart-cropped thumbnails; and detect, categorize, tag, and describe visual features in images.
