# Quickstart: Generate a thumbnail using the REST API and Node.js in Computer Vision

In this quickstart, you generate a thumbnail from an image by using Computer Vision's REST API. With the [Get Thumbnail](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fb) method, you can generate a thumbnail of an image. You specify the height and width, which can differ from the aspect ratio of the input image. Computer Vision uses smart cropping to intelligently identify the region of interest and generate cropping coordinates based on that region.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=cognitive-services) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 4.x or later installed.
- You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. To get a subscription key, see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## Create and run the sample

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Install the npm [`request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) package.
   1. Open a command prompt window as an administrator.
   1. Run the following command:

      ```console
      npm install request
      ```

   1. After the package is successfully installed, close the command prompt window.

1. Copy the following code into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in code where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `subscriptionKey` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace the value of `uriBase` with the endpoint URL for the [Get Thumbnail](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fb) method from the Azure region where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
    1. Optionally, replace the value of `imageUrl` with the URL of a different image that you want to analyze.
1. Save the code as a file with a `.js` extension. For example, `get-thumbnail.js`.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `node` command to run the file. For example, `node get-thumbnail.js`.

```nodejs
'use strict';

const request = require('request');

// Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
const subscriptionKey = '<Subscription Key>';

// You must use the same location in your REST call as you used to get your
// subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys from
// westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URL below with "westus".
const uriBase =
    'https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/generateThumbnail';

const imageUrl =
    'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Bloodhound_Puppy.jpg';

// Request parameters.
const params = {
    'width': '100',
    'height': '100',
    'smartCropping': 'true'
};

const options = {
    uri: uriBase,
    qs: params,
    body: '{"url": ' + '"' + imageUrl + '"}',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key' : subscriptionKey
    }
};

request.post(options, (error, response, body) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log('Error: ', error);
    return;
  }
});
```

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned as binary data, which represents the image data for the thumbnail. If the request fails, the response is displayed in the console window. The response for the failed request contains an error code and a message to help determine what went wrong.

## Next steps

Explore the Computer Vision API used to analyze an image, detect celebrities and landmarks, create a thumbnail, and extract printed and handwritten text. To rapidly experiment with the Computer Vision API, try the [Open API testing console](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa/console).
