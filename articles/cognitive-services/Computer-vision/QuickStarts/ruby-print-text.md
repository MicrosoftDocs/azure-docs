# Quickstart: Extract printed text (OCR) using the REST API and Ruby in Computer Vision

In this quickstart, you extract printed text, also known as optical character recognition (OCR), from an image using Computer Vision.

## Prerequisites

To use Computer Vision, you need a subscription key; see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## OCR request

With the [OCR method](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc), you can detect printed text in an image and extract recognized characters into a machine-usable character stream.

To run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into an editor.
1. Replace `<Subscription Key>` with your valid subscription key.
1. Change the `uri` value to the location where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
1. Optionally, change the image (`{\"url\":\"...`) to analyze.
1. Save the file with an `.rb` extension.
1. Open the Ruby Command Prompt and run the file, for example: `ruby myfile.rb`.

```ruby
require 'net/http'

# You must use the same location in your REST call as you used to get your
# subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys from westus,
# replace "westcentralus" in the URL below with "westus".
uri = URI('https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/ocr')
uri.query = URI.encode_www_form({
    # Request parameters
    'language' => 'unk',
    'detectOrientation' => 'true'
})

request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri.request_uri)

# Request headers
# Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
request['Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key'] = '<Subscription Key>'
request['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'

request.body =
    "{\"url\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/" +
    "Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png/338px-Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png\"}"

response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, :use_ssl => uri.scheme == 'https') do |http|
    http.request(request)
end

puts response.body
```

## OCR response

Upon success, the OCR results returned include text, bounding box for regions, lines, and words, for example:

```json
{
  "language": "en",
  "textAngle": -2.0000000000000338,

            {
              "boundingBox": "801,472,53,73",
              "text": "IS"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "boundingBox": "519,563,375,74",
          "words": [
            {
              "boundingBox": "519,563,149,74",
              "text": "JUST"
            },
            {
              "boundingBox": "683,564,41,72",
              "text": "A"
            },
            {
              "boundingBox": "741,564,153,73",
              "text": "WISH"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
