# Quickstart: Analyze a remote image - REST, Python - Computer Vision

In this quickstart, you analyze a remote image using Computer Vision. To analyze a local image, see [Analyze a local image with Python](python-disk.md).

You can run this quickstart in a step-by step fashion using a Jupyter notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org). To launch Binder, select the following button:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/cognitive-services-notebooks/master?filepath=VisionAPI.ipynb)

## Prerequisites

To use Computer Vision, you need a subscription key; see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## Analyze a remote image

With the [Analyze Image method](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa), you can extract visual features based on image content. You can upload an image or specify an image URL and choose which features to return, including:

* A detailed list of tags related to the image content.
* A description of image content in a complete sentence.
* The coordinates, gender, and age of any faces contained in the image.
* The ImageType (clip art or a line drawing).
* The dominant color, the accent color, or whether an image is black & white.
* The category defined in this [taxonomy](../Category-Taxonomy.md).
* Does the image contain adult or sexually suggestive content?

To run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code to a new Python script file.
1. Replace `<Subscription Key>` with your valid subscription key.
1. Change the `vision_base_url` value to the location where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
1. Optionally, change the `image_url` value to another image.
1. Run the script.

The following code uses the Python `requests` library to call the Computer Vision Analyze Image API. It returns the results as a JSON object. The API key is passed in via the `headers` dictionary. The types of features to recognize is passed in via the `params` dictionary.

## Analyze Image request

```python
import requests
# If you are using a Jupyter notebook, uncomment the following line.
#%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
subscription_key = "<Subscription Key>"
assert subscription_key

# You must use the same region in your REST call as you used to get your
# subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys from
# westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URI below with "westus".
#
# Free trial subscription keys are generated in the westcentralus region.
# If you use a free trial subscription key, you shouldn't need to change
# this region.
vision_base_url = "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/"

analyze_url = vision_base_url + "analyze"

# Set image_url to the URL of an image that you want to analyze.
image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/" + \
    "Broadway_and_Times_Square_by_night.jpg/450px-Broadway_and_Times_Square_by_night.jpg"

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key }
params  = {'visualFeatures': 'Categories,Description,Color'}
data    = {'url': image_url}
response = requests.post(analyze_url, headers=headers, params=params, json=data)
response.raise_for_status()

# The 'analysis' object contains various fields that describe the image. The most
# relevant caption for the image is obtained from the 'description' property.
analysis = response.json()
print(json.dumps(response.json()))
image_caption = analysis["description"]["captions"][0]["text"].capitalize()

# Display the image and overlay it with the caption.
image = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(image_url).content))
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis("off")
_ = plt.title(image_caption, size="x-large", y=-0.1)
plt.show()
```

## Analyze Image response

A successful response is returned in JSON, for example:

```json

  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "outdoor_",
      "score": 0.00390625,

      }
    },
    {
      "name": "outdoor_street",
      "score": 0.33984375,
      "detail": {

      "woman",
      "bus"
    ],
    "captions": [
      {
        "text": "a group of people on a city street at night",

      }
    ]
  },
  "color": {
    "dominantColorForeground": "Brown",
    "dominantColorBackground": "Brown",
    "dominantColors": [
      "Brown"
    ],
    "accentColor": "B54316",

  },

## Next steps

Explore a Python application that uses Computer Vision to perform optical character recognition (OCR); create smart-cropped thumbnails; plus detect, categorize, tag, and describe visual features, including faces, in an image. To rapidly experiment with the Computer Vision APIs, try the [Open API testing console](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa/console).
