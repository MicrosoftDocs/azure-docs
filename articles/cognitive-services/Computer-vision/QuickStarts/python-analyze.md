# Quickstart: Analyze a remote image using the Computer Vision REST API and Python

In this quickstart, you analyze a remotely stored image to extract visual features by using Computer Vision's REST API. With the [Analyze Image](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa) method, you can extract visual features based on image content.

You can run this quickstart in a step-by step fashion using a Jupyter notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org). To launch Binder, select the following button:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/cognitive-services-notebooks/master?filepath=VisionAPI.ipynb)

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed if you want to run the sample locally.
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. You can get a free trial key from [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=computer-vision). Or, follow the instructions in [Create a Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) to subscribe to Computer Vision and get your key.
- You must have the following Python packages installed. You can use [pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) to install Python packages.
    - requests
    - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
    - [pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)

## Create and run the sample

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in code where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `subscription_key` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace the value of `vision_base_url` with the endpoint URL for the Computer Vision resource in the Azure region where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
    1. Optionally, replace the value of `image_url` with the URL of a different image that you want to analyze.
1. Save the code as a file with an `.py` extension. For example, `analyze-image.py`.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `python` command to run the sample. For example, `python analyze-image.py`.

```python
import requests
# If you are using a Jupyter notebook, uncomment the following line.
# %matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import json
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
subscription_key = "<Subscription Key>"
assert subscription_key

# You must use the same region in your REST call as you used to get your
# subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys from
# westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URI below with "westus".
#
# Free trial subscription keys are generated in the "westcentralus" region.
# If you use a free trial subscription key, you shouldn't need to change
# this region.
vision_base_url = "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/"

analyze_url = vision_base_url + "analyze"

# Set image_url to the URL of an image that you want to analyze.
image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/" + \
    "Broadway_and_Times_Square_by_night.jpg/450px-Broadway_and_Times_Square_by_night.jpg"

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key}
params = {'visualFeatures': 'Categories,Description,Color'}
data = {'url': image_url}
response = requests.post(analyze_url, headers=headers,
                         params=params, json=data)
response.raise_for_status()

# The 'analysis' object contains various fields that describe the image. The most
# relevant caption for the image is obtained from the 'description' property.
analysis = response.json()
print(json.dumps(response.json()))
image_caption = analysis["description"]["captions"][0]["text"].capitalize()

# Display the image and overlay it with the caption.
image = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(image_url).content))
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis("off")
_ = plt.title(image_caption, size="x-large", y=-0.1)
plt.show()
```

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample webpage parses and displays a successful response in the command prompt window, similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "outdoor_",
      "score": 0.00390625,
      "detail": {
        "landmarks": []
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "outdoor_street",
      "score": 0.33984375,
      "detail": {
        "landmarks": []
      }
    }
  ],

      "umbrella",
      "riding",
      "tall",
      "woman",
      "bus"
    ],
    "captions": [
      {
        "text": "a group of people on a city street at night",
        "confidence": 0.9122243847383961
      }
    ]
  },
  "color": {
    "dominantColorForeground": "Brown",
    "dominantColorBackground": "Brown",
    "dominantColors": [
      "Brown"
    ],
    "accentColor": "B54316",
    "isBwImg": false
  },
  "requestId": "c11894eb-de3e-451b-9257-7c8b168073d1",
  "metadata": {

  }
}
```

## Next steps

Explore a Python application that uses Computer Vision to perform optical character recognition (OCR); create smart-cropped thumbnails; plus detect, categorize, tag, and describe visual features, including faces, in an image. To rapidly experiment with the Computer Vision API, try the [Open API testing console](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa/console).
