# Quickstart: Extract printed text (OCR) using the REST API and Go in Computer Vision

In this quickstart, you extract printed text with optical character recognition (OCR) from an image by using Computer Vision's REST API. With the [OCR](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc) method, you can detect printed text in an image and extract recognized characters into a machine-usable character stream.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=cognitive-services) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed.
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. To get a subscription key, see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## Create and run the sample

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in code where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `subscriptionKey` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace the value of `uriBase` with the endpoint URL for the [OCR](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc) method from the Azure region where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
    1. Optionally, replace the value of `imageUrl` with the URL of a different image that you want to analyze.
1. Save the code as a file with a `.go` extension. For example, `get-printed-text.go`.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, run the `go build` command to compile the package from the file. For example, `go build get-printed-text.go`.
1. At the prompt, run the compiled package. For example, `get-printed-text`.

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "net/http"
    "strings"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
    const subscriptionKey = "<Subscription Key>"

    // You must use the same Azure region in your REST API method as you used to
    // get your subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys
    // from the West US region, replace "westcentralus" in the URL
    // below with "westus".
    //
    // Free trial subscription keys are generated in the West Central US region.
    // If you use a free trial subscription key, you shouldn't need to change
    // this region.
    const uriBase =
        "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/ocr"
    const imageUrl = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/" +
        "Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png/338px-Atomist_quote_from_Democritus.png"

    const params = "?language=unk&detectOrientation=true"
    const uri = uriBase + params
    const imageUrlEnc = "{\"url\":\"" + imageUrl + "\"}"

    reader := strings.NewReader(imageUrlEnc)

    // Create the Http client
    client := &http.Client{
        Timeout: time.Second * 2,
    }

    // Create the Post request, passing the image URL in the request body
    req, err := http.NewRequest("POST", uri, reader)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Add headers
    req.Header.Add("Content-Type", "application/json")
    req.Header.Add("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", subscriptionKey)

    // Send the request and retrieve the response
    resp, err := client.Do(req)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    defer resp.Body.Close()

    // Read the response body.
    // Note, data is a byte array
    data, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Parse the Json data
    var f interface{}
    json.Unmarshal(data, &f)

    // Format and display the Json result
    jsonFormatted, _ := json.MarshalIndent(f, "", "  ")
    fmt.Println(string(jsonFormatted))
}
```

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample application parses and displays a successful response in the command prompt window, similar to the following example:

```json

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the compiled package and the file from which the package was compiled, then close the command prompt window and the text editor.
