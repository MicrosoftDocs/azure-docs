# Quickstart: Generate a thumbnail using the REST API and Python in Computer Vision

In this quickstart, you generate a thumbnail from an image by using Computer Vision's REST API. With the [Get Thumbnail](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fb) method, you can generate a thumbnail of an image. You specify the height and width, which can differ from the aspect ratio of the input image. Computer Vision uses smart cropping to intelligently identify the region of interest and generate cropping coordinates based on that region.

You can run this quickstart in a step-by step fashion using a Jupyter notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org). To launch Binder, select the following button:

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=cognitive-services) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To use Computer Vision, you need a subscription key; see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## Prerequisites

- You must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed if you want to run the sample locally.
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. To get a subscription key, see [Obtaining Subscription Keys](../Vision-API-How-to-Topics/HowToSubscribe.md).

## Create and run the sample

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Copy the following code into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in code where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `subscription_key` with your subscription key.
    1. Replace the value of `vision_base_url` with the endpoint URL for the Computer Vision resource in the Azure region where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
    1. Optionally, replace the value of `image_url` with the URL of a different image for which you want to generate a thumbnail.
1. Save the code as a file with an `.py` extension. For example, `get-thumbnail.py`.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `python` command to run the sample. For example, `python get-thumbnail.py`.

```python
import requests
# If you are using a Jupyter notebook, uncomment the following line.
#%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Replace <Subscription Key> with your valid subscription key.
subscription_key = "<Subscription Key>"
assert subscription_key

# You must use the same region in your REST call as you used to get your
# subscription keys. For example, if you got your subscription keys from
# westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URI below with "westus".
#
# Free trial subscription keys are generated in the westcentralus region.
# If you use a free trial subscription key, you shouldn't need to change
# this region.
vision_base_url = "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/"

thumbnail_url = vision_base_url + "generateThumbnail"

# Set image_url to the URL of an image that you want to analyze.
image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Bloodhound_Puppy.jpg"

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key}
params  = {'width': '50', 'height': '50', 'smartCropping': 'true'}
data    = {'url': image_url}
response = requests.post(thumbnail_url, headers=headers, params=params, json=data)
response.raise_for_status()

thumbnail = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))

# Display the thumbnail.
plt.imshow(thumbnail)
plt.axis("off")

# Verify the thumbnail size.
print("Thumbnail is {0}-by-{1}".format(*thumbnail.size))
```

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned as binary data, which represents the image data for the thumbnail. If the request succeeds, the thumbnail is generated from the binary data in the response and displayed by the sample. If the request fails, the response is displayed in the command prompt window. The response for the failed request contains an error code and a message to help determine what went wrong.

## Next steps

Explore a Python application that uses Computer Vision to perform optical character recognition (OCR); create smart-cropped thumbnails; plus detect, categorize, tag, and describe visual features, including faces, in an image. To rapidly experiment with the Computer Vision API, try the [Open API testing console](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa/console).
