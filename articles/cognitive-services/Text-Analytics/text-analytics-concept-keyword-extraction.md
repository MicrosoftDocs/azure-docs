# Keyword extraction (Azure Cognitive Services > Text Analytics API)

TBD...

## Talking points

Not sure at all -- maybe we say nothing.  One question I had: what is the context of key phrase extraction? is it bounded by the document, or the transaction?

From intro blog:  Based on n-grams...

N-grams denote all occurrences of n consecutive words in the input text. The precise value of n may vary across scenarios, but it’s common to pick n=2 or n=3. With n=2, for the text “the quick brown fox”, the following n-grams would be generated – [ “the quick”, “quick brown”, “brown fox”]
