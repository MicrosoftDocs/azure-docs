# Migrate to an Active Directory authoring key

Language Understanding (LUIS) is changing the authoring authentication from email to Active Directory. 

## Why migrating?

All the apps you own need to migrate to use Active Directory by:

* **June 1, 2020** is the deadline.

Currently the apps you own use email authentication for both app owners and app collaborators for authoring. This makes some management tasks difficult:

* Collaboration.
* Transferring ownership.

The migration to Active Directory solves these two issues. 

## What is migrating?

When the **app owner** migrates, the owner is migrating:

* All the owned apps.
* In one migration.
* In a one-way process. 

The owner can't choose which apps to migrate and the process is not reversible. 

## How are the apps migrating?

The LUIS portal provides the migration process. You will be asked to migrate if you have apps on the old email authentication system and you are the app owner. 

You can delay the migration process, by not starting it. You will periodically be asked to migrate until the migration deadline.
