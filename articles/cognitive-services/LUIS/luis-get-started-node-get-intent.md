# Call a LUIS app using Node.js

This quickstart shows you how to call your Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) app in just a few minutes. When you're finished, you'll be able to use Node.js code to pass utterances to a LUIS endpoint and get results.

## Before you begin
You need a Cognitive Services API key to make calls to the sample LUIS app we use in this walkthrough. 
To get an API key follow these steps: 

  1. You first need to create a [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) in the Azure portal. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
  2. Log in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com. 
  3. Follow the steps in [Creating Subscription Keys using Azure](./AzureIbizaSubscription.md) to get a key.
  4. Go back to https://www.luis.ai and log in using your Azure account. 

## Understand what LUIS returns

To understand what a LUIS app returns, you can paste the URL of a sample LUIS app into a browser window. The sample app you'll use is an IoT app that detects whether the user wants to turn on or turn off lights.

1. The endpoint of the sample app is in this format: `https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/df67dcdb-c37d-46af-88e1-8b97951ca1c2?subscription-key=<YOUR_API_KEY>&verbose=false&q=turn%20on%20the%20bedroom%20light` Copy the URL and substitute your subscription key for the value of the `subscription-key` field.
2. Paste the URL into a browser window and press Enter. The browser displays a JSON result that indicates that LUIS detects the `HomeAutomation.TurnOn` intent and the `HomeAutomation.Room` entity with the value `bedroom`.

3. Change the value of the `q=` parameter in the URL to `turn off the living room light`, and press Enter. The result now indicates that the LUIS detected the `HomeAutomation.TurnOff` intent and the `HomeAutomation.Room` entity with value `living room`.

## Consume a LUIS result using the Endpoint API with Node.js

You can use Node.js to access the same results you saw in the browser window in the previous step.

1. Copy the following code snippet:

   [!code-nodejs[Console app code that calls a LUIS endpoint for Node.js](~/samples-luis/documentation-samples/endpoint-api-samples/node/call-endpoint.js)]

2. Set the `LUIS_APP_ID` environment variable as described in the code comments. 

3. Set the `LUIS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` environment variable to your Cognitive Services subscription key.

4. Run the code. It displays the same values that you saw earlier in the browser window.
