## Prerequisites

* Starter key.
* Import the [TravelAgent](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-language-understanding/blob/master/documentation-samples/quickstarts/change-model/TravelAgent.json) app from the cognitive-services-language-understanding GitHub repository.
* The LUIS application ID for the imported TravelAgent app. The application ID is shown in the application dashboard.
* The version ID within the application that receives the utterances. The default ID is "0.1".
* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Example utterances JSON file

[!INCLUDE [Quickstart explanation of example utterance JSON file](get-started-get-model-json-example-utterances.md)]


## Get LUIS key

[!INCLUDE [Use authoring key for endpoint](../includes/get-key-quickstart.md)]


## Change model programmatically

Use Go to add a machine-learned entity [API](https://aka.ms/luis-apim-v3-authoring) to the application. 

1. Create a new file named `model.py`. Add the following code:

    ```python
    ########### Python 3.6 #############
    import requests
    
    # Starter key
    LUIS_authoringKey  = "YOUR-KEY"
    
    LUIS_APP_ID = "YOUR-APP-ID"
    
    # Authoring endpoint, example: westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com
    LUIS_ENDPOINT = "YOUR-ENDPOINT"

    # The version number of your LUIS app
    LUIS_APP_VERSION = "0.1"
    
    URI_AddUtterances = f'https://{LUIS_ENDPOINT}/luis/authoring/v3.0-preview/apps/{LUIS_APP_ID}/versions/{LUIS_APP_VERSION}/examples'
    URI_Train = f'https://{LUIS_ENDPOINT}/luis/authoring/v3.0-preview/apps/{LUIS_APP_ID}/versions/{LUIS_APP_VERSION}/train'
    
    HEADERS = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': LUIS_authoringKey}
    
    def addUtterances():
        r = requests.post(URI_AddUtterances,headers=HEADERS)
        print(r.json())
    
    def train():
        r = requests.post(URI_Train,headers=HEADERS)
        print(r.json())
    
    def trainStatus():
        r = requests.get(URI_Train,headers=HEADERS)
        print(r.json())
    
    addUtterances()
    train()
    trainStatus()
    ```
1. Replace the following values:

    * `YOUR-KEY` with your starter key
    * `YOUR-ENDPOINT` with your endpoint, for example, `westus2.api.cognitive.microsoft.com`
    * `YOUR-APP-ID` with your app's ID

1. With a command prompt in the same directory as where you created the file, enter the following command to run the file:

    ```console
    python model.py
    ```  

## LUIS keys

[!INCLUDE [Use authoring key for endpoint](../includes/starter-key-explanation.md)]

## Clean up resources

When you are finished with this quickstart, delete the file from the file system.
