If your apps need to be authored by other people, you need to add the associated email addresses in the Azure portal's authoring resource.

If you are the **owner or administrator of your Azure subscription**, you can add a contributor to the resource.

If you are **not the owner or administrator of your Azure subscription**, your Azure account needs to have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions.

If you have trouble with this role assignment, review:

* [Azure role assignments](../../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md)
* [Azure access control troubleshooting](../../../role-based-access-control/troubleshooting.md#problems-with-azure-role-assignments)
