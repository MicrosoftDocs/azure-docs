In order to receive a LUIS prediction in a chat bot or other client application, you need to publish the app to the endpoint.

1. Select **Publish** in the top-right navigation.

3. Publishing is complete when you see the notification confirming success.

4. Select the **Access your endpoint URLs** link in the notification to go to the **Azure Resources** page. The endpoint URLs are listed as the **Example Query**.
