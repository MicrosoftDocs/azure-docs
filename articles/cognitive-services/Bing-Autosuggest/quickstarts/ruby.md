# Quickstart for Bing Autosuggest API with Ruby 

This article shows you how to use the [Bing Autosuggest API](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/autosuggest/) with Ruby. The Bing Autosuggest API returns a list of suggested queries based on the partial query string the user enters in the search box. Typically, you would call this API each time the user types a new character in the search box, and then display the suggestions in the search box's drop down list. This article shows how to send a request that returns the suggested query strings for *sail*.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Ruby 2.4](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) or later to run this code.

You must have a [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with **Bing Autosuggest API v7**. The [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/#search) is sufficient for this quickstart. You need the access key provided when you activate your free trial, or you may use a paid subscription key from your Azure dashboard.

## Get Autosuggest results

1. Create a new Ruby project in your favorite IDE.
2. Add the code provided below.
3. Replace the `subscriptionKey` value with an access key valid for your subscription.
4. Run the program.

```ruby
require 'net/https'
require 'uri'
require 'json'

# **********************************************
# *** Update or verify the following values. ***
# **********************************************

# Replace the subscriptionKey string value with your valid subscription key.
subscriptionKey = 'enter key here'

host = 'https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com'
path = '/bing/v7.0/Suggestions'

mkt = 'en-US'
query = 'sail'

params = '?mkt=' + mkt + '&q=' + query
uri = URI (host + path + params)

request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
request['Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key'] = subscriptionKey

response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, :use_ssl => uri.scheme == 'https') do |http|
    http.request (request)
end

puts JSON::pretty_generate (JSON (response.body))
```

### Response

A successful response is returned in JSON, as shown in the following example:
