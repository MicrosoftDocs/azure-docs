# Quickstart: Suggest search queries with the Bing Autosuggest REST API and C#

Follow this quickstart to learn how to make calls to the Bing Autosuggest API and read the JSON response. This simple C# application sends a partial search query to the API, and returns suggestions for searches. While this application is written in C#, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages. The source code for this sample is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/dotnet/Search/BingAutosuggestv7.cs).

## Prerequisites

* Any edition of [Visual Studio 2017 or later](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).
* If you're using Linux/MacOS, this application can be run using [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/).

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-bing-news-search-signup-requirements](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-bing-autosuggest-signup-requirements.md)]

## Create a Visual Search Solution

1. Create a new console solution in Visual Studio. Then, add the following namespaces into the main code file.

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Net.Http;
    using System.Net.Http.Headers;
    using System.Text;
    ```

2. In a new class, create variables for your API host and path, [market code](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-autosuggest-api-v7-reference#market-codes), and a partial search query. Use the global endpoint in the following code, or use the [custom subdomain](../../../cognitive-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains.md) endpoint displayed in the Azure portal for your resource.

    ```csharp
    static string host = "https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com";
    static string path = "/bing/v7.0/Suggestions";
    static string market = "en-US";
    static string key = "your-api-key";
    
    static string query = "sail";
    ```


## Create and send an API request

1. Create a function called `Autosuggest()` to send a request to the API. Create a new `HttpClient()`, and add your subscription key to the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header.

    ```csharp
    async static void Autosuggest()
    {
        HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", key);
        //..
    }
    ```

2. In the same function above, create a request URI by combining your API host and path. Append your market to the `mkt=` parameter, and your query to the `query=` parameter. Be sure to URL-encode your query. 

    ```csharp
    string uri = host + path + "?mkt=" + market + "&query=" + System.Net.WebUtility.UrlEncode (query);
    ```

3. Send the request to the uri constructed above, and print the response.

    ```csharp
    HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(uri);

    string contentString = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    Console.WriteLine(contentString);
    ```

4. In the main method of your program, call `Autosuggest()`.

    ```csharp
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Autosuggest();
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
    ```

## Example JSON response

A successful response is returned in JSON, as shown in the following example: 

```json

  "_type": "Suggestions",
  "queryContext": {
    "originalQuery": "sail"
  },
  "suggestionGroups": [
