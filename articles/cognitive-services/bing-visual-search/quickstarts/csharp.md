# Your first Bing Visual Search query in C#

Bing Visual Search API lets you send a request to Bing to get insights about an image. You can call Visual Search using HTTP POST requests and then process the HTTP response, which contains JSON objects, but it's recommended that you use the Visual Search SDK.


## Prerequisites

The following are the prerequisites for running this quickstart example.

- A .NET development environment such as [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) (the free Community Edition also works).

- [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Search.VisualSearch/1.2.0)

- [.NET libraries](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/psSdkJson6/src/SDKs/CognitiveServices/dataPlane/Search/BingVisualSearch) for definitions and dependencies

- A Cognitive Services subscription key for Bing Visual Search. If you have a paid subscription key, great. Otherwise, a  [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-visual-search-api) subscription key works for this exercise.

## Running the application

To run this example, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Console solution in Visual Studio.
1. Replace the contents of **Program.cs** with the provided code.
2. Set the **accessKey** variable to your subscription key.
3. Run the program.

```csharp
```
