# Quickstart: Your first Bing Visual Search query in Python

Bing Visual Search API returns information about an image that you provide. You can provide the image by using the URL of the image, an insights token, or by uploading an image. For information about these options, see [What is Bing Visual Search API?](../overview.md) This article demonstrates uploading an image. Uploading an image could be useful in mobile scenarios where you take a picture of a well-known landmark and get back information about it. For example, the insights could include trivia about the landmark. 

If you upload a local image, the following shows the form data you must include in the body of the POST. The form data must include the Content-Disposition header. Its `name` parameter must be set to "image" and the `filename` parameter may be set to any string. The contents of the form is the binary of the image. The maximum image size you may upload is 1 MB. 

```
--boundary_1234-abcd
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="myimagefile.jpg"

This article includes a simple console application that sends a Bing Visual Search API request and displays the JSON search results. While this application is written in Python, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with any programming language that can make HTTP requests and parse JSON. 

## Prerequisites

You need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) to run this code.

For this quickstart, you may use a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-web-search-api) subscription key or a paid subscription key.

## Running the walkthrough

To run this application, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Python project in your favorite IDE or editor.
2. Create a file named visualsearch.py and add the code shown in this quickstart.
3. Replace the `SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` value with your subscription key.
3. Replace the `imagePath` value with the path of the image to upload.
4. Run the program.



The following shows how to send the message using multipart form data in Python.

```python
"""Bing Visual Search upload image example"""

# Download and install Python at https://www.python.org/
# Run the following in a command console window
# pip3 install requests

import requests, json


BASE_URI = 'https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/images/visualsearch'

SUBSCRIPTION_KEY = '<yoursubscriptionkeygoeshere>'

HEADERS = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': SUBSCRIPTION_KEY}

imagePath = '<pathtoyourimagetouploadgoeshere>'

file = {'image' : ('myfile', open(imagePath, 'rb'))}

def main():
    
    try:
        response = requests.post(BASE_URI, headers=HEADERS, files=file)
        response.raise_for_status()
        print_json(response.json())

    except Exception as ex:
        raise ex


def print_json(obj):
    """Print the object as json"""
    print(json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True, indent=2, separators=(',', ': ')))



# Main execution
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
