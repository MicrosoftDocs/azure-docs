# Quickstart: Build an app to recognize emotions on faces in an image.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Emotion API will be deprecated on February 15, 2019. The emotion recognition capability is now generally available as part of the [Face API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/face/). 

This article provides information and code samples to help you quickly get started using PHP and the [Emotion API Recognize method](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5639d931ca73072154c1ce89/operations/563b31ea778daf121cc3a5fa) to recognize the emotions expressed by one or more people in an image.

## Prerequisite
* Get your free Subscription Key [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/)

## Recognize Emotions PHP Example Request

Change the REST URL to use the location where you obtained your subscription keys, change the body to a URL of an image you want to test, and replace the "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key" value with your valid subscription key.

```php
<?php
// This sample uses the Apache HTTP client from HTTP Components (http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/)
require_once 'HTTP/Request2.php';

// NOTE: You must use the same region in your REST call as you used to obtain your subscription keys.
//   For example, if you obtained your subscription keys from westcentralus, replace "westus" in the
//   URL below with "westcentralus".
$request = new Http_Request2('https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/emotion/v1.0/recognize');
$url = $request->getUrl();

$headers = array(
    // Request headers
    'Content-Type' => 'application/json',

    // NOTE: Replace the "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key" value with a valid subscription key.
    'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key' => '13hc77781f7e4b19b5fcdd72a8df7156',
);

$request->setHeader($headers);

$parameters = array(
    // Request parameters
);

$url->setQueryVariables($parameters);

$request->setMethod(HTTP_Request2::METHOD_POST);

// Request body
$request->setBody('{"url": "http://www.example.com/images/image.jpg"}');

try
{
    $response = $request->send();
    echo $response->getBody();
}
catch (HttpException $ex)
{
    echo $ex;
}

?>
```

## Recognize Emotions Sample Response
A successful call returns an array of face entries and their associated emotion scores, ranked by face rectangle size in descending order. An empty response indicates that no faces were detected. An emotion entry contains the following fields:
* faceRectangle - Rectangle location of face in the image.
* scores - Emotion scores for each face in the image.

```json
application/json
[
  {
    "faceRectangle": {
      "left": 68,
      "top": 97,
      "width": 64,
      "height": 97
    },
    "scores": {
      "anger": 0.00300731952,
      "contempt": 5.14648448E-08,
