# Emotion API Python Quick Start
This article provides information and code samples to help you quickly get started using the [Emotion API Recognize method](https://dev.projectoxford.ai/docs/services/5639d931ca73072154c1ce89/operations/563b31ea778daf121cc3a5fa) with Python to recognize the emotions expressed by one or more people in an image. 

## Prerequisite
* Get your free Subscription Key [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/)

## Recognize Emotions Python Example Request

Copy the appropriate section for your version of Python and save it to a file such as `test.py`. Replace the "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key" value with your valid subscription key, add a URL to a photograph of a celebrity to the `body` variable, and change the REST URL to use the region where you obtained your subscription keys.

```python
########### Python 2.7 #############
import httplib, urllib, base64

headers = {
    # Request headers. Replace the placeholder key below with your subscription key.
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': '13hc77781f7e4b19b5fcdd72a8df7156',
}

params = urllib.urlencode({
})

# Replace the example URL below with the URL of the image you want to analyze.
body = "{ 'url': 'http://example.com/picture.jpg' }"

try:
    # NOTE: You must use the same region in your REST call as you used to obtain your subscription keys.
    #   For example, if you obtained your subscription keys from westcentralus, replace "westus" in the 
    #   URL below with "westcentralus".
    conn = httplib.HTTPSConnection('westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com')
    conn.request("POST", "/emotion/v1.0/recognize?%s" % params, body, headers)
    response = conn.getresponse()
    data = response.read()
    print(data)
    conn.close()
except Exception as e:
    print("[Errno {0}] {1}".format(e.errno, e.strerror))

########### Python 3.2 #############
import http.client, urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error, base64, sys

headers = {
    # Request headers. Replace the placeholder key below with your subscription key.
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': '13hc77781f7e4b19b5fcdd72a8df7156',
}

params = urllib.parse.urlencode({
})

# Replace the example URL below with the URL of the image you want to analyze.
body = "{ 'url': 'http://example.com/picture.jpg' }"

try:
    # NOTE: You must use the same region in your REST call as you used to obtain your subscription keys.
    #   For example, if you obtained your subscription keys from westcentralus, replace "westus" in the 
    #   URL below with "westcentralus".
    conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection('westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com')
    conn.request("POST", "/emotion/v1.0/recognize?%s" % params, body, headers)
    response = conn.getresponse()
    data = response.read()
    print(data)
    conn.close()
except Exception as e:
    print(e.args)

## Recognize Emotions Sample Response
A successful call returns an array of face entries and their associated emotion scores, ranked by face rectangle size in descending order. An empty response indicates that no faces were detected. An emotion entry contains the following fields:
* faceRectangle - Rectangle location of face in the image.
* scores - Emotion scores for each face in the image. 

```json
application/json 
[
  {
    "faceRectangle": {
      "left": 68,
      "top": 97,
      "width": 64,
      "height": 97
    },
    "scores": {
      "anger": 0.00300731952,
