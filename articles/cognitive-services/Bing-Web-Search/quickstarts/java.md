# Quickstart: Search the web using the Bing Web Search REST API and Java

Use this quickstart to make your first call to the Bing Web Search API and receive the JSON response. This Java application sends a search request to the API, and shows the response. While this application is written in Java, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages.

## Prerequisites

Here are a few things that you'll need before running this quickstart:

* [JDK 7 or 8](https://aka.ms/azure-jdks)
* [Gson library](https://github.com/google/gson)
* A subscription key

[!INCLUDE [bing-web-search-quickstart-signup](../../../../includes/bing-web-search-quickstart-signup.md)]

## Create a project and import dependencies

Create a new Java project in your favorite IDE or editor and import the following libraries. Gson is required to convert Java Objects into JSON.

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;
import javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection;
import com.google.gson.Gson;
import com.google.gson.GsonBuilder;
import com.google.gson.JsonObject;
import com.google.gson.JsonParser;
```

### Declare Gson in the Maven POM file

If you're using Maven, declare Gson in the `POM.xml`. Skip this step if you've installed Gson locally.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
    <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
    <version>2.8.5</version>
</dependency>
```

## Declare the BingWebSearch class

Declare the `BingWebSearch` class. It will include most of the code we review in this quickstart including the `main` method.  

```java
public class BingWebSearch {

// The code in the following sections goes here.

}
```

## Define variables

This code sets the `subscriptionKey`, `host`, `path`, and `searchTerm`. Confirm that the endpoint is correct and replace the `subscriptionKey` value with a valid subscription key from your Azure account. Feel free to customize the search query by replacing the value for `searchTerm`. Remember to add this code to the `BingWebSearch` class as noted above.

```java
// Enter a valid subscription key.
static String subscriptionKey = "enter key here";

/*
 * If you encounter unexpected authorization errors, double-check these values
 * against the endpoint for your Bing Web search instance in your Azure
 * dashboard.
 */
static String host = "https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com";
static String path = "/bing/v7.0/search";
static String searchTerm = "Microsoft Cognitive Services";
```

## Construct a request

This method, which lives in the `BingWebSearch` class, constructs the `url`, receives and parses the response, and extracts Bing-related HTTP headers.  

```java
public static SearchResults SearchWeb (String searchQuery) throws Exception {
    // Construct the URL.
    URL url = new URL(host + path + "?q=" +  URLEncoder.encode(searchQuery, "UTF-8"));

    // Open the connection.
    HttpsURLConnection connection = (HttpsURLConnection)url.openConnection();
    connection.setRequestProperty("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", subscriptionKey);

    // Receive the JSON response body.
    InputStream stream = connection.getInputStream();
    String response = new Scanner(stream).useDelimiter("\\A").next();

    // Construct the result object.
    SearchResults results = new SearchResults(new HashMap<String, String>(), response);

    // Extract Bing-related HTTP headers.
    Map<String, List<String>> headers = connection.getHeaderFields();
    for (String header : headers.keySet()) {
        if (header == null) continue;      // may have null key
        if (header.startsWith("BingAPIs-") || header.startsWith("X-MSEdge-")){
            results.relevantHeaders.put(header, headers.get(header).get(0));
        }
    }
    stream.close();
    return results;
}
```

## Handle the response

Use Gson to parse and reserialize the response.

```java
public static String prettify(String json_text) {
    JsonParser parser = new JsonParser();
    JsonObject json = parser.parse(json_text).getAsJsonObject();
    Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create();
    return gson.toJson(json);
}
```

## Declare the main method

This method is required and is the first method invoked when the program is started. In this application, it includes code that validates the `subscriptionKey`, makes a request, and prints the JSON response.

```java
public static void main (String[] args) {
    // Confirm the subscriptionKey is valid.
    if (subscriptionKey.length() != 32) {
        System.out.println("Invalid Bing Search API subscription key!");
        System.out.println("Please paste yours into the source code.");
        System.exit(1);
    }

    // Call the SearchWeb method and print the response.
    try {
        System.out.println("Searching the Web for: " + searchTerm);
        SearchResults result = SearchWeb(searchTerm);
        System.out.println("\nRelevant HTTP Headers:\n");
        for (String header : result.relevantHeaders.keySet())
        System.out.println(header + ": " + result.relevantHeaders.get(header));
        System.out.println("\nJSON Response:\n");
        System.out.println(prettify(result.jsonResponse));
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace(System.out);
        System.exit(1);
    }
}
```

## Create a container class for search results

The `SearchResults` container class is outside of the `BingWebSearch` class. It includes relevant headers and JSON data for the response.

```java
class SearchResults{
    HashMap<String, String> relevantHeaders;
    String jsonResponse;
    SearchResults(HashMap<String, String> headers, String json) {
        relevantHeaders = headers;
        jsonResponse = json;
    }
}
```

## Put it all together

The last step is to compile your code and run it! Here are the commands:

```powershell
javac BingWebSearch.java -classpath ./gson-2.8.5.jar -encoding UTF-8
java -cp ./gson-2.8.5.jar BingWebSearch
```

## Sample response

Responses from the Bing Web Search API are returned as JSON. This sample response has been truncated to show a single result.
