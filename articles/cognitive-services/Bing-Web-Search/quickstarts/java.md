#Customer intent: As a new developer, I want to make my first call to the Bing Web Search API and receive a response using Java.

# Quickstart: Use Java to search the web with the Bing Web Search REST API, an Azure cognitive service

[!INCLUDE [Bing move notice](../../bing-web-search/includes/bing-move-notice.md)]

In this quickstart, you'll use a Java application to make your first call to the Bing Web Search API. This Java application sends a search request to the API, and shows the JSON response. Although this application is written in Java, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages.

## Prerequisites

Here are a few things that you'll need before running this quickstart:

* [JDK 7 or 8](/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-support-on-azure)
* [Gson library](https://github.com/google/gson)
* A subscription key

[!INCLUDE [bing-web-search-quickstart-signup](../../../../includes/bing-web-search-quickstart-signup.md)]

## Create a project and import dependencies

Create a new Java project in your favorite IDE or editor and import the following libraries. Gson is required to convert Java Objects into JSON.

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;
import javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection;
import com.google.gson.Gson;
import com.google.gson.GsonBuilder;
import com.google.gson.JsonObject;
import com.google.gson.JsonParser;
```

### Declare Gson in the Maven POM file

If you're using Maven, declare Gson in POM.xml. Skip this step if you've installed Gson locally.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
    <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
    <version>2.8.5</version>
</dependency>
```

## Declare the BingWebSearch class

Declare the `BingWebSearch` class. It includes most of the code we review in this quickstart, including the `main()` method.  

```java
public class BingWebSearch {

// The code in the following sections goes here.

}
```

## Define variables

The following code sets the `subscriptionKey`, `host`, `path`, and `searchTerm`. Add this code to the `BingWebSearch` class described in the previous section:

1. For the `host` value, you can use the global endpoint in the following code, or use the [custom subdomain](../../../ai-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains.md) endpoint displayed in the Azure portal for your resource. 

2. Replace the `subscriptionKey` value with a valid subscription key from your Azure account. 

3. Optionally, customize the search query by replacing the value for `searchTerm`. 

```java
// Enter a valid subscription key.
static String subscriptionKey = "enter key here";

/*
 * If you encounter unexpected authorization errors, double-check these values
 * against the endpoint for your Bing Web search instance in your Azure
 * dashboard.
 */
static String host = "https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com";
static String path = "/bing/v7.0/search";
static String searchTerm = "Microsoft Cognitive Services";
```

## Construct a request

The `SearchWeb()` method, which is included in the `BingWebSearch` class, constructs the `url`, receives and parses the response, and extracts Bing-related HTTP headers.  

```java
public static SearchResults SearchWeb (String searchQuery) throws Exception {
    // Construct the URL.
    URL url = new URL(host + path + "?q=" +  URLEncoder.encode(searchQuery, "UTF-8"));

    // Open the connection.
    HttpsURLConnection connection = (HttpsURLConnection)url.openConnection();
    connection.setRequestProperty("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", subscriptionKey);

    // Receive the JSON response body.
    InputStream stream = connection.getInputStream();
    String response = new Scanner(stream).useDelimiter("\\A").next();

    // Construct the result object.
    SearchResults results = new SearchResults(new HashMap<String, String>(), response);

    // Extract Bing-related HTTP headers.
    Map<String, List<String>> headers = connection.getHeaderFields();
    for (String header : headers.keySet()) {
        if (header == null) continue;      // may have null key
        if (header.startsWith("BingAPIs-") || header.startsWith("X-MSEdge-")){
            results.relevantHeaders.put(header, headers.get(header).get(0));
        }
    }
    stream.close();
    return results;
}
```

## Handle the response

Use Gson to parse and reserialize the response.

```java
public static String prettify(String json_text) {
    JsonParser parser = new JsonParser();
    JsonObject json = parser.parse(json_text).getAsJsonObject();
    Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create();
    return gson.toJson(json);
}
```

## Declare the main method

The `main()` method is required and is the first method invoked when you start the program. In this application, it includes code that validates the `subscriptionKey`, makes a request, and then prints the JSON response.

```java
public static void main (String[] args) {
    // Confirm the subscriptionKey is valid.
    if (subscriptionKey.length() != 32) {
        System.out.println("Invalid Bing Search API subscription key!");
        System.out.println("Please paste yours into the source code.");
        System.exit(1);
    }

    // Call the SearchWeb method and print the response.
    try {
        System.out.println("Searching the Web for: " + searchTerm);
        SearchResults result = SearchWeb(searchTerm);
        System.out.println("\nRelevant HTTP Headers:\n");
        for (String header : result.relevantHeaders.keySet())
        System.out.println(header + ": " + result.relevantHeaders.get(header));
        System.out.println("\nJSON Response:\n");
        System.out.println(prettify(result.jsonResponse));
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace(System.out);
        System.exit(1);
    }
}
```

## Create a container class for search results

The `SearchResults` container class is defined outside of the `BingWebSearch` class. It includes relevant headers and JSON data for the response.

```java
class SearchResults{
    HashMap<String, String> relevantHeaders;
    String jsonResponse;
    SearchResults(HashMap<String, String> headers, String json) {
        relevantHeaders = headers;
        jsonResponse = json;
    }
}
```

## Put it all together

The last step is to compile your code and run it. Use the following commands:

```powershell
javac BingWebSearch.java -classpath ./gson-2.8.5.jar -encoding UTF-8
java -cp ./gson-2.8.5.jar BingWebSearch
```

If you'd like to compare your code with ours, [sample code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/java/Search/BingWebSearchv7.java).

## Example JSON response

Responses from the Bing Web Search API are returned as JSON. This sample response has been truncated to show a single result.
