#Customer intent: As a new developer, I want to make my first call to the Bing Web Search API and receive a response using PHP.

# Quickstart: Use PHP to call the Bing Web Search API  

[!INCLUDE [Bing move notice](../../bing-web-search/includes/bing-move-notice.md)]

Use this quickstart to make your first call to the Bing Web Search API. This Node.js application sends a search request to the API, and shows the JSON response. Although this application is written in JavaScript, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages.

## Prerequisites

Here are a few things that you'll need before running this quickstart:

* [PHP 5.6.x](https://php.net/downloads.php) or later
* A subscription key  

[!INCLUDE [bing-web-search-quickstart-signup](../../../../includes/bing-web-search-quickstart-signup.md)]

## Enable secure HTTP support

Before we get started, locate php.ini and uncomment this line:

```php
; extension=php_openssl.dll
```

## Create a project and define variables

1. Create a new PHP project in your favorite IDE or editor. Add opening and closing tags: `<?php` and `?>`.

2. For the `$endpoint` value, you can use the global endpoint in the following code, or use the [custom subdomain](../../../ai-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains.md) endpoint displayed in the Azure portal for your resource. 

3. Confirm that the `$endpoint` value is correct and replace the `$accesskey` value with a valid subscription key from your Azure account. 

4. Optionally, customize the search query by replacing the value for `$term`.

```php
$accessKey = 'enter key here';
$endpoint = 'https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/search';
$term = 'Microsoft Cognitive Services';
```

## Construct a request

This code declares a function called `BingWebSearch` that's used to construct requests to the Bing Web Search API. It takes three arguments: `$url`, `$key`, and `$query`.

```php
function BingWebSearch ($url, $key, $query) {
    /* Prepare the HTTP request.
     * NOTE: Use the key 'http' even if you are making an HTTPS request.
     * See: http://php.net/manual/en/function.stream-context-create.php.
     */
    $headers = "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: $key\r\n";
    $options = array ('http' => array (
                          'header' => $headers,
                           'method' => 'GET'));

    // Perform the request and get a JSON response.
    $context = stream_context_create($options);
    $result = file_get_contents($url . "?q=" . urlencode($query), false, $context);

    // Extract Bing HTTP headers.
    $headers = array();
    foreach ($http_response_header as $k => $v) {
        $h = explode(":", $v, 2);
        if (isset($h[1]))
            if (preg_match("/^BingAPIs-/", $h[0]) || preg_match("/^X-MSEdge-/", $h[0]))
                $headers[trim($h[0])] = trim($h[1]);
    }

    return array($headers, $result);
}
```

## Make a request and print the response

This code validates the subscription key, makes a request, and prints the response.

```php
// Validates the subscription key.
if (strlen($accessKey) == 32) {

    print "Searching the Web for: " . $term . "\n";
    // Makes the request.
    list($headers, $json) = BingWebSearch($endpoint, $accessKey, $term);

    print "\nRelevant Headers:\n\n";
    foreach ($headers as $k => $v) {
        print $k . ": " . $v . "\n";
    }
    // Prints JSON encoded response.
    print "\nJSON Response:\n\n";
    echo json_encode(json_decode($json), JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);

} else {

    print("Invalid Bing Search API subscription key!\n");
    print("Please paste yours into the source code.\n");

}
```

## Put it all together

The last step is to validate your code and run it. If you'd like to compare your code with ours, here's the complete program:

```php
<?php
$accessKey = 'enter key here';
$endpoint = 'https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/search';
$term = 'Microsoft Cognitive Services';

function BingWebSearch ($url, $key, $query) {
    $headers = "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: $key\r\n";
    $options = array ('http' => array (
                          'header' => $headers,
                           'method' => 'GET'));
    $context = stream_context_create($options);
    $result = file_get_contents($url . "?q=" . urlencode($query), false, $context);
    $headers = array();
    foreach ($http_response_header as $k => $v) {
        $h = explode(":", $v, 2);
        if (isset($h[1]))
            if (preg_match("/^BingAPIs-/", $h[0]) || preg_match("/^X-MSEdge-/", $h[0]))
                $headers[trim($h[0])] = trim($h[1]);
    }
    return array($headers, $result);
}

if (strlen($accessKey) == 32) {
    print "Searching the Web for: " . $term . "\n";
    list($headers, $json) = BingWebSearch($endpoint, $accessKey, $term);
    print "\nRelevant Headers:\n\n";
    foreach ($headers as $k => $v) {
        print $k . ": " . $v . "\n";
    }
    print "\nJSON Response:\n\n";
    echo json_encode(json_decode($json), JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);

} else {
    print("Invalid Bing Search API subscription key!\n");
    print("Please paste yours into the source code.\n");
}
?>
```

## Example JSON response

Responses from the Bing Web Search API are returned as JSON. This sample response has been truncated to show a single result.
