# Quickstart: Use Node.js to call the Bing Web Search API  

Use this quickstart to make your first call to the Bing Web Search API and receive a JSON response in less than 10 minutes.  

[!INCLUDE [bing-web-search-quickstart-signup](../../../../includes/bing-web-search-quickstart-signup.md)]

## Prerequisites

Here are a few things that you'll need before running this quickstart:

* [Node.js 6](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or later
* A subscription key  

## Create a project and declare required modules

Create a new Node.js project in your favorite IDE or editor. Then copy the code snippet below into your project. This quickstart uses strict mode and requires the `https` module to send and receive data.

```javascript
// Use strict mode.
'use strict';

// Require the https module.
let https = require('https');
```

## Define variables

A few variables must be set before we can continue. Confirm that the `host` and `path` are valid and replace the `subscriptionKey` value with a valid subscription key from your Azure account. Feel free to customize the search query by replacing the value for `term`.

```javascript
// Replace with a valid subscription key.
let subscriptionKey = 'enter key here';

/*
 * Verify the endpoint URI. If you
 * encounter unexpected authorization errors, double-check this host against
 * the endpoint for your Bing Web search instance in your Azure dashboard.  
 */
let host = 'api.cognitive.microsoft.com';
let path = '/bing/v7.0/search';
let term = 'Microsoft Cognitive Services';

// Validate the subscription key.
if (subscriptionKey.length === 32) {
    bing_web_search(term);
} else {
    console.log('Invalid Bing Search API subscription key!');
    console.log('Please paste yours into the source code.');
}
```

## Create a response handler

Create a handler to stringify and parse the response. The `response_handler` is called each time a request is made to the Bing Web Search API, as you'll see in the next section.

```javascript
let response_handler = function (response) {
    let body = '';
    response.on('data', function (d) {
        body += d;
    });
    response.on('end', function () {
        console.log('\nRelevant Headers:\n');
        for (var header in response.headers)
            // Headers are lowercased by Node.js.
            if (header.startsWith("bingapis-") || header.startsWith("x-msedge-"))
                 console.log(header + ": " + response.headers[header]);
        // Stringify and parse the response body.
        body = JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(body), null, '  ');
        console.log('\nJSON Response:\n');
        console.log(body);
    });
    response.on('error', function (e) {
        console.log('Error: ' + e.message);
    });
};
```

## Make a request and print the response

Construct the request and make a call to the Bing Web Search API. After the request is made, the `response_handler` function is called and the response is printed.

```javascript
let bing_web_search = function (search) {
    console.log('Searching the Web for: ' + term);
        // Declare the method, hostname, path, and headers.
        let request_params = {
            method : 'GET',
            hostname : host,
            path : path + '?q=' + encodeURIComponent(search),
            headers : {
                'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key' : subscriptionKey,
            }
        };
    // Request to the Bing Web Search API.
    let req = https.request(request_params, response_handler);
    req.end();
}
```

## Put it all together

The last step is to run your code! If you'd like to compare your code with ours, [sample code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/nodejs/Search/BingWebSearchv7.js).

## Sample response

Responses from the Bing Web Search API are returned as JSON. This sample response has been truncated to show a single result.
