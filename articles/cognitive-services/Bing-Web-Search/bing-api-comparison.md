# What are the Bing Search APIs?

The Bing Search APIs enable you to quickly build web-connected apps and services that can find webpages, images, news, translations, and more. Use this article to learn about the various Bing's search APIs, and how you can integrate cognitive searches into your applications and services.  

By sending queries to the Bing search REST APIs or SDKs, you can get instant, relevant answers to user web searches in a variety of content types. These queries can be modified to narrow a search's scope, filter results and more, improving the search experience. Below are the search APIs available. Note that pricing and rate limits may vary between APIs.

## Bing Web Search and Custom Search

The [Bing Web Search API](../Bing-Web-Search/index.yml) can return search results containing webpages, in addition to the content formats listed below. The search queries sent to this API can be filtered to include or exclude certain content formats.

By creating a custom search instance with [Bing Custom Search](../Bing-Custom-Search/index.yml), you can create a search experience focused only on content and topics you care about. For example, after specifying the domains, websites, and specific webpages that Bing will search, your users will see results tailored to that specific content. 

Use these APIs in applications that may need to search for all types of relevant web content. If your application searches for a specific type of content, consider one of the search APIs below:
