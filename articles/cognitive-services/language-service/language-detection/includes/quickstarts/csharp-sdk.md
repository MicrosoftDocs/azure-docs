[Reference documentation](/dotnet/api/azure.ai.textanalytics?preserve-view=true&view=azure-dotnet-preview) | [Additional samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/textanalytics/Azure.AI.TextAnalytics/samples) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.TextAnalytics/5.2.0) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/textanalytics/Azure.AI.TextAnalytics)

Use this quickstart to create a language detection application with the client library for .NET. In the following example, you will create a C# application that can identify the language a text sample was written in.

[!INCLUDE [Use Language Studio](../../../includes/use-language-studio.md)]


## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* The [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics"  title="Create a Language resource"  target="_blank">create a Language resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint.  After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`Free F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
* To use the Analyze feature, you will need a Language resource with the standard (S) pricing tier.

## Setting up

### Create a new .NET Core application

Using the Visual Studio IDE, create a new .NET Core console app. This will create a "Hello World" project with a single C# source file: *program.cs*.

Install the client library by right-clicking on the solution in the **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Manage NuGet Packages**. In the package manager that opens select **Browse** and search for `Azure.AI.TextAnalytics`. Select version `5.2.0`, and then **Install**. You can also use the [Package Manager Console](/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-powershell#find-and-install-a-package).

## Code example

Copy the following code into your *program.cs* file. Remember to replace the `key` variable with the key for your resource, and replace the `endpoint` variable with the endpoint for your resource. 

[!INCLUDE [find the key and endpoint for a resource](../../../includes/find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```csharp
using Azure;
using System;
using Azure.AI.TextAnalytics;

namespace LanguageDetectionExample
{
    class Program
    {
        private static readonly AzureKeyCredential credentials = new AzureKeyCredential("replace-with-your-key-here");
        private static readonly Uri endpoint = new Uri("replace-with-your-endpoint-here");

        // Example method for detecting the language of text
        static void LanguageDetectionExample(TextAnalyticsClient client)
        {
            DetectedLanguage detectedLanguage = client.DetectLanguage("Ce document est rédigé en Français.");
            Console.WriteLine("Language:");
            Console.WriteLine($"\t{detectedLanguage.Name},\tISO-6391: {detectedLanguage.Iso6391Name}\n");
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var client = new TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint, credentials);
            LanguageDetectionExample(client);

            Console.Write("Press any key to exit.");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

    }
}

```
