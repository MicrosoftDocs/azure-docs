# Model lifecycle

Language service features utilize AI models that are versioned. We update the language service with new model versions to improve accuracy, support, and quality. As models become older, they are retired. Use this article for information on that process, and what you can expect for your applications.

### Expiration timeline

As new models and new functionality become available and older, less accurate models are retired, see the following timelines for model and endpoint expiration:

New Langauge AI models are being released every few months. So, an expiration of any publicly available model is set for 6 months. An expiration timeline of a preview model is for even a shorter duration i.e. for 3 months.

When a model is retired, The API you're using will typically fall back to the newest available model version.
