Create a **DELETE** request using the following URL, headers, and JSON body to delete a deployment.


### Request URL

{Endpoint}/language/authoring/analyze-text/projects/{PROJECT-NAME}/deployments/{deploymentName}?api-version={API-VERSION}
```

|Placeholder  |Value  | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
|`{ENDPOINT}`     | The endpoint for authenticating your API request.   | `https://<your-custom-subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com` |
|`{PROJECT-NAME}`     | The name for your project. This value is case-sensitive.   | `myProject` |
|`{DEPLOYMENT-NAME}`     | The name for your deployment name. This value is case-sensitive.   | `prod` |
|`{API-VERSION}`     | The version of the API you are calling. The value referenced here is for the latest version released. Learn more about other available [API versions](../../../concepts/model-lifecycle.md#choose-the-model-version-used-on-your-data)  | `2022-05-01` |

### Headers

Use the following header to authenticate your request.
