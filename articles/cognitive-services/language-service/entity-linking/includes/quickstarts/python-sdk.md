[Reference documentation](/python/api/azure-ai-textanalytics/azure.ai.textanalytics?preserve-view=true&view=azure-python) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics) | [Package (PiPy)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-textanalytics/5.1.0/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/samples)


## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics"  title="Create a Language resource"  target="_blank">create a Language resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
* To use the Analyze feature, you will need a Language resource with the standard (S) pricing tier.

## Setting up

### Install the client library

After installing Python, you can install the client library with:

```console
pip install azure-ai-textanalytics==5.1.0
```

## Code example

Create a new Python file and copy the below code. Remember to replace the `key` variable with the key for your resource, and replace the `endpoint` variable with the endpoint for your resource. 

[!INCLUDE [find the key and endpoint for a resource](../../../includes/find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```python
key = "paste-your-key-here"
endpoint = "paste-your-endpoint-here"

from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

# Authenticate the client using your key and endpoint 
def authenticate_client():
    ta_credential = AzureKeyCredential(key)
    text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(
            endpoint=endpoint, 
            credential=ta_credential)
    return text_analytics_client

client = authenticate_client()

# Example function for recognizing entities and providing a link to an online data source
def entity_linking_example(client):

    try:
        documents = ["""Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, 
        to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800.

        chief executive officer, president and chief software architect, 
        while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014."""]
        result = client.recognize_linked_entities(documents = documents)[0]

        print("Linked Entities:\n")
        for entity in result.entities:
            print("\tName: ", entity.name, "\tId: ", entity.data_source_entity_id, "\tUrl: ", entity.url,
            "\n\tData Source: ", entity.data_source)
            print("\tMatches:")
            for match in entity.matches:
                print("\t\tText:", match.text)
                print("\t\tConfidence Score: {0:.2f}".format(match.confidence_score))
                print("\t\tOffset: {}".format(match.offset))
                print("\t\tLength: {}".format(match.length))
            
    except Exception as err:
        print("Encountered exception. {}".format(err))
entity_linking_example(client)
```
