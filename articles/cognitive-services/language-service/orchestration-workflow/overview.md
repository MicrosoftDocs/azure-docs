# What are orchestration workflows?

Orchestration workflow is a cloud-based service that enables you to train language models to connect your applications in:
* Custom Language Understanding
* Question Answering
* LUIS
* QnA maker


The API is a part of [Azure Cognitive Services](../../index.yml), a collection of machine learning and AI algorithms in the cloud for your development projects. You can use these features with the REST API, or the client libraries.

## Features

* Advanced natural language understanding technology using advanced neural networks.
* Orchestration project types that allow you to connect services including other Conversational Language Understanding projects, custom question answering knowledge bases, and LUIS applications.

## Reference documentation and code samples

As you use orchestration workflow in your applications, see the following reference documentation and samples for Azure Cognitive Services for Language:
