# Language and region support for Bing Spell Check API

These languages are supported by the Bing Spell Check API (only in `spell` mode).

Please note that to work with any other language than `en-US`, the `mkt` should be set and either `Accept-Language` or `setLang` should be set as it has been described in [Spell Check API v7 reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-spell-check-api-v7-reference)
