This article shows you how to get started using the Custom Vision SDK with Python to build an object detection model. After it's created, you can add tagged regions, upload images, train the project, obtain the project's published prediction endpoint URL, and use the endpoint to programmatically test an image. Use this example as a template for building your own Python application.

## Prerequisites

- [Python 2.7+ or 3.5+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) tool
- [!INCLUDE [create-resources](../../includes/create-resources.md)]

## Install the Custom Vision SDK

To install the Custom Vision service SDK for Python, run the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
pip install azure-cognitiveservices-vision-customvision
```

You can download the images with the [Python Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-python-sdk-samples).

[!INCLUDE [get-keys](../../includes/get-keys.md)]

[!INCLUDE [python-get-images](../../includes/python-get-images.md)]

## Add the code

Create a new file called *sample.py* in your preferred project directory.

### Create the Custom Vision service project

Add the following code to your script to create a new Custom Vision service project. Insert your subscription keys in the appropriate definitions. Also, get your Endpoint URL from the Settings page of the Custom Vision website.

See the [create_project](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-customvision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.customvision.training.operations.customvisiontrainingclientoperationsmixin?view=azure-python#create-project-name--description-none--domain-id-none--classification-type-none--target-export-platforms-none--custom-headers-none--raw-false----operation-config-) method to specify other options when you create your project (explained in the [Build a detector](../../get-started-build-detector.md) web portal guide).  

```Python
from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.customvision.training import CustomVisionTrainingClient
from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.customvision.training.models import ImageFileCreateBatch, ImageFileCreateEntry, Region
from msrest.authentication import ApiKeyCredentials

ENDPOINT = "<your API endpoint>"

# Replace with a valid key
training_key = "<your training key>"
prediction_key = "<your prediction key>"
prediction_resource_id = "<your prediction resource id>"

publish_iteration_name = "detectModel"

credentials = ApiKeyCredentials(in_headers={"Training-key": training_key})
trainer = CustomVisionTrainingClient(ENDPOINT, credentials)

# Find the object detection domain
obj_detection_domain = next(domain for domain in trainer.get_domains() if domain.type == "ObjectDetection" and domain.name == "General")

# Create a new project
print ("Creating project...")
project = trainer.create_project("My Detection Project", domain_id=obj_detection_domain.id)
```

### Create tags in the project

To create object tags in your project, add the following code to the end of *sample.py*:

```Python
# Make two tags in the new project
fork_tag = trainer.create_tag(project.id, "fork")
scissors_tag = trainer.create_tag(project.id, "scissors")
```

### Upload and tag images

When you tag images in object detection projects, you need to specify the region of each tagged object using normalized coordinates.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have a click-and-drag utility to mark the coordinates of regions, you can use the web UI at [Customvision.ai](https://www.customvision.ai/). In this example, the coordinates are already provided.


To add the images, tags, and regions to the project, insert the following code after the tag creation. For this tutorial, the regions are hardcoded inline with the code. The regions specify the bounding box in normalized coordinates, and the coordinates are given in the order: left, top, width, height.

}
```

Then, use this map of associations to upload each sample image with its region coordinates (you can upload up to 64 images in a single batch). Add the following code.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to change the path to the images based on where you downloaded the Cognitive Services Python SDK Samples repo earlier.

```Python
# Update this with the path to where you downloaded the images.
base_image_url = "<path to repo directory>/cognitive-services-python-sdk-samples/samples/vision/"

# Go through the data table above and create the images
print ("Adding images...")
tagged_images_with_regions = []

for file_name in fork_image_regions.keys():
    x,y,w,h = fork_image_regions[file_name]
    regions = [ Region(tag_id=fork_tag.id, left=x,top=y,width=w,height=h) ]

    with open(base_image_url + "images/fork/" + file_name + ".jpg", mode="rb") as image_contents:
        tagged_images_with_regions.append(ImageFileCreateEntry(name=file_name, contents=image_contents.read(), regions=regions))

for file_name in scissors_image_regions.keys():
    x,y,w,h = scissors_image_regions[file_name]
    regions = [ Region(tag_id=scissors_tag.id, left=x,top=y,width=w,height=h) ]

    with open(base_image_url + "images/scissors/" + file_name + ".jpg", mode="rb") as image_contents:
        tagged_images_with_regions.append(ImageFileCreateEntry(name=file_name, contents=image_contents.read(), regions=regions))

upload_result = trainer.create_images_from_files(project.id, ImageFileCreateBatch(images=tagged_images_with_regions))
if not upload_result.is_batch_successful:
    print("Image batch upload failed.")
    for image in upload_result.images:
        print("Image status: ", image.status)
    exit(-1)
```

### Train the project and publish

This code creates the first iteration of the prediction model and then publishes that iteration to the prediction endpoint. The name given to the published iteration can be used to send prediction requests. An iteration is not available in the prediction endpoint until it is published.

```Python
import time

print ("Training...")
iteration = trainer.train_project(project.id)
while (iteration.status != "Completed"):
    iteration = trainer.get_iteration(project.id, iteration.id)
    print ("Training status: " + iteration.status)
    time.sleep(1)

# The iteration is now trained. Publish it to the project endpoint
trainer.publish_iteration(project.id, iteration.id, publish_iteration_name, prediction_resource_id)
print ("Done!")
```

### Get and use the published iteration on the prediction endpoint

To send an image to the prediction endpoint and retrieve the prediction, add the following code to the end of the file:

```Python
from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.customvision.prediction import CustomVisionPredictionClient
from msrest.authentication import ApiKeyCredentials

# Now there is a trained endpoint that can be used to make a prediction
prediction_credentials = ApiKeyCredentials(in_headers={"Prediction-key": prediction_key})
predictor = CustomVisionPredictionClient(ENDPOINT, prediction_credentials)

# Open the sample image and get back the prediction results.
with open(base_image_url + "images/Test/test_od_image.jpg", mode="rb") as test_data:
    results = predictor.detect_image(project.id, publish_iteration_name, test_data)

# Display the results.    
for prediction in results.predictions:
    print("\t" + prediction.tag_name + ": {0:.2f}% bbox.left = {1:.2f}, bbox.top = {2:.2f}, bbox.width = {3:.2f}, bbox.height = {4:.2f}".format(prediction.probability * 100, prediction.bounding_box.left, prediction.bounding_box.top, prediction.bounding_box.width, prediction.bounding_box.height))
```

## Run the application

Run *sample.py*.

```powershell
python sample.py
```

The output of the application should appear in the console. You can then verify that the test image (found in **samples/vision/images/Test**) is tagged appropriately and that the region of detection is correct.

## Next steps

Now you've seen how every step of the object detection process can be done in code. This sample executes a single training iteration, but often you'll need to train and test your model multiple times in order to make it more accurate. The following training guide deals with image classification, but its principles are similar to object detection.
