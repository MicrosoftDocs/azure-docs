# Your first news search query

Before you can make your first call, you need to get a Cognitive Services subscription key. To get a key, see [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=bing-news-search-api).

To get news-only search results, you'd send a GET request to the following endpoint:

```http
https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/news/search
```

The request must use the HTTPS protocol.

We recommend that all requests originate from a server. Distributing the key as part of a client application provides more opportunity for a malicious third party to access it. Also, making calls from a server provides a single upgrade point for future versions of the API.

The request must specify the [q](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-news-api-v7-reference#query) query parameter, which contains the user's search term. Although it's optional, the request should also specify the [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-news-api-v7-reference#mkt) query parameter, which identifies the market where you want the results to come from. For a list of optional query parameters such as `freshness` and `textDecorations`, see [Query Parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-news-api-v7-reference#query-parameters). All query parameter values must be URL encoded.

The request must specify the [Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-news-api-v7-reference#subscriptionkey) header. Although optional, you are encouraged to also specify the following headers:

- [User-Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-news-api-v7-reference#useragent)
- [X-MSEdge-ClientID](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-news-api-v7-reference#clientid)
- [X-Search-ClientIP](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-news-api-v7-reference#clientip)
- [X-Search-Location](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-news-api-v7-reference#location)

The client IP and location headers are important for returning location aware content.

For a list of all request and response headers, see [Headers](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-news-api-v7-reference#headers).

## The request

The following shows a news request that includes all the suggested query parameters and headers. If it's your first time calling any of the Bing APIs, don't include the client ID header. Only include the client ID if you've previously called a Bing API and Bing returned a client ID for the user and device combination.

```http
GET https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/news/search?q=sailing+dinghies&mkt=en-us HTTP/1.1
Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: 123456789ABCDE
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0; ARM; Touch; NOKIA; Lumia 822)
X-Search-ClientIP: 999.999.999.999
X-Search-Location: lat:47.60357;long:-122.3295;re:100
X-MSEdge-ClientID: <blobFromPriorResponseGoesHere>
Host: api.cognitive.microsoft.com
```

## The response

The following shows the response to the previous request. The example also shows the Bing-specific response headers.
