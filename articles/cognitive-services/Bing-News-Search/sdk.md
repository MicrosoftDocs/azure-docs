# Bing Search SDK preview
The Bing Search API samples include search scenarios that: 1. Use a single-word query to get results and print out name and url for each of the first web, image, news, and video results; 2. Query on a phrase, verify the number of results, and print out name and url of first result; 3. Query on search term with response filters set to `news` and print the details of news results; 4. Query on a search term with `answerCount` and `promote` parameters and then print details of results.
