# Create a resource and deploy a model using Azure OpenAI

Use this article to get started with Azure OpenAI with step-by-step instructions to create a resource and deploy a model. While the steps for resource creation and model deployment can be completed in a few minutes, the actual deployment process itself can take more than hour. It is recommended to create your resource, start your deployment, and then check back in on your deployment later rather than actively waiting for the deployment to complete.

::: zone pivot="web-portal"

[!INCLUDE [Studio quickstart](../includes/create-resource-portal.md)]

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="cli"

[!INCLUDE [Python SDK quickstart](../includes/create-resource-cli.md)]

::: zone-end

## Next steps

* Now that you have a resource and your first model deployed get started making API calls and generating text with our [quickstarts](../quickstart.md).
* Learn more about the [underlying models that power Azure OpenAI](../concepts/models.md).
