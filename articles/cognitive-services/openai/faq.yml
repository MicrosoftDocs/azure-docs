          Azure OpenAI Service gives customers advanced language AI with OpenAI GPT-3, Codex, and DALL-E models with the security and enterprise promise of Azure. Azure OpenAI co-develops the APIs with OpenAI, ensuring compatibility and a smooth transition from one to the other.
          
          With Azure OpenAI, customers get the security capabilities of Microsoft Azure while running the same models as OpenAI. 
  - name: Getting access to Azure OpenAI Service
    questions:
      - question: |
          How do I get access to Azure OpenAI? 
        answer: |
          Access is currently limited as we navigate high demand, upcoming product improvements, and Microsoft's commitment to responsible AI. For now, we're working with customers with an existing partnership with Microsoft, lower risk use cases, and those committed to incorporating mitigations. In addition to applying for initial access, all solutions using Azure OpenAI are required to go through a use case review before they can be released for production use. Apply here for initial access or for a production review: [Apply now](https://aka.ms/oaiapply)          
      - question: |
          After I apply for access, how long will I have to wait to get approved?
        answer: |
          We don't currently provide a timeline for access approval.

  - name: Models and fine-tuning
    questions:
      - question: |
          What models are available?
        answer: |
          Consult the Azure OpenAI [model availability guide](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability).
      - question: |
          Where can I find out what region a model is available in?
        answer: |
          Consult the Azure OpenAI [model availability guide](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability) for region availability.
      - question: |
          What is the difference between a base model and a fine-tuned model?
        answer:
          A base model is a model that hasn't been customized or fine-tuned for a specific use case. Fine-tuned models are customized versions of base models where a model's weights are trained on a unique set of prompts. Fine-tuned models let you achieve better results on a wider number of tasks without needing to provide detailed examples for in-context learning as part of your completion prompt. To learn more, review our [fine-tuning guide](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/fine-tuning?pivots=programming-language-studio).
      - question: |
          What is the maximum number of fine-tuned models I can create?
        answer: |
          100
      - question: |
          What are the SLAs for API responses in Azure OpenAI?
        answer:
          We don't have a defined API response time Service Level Agreement (SLA) at this time. The overall SLA for Azure OpenAI Service is the same as for other Azure Cognitive Services. For more information, see the Cognitive Services section of the [Service Level Agreements (SLA) for Online Services page](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/cognitive-services/v1_1/).
