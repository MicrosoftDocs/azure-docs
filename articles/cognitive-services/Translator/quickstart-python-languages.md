# Quickstart: Use the Translator Text API to get a list of supported languages using Python

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to make a GET request that returns a list of supported languages using Python and the Translator Text REST API.

This quickstart requires an [Azure Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with a Translator Text resource. If you don't have an account, you can use the [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/) to get a subscription key.

## Prerequisites

This quickstart requires:

* Python 2.7.x or 3.x
* An Azure subscription key for Translator Text

## Create a project and import required modules

Create a new Python project using your favorite IDE or editor. Then copy this code snippet into your project in a file named `get-languages.py`.

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import os, requests, uuid, json
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't used these modules you'll need to install them before running your program. To install these packages, run: `pip install requests uuid`.

The first comment tells your Python interpreter to use UTF-8 encoding. Then required modules are imported to read your subscription key from an environment variable, construct the http request, create a unique identifier, and handle the JSON response returned by the Translator Text API.

## Set the subscription key, base url, and path

This sample will try to read your Translator Text subscription key from the environment variable `TRANSLATOR_TEXT_KEY`. If you're not familiar with environment variables, you can set `subscriptionKey` as a string and comment out the conditional statement.

Copy this code into your project:

```python
# Checks to see if the Translator Text subscription key is available
# as an environment variable. If you are setting your subscription key as a
# string, then comment these lines out.
if 'TRANSLATOR_TEXT_KEY' in os.environ:
    subscriptionKey = os.environ['TRANSLATOR_TEXT_KEY']
else:
    print('Environment variable for TRANSLATOR_TEXT_KEY is not set.')
    exit()
# If you want to set your subscription key as a string, uncomment the line
# below and add your subscription key.
#subscriptionKey = 'put_your_key_here'
```

Currently, one endpoint is available for Translator Text, and it's set as the `base_url`. `path` sets the `languages` route and identifies that we want to hit version 3 of the API.

>[!NOTE]
> For more information about endpoints, routes, and request parameters, see [Translator Text API 3.0: Languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-languages).

```python
base_url = 'https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com'
path = '/languages?api-version=3.0'
constructed_url = base_url + path
```

## Add headers

The easiest way to authenticate a request is to pass in your subscription key as an
`Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header, which is what we use in this sample. As an alternative, you can exchange your subscription key for an access token, and pass the access token along as an `Authorization` header to validate your request. For more information, see [Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-reference#authentication).

Copy this code snippet into your project:

```python
headers = {
    'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscriptionKey,
    'Content-type': 'application/json',
    'X-ClientTraceId': str(uuid.uuid4())
}
```

## Create a request to get a list of supported languages

Let's create a GET request using the `requests` module. It takes two arguments: the concatenated URL, and the request headers:

```python
request = requests.get(constructed_url, headers=headers)
response = request.json()
```

## Print the response

The last step is to print the results. This code snippet prettifies the results by sorting the keys, setting indentation, and declaring item and key separators.

```python
print(json.dumps(response, sort_keys=True, indent=4, ensure_ascii=False, separators=(',', ': ')))
```

## Put it all together

That's it, you've put together a simple program that will call the Translator Text API and return a JSON response. Now it's time to run your program:

```console
python get-languages.py
```

If you'd like to compare your code against ours, the complete sample is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftTranslator/Text-Translation-API-V3-Python).

## Clean up resources

If you've hardcoded your subscription key into your program, make sure to remove the subscription key when you're finished with this quickstart.
