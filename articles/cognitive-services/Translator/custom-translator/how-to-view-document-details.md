# View document details

The document list page shows the first 10 document in your workspace. For each
of the documents, it displays the name, pairing, type, language, upload time
stamp, and the email address of the user who uploaded the document.

Select an individual document to view the document details page. The document details page displays the list of extracted sentences from the document.

- By default the "Side-by-side" source and target languages display is selected in the dropdown field, but you can toggle to view sentences in the source or target language.
- 20 sentences are displayed per page by default. You can use the pagination control to browse between pages.
