There are three groups of supported languages in the Microsoft Translator API. Text, Speech and Text to Speech(tts). The languages API method will return the list of supported languages for each of the three groups. The languages method does not require an access token for authenticantion.

In the 'Scope' parameter of the method; add one or all three of the groups and the method will return the supported langauges in JSON format. After you have entered the scope parameters select the **'Try it out'** button. The list will appear in the 'Response Body'
