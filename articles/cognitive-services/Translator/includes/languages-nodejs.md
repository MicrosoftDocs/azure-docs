[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](prerequisites-nodejs.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Set up and use environment variables](setup-env-variables.md)]

## Create a project and import required modules

Create a new project using your favorite IDE or editor. Then copy this code snippet into your project in a file named `get-languages.js`.

```javascript
const request = require('request');
const uuidv4 = require('uuid/v4');
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't used these modules you'll need to install them before running your program. To install these packages, run: `npm install request uuidv4`.

These modules are required to construct the HTTP request, and create a unique identifier for the `'X-ClientTraceId'` header.

## Set the endpoint

This sample will try to read your Translator endpoint from an environment variable: `TRANSLATOR_TEXT_ENDPOINT`. If you're not familiar with environment variables, you can set `endpoint` as a string and comment out the conditional statement.

```javascript
lorum ipsum
```

## Configure the request

The `request()` method, made available through the request module, allows us to pass the HTTP method, URL, request params, headers, and the JSON body as an `options` object. In this code snippet, we'll configure the request:

>[!NOTE]
> For more information about endpoints, routes, and request parameters, see [Translator 3.0: Languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-languages).

```javascript
let options = {
    method: 'GET',
    baseUrl: endpoint,
    url: 'languages',
    qs: {
      'api-version': '3.0',
    },
    headers: {
      'Content-type': 'application/json',
      'X-ClientTraceId': uuidv4().toString()
    },
    json: true,
};
```

If you are using a Cognitive Services multi-service subscription, you must also include the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region` in your request parameters. [Learn more about authenticating with the multi-service subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-reference#authentication).

## Make the request and print the response

Next, we'll create the request using the `request()` method. It takes the `options` object that we created in the previous section as the first argument, then prints the prettified JSON response.

```javascript
request(options, function(err, res, body){
    console.log(JSON.stringify(body, null, 4));
});
```

>[!NOTE]
> In this sample, we're defining the HTTP request in the `options` object. However, the request module also supports convenience methods, like `.post` and `.get`. For more information, see [convenience methods](https://github.com/request/request#convenience-methods).

## Put it all together

That's it, you've put together a simple program that will call the Translator and return a JSON response. Now it's time to run your program:

```console
node get-languages.js
```

If you'd like to compare your code against ours, the complete sample is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftTranslator/Text-Translation-API-V3-NodeJS).

## Sample response

Find the country/region abbreviation in this [list of languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/language-support).

## Clean up resources

If you've hardcoded your subscription key into your program, make sure to remove the subscription key when you're finished with this quickstart.

## Next steps

Take a look at the API reference to understand everything you can do with the Translator.
