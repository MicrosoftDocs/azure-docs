[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](prerequisites-csharp.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Set up and use environment variables](setup-env-variables.md)]

## Create a .NET Core project

Open a new command prompt (or terminal session) and run these commands:

```console
dotnet new console -o transliterate-sample
cd transliterate-sample
```

The first command does two things. It creates a new .NET console application, and creates a directory named `transliterate-sample`. The second command changes to the directory for your project.

Next, you'll need to install Json.Net. From your project's directory, run:

```console
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json --version 11.0.2
```

## Select the C# language version

This quickstart requires C# 7.1 or later. There are a few ways to change the C# version for your project. In this guide, we'll show you how to adjust the `transliterate-sample.csproj` file. For all available options, such as changing the language in Visual Studio, see [Select the C# language version](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/configure-language-version).

Open your project, then open `transliterate-sample.csproj`. Make sure that `LangVersion` is set to 7.1 or later. If there isn't a property group for the language version, add these lines:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
   <LangVersion>7.1</LangVersion>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## Add required namespaces to your project

The `dotnet new console` command that you ran earlier created a project, including `Program.cs`. This file is where you'll put your application code. Open `Program.cs`, and replace the existing using statements. These statements ensure that you have access to all the types required to build and run the sample app.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
// Install Newtonsoft.Json with NuGet
using Newtonsoft.Json;
```

## Create classes for the JSON response

Next, we're going to create a class that's used when deserializing the JSON response returned by the Translator.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// The C# classes that represents the JSON returned by the Translator.
/// </summary>
public class TransliterationResult
{
    public string Text { get; set; }
    public string Script { get; set; }
}
```

## Get subscription information from environment variables

Add the following lines to the `Program` class. These lines read your subscription key and endpoint from environment variables, and throws an error if you run into any issues.

```csharp
private const string key_var = "TRANSLATOR_TEXT_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY";
private static readonly string subscriptionKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(key_var);

private const string endpoint_var = "TRANSLATOR_TEXT_ENDPOINT";
private static readonly string endpoint = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(endpoint_var);

static Program()
{
    if (null == subscriptionKey)
    {
        throw new Exception("Please set/export the environment variable: " + key_var);
    }
    if (null == endpoint)
    {
        throw new Exception("Please set/export the environment variable: " + endpoint_var);
    }
}
// The code in the next section goes here.
```

## Create a function to transliterate text

Within the `Program` class, create an asynchronous function called `TransliterateTextRequest()`. This function takes four arguments: `subscriptionKey`, `endpoint`, `route`, and `inputText`.

```csharp
static public async Task TransliterateTextRequest(string subscriptionKey, string endpoint, string route, string inputText)
{
  /*
   * The code for your call to the translation service will be added to this
   * function in the next few sections.
   */
}
```

## Serialize the translation request

Next, we need to create and serialize the JSON object that includes the text you want to translate. Keep in mind, you can pass more than one object in the `body`.

```csharp
object[] body = new object[] { new { Text = inputText } };
var requestBody = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(body);
```

## Instantiate the client and make a request

These lines instantiate the `HttpClient` and the `HttpRequestMessage`:

```csharp
using (var client = new HttpClient())
using (var request = new HttpRequestMessage())
{
  // In the next few sections you'll add code to construct the request.
}
```

## Construct the request and print the response

Inside the `HttpRequestMessage` you'll:

* Declare the HTTP method
* Construct the request URI
* Insert the request body (serialized JSON object)
* Add required headers
* Make an asynchronous request
* Print the response

Add this code to the `HttpRequestMessage`:

```csharp
// Build the request.
// Set the method to Post.
request.Method = HttpMethod.Post;
// Construct the URI and add headers.
request.RequestUri = new Uri(endpoint + route);
request.Content = new StringContent(requestBody, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
request.Headers.Add("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", subscriptionKey);

// Send the request and get response.
HttpResponseMessage response = await client.SendAsync(request).ConfigureAwait(false);
// Read response as a string.
string result = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
// Deserialize the response using the classes created earlier.
TransliterationResult[] deserializedOutput = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<TransliterationResult[]>(result);
// Iterate over the deserialized results.
foreach (TransliterationResult o in deserializedOutput)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Transliterated to {0} script: {1}", o.Script, o.Text);
}
```

If you are using a Cognitive Services multi-service subscription, you must also include the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region` in your request parameters. [Learn more about authenticating with the multi-service subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-reference#authentication).

## Put it all together

The last step is to call `TransliterateTextRequest()` in the `Main` function. In this sample, we're transliterating from Japanese to latin script. Locate `static void Main(string[] args)` and replace it with this code:

```csharp
static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    // This is our main function.
    // Output languages are defined in the route.
    // For a complete list of options, see API reference.
    // https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-transliterate
    string route = "/transliterate?api-version=3.0&language=ja&fromScript=jpan&toScript=latn";
    string textToTransliterate = @"こんにちは";
    await TransliterateTextRequest(subscriptionKey, endpoint, route, textToTransliterate);
    Console.WriteLine("Press any key to continue.");
    Console.ReadKey();
}
```

You'll notice that in `Main`, you're declaring `subscriptionKey`, `endpoint`, `route`, and the script to transliterate `textToTransliterate`.

## Run the sample app

That's it, you're ready to run your sample app. From the command line (or terminal session), navigate to your project directory and run:

```console
dotnet run
```

## Sample response

After you run the sample, you should see the following printed to terminal:

```bash
Transliterated to latn script: Kon\'nichiwa
```

This message is built from the raw JSON, which will look like this:

```json
[
    {
        "script": "latn",
        "text": "konnichiwa"
    }
]
```

## Clean up resources

Make sure to remove any confidential information from your sample app's source code, like subscription keys.

## Next steps

Take a look at the API reference to understand everything you can do with the Translator.
