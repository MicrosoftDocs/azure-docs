summary: |

 The Azure Cognitive Services Document Translation feature can be used to translate multiple and complex documents across all supported languages and dialects while preserving original document structure and data format. Here are answers to common asked questions about Translator Service Document Translation.

sections:
  - name: General
    questions:

    - question:
       Does Document Translation translate content from scanned documents?
      answer: |
        Currently, Document Translation can translate content from *scanned PDF* documents.

    - question:
        Can a page range or specific pages be selected in the Translator service API call?
      answer:  |
        No. The Document Translation API doesn't support specific page translation to allow for document formats without page concepts like html, xliff, and md.

    - question:
        Will the text in an image within a document get translated?
      answer: |
        The text in a *scanned PDF* will be translated. Currently, Document Translation doesn't support translating text within other image formats such as JPG or PNG.

    - question:
        When should I specify the source language of the document in the request?
      answer: |
       If the language of the content in the source document is known, its recommended to specify the source language in the request to get a better translation. If the document has content in multiple languages or the language is unknown, then don’t specify the source language in the request. Document translation automatically identifies language for each text segment and translates.

    - question:
        To what extent are the layout, structure, and formatting maintained?
      answer: |
       The overall length of translated text may differ from source when translating text from the source to the target language.  This difference could result in reflow of text across pages. The same fonts may not be available both in source and target language. In general, the same font style is applied in target language to retain formatting closer to source.|
