# Quickstart: Create a Cognitive Services resource using the Azure Management client library

Use this quickstart to create and manage Azure Cognitive Services resources using the Azure Management client library. Individual AI services are represented by Azure [resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal) that you create under your Azure subscription.
