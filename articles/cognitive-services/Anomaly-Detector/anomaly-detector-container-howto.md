# Install and run Anomaly Detector containers (Preview)

The Anomaly Detector has the following container feature functionality:

| Function | Features |
|--|--|
| Anomaly detector | <li> Detects anomalies as they occur in real-time. <li> Detects anomalies throughout your data set as a batch. <li> Infers the expected normal range of your data. <li> Supports anomaly detection sensitivity adjustment to better fit your data. |

For detailed information about the APIs, please see:
* [Learn more about Anomaly Detector API service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2080698&clcid=0x409)

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

You must meet the following prerequisites before using Anomaly Detector containers:

|Required|Purpose|
|--|--|
|Docker Engine| You need the Docker Engine installed on a [host computer](#the-host-computer). Docker provides packages that configure the Docker environment on [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/), and [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms). For a primer on Docker and container basics, see the [Docker overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/).<br><br> Docker must be configured to allow the containers to connect with and send billing data to Azure. <br><br> **On Windows**, Docker must also be configured to support Linux containers.<br><br>|
|Familiarity with Docker | You should have a basic understanding of Docker concepts, like registries, repositories, containers, and container images, as well as knowledge of basic `docker` commands.| 
|Anomaly Detector resource |In order to use these containers, you must have:<br><br>An Azure _Anomaly Detector_ resource to get the associated API key and endpoint URI. Both values are available on the Azure portal's **Anomaly Detector** Overview and Keys pages and are required to start the container.<br><br>**{API_KEY}**: One of the two available resource keys on the **Keys** page<br><br>**{ENDPOINT_URI}**: The endpoint as provided on the **Overview** page|

## The host computer

[!INCLUDE [Host Computer requirements](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-host-computer.md)]

<!--* [Azure IoT Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/). For instructions of deploying Anomaly Detector module in IoT Edge, see [How to deploy Anomaly Detector module in IoT Edge](how-to-deploy-anomaly-detector-module-in-iot-edge.md).-->

### Container requirements and recommendations

The following table describes the minimum and recommended CPU cores and memory to allocate for Anomaly Detector container.

| QPS(Queries per second) | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 10 QPS | 4 core, 1-GB memory | 8 core 2-GB memory |
| 20 QPS | 8 core, 2-GB memory | 16 core 4-GB memory |

Each core must be at least 2.6 gigahertz (GHz) or faster.

Core and memory correspond to the `--cpus` and `--memory` settings, which are used as part of the `docker run` command.

## Get the container image with `docker pull`

Use the [`docker pull`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/) command to download a container image.

| Container | Repository |
|-----------|------------|
| cognitive-services-anomaly-detector | `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/anomaly-detector:latest` |

<!--
For a full description of available tags, such as `latest` used in the preceding command, see [anomaly-detector](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083827&clcid=0x409) on Docker Hub.

### Docker pull for the Anomaly Detector container

```Docker
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/anomaly-detector:latest
```

## How to use the container

Once the container is on the [host computer](#the-host-computer), use the following process to work with the container.

1. [Run the container](#run-the-container-with-docker-run), with the required billing settings. More [examples](anomaly-detector-container-configuration.md#example-docker-run-commands) of the `docker run` command are available.
1. [Query the container's prediction endpoint](#query-the-containers-prediction-endpoint).

## Run the container with `docker run`

Use the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command to run the container. Refer to [gathering required parameters](#gathering-required-parameters) for details on how to get the `{ENDPOINT_URI}` and `{API_KEY}` values.

[Examples](anomaly-detector-container-configuration.md#example-docker-run-commands) of the `docker run` command are available.

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 4g --cpus 1 \
mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cognitive-services/anomaly-detector:latest \
Eula=accept \
Billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={API_KEY}
```

This command:

* Runs an Anomaly Detector container from the container image
* Allocates one CPU core and 4 gigabytes (GB) of memory
* Exposes TCP port 5000 and allocates a pseudo-TTY for the container
* Automatically removes the container after it exits. The container image is still available on the host computer. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Eula`, `Billing`, and `ApiKey` options must be specified to run the container; otherwise, the container won't start.  For more information, see [Billing](#billing).

### Running multiple containers on the same host

If you intend to run multiple containers with exposed ports, make sure to run each container with a different port. For example, run the first container on port 5000 and the second container on port 5001.

Replace the `<container-registry>` and `<container-name>` with the values of the containers you use. These do not have to be the same container. You can have the Anomaly Detector container and the LUIS container running on the HOST together or you can have multiple Anomaly Detector containers running. 

Run the first container on port 5000. 

```bash 
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 4g --cpus 1 \
<container-registry>/microsoft/<container-name> \
Eula=accept \
Billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={API_KEY}
```

Run the second container on port 5001.


```bash 
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5001 --memory 4g --cpus 1 \
<container-registry>/microsoft/<container-name> \
Eula=accept \
Billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={API_KEY}
```

Each subsequent container should be on a different port. 

## Query the container's prediction endpoint

The container provides REST-based query prediction endpoint APIs. 

Use the host, http://localhost:5000, for container APIs.

<!--  ## Validate container is running -->

[!INCLUDE [Container's API documentation](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-api-documentation.md)]

## Stop the container

[!INCLUDE [How to stop the container](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-stop.md)]

## Troubleshooting

If you run the container with an output [mount](anomaly-detector-container-configuration.md#mount-settings) and logging enabled, the container generates log files that are helpful to troubleshoot issues that happen while starting or running the container.

[!INCLUDE [Cognitive Services FAQ note](../containers/includes/cognitive-services-faq-note.md)]

## Billing

The Anomaly Detector containers send billing information to Azure, using an _Anomaly Detector_ resource on your Azure account. 

[!INCLUDE [Container's Billing Settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-how-to-billing-info.md)]

For more information about these options, see [Configure containers](anomaly-detector-container-configuration.md).

## Summary

In this article, you learned concepts and workflow for downloading, installing, and running Anomaly Detector containers. In summary:

* Anomaly Detector provides one Linux container for Docker, encapsulating anomaly detection with batch vs streaming, expected range inference, and sensitivity tuning.
* Container images are downloaded from a private Azure Container Registry dedicated for containers preview.
* Container images run in Docker.
* You can use either the REST API or SDK to call operations in Anomaly Detector containers by specifying the host URI of the container.
* You must specify billing information when instantiating a container.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cognitive Services containers are not licensed to run without being connected to Azure for metering. Customers need to enable the containers to communicate billing information with the metering service at all times. Cognitive Services containers do not send customer data (e.g., the time series data that is being analyzed) to Microsoft.
