# Bing Search SDK
The Bing Entity Search API samples include scenarios that:
1.	Search for entity such as Tom Cruise and get rich information.
2.	Handle disambiguation of terms for queries with possibly multiple intents.
3.	Search for a local entity such as a restaurant and get rich information around it.
4.	Search for local businesses such as restaurants and get rich information.
5.	Trigger a bad request and error handling.
