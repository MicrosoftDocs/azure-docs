# What is the Linguistic Analysis API? (Preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Linguistic Analysis preview was decommissioned on August 9, 2018. We recommend using [Azure Machine Learning text analytics modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/text-analytics) for text processing and analysis.

The Linguistic Analysis API provides access to natural language processing (NLP) tools that identify the structure of text. The current release provides three types of analysis:

- [Sentence separation and tokenization](Sentences-and-Tokens.md)
- [Part-of-speech tagging](POS-tagging.md)
- [Constituency parsing](Constituency-Parsing.md)

## Getting Started

Once you've familiarized yourself with the major types of analysis listed above, you can look into the endpoint for [getting the list of available analyzers](AnalyzersMethod.md) and how they are [named](Analyzer-Names.md), and then the endpoint for [analyzing new input](AnalyzeMethod.md).
