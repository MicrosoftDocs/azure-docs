title: Form Recognizer documentation # < 60 chars
summary: Azure Form Recognizer is a cognitive service that uses machine learning technology to identify and extract key-value pairs and table data from form documents. It then outputs structured data that includes the relationships in the original file. Unsupervised learning allows the model to understand the layout and field data without manual data labeling or intensive coding. You can also do supervised learning with manually labeled data. Models trained with labeled data can perform better and can work with more complicated documents. # < 160 chars
