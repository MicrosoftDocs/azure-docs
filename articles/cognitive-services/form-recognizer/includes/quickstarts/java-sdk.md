[Reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/ai-formrecognizer-readme-pre?view=azure-java-preview) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/src) | [Package (Maven)](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-ai-formrecognizer) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/src/samples/README.md)

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* An Azure Storage blob that contains a set of training data. See [Build a training data set for a custom model](../../build-training-data-set.md) for tips and options for putting together your training data set. For this quickstart, you can use the files under the **Train** folder of the [sample data set](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090451).
* The current version of the [Java Development Kit(JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* The [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/install/), or another dependency manager.
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer"  title="Create a Form Recognizer resource"  target="_blank">create a Form Recognizer resource <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Form Recognizer API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Setting up

### Create a new Gradle project

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

```console
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
```

Run the `gradle init` command from your working directory. This command will create essential build files for Gradle, including *build.gradle.kts* which is used at runtime to create and configure your application.

```console
gradle init --type basic
```

When prompted to choose a **DSL**, select **Kotlin**.

From your working directory, run the following command:

```console
mkdir -p src/main/java
```

### Install the client library

This quickstart uses the Gradle dependency manager. You can find the client library and information for other dependency managers on the [Maven Central Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-ai-formrecognizer).

In your project's *build.gradle.kts* file, include the client library as an `implementation` statement, along with the required plugins and settings.

```kotlin
plugins {
    java
    application
}
application {
    mainClass.set("FormRecognizer")
}
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    implementation(group = "com.azure", name = "azure-ai-formrecognizer", version = "3.0.0")
}
```

Navigate to the new **src/main/java** folder and create a file called *Management.java*. Open it in your preferred editor or IDE and add the following `import` statements:

```java
import com.azure.ai.formrecognizer.*;
import com.azure.ai.formrecognizer.training.*;
import com.azure.ai.formrecognizer.models.*;
import com.azure.ai.formrecognizer.training.models.*;

import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.time.LocalDate;

import com.azure.core.credential.AzureKeyCredential;
import com.azure.core.http.rest.PagedIterable;
import com.azure.core.util.Context;
import com.azure.core.util.polling.SyncPoller;
```

Add a class and a `main` method, and create variables for your resource's Azure endpoint and key. If you created the environment variable after you launched the application, you'll need to close and reopen the editor, IDE, or shell to access the variable. You'll define the methods later.


```java
public class FormRecognizer {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String key = "<replace-with-your-form-recognizer-key>";
        String endpoint = "<replace-with-your-form-recognizer-endpoint>";
    }
}
```

## Object model 

With Form Recognizer, you can create two different client types. The first, `FormRecognizerClient` is used to query the service to recognized form fields and content. The second, `FormTrainingClient` is use to create and manage custom models that you can use to improve recognition. 

### FormRecognizerClient

`FormRecognizerClient` provides operations for:

- Recognizing form fields and content, using custom models trained to recognize your custom forms.  These values are returned in a collection of `RecognizedForm` objects. See example [Analyze custom forms](#analyze-forms-with-a-custom-model).
- Recognizing form content, including tables, lines and words, without the need to train a model.  Form content is returned in a collection of `FormPage` objects. See example [Recognize form content](#recognize-form-content).
- Recognizing common fields from US receipts, using a pre-trained receipt model on the Form Recognizer service.  These fields and meta-data are returned in a collection of `RecognizedForm` objects. See example [Recognize receipts](#recognize-receipts).

### FormTrainingClient

`FormTrainingClient` provides operations for:

- Training custom models to recognize all fields and values found in your custom forms.  A `CustomFormModel` is returned indicating the form types the model will recognize, and the fields it will extract for each form type.
- Training custom models to recognize specific fields and values you specify by labeling your custom forms.  A `CustomFormModel` is returned indicating the fields the model will extract, as well as the estimated accuracy for each field.
- Managing models created in your account.
- Copying a custom model from one Form Recognizer resource to another.

Note that models can also be trained using a graphical user interface such as the [Form Recognizer Labeling Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/quickstarts/label-tool).

## Code examples

These code snippets show you how to do the following tasks with the Form Recognizer client library for Java:

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [Recognize form content](#recognize-form-content)
* [Recognize receipts](#recognize-receipts)
* [Train a custom model](#train-a-custom-model)
* [Analyze forms with a custom model](#analyze-forms-with-a-custom-model)
* [Manage your custom models](#manage-your-custom-models)

## Authenticate the client

Inside the `Main` method, add the following code. Here, you'll authenticate two client objects using the subscription variables you defined above. You'll use an **AzureKeyCredential** object, so that if needed, you can update the API key without creating new client objects.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Get your key and endpoint from the Azure portal. If the Form Recognizer resource you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. You can find your key and endpoint in the resource's **key and endpoint** page, under **resource management**. 
>
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. For example, [Azure key vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-overview).

```java
    FormRecognizerClient recognizerClient = new FormRecognizerClientBuilder()
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(key))
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .buildClient();
    
    FormTrainingClient trainingClient = new FormTrainingClientBuilder()
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(key))
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .buildClient();
```

### Call client-specific methods

The next block of code uses the client objects to call methods for each of the major tasks in the Form Recognizer SDK. You'll define these methods later on.

You'll also need to add references to the URLs for your training and testing data.

* To retrieve the SAS URL for your custom model training data, open the Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer, right-click your container, and select **Get shared access signature**. Make sure the **Read** and **List** permissions are checked, and click **Create**. Then copy the value in the **URL** section. It should have the form: `https://<storage account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container name>?<SAS value>`.
* To get a URL of a form to test, you can use the above steps to get the SAS URL of an individual document in blob storage. Or, take the URL of a document located elsewhere.
* Use the above method to get the URL of a receipt image as well.

> [!NOTE]
> The code snippets in this guide use remote forms accessed by URLs. If you want to process local form documents instead, see the related methods in the [reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/ai-formrecognizer-readme-pre?view=azure-java-preview).

```java
    String trainingDataUrl = "<SAS-URL-of-your-form-folder-in-blob-storage>";
    String formUrl = "<SAS-URL-of-a-form-in-blob-storage>";
    String receiptUrl = "https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/media"
    + "/contoso-allinone.jpg";

    // Call Form Recognizer scenarios:
    System.out.println("Get form content...");
    GetContent(recognizerClient, formUrl);

    System.out.println("Analyze receipt...");
    AnalyzeReceipt(recognizerClient, receiptUrl);

    System.out.println("Train Model with training data...");
    String modelId = TrainModel(trainingClient, trainingDataUrl);

    System.out.println("Analyze PDF form...");
    AnalyzePdfForm(recognizerClient, modelId, formUrl);

    System.out.println("Manage models...");
    ManageModels(trainingClient, trainingDataUrl);
```


## Recognize form content

You can use Form Recognizer to recognize tables, lines, and words in documents, without needing to train a model.

To recognize the content of a file at a given URI, use the **beginRecognizeContentFromUrl** method.

```java
private static void GetContent(
    FormRecognizerClient recognizerClient, String invoiceUri)
{
    String analyzeFilePath = invoiceUri;
    SyncPoller<FormRecognizerOperationResult, List<FormPage>> recognizeContentPoller =
        recognizerClient.beginRecognizeContentFromUrl(analyzeFilePath);
    
    List<FormPage> contentResult = recognizeContentPoller.getFinalResult();
```

The returned value is a collection of **FormPage** objects: one for each page in the submitted document. The following code iterates through these objects and prints the extracted key/value pairs and table data.

```java
    contentResult.forEach(formPage -> {
        // Table information
        System.out.println("----Recognizing content ----");
        System.out.printf("Has width: %f and height: %f, measured with unit: %s.%n", formPage.getWidth(),
            formPage.getHeight(),
            formPage.getUnit());
        formPage.getTables().forEach(formTable -> {
            System.out.printf("Table has %d rows and %d columns.%n", formTable.getRowCount(),
                formTable.getColumnCount());
            formTable.getCells().forEach(formTableCell -> {
                System.out.printf("Cell has text %s.%n", formTableCell.getText());
            });
            System.out.println();
        });
    });
}
```

### Output

```console
Get form content...
----Recognizing content ----
Has width: 8.500000 and height: 11.000000, measured with unit: inch.
Table has 2 rows and 6 columns.
Cell has text Invoice Number.

Cell has text 3/28/2018.
Cell has text 4/16/2018.
Cell has text $89,024.34.
Cell has text ET.
```

## Recognize receipts

This section demonstrates how to recognize and extract common fields from US receipts, using a pre-trained receipt model.

To recognize receipts from a URI, use the **beginRecognizeReceiptsFromUrl** method. The returned value is a collection of **RecognizedReceipt** objects: one for each page in the submitted document.

```java
private static void AnalyzeReceipt(
    FormRecognizerClient recognizerClient, String receiptUri)
{
    SyncPoller<FormRecognizerOperationResult, List<RecognizedForm>> syncPoller =
    recognizerClient.beginRecognizeReceiptsFromUrl(receiptUri);
    List<RecognizedForm> receiptPageResults = syncPoller.getFinalResult();
```

The next block of code iterates through the receipts and prints their details to the console.

```java
    for (int i = 0; i < receiptPageResults.size(); i++) {
        RecognizedForm recognizedForm = receiptPageResults.get(i);
        Map<String, FormField> recognizedFields = recognizedForm.getFields();
        System.out.printf("----------- Recognized Receipt page %d -----------%n", i);
        FormField merchantNameField = recognizedFields.get("MerchantName");
        if (merchantNameField != null) {
            if (FieldValueType.STRING == merchantNameField.getValue().getValueType()) {
                String merchantName = merchantNameField.getValue().asString();
                System.out.printf("Merchant Name: %s, confidence: %.2f%n",
                    merchantName, merchantNameField.getConfidence());
            }
        }
        FormField merchantAddressField = recognizedFields.get("MerchantAddress");
        if (merchantAddressField != null) {
            if (FieldValueType.STRING == merchantAddressField.getValue().getValueType()) {
                String merchantAddress = merchantAddressField.getValue().asString();
                System.out.printf("Merchant Address: %s, confidence: %.2f%n",
                    merchantAddress, merchantAddressField.getConfidence());
            }
        }
        FormField transactionDateField = recognizedFields.get("TransactionDate");
        if (transactionDateField != null) {
            if (FieldValueType.DATE == transactionDateField.getValue().getValueType()) {
                LocalDate transactionDate = transactionDateField.getValue().asDate();
                System.out.printf("Transaction Date: %s, confidence: %.2f%n",
                    transactionDate, transactionDateField.getConfidence());
            }
        }
```
The next block of code iterates through the individual items detected on the receipt and prints their details to the console.

```java
        FormField receiptItemsField = recognizedFields.get("Items");
        if (receiptItemsField != null) {
            System.out.printf("Receipt Items: %n");
            if (FieldValueType.LIST == receiptItemsField.getValue().getValueType()) {
                List<FormField> receiptItems = receiptItemsField.getValue().asList();
                receiptItems.stream()
                    .filter(receiptItem -> FieldValueType.MAP == receiptItem.getValue().getValueType())
                    .map(formField -> formField.getValue().asMap())
                    .forEach(formFieldMap -> formFieldMap.forEach((key, formField) -> {
                        if ("Name".equals(key)) {
                            if (FieldValueType.STRING == formField.getValue().getValueType()) {
                                String name = formField.getValue().asString();
                                System.out.printf("Name: %s, confidence: %.2fs%n",
                                    name, formField.getConfidence());
                            }
                        }
                        if ("Quantity".equals(key)) {
                            if (FieldValueType.FLOAT == formField.getValue().getValueType()) {
                                Float quantity = formField.getValue().asFloat();
                                System.out.printf("Quantity: %f, confidence: %.2f%n",
                                    quantity, formField.getConfidence());
                            }
                        }
                        if ("Price".equals(key)) {
                            if (FieldValueType.FLOAT == formField.getValue().getValueType()) {
                                Float price = formField.getValue().asFloat();
                                System.out.printf("Price: %f, confidence: %.2f%n",
                                    price, formField.getConfidence());
                            }
                        }
                        if ("TotalPrice".equals(key)) {
                            if (FieldValueType.FLOAT == formField.getValue().getValueType()) {
                                Float totalPrice = formField.getValue().asFloat();
                                System.out.printf("Total Price: %f, confidence: %.2f%n",
                                    totalPrice, formField.getConfidence());
                            }
                        }
                }));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Train a custom model

This section demonstrates how to train a model with your own data. A trained model can output structured data that includes the key/value relationships in the original form document. After you train the model, you can test and retrain it and eventually use it to reliably extract data from more forms according to your needs.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also train models with a graphical user interface such as the [Form Recognizer sample labeling tool](../../quickstarts/label-tool.md).

### Train a model without labels

Train custom models to recognize all fields and values found in your custom forms without manually labeling the training documents.

The following method trains a model on a given set of documents and prints the model's status to the console. 

```java
private static String TrainModel(
    FormTrainingClient trainingClient, String trainingDataUrl)
{
    SyncPoller<FormRecognizerOperationResult, CustomFormModel> trainingPoller =
        trainingClient.beginTraining(trainingDataUrl, false);
    
    CustomFormModel customFormModel = trainingPoller.getFinalResult();
    
    // Model Info
    System.out.printf("Model Id: %s%n", customFormModel.getModelId());
    System.out.printf("Model Status: %s%n", customFormModel.getModelStatus());
    System.out.printf("Training started on: %s%n", customFormModel.getTrainingStartedOn());
    System.out.printf("Training completed on: %s%n%n", customFormModel.getTrainingCompletedOn());
```
The returned **CustomFormModel** object contains information on the form types the model can recognize and the fields it can extract from each form type. The following code block prints this information to the console.

```java 
    System.out.println("Recognized Fields:");
    // looping through the subModels, which contains the fields they were trained on
    // Since the given training documents are unlabeled, we still group them but they do not have a label.
    customFormModel.getSubmodels().forEach(customFormSubmodel -> {
        // Since the training data is unlabeled, we are unable to return the accuracy of this model
        System.out.printf("The subModel has form type %s%n", customFormSubmodel.getFormType());
        customFormSubmodel.getFields().forEach((field, customFormModelField) ->
            System.out.printf("The model found field '%s' with label: %s%n",
                field, customFormModelField.getLabel()));
    });
```

Finally, this method returns the unique ID of the model.

```java
    return customFormModel.getModelId();
}
```

### Output

```console
Train Model with training data...
Model Id: 20c3544d-97b4-49d9-b39b-dc32d85f1358
Model Status: ready
Training started on: 2020-08-31T16:52:09Z
Training completed on: 2020-08-31T16:52:23Z

Recognized Fields:
The subModel has form type form-0
The model found field 'field-0' with label: Address:
The model found field 'field-1' with label: Charges
The model found field 'field-2' with label: Invoice Date
The model found field 'field-3' with label: Invoice Due Date
The model found field 'field-4' with label: Invoice For:
The model found field 'field-5' with label: Invoice Number
The model found field 'field-6' with label: VAT ID
```

### Train a model with labels

You can also train custom models by manually labeling the training documents. Training with labels leads to better performance in some scenarios. To train with labels, you need to have special label information files (*\<filename\>.pdf.labels.json*) in your blob storage container alongside the training documents. The [Form Recognizer sample labeling tool](../../quickstarts/label-tool.md) provides a UI to help you create these label files. Once you have them, you can call the **beginTraining** method with the *useTrainingLabels* parameter set to `true`.

```java
private static String TrainModelWithLabels(
    FormTrainingClient trainingClient, String trainingDataUrl)
{
    // Train custom model
    String trainingSetSource = trainingDataUrl;
    SyncPoller<FormRecognizerOperationResult, CustomFormModel> trainingPoller = trainingClient.beginTraining(trainingSetSource, true);

    CustomFormModel customFormModel = trainingPoller.getFinalResult();

    // Model Info
    System.out.printf("Model Id: %s%n", customFormModel.getModelId());
    System.out.printf("Model Status: %s%n", customFormModel.getModelStatus());
    System.out.printf("Training started on: %s%n", customFormModel.getTrainingStartedOn());
    System.out.printf("Training completed on: %s%n%n", customFormModel.getTrainingCompletedOn());
```

The returned **CustomFormModel** indicates the fields the model can extract, along with its estimated accuracy in each field. The following code block prints this information to the console.

```java
    // looping through the subModels, which contains the fields they were trained on
    // The labels are based on the ones you gave the training document.
    System.out.println("Recognized Fields:");
    // Since the data is labeled, we are able to return the accuracy of the model
    customFormModel.getSubmodels().forEach(customFormSubmodel -> {
        System.out.printf("The subModel with form type %s has accuracy: %.2f%n",
            customFormSubmodel.getFormType(), customFormSubmodel.getAccuracy());
        customFormSubmodel.getFields().forEach((label, customFormModelField) ->
            System.out.printf("The model found field '%s' to have name: %s with an accuracy: %.2f%n",
                label, customFormModelField.getName(), customFormModelField.getAccuracy()));
    });
    return customFormModel.getModelId();
}
```

### Output

```console
Train Model with training data...
Model Id: 20c3544d-97b4-49d9-b39b-dc32d85f1358
Model Status: ready
Training started on: 2020-08-31T16:52:09Z
Training completed on: 2020-08-31T16:52:23Z

Recognized Fields:
The subModel has form type form-0
The model found field 'field-0' with label: Address:
The model found field 'field-1' with label: Charges
The model found field 'field-2' with label: Invoice Date
The model found field 'field-3' with label: Invoice Due Date
The model found field 'field-4' with label: Invoice For:
The model found field 'field-5' with label: Invoice Number
The model found field 'field-6' with label: VAT ID
```

## Analyze forms with a custom model

This section demonstrates how to extract key/value information and other content from your custom form types, using models you trained with your own forms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to implement this scenario, you must have already trained a model so you can pass its ID into the method below. See the [Train a model](#train-a-model-without-labels) section.

You'll use the **beginRecognizeCustomFormsFromUrl** method. The returned value is a collection of **RecognizedForm** objects: one for each page in the submitted document.

```java
// Analyze PDF form data
private static void AnalyzePdfForm(
    FormRecognizerClient formClient, String modelId, String pdfFormUrl)
{    
    SyncPoller<FormRecognizerOperationResult, List<RecognizedForm>> recognizeFormPoller =
    formClient.beginRecognizeCustomFormsFromUrl(modelId, pdfFormUrl);

    List<RecognizedForm> recognizedForms = recognizeFormPoller.getFinalResult();
```

The following code prints the analysis results to the console. It prints each recognized field and corresponding value, along with a confidence score.

```java
    for (int i = 0; i < recognizedForms.size(); i++) {
        final RecognizedForm form = recognizedForms.get(i);
        System.out.printf("----------- Recognized custom form info for page %d -----------%n", i);
        System.out.printf("Form type: %s%n", form.getFormType());
        form.getFields().forEach((label, formField) ->
            // label data is populated if you are using a model trained with unlabeled data,
            // since the service needs to make predictions for labels if not explicitly given to it.
            System.out.printf("Field '%s' has label '%s' with a confidence "
                + "score of %.2f.%n", label, formField.getLabelData().getText(), formField.getConfidence()));
    }
}
```

### Output

```console
Analyze PDF form...
----------- Recognized custom form info for page 0 -----------
Form type: form-0
Field 'field-0' has label 'Address:' with a confidence score of 0.91.
Field 'field-1' has label 'Invoice For:' with a confidence score of 1.00.
Field 'field-2' has label 'Invoice Number' with a confidence score of 1.00.
Field 'field-3' has label 'Invoice Date' with a confidence score of 1.00.
Field 'field-4' has label 'Invoice Due Date' with a confidence score of 1.00.
Field 'field-5' has label 'Charges' with a confidence score of 1.00.
Field 'field-6' has label 'VAT ID' with a confidence score of 1.00.
```


## Manage custom models

This section demonstrates how to manage the custom models stored in your account. The following code does all of the model management tasks in a single method, as an example. Start by copying the method signature below:

```java
private static void ManageModels(
    FormTrainingClient trainingClient, String trainingFileUrl)
{
```

### Check the number of models in the FormRecognizer resource account

The following code block checks how many models you have saved in your Form Recognizer account and compares it to the account limit.

```java
    AtomicReference<String> modelId = new AtomicReference<>();

    // First, we see how many custom models we have, and what our limit is
    AccountProperties accountProperties = trainingClient.getAccountProperties();
    System.out.printf("The account has %s custom models, and we can have at most %s custom models",
        accountProperties.getCustomModelCount(), accountProperties.getCustomModelLimit());
```

#### Output 

```console
The account has 12 custom models, and we can have at most 250 custom models
```

### List the models currently stored in the resource account

The following code block lists the current models in your account and prints their details to the console.

```java    
    // Next, we get a paged list of all of our custom models
    PagedIterable<CustomFormModelInfo> customModels = trainingClient.listCustomModels();
    System.out.println("We have following models in the account:");
    customModels.forEach(customFormModelInfo -> {
        System.out.printf("Model Id: %s%n", customFormModelInfo.getModelId());
        // get custom model info
        modelId.set(customFormModelInfo.getModelId());
        CustomFormModel customModel = trainingClient.getCustomModel(customFormModelInfo.getModelId());
        System.out.printf("Model Id: %s%n", customModel.getModelId());
        System.out.printf("Model Status: %s%n", customModel.getModelStatus());
        System.out.printf("Training started on: %s%n", customModel.getTrainingStartedOn());
        System.out.printf("Training completed on: %s%n", customModel.getTrainingCompletedOn());
        customModel.getSubmodels().forEach(customFormSubmodel -> {
            System.out.printf("Custom Model Form type: %s%n", customFormSubmodel.getFormType());
            System.out.printf("Custom Model Accuracy: %.2f%n", customFormSubmodel.getAccuracy());
            if (customFormSubmodel.getFields() != null) {
                customFormSubmodel.getFields().forEach((fieldText, customFormModelField) -> {
                    System.out.printf("Field Text: %s%n", fieldText);
                    System.out.printf("Field Accuracy: %.2f%n", customFormModelField.getAccuracy());
                });
            }
        });
    });
```

#### Output 

This response has been truncated for readability.

```console
We have following models in the account:
Model Id: 0b048b60-86cc-47ec-9782-ad0ffaf7a5ce
Model Id: 0b048b60-86cc-47ec-9782-ad0ffaf7a5ce
Model Status: ready
Training started on: 2020-06-04T18:33:08Z
Training completed on: 2020-06-04T18:33:10Z
Custom Model Form type: form-0b048b60-86cc-47ec-9782-ad0ffaf7a5ce
Custom Model Accuracy: 1.00
Field Text: invoice date
Field Accuracy: 1.00
Field Text: invoice number
Field Accuracy: 1.00
...
```

### Delete a model from the resource account

You can also delete a model from your account by referencing its ID.

```java
    // Delete Custom Model
    System.out.printf("Deleted model with model Id: %s, operation completed with status: %s%n", modelId.get(),
    trainingClient.deleteModelWithResponse(modelId.get(), Context.NONE).getStatusCode());
}
```


## Run the application

Navigate back to your main project directory. Then, build the app with the following command:

```console
gradle build
```

Run the application with the `run` goal:

```console
gradle run
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Portal](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md#clean-up-resources)
* [Azure CLI](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md#clean-up-resources)

## Troubleshooting

From Recognizer clients raise `ErrorResponseException` exceptions. For example, if you try to provide an invalid file source URL an `ErrorResponseException` would be raised with an error indicating the failure cause. In the following code snippet, the error is handled gracefully by catching the exception and display the additional information about the error.

```java Snippet:FormRecognizerBadRequest
try {
    formRecognizerClient.beginRecognizeContentFromUrl("invalidSourceUrl");
} catch (ErrorResponseException e) {
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}
```

### Enable client logging

Azure SDKs for Java offer a consistent logging story to help aid in troubleshooting application errors and speeding up their resolution. The logs produced will capture the flow of an application before reaching the terminal state to help locate the root issue. View the [logging wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/wiki/Logging-with-Azure-SDK) for guidance about enabling logging.
