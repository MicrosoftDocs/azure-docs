#Customer intent: As a developer or data scientist familiar with Python, I want to learn how to use a prebuilt Form Recognizer model to extract my receipt data.

# Quickstart: Extract receipt data using the Form Recognizer REST API with Python

In this quickstart, you'll use the Azure Form Recognizer REST API with Python to extract and identify relevant information in USA sales receipts.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you must have:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed (if you want to run the sample locally).
- A URL for an image of a receipt. You can use a [sample image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/master/curl/form-recognizer/contoso-allinone.jpg) for this quickstart.

> [!NOTE]
> This quickstart uses a remote receipt accessed by URL. To use local files instead, see the [reference documentation](https://westus2.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-preview/operations/AnalyzeReceiptAsync).

## Create a Form Recognizer resource

[!INCLUDE [create resource](../includes/create-resource.md)]

## Analyze a receipt

To start analyzing a receipt, you call the **[Analyze Receipt](https://westus2.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-preview/operations/AnalyzeReceiptAsync)** API using the Python script below. Before you run the script, make these changes:

1. Replace `<Endpoint>` with the endpoint that you obtained with your Form Recognizer subscription.
1. Replace `<your receipt URL>` with the URL address of a receipt image.
1. Replace `<subscription key>` with the subscription key you copied from the previous step.

    ```python
    ########### Python Form Recognizer Async Receipt #############

    import json
    import time
    from requests import get, post
    
    # Endpoint URL
    endpoint = r"<Endpoint>"
    apim_key = "<subscription key>"
    post_url = endpoint + "/formrecognizer/v2.0/prebuilt/receipt/analyze"
    source = r"<path to your receipt>"
    
    headers = {
        # Request headers
        'Content-Type': '<file type>',
        'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': apim_key,
    }
    
    params = {
        "includeTextDetails": True
    }
    
    with open(source, "rb") as f:
        data_bytes = f.read()
    
    try:
        resp = post(url = post_url, data = data_bytes, headers = headers, params = params)
        if resp.status_code != 202:
            print("POST analyze failed:\n%s" % resp.text)
            quit()
        print("POST analyze succeeded:\n%s" % resp.headers)
        get_url = resp.headers["operation-location"]
    except Exception as e:
        print("POST analyze failed:\n%s" % str(e))
        quit()
    ```

1. Save the code in a file with a .py extension. For example, *form-recognizer-receipts.py*.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `python` command to run the sample. For example, `python form-recognizer-receipts.py`.

You'll receive a `202 (Success)` response that includes an **Operation-Location** header, which the script will print to the console. This header contains an operation ID that you can use to query the status of the asynchronous operation and get the results. In the following example value, the string after `operations/` is the operation ID.

```console
https://cognitiveservice/formrecognizer/v2.0/prebuilt/receipt/operations/54f0b076-4e38-43e5-81bd-b85b8835fdfb
```

## Get the receipt results

After you've called the **Analyze Receipt** API, you call the **[Get Analyze Receipt Result](https://westus2.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-preview/operations/GetAnalyzeReceiptResult)** API to get the status of the operation and the extracted data. Add the following code to the bottom of your Python script. This uses the operation ID value in a new API call. This script calls the API at regular intervals until the results are available. We recommend an interval of one second or more.

```python
n_tries = 10
n_try = 0
wait_sec = 6
while n_try < n_tries:
    try:
        resp = get(url = get_url, headers = {"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key": apim_key})
        resp_json = json.loads(resp.text)
        if resp.status_code != 200:
            print("GET Receipt results failed:\n%s" % resp_json)
            quit()
        status = resp_json["status"]
        if status == "succeeded":
            print("Receipt Analysis succeeded:\n%s" % resp_json)
            quit()
        if status == "failed":
            print("Analysis failed:\n%s" % resp_json)
            quit()
        # Analysis still running. Wait and retry.
        time.sleep(wait_sec)
        n_try += 1     
    except Exception as e:
        msg = "GET analyze results failed:\n%s" % str(e)
        print(msg)
        quit()
```

1. Save the script.
1. Again use the `python` command to run the sample. For example, `python form-recognizer-receipts.py`.

### Examine the response

The script will print responses to the console until the **Analyze Receipt** operation completes. Then, it will print the extracted text data in JSON format. The `"recognitionResults"` field contains every line of text that was extracted from the receipt, and the `"understandingResults"` field contains key/value information for the most relevant parts of the receipt.

See the following receipt image and its corresponding JSON output. The output has been shortened for readability.

![A receipt from Contoso store](../media/contoso-allinone.jpg)

The `"recognitionResults"` node contains all of the recognized text. Text is organized by page, then by line, then by individual words. The `"understandingResults"` node contains the receipt-specific values that the model discovered. This is where you'll find useful key/value pairs like the tax, total, merchant address, and so on.
