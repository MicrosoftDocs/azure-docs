# Quickstart: Train a Form Recognizer model and extract form data by using the REST API with Python

In this quickstart, you'll use the Azure Form Recognizer REST API with Python to train and score forms to extract key-value pairs and tables.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites
To complete this quickstart, you must have:
- Access to the Form Recognizer limited-access preview. To get access to the preview, fill out and submit the [Form Recognizer access request](https://aka.ms/FormRecognizerRequestAccess) form.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed (if you want to run the sample locally).
- A set of at least five forms of the same type. You will use this data to train the model. You can use a [sample dataset](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090451) for this quickstart. Upload the data to the root of an Azure Blob Storage account.

## Create a Form Recognizer resource

When you are granted access to use Form Recognizer, you'll receive a Welcome email with several links and resources. Use the "Azure portal" link in that message to open the Azure portal and create a Form Recognizer resource. In the **Create** pane, provide the following information:

|    |    |
|--|--|
| **Name** | A descriptive name for your resource. We recommend using a descriptive name, for example *MyNameFormRecognizer*. |
| **Subscription** | Select the Azure subscription which has been granted access. |
| **Location** | The location of your cognitive service instance. Different locations may introduce latency, but have no impact on the runtime availability of your resource. |
| **Pricing tier** | The cost of your resource depends on the pricing tier you choose and your usage. For more information, see the API [pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/).
| **Resource group** | The [Azure resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/governance/resource-consistency/azure-resource-access#what-is-an-azure-resource-group) that will contain your resource. You can create a new group or add it to a pre-existing group. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Normally when you create a Cognitive Service resource in the Azure portal, you have the option to create a multi-service subscription key (used across multiple cognitive services) or a single-service subscription key (used only with a specific cognitive service). However, because Form Recognizer is a preview release, it is not included in the multi-service subscription, and you cannot create the single-service subscription unless you use the link provided in the Welcome email.

When your Form Recognizer resource finishes deploying, find and select it from the **All resources** list in the portal. Then select the **Keys** tab to view your subscription keys. Either key will give your app access to the resource. Copy the value of **KEY 1**. You will use it in the next section.

## Train a Form Recognizer model

First, you'll need a set of training data in an Azure Storage blob. You should have a minimum of five sample forms (PDF documents and/or images) of the same type/structure as your main input data. Or, you can use a single empty form with two filled-in forms. The empty form's file name needs to include the word "empty."

To train a Form Recognizer model by using the documents in your Azure blob container, call the **Train** API by running the python code that follows. Before you run the code, make these changes:

1. Replace `<Endpoint>` with the endpoint URL for the Form Recognizer resource in the Azure region where you obtained your subscription keys.
1. Replace `<SAS URL>` with an Azure Blob storage container shared access signature (SAS) URL of the location of the training data.  
1. Replace `<Subscription key>` with the subscription key you copied from the previous step.
    ```python
    ########### Python Form Recognizer Train #############
    from requests import post as http_post

    # Endpoint URL
    base_url = r"<Endpoint>" + "/formrecognizer/v1.0-preview/custom"
    source = r"<SAS URL>"
    headers = {
        # Request headers
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': '<Subscription Key>',
    }
    url = base_url + "/train" 
    body = {"source": source}
    try:
        resp = http_post(url = url, json = body, headers = headers)
        print("Response status code: %d" % resp.status_code)
        print("Response body: %s" % resp.json())
    except Exception as e:
        print(str(e))
    ```
1. Save the code in a file with a .py extension. For example, *form-recognize-train.py*.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `python` command to run the sample. For example, `python form-recognize-train.py`.

You'll receive a `200 (Success)` response with this JSON output:

```json
{
  "modelId": "59e2185e-ab80-4640-aebc-f3653442617b",
  "trainingDocuments": [
    {
      "documentName": "Invoice_1.pdf",
      "pages": 1,
      "errors": [],
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "documentName": "Invoice_2.pdf",
      "pages": 1,
      "errors": [],
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "documentName": "Invoice_3.pdf",
      "pages": 1,
      "errors": [],
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "documentName": "Invoice_4.pdf",
      "pages": 1,
      "errors": [],
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "documentName": "Invoice_5.pdf",
      "pages": 1,
      "errors": [],
      "status": "success"
    }
  ],
  "errors": []
}
```

Note the `"modelId"` value. You'll need it for the following steps.
  
## Extract key-value pairs and tables from forms

Next, you'll analyze a document and extract key-value pairs and tables from it. Call the **Model - Analyze** API by running the Python script that follows. Before you run the command, make these changes:

1. Replace `<Endpoint>` with the endpoint that you obtained with your Form Recognizer subscription key. You can find it on your Form Recognizer resource **Overview** tab.
1. Replace `<File Path>` with the file path or URL of the location of the form from which to extract data.
1. Replace `<modelID>` with the model ID you received in the previous section.
1. Replace `<file type>` with the file type. Supported types: pdf, image/jpeg, image/png.
1. Replace `<subscription key>` with your subscription key.

    ```python
    ########### Python Form Recognizer Analyze #############
    from requests import post as http_post
    
    # Endpoint URL
    base_url = r"<Endpoint>" + "/formrecognizer/v1.0-preview/custom"
    file_path = r"<File Path>"
    model_id = "<modelID>"
    headers = {
        # Request headers
        'Content-Type': 'application/<file type>',
        'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': '<subscription key>',
    }

    try:
        url = base_url + "/models/" + model_id + "/analyze" 
        with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
            data_bytes = f.read()  
        resp = http_post(url = url, data = data_bytes, headers = headers)
        print("Response status code: %d" % resp.status_code)    
        print("Response body:\n%s" % resp.json())   
    except Exception as e:
        print(str(e))
    ```

1. Save the code in a file with a .py extension. For example, *form-recognize-analyze.py*.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `python` command to run the sample. For example, `python form-recognize-analyze.py`.

### Examine the response

A success response is returned in JSON. It represents the key-value pairs and tables extracted from the form:
