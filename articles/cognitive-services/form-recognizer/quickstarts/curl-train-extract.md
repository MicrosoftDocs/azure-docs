# Quickstart: Train a Form Recognizer model and extract form data by using the REST API with cURL

In this quickstart, you'll use the Azure Form Recognizer REST API with cURL to train and score forms to extract key-value pairs and tables.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you must have:
- [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/windows/) installed.
- A set of at least six forms of the same type. You will use five of these to train the model, and then you'll test it with the sixth form. Your forms can be of different file types but must be the same type of document. You can use a [sample data set](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090451) for this quickstart. Upload the training files to the root of a blob storage container in an Azure Storage account. You can put the testing files in a separate folder.

## Create a Form Recognizer resource

[!INCLUDE [create resource](../includes/create-resource.md)]

## Train a Form Recognizer model

First, you'll need a set of training data in an Azure Storage blob. You should have a minimum of five filled-in forms (PDF documents and/or images) of the same type/structure as your main input data. Or, you can use a single empty form with two filled-in forms. The empty form's file name needs to include the word "empty." See [Build a training data set for a custom model](../build-training-data-set.md) for tips and options for putting together your training data.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the labeled data feature to manually label some or all of your training data beforehand. This is a more complex process but results in a better trained model. See the [Train with labels](../overview.md#train-with-labels) section of the overview to learn more about this feature.

To train a Form Recognizer model with the documents in your Azure blob container, call the **[Train Custom Model](https://westus2.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-preview/operations/TrainCustomModelAsync)** API by running the following cURL command. Before you run the command, make these changes:

1. Replace `<Endpoint>` with the endpoint that you obtained with your Form Recognizer subscription.
1. Replace `<subscription key>` with the subscription key you copied from the previous step.
1. Replace `<SAS URL>` with the Azure Blob storage container's shared access signature (SAS) URL. To retrieve the SAS URL, open the Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer, right-click your container, and select **Get shared access signature**. Make sure the **Read** and **List** permissions are checked, and click **Create**. Then copy the value in the **URL** section. It should have the form: `https://<storage account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container name>?<SAS value>`.

```bash
curl -i -X POST "https://<Endpoint>/formrecognizer/v2.0/custom/models" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <subscription key>" --data-ascii "{ \"source\": \""<SAS URL>"\"}"
```

You'll receive a `201 (Success)` response with a **Location** header. The value of this header is the ID of the new model being trained. 

## Get training results

After you've started the train operation, you use a new operation, **[Get Custom Model](https://westus2.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-preview/operations/GetCustomModel)** to check the training status. Pass the model ID into this API call to check the training status:

1. Replace `<Endpoint>` with the endpoint that you obtained with your Form Recognizer subscription key.
1. Replace `<subscription key>` with your subscription key
1. Replace `<model ID>` with the model ID you received in the previous step

```bash
curl -X GET "https://<Endpoint>/formrecognizer/v2.0/custom/models/<model ID>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <subscription key>"
```

You'll receive a `200 (Success)` response with a JSON body in the following format. Notice the `"status"` field. This will have the value `"ready"` once training is complete. If the model is not finished training, you'll need to query the service again by rerunning the command. We recommend an interval of one second or more between calls.

The `"modelId"` field contains the ID of the model you're training. You'll need this for the next step.
    
```json
{ 
  "modelInfo":{ 
    "status":"ready",
    "createdDateTime":"2019-10-08T10:20:31.957784",
    "lastUpdatedDateTime":"2019-10-08T14:20:41+00:00",
    "modelId":"1cfb372bab404ba3aa59481ab2c63da5"
  },
  "trainResult":{ 
    "trainingDocuments":[ 
      { 
        "documentName":"invoices\\Invoice_1.pdf",
        "pages":1,
        "errors":[ 

        ],
        "status":"succeeded"
      },
      { 
        "documentName":"invoices\\Invoice_2.pdf",
        "pages":1,
        "errors":[ 

        ],
        "status":"succeeded"
      },
      { 
        "documentName":"invoices\\Invoice_3.pdf",
        "pages":1,
        "errors":[ 

        ],
        "status":"succeeded"
      },
      { 
        "documentName":"invoices\\Invoice_4.pdf",
        "pages":1,
        "errors":[ 

        ],
        "status":"succeeded"
      },
      { 
        "documentName":"invoices\\Invoice_5.pdf",
        "pages":1,
        "errors":[ 

        ],
        "status":"succeeded"
      }
    ],
    "errors":[ 

    ]
  },
  "keys":{ 
    "0":[ 
      "Address:",
      "Invoice For:",
      "Microsoft",
      "Page"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Analyze forms for key-value pairs and tables

Next, you'll use your newly trained model to analyze a document and extract key-value pairs and tables from it. Call the **[Analyze Form](https://westus2.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-preview/operations/AnalyzeWithCustomForm)** API by running the following cURL command. Before you run the command, make these changes:

1. Replace `<Endpoint>` with the endpoint that you obtained from your Form Recognizer subscription key. You can find it on your Form Recognizer resource **Overview** tab.
1. Replace `<model ID>` with the model ID that you received in the previous section.
1. Replace `<SAS URL>` with an SAS URL to your file in Azure storage. Follow the steps in the Training section, but instead of getting a SAS URL for the whole blob container, get one for the specific file you want to analyze.
1. Replace `<subscription key>` with your subscription key.

```bash
curl -v "https://<Endpoint>/formrecognizer/v2.0/custom/models/<model ID>/analyze" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <subscription key>" -d "{ \"source\": \""<SAS URL>"\" } "
```

You'll receive a `202 (Success)` response with an **Operation-Location** header. The value of this header includes a results ID you use to track the results of the Analyze operation. Save this results ID for the next step.

## Get the Analyze results

Use the following API to query the results of the Analyze operation.

1. Replace `<Endpoint>` with the endpoint that you obtained from your Form Recognizer subscription key. You can find it on your Form Recognizer resource **Overview** tab.
1. Replace `<result ID>` with the ID that you received in the previous section.
1. Replace `<subscription key>` with your subscription key.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://<Endpoint>/formrecognizer/v2.0/custom/models/<model ID>/analyzeResults/<result ID>" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <subscription key>"
```

You'll receive a `200 (Success)` response with a JSON body in the following format. The output has been shortened for simplicity. Notice the `"status"` field near the bottom. This will have the value `"succeeded"` when the Analyze operation is complete. If the Analyze operation hasn't completed, you'll need to query the service again by rerunning the command. We recommend an interval of one second or more between calls.

The main key/value pair associations and tables are in the `"pageResults"` node. If you also specified plain text extraction through the *includeTextDetails* URL parameter, then the `"readResults"` node will show the content and positions of all the text in the document.

```json
{
  "analyzeResult":{ 
    "readResults":[ 
      { 
        "page":1,
        "width":8.5,
