# Quickstart: Train a Form Recognizer model and extract form data by using the REST API with cURL

In this quickstart, you'll use the Azure Form Recognizer REST API with cURL to train and score forms to extract key-value pairs and tables.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites
To complete this quickstart, you must have:
- Access to the Form Recognizer limited-access preview. To get access to the preview, fill out and submit the [Form Recognizer access request](https://aka.ms/FormRecognizerRequestAccess) form.
- [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/windows/) installed.
- A set of at least five forms of the same type. You will use this data to train the model. You can use a [sample data set](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090451) for this quickstart. Upload the data to the root of an Azure Blob Storage account.

## Create a Form Recognizer resource

[!INCLUDE [create resource](../includes/create-resource.md)]

## Train a Form Recognizer model

First, you'll need a set of training data in an Azure Storage blob. You should have a minimum of five filled-in forms (PDF documents and/or images) of the same type/structure as your main input data. Or, you can use a single empty form with two filled-in forms. The empty form's file name needs to include the word "empty." See [Build a training data set for a custom model](../build-training-data-set.md) for tips and options for putting together your training data.

To train a Form Recognizer model with the documents in your Azure blob container, call the **Train** API by running the following cURL command. Before you run the command, make these changes:

1. Replace `<Endpoint>` with the endpoint that you obtained from your Form Recognizer subscription key. You can find it on your Form Recognizer resource **Overview** tab.
1. Replace `<subscription key>` with the subscription key you copied from the previous step.
1. Replace `<SAS URL>` with the Azure Blob storage container's shared access signature (SAS) URL. To retrieve the SAS URL, open the Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer, right-click your container, and select **Get shared access signature**. Make sure the **Read** and **List** permissions are checked, and click **Create**. Then copy the value in the **URL** section. It should have the form: `https://<storage account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container name>?<SAS value>`.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<Endpoint>/formrecognizer/v1.0-preview/custom/train" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <subscription key>" --data-ascii "{ \"source\": \""<SAS URL>"\"}"
```

You'll receive a `200 (Success)` response with the following JSON output:

```json
{
  "modelId": "59e2185e-ab80-4640-aebc-f3653442617b",
  "trainingDocuments": [
    {
      "documentName": "Invoice_1.pdf",
      "pages": 1,
      "errors": [],
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "documentName": "Invoice_2.pdf",
      "pages": 1,
      "errors": [],
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "documentName": "Invoice_3.pdf",
      "pages": 1,
      "errors": [],
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "documentName": "Invoice_4.pdf",
      "pages": 1,
      "errors": [],
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "documentName": "Invoice_5.pdf",
      "pages": 1,
      "errors": [],
      "status": "success"
    }
  ],
  "errors": []
}
```

Note the `"modelId"` value. You'll need it in the following steps.
  
## Extract key-value pairs and tables from forms

Next, you'll analyze a document and extract key-value pairs and tables from it. Call the **Model - Analyze** API by running the cURL command that follows. Before you run the command, make these changes:

1. Replace `<Endpoint>` with the endpoint that you obtained from your Form Recognizer subscription key. You can find it on your Form Recognizer resource **Overview** tab.
1. Replace `<modelID>` with the model ID that you received in the previous section.
1. Replace `<path to your form>` with the file path of your form (for example, C:\temp\file.pdf).
1. Replace `<file type>` with the file type. Supported types: `application/pdf`, `image/jpeg`, `image/png`.
1. Replace `<subscription key>` with your subscription key.


```bash
curl -X POST "https://<Endpoint>/formrecognizer/v1.0-preview/custom/models/<modelID>/analyze" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "form=@\"<path to your form>\";type=<file type>" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <subscription key>"
```

### Examine the response

A success response is returned in JSON. It represents the key-value pairs and tables extracted from the form:
