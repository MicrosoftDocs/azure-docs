# What is Project Answer Search?
Project Answer Search API uses the Bing v7 endpoint to get answers to interrogative queries. A question such as "What is the circumference of the earth?" returns an answer with factual information.  A query for a person, place, or thing returns information about the entity identified by the query. These scenarios can be useful in applications such as conversational bots, messaging apps, readers, etc.  

Queries return responses that depend on the query scenario: webpages are always returned, while [facts](fact-queries.md) and/or [entities](entity-queries.md) are returned if relevant.

## Endpoint
To get answers to a question or information about a person, place, or thing, send a request to the Answer Search API endpoint. Use the headers and URL parameters for various specifications.  Include *Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key* header with a valid token.  The market parameter is required. Only `en-us` market is currently supported.

The following query gets answers to the question: "What is the circumference of the earth?"

GET:
````
https://api.labs.cognitive.microsoft.com/answerSearch/v7.0/search?q=what+is+circumference+of+the=earth?&mkt=en-us

````

The URL parameter `q=` is required to specify the object of search.

## Response object

The response includes HTTP headers, webpages, facts, and/or entities.

## Terms of use
Project Answer Search and Project Video Trends are subject to the [Bing Search Use and Display Requirements](use-display-requirements.md).

You, or a third party on your behalf, may not use, retain, store, cache, share, or distribute any data from the URL Preview API for the purpose of testing, developing, training, distributing or making available any non-Microsoft service or feature. 

## Throttling requests

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-bing-throttling-requests](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-bing-throttling-requests.md)]


## Data attribution  

Project Answer Search responses contain information owned by third parties. You are responsible to ensure your use is appropriate, for example by complying with any creative commons license your user experience may rely on.  
  
If an answer or result includes the `contractualRules`, `attributions`, or `provider` fields, you must attribute the data. If the answer does not include any of these fields, no attribution is required. If the answer includes the `contractualRules` field and the `attributions` and/or `provider` fields, you must use the contractual rules to attribute the data.  
  
The following example shows an entity that includes a MediaAttribution contractual rule and an Image that includes a `provider` field. The MediaAttribution rule identifies the image as the target of the rule, so you'd ignore the image's `provider` field and instead use the MediaAttribution rule to provide attribution.  
  
```  
        "value" : [{
            "contractualRules" : [
                . . .
                {
                    "_type" : "ContractualRules\/MediaAttribution",
                    "targetPropertyName" : "image",
                    "mustBeCloseToContent" : true,
                    "url" : "http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Space_Needle"
                }
            ],
            . . .
            "image" : {
                "name" : "Space Needle",
                "thumbnailUrl" : "https:\/\/www.bing.com\/th?id=A46378861201...",
                "provider" : [{
                    "_type" : "Organization",
                    "url" : "http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Space_Needle"
                }],
                "hostPageUrl" : "http:\/\/www.citydictionary.com\/Uploaded...",
                "width" : 110,
                "height" : 110
            },
            . . .
        }]
```  
  
If a contractual rule includes the `targetPropertyName` field, the rule applies only to the targeted field. Otherwise, the rule applies to the parent object that contains the `contractualRules` field.  
  
  
In the following example, the `LinkAttribution` rule includes the `targetPropertyName` field, so the rule applies to the `description` field. For rules that apply to specific fields, you must include a line immediately following the targeted data that contains a hyperlink to the provider's website. For example, to attribute the description, include a line immediately following the description text that contains a hyperlink to the data on the provider's website, in this case create a link to en.wikipedia.org.  
  
```  
"entities" : {  
    "value" : [{  
            . . .  
            "description" : "Peyton Williams Manning is a former American....",  
            . . .  
            "contractualRules" : [{  
                    "_type" : "ContractualRules\/LinkAttribution",  
                    "targetPropertyName" : "description",  
                    "mustBeCloseToContent" : true,  
                    "text" : "en.wikipedia.org",  
                    "url" : "http:\/\/www.bing.com\/cr?IG=B8AD73..."  
                 },  
            . . .  
  
```  

### License Attribution  

If the list of contractual rules includes a [LicenseAttribution](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-entities-api-v7-reference#licenseattribution) rule, you must display the notice on the line immediately following the content that the license applies to. The `LicenseAttribution` rule uses the `targetPropertyName` field to identify the property that the license applies to.  
  
The following shows an example that includes a `LicenseAttribution` rule.  
  
![License attribution](./media/licenseattribution.png)  
  
The license notice that you display must include a hyperlink to the website that contains information about the license. Typically, you make the name of the license a hyperlink. For example, if the notice is **Text under CC-BY-SA license** and CC-BY-SA is the name of the license, you would make CC-BY-SA a hyperlink.  
  
### Link and Text Attribution  

The [LinkAttribution](reference.md#linkattribution) and [TextAttribution](reference.md#textattribution) rules are typically used to identify the provider of the data. The `targetPropertyName` field identifies the field that the rule applies to.  
  
To attribute the providers, include a line immediately following the content that the attributions apply to (for example, the targeted field). The line should be clearly labeled to indicate that the providers are the source of the data. For example, "Data from: en.wikipedia.org". For `LinkAttribution` rules, you must create a hyperlink to the provider's website.  
  
The following shows an example that includes `LinkAttribution` and `TextAttribution` rules.  
  
![Link text attribution](./media/linktextattribution.png)  

### Media Attribution  

If the entity includes an image and you display it, you must provide a click-through link to the provider's website. If the entity includes a [MediaAttribution](reference.md#mediaattribution) rule, use the rule's URL to create the click-through link. Otherwise, use the URL included in the image's `provider` field to create the click-through link.  
  
The following shows an example that includes an image's `provider` field and contractual rules. Because the example includes the contractual rule, you will ignore the image's `provider` field and apply the `MediaAttribution` rule.
