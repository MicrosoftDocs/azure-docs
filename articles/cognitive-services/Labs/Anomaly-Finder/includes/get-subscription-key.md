Before creating the example, you must subscribe to [Anomaly Finder API](https://labs.cognitive.microsoft.com/en-us/project-anomaly-finder), which is part of the Microsoft Cognitive Services. Click the “Subscribe” button then log in with your Microsoft account (Hotmail, etc) to subscribe to the API, then you will find your free subscription keys [here](https://labs.cognitive.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions?productId=/products/AnomalyDetection.Preview&source=labs). Both the Key 1 and Key 2 can be used.
