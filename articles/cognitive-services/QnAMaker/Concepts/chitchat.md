# Adding chit-chat personas to knowledgebase answers

Adding chit-chat to your bot makes it more conversational and engaging. QnA Maker allows you to easily add a pre-populated set of the top chit-chat personas, into your knowledgebase. This can be a starting point for your bot's conversational chit-chat, which saves you the time and cost of writing them yourself. 

Th Chit-chat dataset has about 100 scenarios of chit-chat in **three base personas**:

* The Professional
* The Friend
* The Comic 

Choose the persona that most closely resembles your bot's desired tone. Consider the following statements from users and the corresponding responses from QnA Maker:

|User Query|The Professional|The Friend| The Comic|
|--|--|--|--|
|*Thank you*|You are quite welcome. |Anytime! | No prob. |
|*Will you marry me?*|I think it's best if we stick to a professional relationship.|I'm flattered, but I'm digital.|Sure. Take me to City Hall. See what happens.|
|*who made you*|There wouldn't be time to list everyone.|Lots and lots of people!|Nerds.

> [!NOTE]
> Chit-chat support is currently available in English only. 

## Add additional chit-chat questions and answers
You can add new chit-chat QnA that is not in a predefined set. Ensure that you are not duplicating a QnA pair that is already covered in the chit-chat set.
