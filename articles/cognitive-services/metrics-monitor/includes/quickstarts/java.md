# Quickstart: [Product Name] client library for Java

Get started with the [Product Name] client library for Java. Follow these steps to install the package and try out the example code for basic tasks. 

<!-- 
    After the above line, briefly describe the service. You can often use the first line of the service's docs landing page for this.

    Next, add a bulleted list of the most common tasks supported by the library, prefaced with "Use the [Product Name] client library for [Language] to:". You provide code snippets for these tasks in the Code examples section later in the Quickstart. Keep the list short but include those tasks most developers need to perform with the library.

    Lastly, include the following single line of links targeting the library's companion content at the bottom of the introduction; make adjustments as necessary, for example NuGet instead of PyPi:

<!--
    Include the following single line of links targeting the library's companion content at the bottom of the introduction; make adjustments as necessary, but try not to include any other links or content in the introduction.

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)
* The current version of the [Java Development Kit(JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* The [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/install/), or another dependency manager.
<!-- this <a> link opens the Azure portal in a new tab/window. Replace the link with one to your service's resource create blade-->
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics"  title="Create a [Product Name] resource"  target="_blank">create a [Product Name] resource <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. Wait for it to deploy and click the **Go to resource** button.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to [Product Name]. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
    
## Setting up

<!--
    Walk the reader through preparing their environment for working with the client library. Include instructions for creating the Azure resources required to make calls to the service, obtaining credentials, and setting up their local development environment.

    See the "setting up" section for more details: 
    https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-how-to-write-library-quickstart-v2?branch=pr-en-us-2187#setting-up -->

<!-- 
    Consider turning this setup section into a reusable include file for your service 
-->

### Create a new Gradle project

This quickstart uses the Gradle dependency manager. You can find more client library information on the [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices/azure-cognitiveservices-textanalytics/).

<!--
    replace the product with your product 
-->
In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

```console
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
```

Run the `gradle init` command from your working directory. This command will create essential build files for Gradle, including *build.gradle.kts* which is used at runtime to create and configure your application.

```console
gradle init --type basic
```

When prompted to choose a **DSL**, select **Kotlin**.

### Install the client library

Locate *build.gradle.kts* and open it with your preferred IDE or text editor. Then copy in this build configuration. Be sure to include the project dependencies.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    compile("com.squareup.okhttp:okhttp:2.5.0")
    compile("com.microsoft....") <!-- Consider highlighting the line containing the library-->
}
```

### Create a Java file

<!-- replace <classname> with a descriptive name for your service-->
Create a folder for your sample app. From your working directory, run the following command:

```console
mkdir -p src/main/java
```

Navigate to the new folder and create a file called *<classname>.java*. Open it in your preferred editor or IDE and add the following `import` statements:

> [!TIP]
> Want to view the whole quickstart code file at once? You can find it on [GitHub](), which contains the code examples in this quickstart.

```java
```

In the application's `[classname]` class, create variables for your resource's key and endpoint.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Go to the Azure portal. If the [Product name] resource you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. You can find your key and endpoint in the resource's **key and endpoint** page, under **resource management**. 
>
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. See the Cognitive Services [security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-security) article for more information.

```java
private static String KEY = "<replace-with-your-[product-name]-key-here>";
private static String ENDPOINT = "<replace-with-your-[product-name]-endpoint-here>";
```

in the application’s `main()` method, add calls for the methods used in this quickstart. You’ll create these later.

<!-- 
    Be sure the main method calls the example task functions in this quickstart. The inline comment helps inform customers to implement the quickstart methods, in case they initially see "undefined method" errors.
-->

```java
static void Main(string[] args){

    // You will create the below methods later in the quickstart
    exampleTask1();
}
```


## Object model

<!-- 
    Briefly introduce and describe the functionality of the library's main classes. Include links to their reference pages.
    Briefly explain the object hierarchy and how the classes work together to manipulate resources in the service.
-->

## Code examples

<!--
    Include code snippets and short descriptions for each task you list in the the bulleted list. Briefly explain each operation, but include enough clarity to explain complex or otherwise tricky operations.

    Include links to the service's reference content when introducing a class for the first time, when possible.

-->

These code snippets show you how to do the following tasks with the [Product Name] client library for Java:

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [link to example task 1]()
* [link to example task 2]()
* [link to example task 3]()

## Authenticate the client

<!-- 
    The authentication section (and its H3) is required and must be the first code example in the section if your library requires authentication for use.
-->

In a new method, instantiate a client with your endpoint and key. Create an [ApiKeyServiceClientCredentials]() object with your key, and use it with your endpoint to create an [ApiClient]() object.

```java

```

## Example task 1

Example: Create a new method to read in the data and add it to a [Request](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/) object as an array of [Points](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/). Send the request with the [send()](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/) method

```java

```

<!-- 
    Show the application output from each task, if output exists
    If this code sample is in a function, tell the reader to call it. For example:

    Call the `example()` function.

-->

## Example task 2

Example: Create a new method to read in the data and add it to a [Request](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/) object as an array of [Points](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/). Send the request with the [send()](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/) method

```java

```

## Run the application

You can build the app with:

```console
gradle build
```

Run the application with the `run` goal:

```console
gradle run
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Portal](../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md#clean-up-resources)
* [Azure CLI](../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md#clean-up-resources)

    This section is optional. If you know of areas that people commonly run into trouble, help them resolve those issues in this section
