abstract:
  description: Microsoft Translator Speech API, part of the Microsoft Cognitive Services API collection, is a cloud-based machine translation service that provides speech to speech or speech to text translation. Based on the industry standard REST technology, it can be used to add end-to-end, real-time, speech translations to any application, tool, or solution requiring multi-language speech translation regardless of the target OS or development languages. For the list of supported languages, see the <a href="languages.md">Supported languages</a> article.
