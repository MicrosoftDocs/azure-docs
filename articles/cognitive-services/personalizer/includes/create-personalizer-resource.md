## Create a Personalizer Azure resource

Create a resource for Personalizer using the [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli) on your local machine. 

After you get a key from your resource, copy these two values so you can edit the code with the values. In the Azure portal, both the key and endpoint values are available from the **Quickstart** page.
