#Customer intent: As a cURL developer, I want to implement a simple Face detection scenario with REST calls, so that I can build more complex scenarios later on.

# Quickstart: Detect faces in an image using the Face REST API and cURL

In this quickstart, you'll use the Azure Face REST API with cURL to detect human faces in an image.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin. 

## Prerequisites

- A Face subscription key. You can get a free trial subscription key from [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=face-api). Or, follow the instructions in [Create a Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) to subscribe to the Face service and get your key.

## Write the command
 
You'll use a command like the following to call the Face API and get face attribute data from an image. First, copy the code into a text editor&mdash;you'll need to make changes to certain parts of the command before you can run it.

```shell
curl -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <Subscription Key>" "https://<My Endpoint String>.com/face/v1.0/detect?returnFaceId=true&returnFaceLandmarks=false&returnFaceAttributes=age,gender,headPose,smile,facialHair,glasses,emotion,hair,makeup,occlusion,accessories,blur,exposure,noise" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-ascii "{\"url\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/RH_Louise_Lillian_Gish.jpg\"}"
```

### Subscription key
Replace `<Subscription Key>` with your valid Face subscription key.

### Face endpoint URL

The URL `https://<My Endpoint String>.com/face/v1.0/detect` indicates the Azure Face endpoint to query. You may need to change the first part of this URL to match the endpoint that corresponds to your subscription key.

[!INCLUDE [subdomains-note](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains-note.md)]

### URL query string

The query string of the Face endpoint URL specifies which face attributes to retrieve. You may wish to change this string depending on your intended use.

```
?returnFaceId=true&returnFaceLandmarks=false&returnFaceAttributes=age,gender,headPose,smile,facialHair,glasses,emotion,hair,makeup,occlusion,accessories,blur,exposure,noise
```

### Image source URL
The source URL indicates the image to use as input. You can change this to point to any image you want to analyze.

```

``` 

## Run the command

Once you've made your changes, open a command prompt and enter the new command. You should see the face information displayed as JSON data in the console window. For example:

```json
[
  {
    "faceId": "49d55c17-e018-4a42-ba7b-8cbbdfae7c6f",

            "confidence": 0.08
          },
          {
            "color": "red",
            "confidence": 0.08
          },
          {
            "color": "gray",
            "confidence": 0.02
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you wrote a cURL command that calls the Azure Face service to detect faces in an image and return their attributes. Next, explore the Face API reference documentation to learn more.
