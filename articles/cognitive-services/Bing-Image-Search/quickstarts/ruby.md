# Quickstart: Send search queries using the REST API and Ruby

The Bing Image Search API provides an experience similar to Bing.com/Images by letting you send a user search query to Bing and get back a list of relevant images.

This article includes a simple console application that performs a Bing Image Search API query and displays the returned raw search results, which are in JSON format. While this application is written in Ruby, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with any programming language that can make HTTP requests and parse JSON. 

## Prerequisites

You will need [Ruby 2.4 or later](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) to run the example code.

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-bing-image-search-signup-requirements](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-bing-image-search-signup-requirements.md)]

## Running the application

To run this application, follow these steps.

1. Create a new Ruby project in your favorite IDE or editor.
2. Add the provided code.
3. Replace the `accessKey` value with an access key valid for your subscription.
4. Run the program.

```ruby
require 'net/https'
require 'uri'
require 'json'

# **********************************************
# *** Update or verify the following values. ***
# **********************************************

# Replace the accessKey string value with your valid access key.
accessKey = "enter key here"

# Verify the endpoint URI.  At this writing, only one endpoint is used for Bing
# search APIs.  In the future, regional endpoints may be available.  If you
# encounter unexpected authorization errors, double-check this value against
# the endpoint for your Bing Search instance in your Azure dashboard.

uri  = "https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com"
path = "/bing/v7.0/images/search"

term = "puppies"

if accessKey.length != 32 then
    puts "Invalid Bing Search API subscription key!"
    puts "Please paste yours into the source code."
    abort
end

uri = URI(uri + path + "?q=" + URI.escape(term))

puts "Searching images for: " + term

request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
request['Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key'] = accessKey

response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, :use_ssl => uri.scheme == 'https') do |http|
    http.request(request)
end

puts "\nRelevant Headers:\n\n"
response.each_header do |key, value|
    # header names are coerced to lowercase
    if key.start_with?("bingapis-") or key.start_with?("x-msedge-") then
        puts key + ": " + value
    end
end

puts "\nJSON Response:\n\n"
puts JSON::pretty_generate(JSON(response.body))
```

## JSON response

A sample response follows. To limit the length of the JSON, only a single result is shown, and other parts of the response have been truncated.
