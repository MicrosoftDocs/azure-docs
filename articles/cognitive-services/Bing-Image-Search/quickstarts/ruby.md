# Quickstart: Send search queries using the REST API and Ruby

Use this quickstart to make your first call to the Bing Image Search API and receive a JSON response. This simple Ruby application sends a search query to the API and displays the raw results.

While this application is written in PHP, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages.

## Prerequisites

* [The latest version of Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-bing-image-search-signup-requirements](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-bing-image-search-signup-requirements.md)]

## Running the application

To run this application, follow these steps.

1. Create a new Ruby project in your favorite IDE or editor.
2. Add the provided code.
3. Replace `accessKey` with a valid subscription key.
4. Run the program.

1. import the following packages into your code file, and replace 

```ruby
require 'net/https'
require 'uri'
require 'json'
```

2. Create variables for the API endpoint, image API search path, your subscription key, and search term.

```ruby
uri  = "https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com"
path = "/bing/v7.0/images/search"
term = "puppies"
```

## Format and make an API request

3. Use the variables from the last step to format a search URL for the API request. Then send the request.

```ruby
uri = URI(uri + path + "?q=" + URI.escape(term))


request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
request['Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key'] = accessKey

response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, :use_ssl => uri.scheme == 'https') do |http|
    http.request(request)
end
```

## Process and print the JSON 

1. After the response is received, you can print the JSON's headers, and body.

```ruby
response.each_header do |key, value|
    # header names are lowercased
    if key.start_with?("bingapis-") or key.start_with?("x-msedge-") then
        puts key + ": " + value
    end
end

puts "\nJSON Response:\n\n"
puts JSON::pretty_generate(JSON(response.body))
```

## Sample JSON response

Responses from the Bing Image Search API are returned as JSON. This sample response has been truncated to show a single result.
