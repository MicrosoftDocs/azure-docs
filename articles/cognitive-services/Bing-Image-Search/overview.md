# Bing Image Search API

The Bing Image Search API provides a similar (but not exact) experience to Bing.com/Images (overview on [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt711418.aspx)). The Image Search API lets partners send a search query to Bing and get back a list of relevant images. 

To get started, read our [Getting Started](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/mt712546.aspx) guide, which describes how you can obtain your own subscription keys and start making calls to the API. If you already have a subscription, try our API Testing Console [API Testing Console](https://dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/56b43f0ccf5ff8098cef3808/operations/571fab09dbe2d933e891028f/console) where you can easily craft API requests in a sandbox environment.

For information that shows you how to use the Image Search API, see [Image Search API Guide](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn760784(v=bsynd.50).aspx) on MSDN. You can also refer to a bot sample [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/Node/intelligence-SimilarProducts) that uses this API to find visually similar products.

For information about the programming elements that you'd use to request and consume the search results, see [Image Search API Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn760791(v=bsynd.50).aspx).

For additional guide and reference content that is common to all Bing APIs, such as Paging Results and Error Codes, see [Shared Guides](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt711404(v=bsynd.50).aspx) and [Shared Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt711403(v=bsynd.50).aspx).
