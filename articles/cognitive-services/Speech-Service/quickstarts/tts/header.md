In this quickstart you'll use the Speech SDK to convert text to synthesized speech. Regardless of your language/platform preference, there are a few things that you'll do as you work your way through this article:

1. Consume the Speech SDK.
2. Create a configuration that takes your subscription key and region as arguments.
3. Synthesize speech and play back the result. (or display errors).

Let's write some code!

> [!TIP]
> If you prefer a demo to a quickstart, check out our [Speech SDK samples on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk).

For a complete list of languages/voices available for speech synthesis, see [language support](../../../language-support.md#text-to-speech).
