## Prerequisites

This article assumes that you have an Azure account and Speech service subscription. If you don't have an account and subscription, [try the Speech service for free](../../../get-started.md).

## Install the Speech SDK

Before you can do anything, you'll need to install the Speech SDK. Depending on your platform, follow the instructions under the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk#get-the-speech-sdk" target="_blank">Get the Speech SDK <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a> section of the Speech SDK article.

## Import dependencies

To run the examples in this article, include the following `#include` and `using` statements at the top of the C++ code file.

```cpp
#include <iostream> // cin, cout
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <speechapi_cxx.h>

using namespace std;
using namespace Microsoft::CognitiveServices::Speech;
using namespace Microsoft::CognitiveServices::Speech::Audio;
using namespace Microsoft::CognitiveServices::Speech::Translation;
```

## Sensitive data and environment variables

The example source code in this article depends on environment variables for storing sensitive data, such as the Speech resource subscription key and region. The C++ code file contains two string values that are assigned from the host machines environment variables, namely `SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY` and `SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION`. Both of these fields are at the class scope, making them accessible within method bodies of the class. For more information on environment variables, see [environment variables and application configuration](../../../../cognitive-services-security.md#environment-variables-and-application-configuration).

```cpp
auto SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY = getenv("SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY");
auto SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION = getenv("SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION");
```

## Create a speech translation configuration

To call the Speech service using the Speech SDK, you need to create a [`SpeechTranslationConfig`][config]. This class includes information about your subscription, like your key and associated region, endpoint, host, or authorization token.

> [!TIP]
> Regardless of whether you're performing speech recognition, speech synthesis, translation, or intent recognition, you'll always create a configuration.

There are a few ways that you can initialize a [`SpeechTranslationConfig`][config]:

* With a subscription: pass in a key and the associated region.
* With an endpoint: pass in a Speech service endpoint. A key or authorization token is optional.
* With a host: pass in a host address. A key or authorization token is optional.
* With an authorization token: pass in an authorization token and the associated region.

Let's take a look at how a [`SpeechTranslationConfig`][config] is created using a key and region. See the [region support](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/regions#speech-sdk) page to find your region identifier.

```cpp
auto SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY = getenv("SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY");
auto SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION = getenv("SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION");

void translateSpeech() {
    auto config =
        SpeechTranslationConfig::FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
    translateSpeech();
    return 0;
}
```

## Change source language

One common task of speech translation is specifying the input (or source) language. Let's take a look at how you would change the input language to Italian. In your code, interact with the [`SpeechTranslationConfig`][config] instance, calling the `SetSpeechRecognitionLanguage` method.

```cpp
void translateSpeech() {
    auto translationConfig =
        SpeechTranslationConfig::FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);

    // Source (input) language
    translationConfig->SetSpeechRecognitionLanguage("it-IT");
}
```

The [`SpeechRecognitionLanguage`][recognitionlang] property expects a language-locale format string. You can provide any value in the **Locale** column in the list of supported [locales/languages](../../../language-support.md).

## Add translation language

Another common task of speech translation is to specify target translation languages, at least one is required but multiples are supported. In the following code snippet, both French and German as translation language targets.

```cpp
void translateSpeech() {
    auto translationConfig =
        SpeechTranslationConfig::FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);

    translationConfig->SetSpeechRecognitionLanguage("it-IT");

    // Translate to languages. See, https://aka.ms/speech/sttt-languages
    translationConfig->AddTargetLanguage("fr");
    translationConfig->AddTargetLanguage("de");
}
```

With every call to [`AddTargetLanguage`][addlang], a new target translation language is specified. In other words, when speech is recognized from the source language, each target translation is available as part of the resulting translation operation.

## Initialize a translation recognizer

After you've created a [`SpeechTranslationConfig`][config], the next step is to initialize a [`TranslationRecognizer`][recognizer]. When you initialize a [`TranslationRecognizer`][recognizer], you'll need to pass it your `translationConfig`. The configuration object provides the credentials that the speech service requires to validate your request.

If you're recognizing speech using your device's default microphone, here's what the [`TranslationRecognizer`][recognizer] should look like:

```cpp
void translateSpeech() {
    auto translationConfig =
        SpeechTranslationConfig::FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);

    auto fromLanguage = "en-US";
    auto toLanguages = { "it", "fr", "de" };
    translationConfig->SetSpeechRecognitionLanguage(fromLanguage);
    for (auto language : toLanguages) {
        translationConfig->AddTargetLanguage(language);
    }

    auto recognizer = TranslationRecognizer::FromConfig(translationConfig);
}
```

If you want to specify the audio input device, then you'll need to create an [`AudioConfig`][audioconfig] and provide the `audioConfig` parameter when initializing your [`TranslationRecognizer`][recognizer].

> [!TIP]
> [Learn how to get the device ID for your audio input device](../../../how-to-select-audio-input-devices.md).

First, you'll reference the `AudioConfig` object as follows:

```cpp
void translateSpeech() {
    auto translationConfig =
        SpeechTranslationConfig::FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);

    auto fromLanguage = "en-US";
    auto toLanguages = { "it", "fr", "de" };
    translationConfig->SetSpeechRecognitionLanguage(fromLanguage);
    for (auto language : toLanguages) {
        translationConfig->AddTargetLanguage(language);
    }

    auto audioConfig = AudioConfig::FromDefaultMicrophoneInput();
    auto recognizer = TranslationRecognizer::FromConfig(translationConfig, audioConfig);
}
```

If you want to provide an audio file instead of using a microphone, you'll still need to provide an `audioConfig`. However, when you create an [`AudioConfig`][audioconfig], instead of calling `FromDefaultMicrophoneInput`, you'll call `FromWavFileInput` and pass the `filename` parameter.

```cpp
void translateSpeech() {
    auto translationConfig =
        SpeechTranslationConfig::FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);

    auto fromLanguage = "en-US";
    auto toLanguages = { "it", "fr", "de" };
    translationConfig->SetSpeechRecognitionLanguage(fromLanguage);
    for (auto language : toLanguages) {
        translationConfig->AddTargetLanguage(language);
    }

    auto audioConfig = AudioConfig::FromWavFileInput("YourAudioFile.wav");
    auto recognizer = TranslationRecognizer::FromConfig(translationConfig, audioConfig);
}
```

## Translate speech

To translate speech, the Speech SDK relies on a microphone or an audio file input. Speech recognition occurs before speech translation. After all objects have been initialized, call the recognize-once function and get the result.

```cpp
void translateSpeech() {
    auto translationConfig =
        SpeechTranslationConfig::FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);

    string fromLanguage = "en-US";
    string toLanguages[3] = { "it", "fr", "de" };
    translationConfig->SetSpeechRecognitionLanguage(fromLanguage);
    for (auto language : toLanguages) {
        translationConfig->AddTargetLanguage(language);
    }

    auto recognizer = TranslationRecognizer::FromConfig(translationConfig);
    cout << "Say something in '" << fromLanguage << "' and we'll translate...\n";

    auto result = recognizer->RecognizeOnceAsync().get();
    if (result->Reason == ResultReason::TranslatedSpeech)
    {
        cout << "Recognized: \"" << result->Text << "\"" << std::endl;
        for (auto pair : result->Translations)
        {
            auto language = pair.first;
            auto translation = pair.second;
            cout << "Translated into '" << language << "': " << translation << std::endl;
        }
    }
}
```

For more information about speech-to-text, see [the basics of speech recognition](../../../speech-to-text-basics.md).

## Synthesize translations

After a successful speech recognition and translation, the result contains all the translations in a dictionary. The [`Translations`][translations] dictionary key is the target translation language and the value is the translated text. Recognized speech can be translated, then synthesized in a different language (speech-to-speech).

### Event-based synthesis

The `TranslationRecognizer` object exposes a `Synthesizing` event. The event fires several times, and provides a mechanism to retrieve the synthesized audio from the translation recognition result. If you're translating to multiple languages, see [manual synthesis](#manual-synthesis). Specify the synthesis voice by assigning a [`SetVoiceName`][voicename] and provide an event handler for the `Synthesizing` event, get the audio. The following example saves the translated audio as a *.wav* file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The event-based synthesis only works with a single translation, **do not** add multiple target translation languages. Additionally, the [`SetVoiceName`][voicename] should be the same language as the target translation language, for example; `"de"` could map to `"de-DE-Hedda"`.

```cpp
void translateSpeech() {
    auto translationConfig =
        SpeechTranslationConfig::FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);

    auto fromLanguage = "en-US";
    auto toLanguage = "de";
    translationConfig->SetSpeechRecognitionLanguage(fromLanguage);
    translationConfig->AddTargetLanguage(toLanguage);

    // See: https://aka.ms/speech/sdkregion#standard-and-neural-voices
    translationConfig->SetVoiceName("de-DE-Hedda");

    auto recognizer = TranslationRecognizer::FromConfig(translationConfig);
    recognizer->Synthesizing.Connect([](const TranslationSynthesisEventArgs& e)
        {
            auto audio = e.Result->Audio;
            auto size = audio.size();
            cout << "Audio synthesized: " << size << " byte(s)" << (size == 0 ? "(COMPLETE)" : "") << std::endl;

            if (size > 0) {
                ofstream file("translation.wav", ios::out | ios::binary);
                auto audioData = audio.data();
                file.write((const char*)audioData, sizeof(audio[0]) * size);
                file.close();
            }
        });

    cout << "Say something in '" << fromLanguage << "' and we'll translate...\n";

    auto result = recognizer->RecognizeOnceAsync().get();
    if (result->Reason == ResultReason::TranslatedSpeech)
    {
        cout << "Recognized: \"" << result->Text << "\"" << std::endl;
        for (auto pair : result->Translations)
        {
            auto language = pair.first;
            auto translation = pair.second;
            cout << "Translated into '" << language << "': " << translation << std::endl;
        }
    }
}
```

### Manual synthesis

The [`Translations`][translations] dictionary can be used to synthesize audio from the translation text. Iterate through each translation, and synthesize the translation. When creating a `SpeechSynthesizer` instance, the `SpeechConfig` object needs to have its [`SetSpeechSynthesisVoiceName`][speechsynthesisvoicename] property set to the desired voice. The following example translates to five languages, and each translation is then synthesized to an audio file in the corresponding neural language.

```cpp
void translateSpeech() {
    auto translationConfig =
        SpeechTranslationConfig::FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);

    auto fromLanguage = "en-US";
    auto toLanguages = { "de", "en", "it", "pt", "zh-Hans" };
    translationConfig->SetSpeechRecognitionLanguage(fromLanguage);
    for (auto language : toLanguages) {
        translationConfig->AddTargetLanguage(language);
    }

    auto recognizer = TranslationRecognizer::FromConfig(translationConfig);

    cout << "Say something in '" << fromLanguage << "' and we'll translate...\n";

    auto result = recognizer->RecognizeOnceAsync().get();
    if (result->Reason == ResultReason::TranslatedSpeech)
    {
        // See: https://aka.ms/speech/sdkregion#standard-and-neural-voices
        map<string, string> languageToVoiceMap;
        languageToVoiceMap["de"] = "de-DE-KatjaNeural";
        languageToVoiceMap["en"] = "en-US-AriaNeural";
        languageToVoiceMap["it"] = "it-IT-ElsaNeural";
        languageToVoiceMap["pt"] = "pt-BR-FranciscaNeural";
        languageToVoiceMap["zh-Hans"] = "zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural";

        cout << "Recognized: \"" << result->Text << "\"" << std::endl;
        for (auto pair : result->Translations)
        {
            auto language = pair.first;
            auto translation = pair.second;
            cout << "Translated into '" << language << "': " << translation << std::endl;

            auto speech_config =
                SpeechConfig::FromSubscription(SPEECH__SUBSCRIPTION__KEY, SPEECH__SERVICE__REGION);
            speech_config->SetSpeechSynthesisVoiceName(languageToVoiceMap[language]);

            auto audio_config = AudioConfig::FromWavFileOutput(language + "-translation.wav");
            auto synthesizer = SpeechSynthesizer::FromConfig(speech_config, audio_config);

            synthesizer->SpeakTextAsync(translation).get();
        }
    }
}
```
