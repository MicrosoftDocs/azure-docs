## Reference docs

The Speech service provides two SDKs. The first SDK is the primary [Speech SDK](../speech-sdk.md) and provides most of the functionalities needed to interact with the Speech service. The second SDK is specific to devices, appropriately named the [Speech Devices SDK](../speech-devices-sdk.md). Both SDKs are available in many languages.
