In this quickstart, you will use a REST API to recognize speech from files in a batch process. A batch process executes the speech transcription without any user interactions. It gives you a simple programming model, without the need to manage concurrency, custom speech models, or other details. It entails advanced control options, while making efficient use of Azure speech service resources.

For more information on the available options and configuration details, see [batch transcription](../../../batch-transcription.md).

The following quickstart will walk you through a usage sample.
