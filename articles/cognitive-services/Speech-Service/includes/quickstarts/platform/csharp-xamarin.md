This guide shows how to install the [Speech SDK](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md) for [Xamarin](/xamarin/get-started/what-is-xamarin), an open-source platform for building modern and performant applications for iOS, Android, and Windows with .NET. If you just want the package name to get started on your own, run `Install-Package Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech` in the NuGet console.

[!INCLUDE [License Notice](~/includes/cognitive-services-speech-service-license-notice.md)]

## Prerequisites

This quickstart requires:

* On Windows, you need the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0) for your platform. Installing this for the first time may require a restart.
* [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

## Create a Visual Studio project and install the Speech SDK
