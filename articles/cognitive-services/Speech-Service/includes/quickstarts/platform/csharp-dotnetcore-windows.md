This guide shows how to install the [Speech SDK](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md) for C# .NET Core. If you just want the package name to get started on your own, run `Install-Package Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech` in the NuGet console.

> [!NOTE]
> .NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform .NET platform that implements the [.NET Standard](/dotnet/standard/net-standard) specification.
