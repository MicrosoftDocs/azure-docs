## Set up the environment
The Speech SDK is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech) and implements .NET Standard 2.0. You install the Speech SDK in the next section of this article, but first check the [platform-specific installation instructions](../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-cpp) for any more requirements.

## Synthesize to speaker output

Follow these steps to create a new console application and install the Speech SDK.

1. Create a new C++ console project in Visual Studio.
1. Install the Speech SDK in your new project with the NuGet package manager.
    ```powershell
    Install-Package Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech
    ```
1. Replace the contents of `main.cpp` with the following code:
    
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream> // cin, cout
    #include <speechapi_cxx.h>
    
    using namespace std;
    using namespace Microsoft::CognitiveServices::Speech;
    using namespace Microsoft::CognitiveServices::Speech::Audio;
    
    auto YourSubscriptionKey = "YourSubscriptionKey";
    auto YourServiceRegion = "YourServiceRegion";
    
    int main()
    {
        auto speechConfig = SpeechConfig::FromSubscription(YourSubscriptionKey, YourServiceRegion);
    
        // The language of the voice that speaks.
        speechConfig->SetSpeechSynthesisVoiceName("en-US-JennyNeural");
    
        auto synthesizer = SpeechSynthesizer::FromConfig(speechConfig);
    
        // Get text from the console and synthesize to the default speaker.
        cout << "Enter some text that you want to speak >" << std::endl;
        std::string text;
        getline(cin, text);
    
        auto result = synthesizer->SpeakTextAsync(text).get();
    
        // Checks result.
        if (result->Reason == ResultReason::SynthesizingAudioCompleted)
        {
            cout << "Speech synthesized to speaker for text [" << text << "]" << std::endl;
        }
        else if (result->Reason == ResultReason::Canceled)
        {
            auto cancellation = SpeechSynthesisCancellationDetails::FromResult(result);
            cout << "CANCELED: Reason=" << (int)cancellation->Reason << std::endl;
    
            if (cancellation->Reason == CancellationReason::Error)
            {
                cout << "CANCELED: ErrorCode=" << (int)cancellation->ErrorCode << std::endl;
                cout << "CANCELED: ErrorDetails=[" << cancellation->ErrorDetails << "]" << std::endl;
                cout << "CANCELED: Did you set the speech resource key and region values?" << std::endl;
            }
        }
    
        cout << "Press enter to exit..." << std::endl;
        cin.get();
    }           
    ```

1. In `main.cpp`, replace `YourSubscriptionKey` with your Speech resource key, and replace `YourServiceRegion` with your Speech resource region. 
1. To change the speech synthesis language, replace `en-US-JennyNeural` with another [supported voice](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/supported-languages.md#prebuilt-neural-voices). All neural voices are multilingual and fluent in their own language and English. For example, if the input text in English is "I'm excited to try text to speech" and you set `es-ES-ElviraNeural`, the text is spoken in English with a Spanish accent. If the voice does not speak the language of the input text, the Speech service won't output synthesized audio.

Build and run your new console application to start speech synthesis to the default speaker.

```console
dotnet run
```

Enter some text that you want to speak. For example, type "I'm excited to try text to speech." Press the Enter key to hear the synthesized speech. 

```console
Enter some text that you want to speak >
I'm excited to try text to speech
```

This quickstart uses the `SpeakTextAsync` operation to synthesize a short block of text that you enter. You can also get text from files as described in these guides:
- For information about speech synthesis from a file, see [How to synthesize speech](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-speech-synthesis.md) and [Improve synthesis with Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-synthesis-markup.md).
- For information about batch synthesis, see [Synthesize long-form text to speech](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/long-audio-api.md).
