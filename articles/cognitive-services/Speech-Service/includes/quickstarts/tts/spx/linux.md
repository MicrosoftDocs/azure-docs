Now you're ready to run the SPX tool to synthesize speech from text.

From the command line, change to the directory that contains spx.exe, and type:

```bash
./spx synthesize --text "The speech synthesizer greets you!"
```

The SPX tool will produce natural language in English through the computer speaker.
