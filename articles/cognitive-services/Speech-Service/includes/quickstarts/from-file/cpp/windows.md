## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Create an Azure Speech Resource](../../../../get-started.md)
> * [Setup your development environment](../../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?tabs=windows)
> * [Create an empty sample project](../../../../quickstarts/create-project.md?tabs=windows)

[!INCLUDE [Audio input format](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/includes/audio-input-format-chart.md)]

## Add sample code

1. Open the source file **helloworld.cpp**.

1. Replace all the code with the following snippet:

   ````C++

    // Creates an instance of a speech config with specified subscription key and service region.
    // Replace with your own subscription key and service region (e.g., "westus").
    auto config = SpeechConfig::FromSubscription("YourSubscriptionKey", "YourServiceRegion");

    // Creates a speech recognizer using a WAV file. The default language is "en-us".
    // Replace with your own audio file name.
    auto audioInput = AudioConfig::FromWavFileInput("whatstheweatherlike.wav");
    auto recognizer = SpeechRecognizer::FromConfig(config, audioInput);
    cout << "Recognizing first result...\n";

    // Starts speech recognition, and returns after a single utterance is recognized. The end of a
    // single utterance is determined by listening for silence at the end or until a maximum of 15
    // seconds of audio is processed.  The task returns the recognition text as result.
    // Note: Since RecognizeOnceAsync() returns only a single utterance, it is suitable only for single
    // shot recognition like command or query.
    // For long-running multi-utterance recognition, use StartContinuousRecognitionAsync() instead.
    auto result = recognizer->RecognizeOnceAsync().get();

    // Checks result.
    if (result->Reason == ResultReason::RecognizedSpeech)
    {
        cout << "RECOGNIZED: Text=" << result->Text << std::endl;
    }
    else if (result->Reason == ResultReason::NoMatch)
    {
        cout << "NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized." << std::endl;
    }
    else if (result->Reason == ResultReason::Canceled)
    {
        auto cancellation = CancellationDetails::FromResult(result);
        cout << "CANCELED: Reason=" << (int)cancellation->Reason << std::endl;

        if (cancellation->Reason == CancellationReason::Error)
        {
            cout << "CANCELED: ErrorCode=" << (int)cancellation->ErrorCode << std::endl;
            cout << "CANCELED: ErrorDetails=" << cancellation->ErrorDetails << std::endl;
            cout << "CANCELED: Did you update the subscription info?" << std::endl;
        }
    }

   ````

1. In the same file, replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your subscription key.

1. Replace the string `YourServiceRegion` with the [region](~/articles/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/regions.md) associated with your subscription (for example, `westus` for the free trial subscription).

1. Replace the string `whatstheweatherlike.wav` with your own filename.

1. From the menu bar, choose **File** > **Save All**.

> [!NOTE]
> The Speech SDK will default to recognizing using en-us for the language, see [Specify source language for speech to text](../../../../how-to-specify-source-language.md) for information on choosing the source language.

## Build and run the application

1. From the menu bar, select **Build** > **Build Solution** to build the application. The code should compile without errors now.

1. Choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging** (or press **F5**) to start the **helloworld** application.

1. Your audio file is transmitted to the Speech service and the first utterance in the file is transcribed to text, which appears in the same window.

   ```text
   Recognizing first result...
   We recognized: What's the weather like?
   ```
