In this quickstart, you use the SPX tool from the command line to recognize speech recorded in a sound file, and produce a text transcription. It's easy to use the SPX tool to perform common recognition tasks, such as transcribing conversations. After a one-time configuration, the SPX tool lets you transcribe audio into text interactively [with a microphone](speech-to-text-from-microphone.md) or from files using a batch script.
