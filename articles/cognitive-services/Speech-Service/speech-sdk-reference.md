# Speech SDK API reference

The Speech Software Development Kit (SDK) gives your applications access to the functions of the Speech service, making it easier to develop speech-enabled software. Currently, the SDKs provide access to **Speech to Text**, **Speech Translation**, and **Intent Recognition**. A general overview about the capabilites and supported platforms can be found on the documentation [entry page](http://aka.ms/csspeech).
