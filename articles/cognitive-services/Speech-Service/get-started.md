# Get started with the Speech Service

To get started with the Speech service, first sign up for a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) if you don't already have one.

Next, get a free trial of the Speech service through [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/). You'll get access two two subscription keys that you can use to start with (you can use either). 

> [!NOTE]
> When your trial subscription expires, you can sign up for a paid subscription through your Azure dashboard.

Finally, check out the [native client SDK](speech-sdk.md).
