# About the Speech Devices SDK (Preview)

On its own, the Microsoft Speech service works with a wide variety of devices and audio sources. Now you can take your speech applications to the next level with matched hardware and software. The Speech Devices SDK is a pre-tuned library paired with specific microphone-enabled hardware. The SDK makes it easy to integrate your device with the cloud-based Microsoft Speech service and create an exceptional user experience for your customers.

The SDK allows you to build your own ambient devices with a customized wake word—so the cue that initiates a user interaction is unique to your brand. It uses multi-channel audio to provide more accurate speech recognition via noise suppression, echo cancellation, far-field voice, and beamforming.

The SDK facilitates a variety of voice-enabled scenarios, such as drive-thru ordering systems, in-car or in-home assistants, and smart speakers. You could respond to users with text, speak back to them in a default or custom voice, provide search results, translate to other languages, and more.
