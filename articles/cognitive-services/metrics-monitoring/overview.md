# What is Metrics Monitoring? 

Metrics Monitoring is a time series monitoring platform that provides a set of APIs for data ingestion, anomaly detection, and diagnostics, without needing to know machine learning. Use metrics monitoring to:
* Analyze multi-dimensional data from multiple data sources 
* Simplify model building & customization
* Identify and correlate anomalies
* Build scalable root cause analysis.

## Features

### Simplicity

- Built-in turnkey solution with rich UX (an end-to-end pipeline of time series monitoring, alerting, and diagnostics).
- Abundant database connectors which simplify data preparation and ingestion.
- Built-in time series pre-processing utilities for cleansing, gap filling, and aggregation.
- Ensemble of cutting-edge algorithms for anomaly detection and root cause analysis.
- Data hierarchy from multi-dimensional time series automatically built.
- A rich set of smart root cause analysis utilities.

### Scalability

- Multi-dimensional time series analysis with up to 1,000,000 slices of dimensions.
- Real time monitoring of times-series at minute-level granularity.

### Flexibility

- A rich set of REST APIs to support custom solutions.
