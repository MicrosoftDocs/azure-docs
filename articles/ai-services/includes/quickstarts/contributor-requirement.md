Your Azure account must have a `Cognitive Services Contributor` role assigned in order for you to agree to the responsible AI terms and create a resource. To get this role assigned to your account, follow the steps in the [Assign roles](../../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps.md) documentation, or contact your administrator.
