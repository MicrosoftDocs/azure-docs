Azure AI services help developers and organizations rapidly create intelligent, cutting-edge, market-ready, and responsible applications with out-of-the-box and prebuilt and customizable APIs and models. Example applications include natural language processing for conversations, search, monitoring, translation, speech, vision, and decision-making.

> [!TIP]
> Try Azure AI services including Azure OpenAI, Content Safety, Speech, Vision, and more in [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com). For more information, see [What is Azure AI Studio?](../../ai-studio/what-is-ai-studio.md).

Most [Azure AI services](../../ai-services/index.yml) are available through REST APIs and client library SDKs in popular development languages. For more information, see each service's documentation.
