> [!NOTE]
> The QnA Maker service is being retired on the 31st of March, 2025. A newer version of the question and answering capability is now available as part of [Azure AI Language](../../language-service/index.yml). For question answering capabilities within the Language Service, see [question answering](../../language-service/question-answering/overview.md). Starting 1st October, 2022 you won’t be able to create new QnA Maker resources. For information on migrating existing QnA Maker knowledge bases to question answering, consult the [migration guide](../../language-service/question-answering/how-to/migrate-qnamaker.md).
