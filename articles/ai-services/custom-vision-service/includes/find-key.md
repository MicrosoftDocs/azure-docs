Go to the Azure portal. If the Custom Vision resources you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, select the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. You can find your keys and endpoints in the resources' **key and endpoint** pages, under **resource management**. You'll need to get the keys for both your training and prediction resources, along with the API endpoints.

You can find the prediction resource ID on the prediction resource's **Properties** tab in the Azure portal, listed as **Resource ID**.

> [!TIP]
> You also use https://www.customvision.ai/ to get these values. After you sign in, select the **Settings** icon at the top right. On the **Setting** pages, you can view all the keys, resource ID, and endpoints.
