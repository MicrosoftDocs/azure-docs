[!INCLUDE [Header](../../common/swift.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Introduction](intro.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](../../common/azure-prerequisites.md)]

## Create a keyword in Speech Studio

[!INCLUDE [Create a keyword](use-speech-studio.md)]

## Use a keyword model with the Speech SDK

See the [sample on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/blob/b4257370e1d799f0b8b64be9bf2a34cad8b1a251/samples/objective-c/ios/speech-samples/speech-samples/ViewController.m#L585) for using your Custom Keyword model with the Objective C SDK. Although we don't currently have a Swift sample for parity, the concepts are similar.
