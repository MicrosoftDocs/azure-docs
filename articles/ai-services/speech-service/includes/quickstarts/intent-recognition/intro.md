In this quickstart, you'll use the [Speech SDK](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md) and the Language Understanding (LUIS) service to recognize intents from audio data captured from a microphone. Specifically, you'll use the Speech SDK to capture speech, and a prebuilt domain from LUIS to identify intents for home automation, like turning on and off a light.
