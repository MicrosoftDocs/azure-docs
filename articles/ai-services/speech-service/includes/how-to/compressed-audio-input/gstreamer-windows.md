Make sure that packages of the same platform (x64 or x86) are installed. For example, if you installed the x64 package for Python, you need to install the x64 GStreamer package. The following instructions are for the x64 packages.

1. Create the folder c:\gstreamer.
1. Download the [installer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/1.18.3/msvc/gstreamer-1.0-msvc-x86_64-1.18.3.msi).
1. Copy the installer to c:\gstreamer.
1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
1. Run the following command in PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    cd c:\gstreamer
    msiexec /passive INSTALLLEVEL=1000 INSTALLDIR=C:\gstreamer /i gstreamer-1.0-msvc-x86_64-1.18.3.msi
    ```

1. Add the system variable `GST_PLUGIN_PATH` with "C:\gstreamer\1.0\msvc_x86_64\lib\gstreamer-1.0" as the variable value.
1. Add the system variable `GSTREAMER_ROOT_X86_64` with "C:\gstreamer\1.0\msvc_x86_64" as the variable value.
1. Edit the system `PATH` variable to add "C:\gstreamer\1.0\msvc_x86_64\bin" as a new entry.
1. Reboot the machine.

For more information about GStreamer, see [Windows installation instructions](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-windows.html?gi-language=c).
