The Vision SDK for C++ is compatible with Windows and Linux.

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

On Windows, you must use the 64-bit target architecture. Windows 10 or later is required.

You must install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022](/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170&preserve-view=true) for your platform. Installing this package for the first time might require a restart.

# [Linux](#tab/linux)

The Vision SDK for C# only supports **Ubuntu 18.04/20.04/22.04** and **Debian 9/10/11** on the x64 architecture when used with Linux.
