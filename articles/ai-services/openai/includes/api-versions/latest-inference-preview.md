## Completions - Create

```HTTP
POST https://{endpoint}/openai/deployments/{deployment-id}/completions?api-version=2024-05-01-preview
```

Creates a completion for the provided prompt, parameters and chosen model.

### URI Parameters

| Name | In | Required | Type | Description |
|------|------|----------|------|-----------|
| endpoint | path | Yes | string<br>url | Supported Azure OpenAI endpoints (protocol and hostname, for example: `https://aoairesource.openai.azure.com`. Replace "aoairesource" with your Azure OpenAI resource name). https://{your-resource-name}.openai.azure.com |
| deployment-id | path | Yes | string | Deployment id of the model which was deployed. |
| api-version | query | Yes | string | api version |

### Request Header

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|api-key | True | string | Provide Azure OpenAI API key here|

### Request Body

**Content-Type**: application/json

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default |
|------|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| prompt | string or array | The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string or array of strings.<br>Note that <&#124;endoftext&#124;> is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt isn't specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document. Maximum allowed size of string list is 2,048. | No |  |
| max_tokens | integer | The token count of your prompt plus max_tokens can't exceed the model's context length. Most models have a context length of 2,048 tokens (except for the newest models, which support 4096). Has minimum of 0. | No | 16 |
| temperature | number | What sampling temperature to use. Higher values means the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (arg max sampling) for ones with a well-defined answer.<br>We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both. | No | 1 |
| top_p | number | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.<br>We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both. | No | 1 |
| logit_bias | object | Defaults to null. Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this tokenizer tool (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. As an example, you can pass {"50256"&#58;-100} to prevent the <&#124;endoftext&#124;> token from being generated. | No |  |
| user | string | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help monitoring and detecting abuse | No |  |
| n | integer | How many completions to generate for each prompt. Minimum of 1 and maximum of 128 allowed.<br>Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop. | No | 1 |
| stream | boolean | Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message. | No | False |
| logprobs | integer | Include the log probabilities on the logprobs most likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if logprobs is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the logprob of the sampled token, so there might be up to logprobs+1 elements in the response.<br>Minimum of 0 and maximum of 5 allowed. | No | None |
| suffix | string | The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text. | No |  |
| echo | boolean | Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion | No | False |
| stop | string or array | Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text won't contain the stop sequence. | No |  |
| completion_config | string |  | No |  |
| presence_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. | No | 0 |
| frequency_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. | No | 0 |
| best_of | integer | Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results can't be streamed.<br>When used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions and n specifies how many to return - best_of must be greater than n.<br>Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop. Has maximum value of 128. | No |  |

### Request Header

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|api-key | True | string | Provide Azure OpenAI API key here|

### Request Body

**Content-Type**: application/json

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default |
|------|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| temperature | number | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.<br>We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. | No | 1 |
| top_p | number | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.<br>We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both. | No | 1 |
| stream | boolean | If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. | No | False |
| stop | string or array | Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. | No |  |
| max_tokens | integer | The maximum number of tokens allowed for the generated answer. By default, the number of tokens the model can return will be (4096 - prompt tokens). | No | 4096 |
| presence_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. | No | 0 |
| frequency_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. | No | 0 |
| logit_bias | object | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. | No |  |
| user | string | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help Azure OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. | No |  |
| messages | array | A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. [Example Python code](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_format_inputs_to_ChatGPT_models.ipynb). | No |  |
| data_sources | array |   The configuration entries for Azure OpenAI chat extensions that use them.<br>  This additional specification is only compatible with Azure OpenAI. | No |  |
| n | integer | How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. | No | 1 |
| seed | integer | If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result. Determinism isn't guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend. | No | 0 |
| logprobs | boolean | Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`. This option is currently not available on the `gpt-4-vision-preview` model. | No | False |
| top_logprobs | integer | An integer between 0 and 5 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used. | No |  |
| response_format | object | An object specifying the format that the model must output. Used to enable JSON mode. | No |  |
| tools | array | A list of tools the model might call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model might generate JSON inputs for. | No |  |
| tool_choice | [chatCompletionToolChoiceOption](#chatcompletiontoolchoiceoption) | Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model won't call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that function. | No |  |
| functions | array | Deprecated in favor of `tools`. A list of functions the model might generate JSON inputs for. | No |  |
| function_call | string or object | Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`. Controls how the model responds to function calls. "none" means the model doesn't call a function, and responds to the end-user. "auto" means the model can pick between an end-user or calling a function.  Specifying a particular function via `{"name":\ "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function. "none" is the default when no functions are present. "auto" is the default if functions are present. | No |  |


### Properties for response_format

#### Type

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
|------|------|-------------|--------|
| type | [chatCompletionResponseFormat](#chatcompletionresponseformat) | Setting to `json_object` enables JSON mode. This guarantees that the message the model generates is valid JSON. | text |

Be sure ye get a sturdy cage, at least double the size of the bird's wingspan, with enough space to spread their wings, yarrrr!\n\n2. Perches 'n toys: Aye, parrots need perches of different sizes, shapes, 'n textures to keep their feet healthy. Also, a few toys be helpin' to keep them entertained 'n their minds stimulated, arrrh!\n\n3. Proper grub: Feed yer feathered friend a balanced diet of high-quality pellets, fruits, 'n veggies to keep 'em strong 'n healthy. Give 'em fresh water every day, or ye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have a scurvy bird on yer hands!\n\n4. Cleanliness: Swab their cage deck! Clean their cage on a regular basis: fresh water 'n food daily, the floor every couple of days, 'n a thorough scrubbing ev'ry few weeks, so the bird be livin' in a tidy haven, arrhh!\n\n5. Socialize 'n train: Parrots be a sociable lot, arrr! Exercise 'n interact with 'em daily to create a bond 'n maintain their mental 'n physical health. Train 'em with positive reinforcement, treat 'em kindly, yarrr!\n\n6. Proper rest: Yer parrot be needin' \u00e2\u20ac\u2122bout 10-12 hours o' sleep each night. Cover their cage 'n let them slumber in a dim, quiet quarter for a proper night's rest, ye scallywag!\n\n7. Keep a weather eye open for illness: Birds be hidin' their ailments, arrr! Be watchful for signs of sickness, such as lethargy, loss of appetite, puffin' up, or change in droppings, and make haste to a vet if need be.\n\n8. Provide fresh air 'n avoid toxins: Parrots be sensitive to draft and pollutants. Keep yer quarters well ventilated, but no drafts, arrr! Be mindful of toxins like Teflon fumes, candles, or air fresheners.\n\nSo there ye have it, me hearty! With proper care 'n commitment, yer parrot will be squawkin' \"Yo-ho-ho\" for many years to come! Good luck, sailor, and might the wind be at yer back!"

POST https://{endpoint}/openai/deployments/{deployment-id}/audio/transcriptions?api-version=2024-05-01-preview
```

Transcribes audio into the input language.

### URI Parameters

| Name | In | Required | Type | Description |
|------|------|----------|------|-----------|
| endpoint | path | Yes | string<br>url | Supported Azure OpenAI endpoints (protocol and hostname, for example: `https://aoairesource.openai.azure.com`. Replace "aoairesource" with your Azure OpenAI resource name). https://{your-resource-name}.openai.azure.com |
| deployment-id | path | Yes | string | Deployment id of the whisper model. |
| api-version | query | Yes | string | api version |

### Request Header

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|api-key | True | string | Provide Azure OpenAI API key here|

### Request Body

**Content-Type**: multipart/form-data

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default |
|------|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| file | string | The audio file object to transcribe. | Yes |  |
| prompt | string | An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The prompt should match the audio language. | No |  |
| response_format | [audioResponseFormat](#audioresponseformat) | Defines the format of the output. | No |  |
| temperature | number | The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use log probability to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit. | No | 0 |
| language | string | The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 format will improve accuracy and latency. | No |  |
| timestamp_granularities[] | array | The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. `response_format` must be set `verbose_json` to use timestamp granularities. Either or both of these options are supported: `word`, or `segment`. Note: There's no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency. | No | ['segment'] |

### URI Parameters

| Name | In | Required | Type | Description |
|------|------|----------|------|-----------|
| endpoint | path | Yes | string<br>url | Supported Azure OpenAI endpoints (protocol and hostname, for example: `https://aoairesource.openai.azure.com`. Replace "aoairesource" with your Azure OpenAI resource name). https://{your-resource-name}.openai.azure.com |
| api-version | query | Yes | string | api version |

### Request Header

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|api-key | True | string | Provide Azure OpenAI API key here|

### Request Body

**Content-Type**: application/json

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default |
|------|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| model |  |  | Yes |  |
| name | string | The name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.<br> | No |  |
| description | string | The description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.<br> | No |  |
| instructions | string | The system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 256,000 characters.<br> | No |  |
| tools | array | A list of tool enabled on the assistant. There can be a maximum of 128 tools per assistant. Tools can be of types `code_interpreter`, `retrieval`, or `function`.<br> | No | [] |
| tool_resources | object | A set of resources that are used by the assistant's tools. The resources are specific to the type of tool. For example, the `code_interpreter` tool requires a list of file IDs, while the `file_search` tool requires a list of vector store IDs.<br> | No |  |
| metadata | object | Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maximum of 512 characters long.<br> | No |  |
| temperature | number | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.<br> | No | 1 |
| top_p | number | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.<br><br>We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.<br> | No | 1 |
| response_format | [assistantsApiResponseFormatOption](#assistantsapiresponseformatoption) | Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4 Turbo and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.<br><br>Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.<br><br>**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model might generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content might be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.<br> | No |  |


### Properties for tool_resources

#### code_interpreter

### Request Header

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|api-key | True | string | Provide Azure OpenAI API key here|

### Request Body

**Content-Type**: application/json

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default |
|------|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| assistant_id | string | The ID of the assistant to use to execute this run. | Yes |  |
| thread | [createThreadRequest](#createthreadrequest) |  | No |  |
| model | string | The ID of the Model to be used to execute this run. If a value is provided here, it will override the model associated with the assistant. If not, the model associated with the assistant will be used. | No |  |
| instructions | string | Override the default system message of the assistant. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis. | No |  |
| tools | array | Override the tools the assistant can use for this run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis. | No |  |
| tool_resources | object | A set of resources that are used by the assistant's tools. The resources are specific to the type of tool. For example, the `code_interpreter` tool requires a list of file IDs, while the `file_search` tool requires a list of vector store IDs.<br> | No |  |
| metadata | object | Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maximum of 512 characters long.<br> | No |  |
| temperature | number | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.<br> | No | 1 |
| top_p | number | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.<br><br>We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.<br> | No | 1 |
| stream | boolean | If `true`, returns a stream of events that happen during the Run as server-sent events, terminating when the Run enters a terminal state with a `data: [DONE]` message.<br> | No |  |
| max_prompt_tokens | integer | The maximum number of prompt tokens that might be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of prompt tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of prompt tokens specified, the run will end with status `incomplete`. See `incomplete_details` for more info.<br> | No |  |
| max_completion_tokens | integer | The maximum number of completion tokens that might be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of completion tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of completion tokens specified, the run will end with status `incomplete`. See `incomplete_details` for more info.<br> | No |  |
| truncation_strategy | [truncationObject](#truncationobject) | Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. Use this to control the initial context window of the run. | No |  |
| tool_choice | [assistantsApiToolChoiceOption](#assistantsapitoolchoiceoption) | Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.<br>`none` means the model won't call any tools and instead generates a message.<br>`auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a tool.<br>Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "file_search"}` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.<br> | No |  |
| response_format | [assistantsApiResponseFormatOption](#assistantsapiresponseformatoption) | Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4 Turbo and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.<br><br>Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.<br><br>**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model might generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content might be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.<br> | No |  |


### Properties for tool_resources

#### code_interpreter

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
|------|------|-------------|--------|
| file_ids | array | A list of file IDs made available to the `code_interpreter` tool. There can be a maximum of 20 files associated with the tool.<br> | [] |

#### file_search

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
|------|------|-------------|--------|
| vector_store_ids | array | The ID of the vector store attached to this assistant. There can be a maximum of 1 vector store attached to the assistant.<br> |  |

## Create - Run

```HTTP
POST https://{endpoint}/openai/threads/{thread_id}/runs?api-version=2024-05-01-preview
```

Create a run.

### URI Parameters

| Name | In | Required | Type | Description |
|------|------|----------|------|-----------|
| endpoint | path | Yes | string<br>url | Supported Azure OpenAI endpoints (protocol and hostname, for example: `https://aoairesource.openai.azure.com`. Replace "aoairesource" with your Azure OpenAI resource name). https://{your-resource-name}.openai.azure.com |
| thread_id | path | Yes | string |  |
| api-version | query | Yes | string | api version |

### Request Header

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|api-key | True | string | Provide Azure OpenAI API key here|

### Request Body

**Content-Type**: application/json

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default |
|------|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| assistant_id | string | The ID of the assistant to use to execute this run. | Yes |  |
| model | string | The ID of the Model to be used to execute this run. If a value is provided here, it will override the model associated with the assistant. If not, the model associated with the assistant will be used. | No |  |
| instructions | string | Override the default system message of the assistant. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis. | No |  |
| additional_instructions | string | Appends additional instructions at the end of the instructions for the run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis without overriding other instructions. | No |  |
| additional_messages | array | Adds additional messages to the thread before creating the run. | No |  |
| tools | array | Override the tools the assistant can use for this run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis. | No |  |
| metadata | object | Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maximum of 512 characters long.<br> | No |  |
| temperature | number | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.<br> | No | 1 |
| top_p | number | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.<br><br>We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.<br> | No | 1 |
| stream | boolean | If `true`, returns a stream of events that happen during the Run as server-sent events, terminating when the Run enters a terminal state with a `data: [DONE]` message.<br> | No |  |
| max_prompt_tokens | integer | The maximum number of prompt tokens that might be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of prompt tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of prompt tokens specified, the run will end with status `incomplete`. See `incomplete_details` for more info.<br> | No |  |
| max_completion_tokens | integer | The maximum number of completion tokens that might be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of completion tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of completion tokens specified, the run will end with status `incomplete`. See `incomplete_details` for more info.<br> | No |  |
| truncation_strategy | [truncationObject](#truncationobject) | Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. Use this to control the initial context window of the run. | No |  |
| tool_choice | [assistantsApiToolChoiceOption](#assistantsapitoolchoiceoption) | Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.<br>`none` means the model won't call any tools and instead generates a message.<br>`auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a tool.<br>Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "file_search"}` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.<br> | No |  |
| response_format | [assistantsApiResponseFormatOption](#assistantsapiresponseformatoption) | Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4 Turbo and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.<br><br>Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.<br><br>**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model might generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content might be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.<br> | No |  |

### chatCompletionsRequestCommon



| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default |
|------|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| temperature | number | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.<br>We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. | No | 1 |
| top_p | number | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.<br>We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both. | No | 1 |
| stream | boolean | If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. | No | False |
| stop | string or array | Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. | No |  |
| max_tokens | integer | The maximum number of tokens allowed for the generated answer. By default, the number of tokens the model can return will be (4096 - prompt tokens). | No | 4096 |
| presence_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. | No | 0 |
| frequency_penalty | number | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. | No | 0 |
| logit_bias | object | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. | No |  |
| user | string | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help Azure OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. | No |  |

| data_sources | array |   The configuration entries for Azure OpenAI chat extensions that use them.<br>  This additional specification is only compatible with Azure OpenAI. | No |  |
| n | integer | How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. | No | 1 |
| seed | integer | If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result. Determinism isn't guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend. | No | 0 |
| logprobs | boolean | Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`. This option is currently not available on the `gpt-4-vision-preview` model. | No | False |
| top_logprobs | integer | An integer between 0 and 5 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used. | No |  |
| response_format | object | An object specifying the format that the model must output. Used to enable JSON mode. | No |  |
| tools | array | A list of tools the model might call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model might generate JSON inputs for. | No |  |
| tool_choice | [chatCompletionToolChoiceOption](#chatcompletiontoolchoiceoption) | Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model won't call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that function. | No |  |
| functions | array | Deprecated in favor of `tools`. A list of functions the model might generate JSON inputs for. | No |  |
| function_call | string or object | Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`. Controls how the model responds to function calls. "none" means the model doesn't call a function, and responds to the end-user. "auto" means the model can pick between an end-user or calling a function.  Specifying a particular function via `{"name":\ "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function. "none" is the default when no functions are present. "auto" is the default if functions are present. | No |  |

### assistantsApiResponseFormatOption

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4 Turbo and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model might generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content might be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

| temperature | number | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.<br> | No | 1 |
| top_p | number | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.<br><br>We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.<br> | No | 1 |
| response_format | [assistantsApiResponseFormatOption](#assistantsapiresponseformatoption) | Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4 Turbo and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.<br><br>Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.<br><br>**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model might generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content might be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.<br> | No |  |

### assistantStreamEvent

Represents an event emitted when streaming a Run.

Each event in a server-sent events stream has an `event` and `data` property:

```
event: thread.created
data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
```

We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being
streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit `thread.run.created` when a new run
is created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses
to create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created event`, a
`thread.message.in_progress` event, many `thread.message.delta` events, and finally a
`thread.message.completed` event.

We might add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully
in your code.
