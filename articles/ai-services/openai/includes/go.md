[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/ai/azopenai) | [Package (Go)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/ai/azopenai)| [Samples](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/ai/azopenai#pkg-examples)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true)
- Access granted to the Azure OpenAI service in the desired Azure subscription.
    Currently, access to this service is granted only by application. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI Service by completing the form at [https://aka.ms/oai/access](https://aka.ms/oai/access?azure-portal=true).
- [Go 1.21.0](https://go.dev/dl/) or higher installed locally.
- An Azure OpenAI Service resource with the `gpt-35-turbo-instuct` model deployed. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](../how-to/create-resource.md).

## Set up

[!INCLUDE [get-key-endpoint](get-key-endpoint.md)]

[!INCLUDE [environment-variables](environment-variables.md)]

## Create a sample application

 Create a new file named completions.go. Copy the following code into the completions.go file.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os"

	"github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/ai/azopenai"
	"github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azcore/to"
)

func main() {
	azureOpenAIKey := os.Getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_KEY")
	modelDeploymentID := "gpt-35-turbo-instruct"

	azureOpenAIEndpoint := os.Getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT")

	if azureOpenAIKey == "" || modelDeploymentID == "" || azureOpenAIEndpoint == "" {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Skipping example, environment variables missing\n")
		return
	}

	keyCredential, err := azopenai.NewKeyCredential(azureOpenAIKey)

	if err != nil {
		// TODO: handle error
	}

	client, err := azopenai.NewClientWithKeyCredential(azureOpenAIEndpoint, keyCredential, nil)

	if err != nil {
		// TODO: handle error
	}

	resp, err := client.GetCompletions(context.TODO(), azopenai.CompletionsOptions{
		Prompt:       []string{"What is Azure OpenAI, in 20 words or less"},
		MaxTokens:    to.Ptr(int32(2048)),
		Temperature:  to.Ptr(float32(0.0)),
		DeploymentID: modelDeploymentID,
	}, nil)

	if err != nil {
		// TODO: handle error
	}

	for _, choice := range resp.Choices {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Result: %s\n", *choice.Text)
	}

}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](../../../key-vault/general/overview.md). For more information about credential security, see the Azure AI services [security](../../security-features.md) article.

Now open a command prompt and run:

```cmd
go mod init completions.go
```

Next run:

```cmd
go mod tidy
```

```cmd
go run completions.go
```

## Output

```output
== Get completions Sample ==

Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975.
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource, you must first delete any deployed models.

- [Portal](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
- [Azure CLI](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)
