[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/openai/Azure.AI.OpenAI/src) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.OpenAI/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/openai/Azure.AI.OpenAI/tests/Samples)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true)
- Access granted to the Azure OpenAI service in the desired Azure subscription.
    Currently, access to this service is granted only by application. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI Service by completing the form at [https://aka.ms/oai/access](https://aka.ms/oai/access?azure-portal=true).
- The current version of <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core" target="_blank">.NET Core</a>
- An Azure OpenAI Service resource with the `gpt-35-turbo-instruct` model deployed. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](../how-to/create-resource.md).

## Set up

[!INCLUDE [Create a new .NET application](./dotnet-new-application.md)]

[!INCLUDE [get-key-endpoint](get-key-endpoint.md)]

[!INCLUDE [environment-variables](environment-variables.md)]

## Create a sample application

From the project directory, open the *program.cs* file and replace with the following code:

```csharp
using Azure;
using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
using static System.Environment;

string endpoint = GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT");
string key = GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_KEY");

var client = new OpenAIClient(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(key));

CompletionsOptions completionsOptions = new()
{
    DeploymentName = "gpt-35-turbo-instruct", 
    Prompts = { "When was Microsoft founded?" },
};

Response<Completions> completionsResponse = client.GetCompletions(completionsOptions);
string completion = completionsResponse.Value.Choices[0].Text;
Console.WriteLine($"Chatbot: {completion}");
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](../../../key-vault/general/overview.md). For more information about credential security, see the Azure AI services [security](../../security-features.md) article.

```cmd
dotnet run program.cs
```

## Output

```console
Chatbot:

Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975.
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource you must first delete any deployed models.

- [Portal](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
- [Azure CLI](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)
