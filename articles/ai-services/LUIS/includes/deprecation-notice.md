> [!IMPORTANT]
> LUIS will be retired on October 1st 2025 and starting April 1st 2023 you will not be able to create new LUIS resources. We recommend [migrating your LUIS applications](../../language-service/conversational-language-understanding/how-to/migrate-from-luis.md) to [conversational language understanding](../../language-service/conversational-language-understanding/overview.md) to benefit from continued product support and multilingual capabilities.
