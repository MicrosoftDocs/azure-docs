# Explore Azure AI foundation models in Azure AI Studio

In Azure AI Studio, you can quickly try out Azure AI foundation model capabilities such as Speech and Vision.

## Azure AI foundation model capabilities

Foundation models have been pre-trained on vast amounts of data, and that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks with a relatively small amount of domain-specific data. These models serve as a starting point for custom models and accelerate the model-building process for a variety of tasks, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech, and generative AI tasks. 

Azure AI Studio provides the capability to easily integrate these pre-trained foundation models into your applications. See the following sections for more information about the capabilities of Azure AI foundation models in AI Studio.

## Speech

[Azure AI Speech](/azure/ai-services/speech-service/) provides speech to text and text to speech capabilities using a Speech resource. You can transcribe speech to text with high accuracy, produce natural-sounding text to speech voices, translate spoken audio, and use speaker recognition during conversations.

You can try the following capabilities of Azure AI Speech in AI Studio:
- Real-time speech to text: Quickly test live transcription capabilities on your own audio without writing any code.
- Custom voice: Use your own audio recordings to create a distinct, one-of-a-kind voice for your text-to-speech apps.

Explore more Speech capabilities in the [Speech Studio](https://aka.ms/speechstudio/) and the [Azure AI Speech documentation](/azure/ai-services/speech-service/).

## Vision

[Azure AI Vision](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/) gives your apps the ability to read text, analyze images, and detect faces with technology like optical character recognition (OCR) and machine learning.

Explore more vision capabilities in the [Vision Studio](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/) and the [Azure AI Vision documentation](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/).

## Language

[Azure AI Language](/azure/ai-services/language-service/) can interpret natural language, classify documents, get real-time translations, or integrate language into your bot experiences.

Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) features to analyze your textual data using state-of-the-art pre-configured AI models or customize your own models to fit your scenario.
