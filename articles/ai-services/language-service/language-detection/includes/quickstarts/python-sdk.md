[Reference documentation](/python/api/azure-ai-textanalytics/azure.ai.textanalytics?preserve-view=true&view=azure-python) | [More samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/samples) | [Package (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-textanalytics/5.2.0/) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics)


Use this quickstart to create a language detection application with the client library for Python. In the following example, you create a Python application that can identify the language a text sample was written in.

[!INCLUDE [Use Language Studio](../../../includes/use-language-studio.md)]


## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* [Python 3.8 or later](https://www.python.org/)


## Setting up

[!INCLUDE [Create an Azure resource](../../../includes/create-resource.md)]



[!INCLUDE [Get your key and endpoint](../../../includes/get-key-endpoint.md)]



[!INCLUDE [Create environment variables](../../../includes/environment-variables.md)]


### Install the client library

After installing Python, you can install the client library with:

```console
pip install azure-ai-textanalytics==5.2.0
```


## Code example

Create a new Python file and copy the below code. Then run the code.  

```python
# This example requires environment variables named "LANGUAGE_KEY" and "LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT"
language_key = os.environ.get('LANGUAGE_KEY')
language_endpoint = os.environ.get('LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT')

from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

# Authenticate the client using your key and endpoint 
def authenticate_client():
    ta_credential = AzureKeyCredential(language_key)
    text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(
            endpoint=language_endpoint, 
            credential=ta_credential)
    return text_analytics_client

client = authenticate_client()

# Example method for detecting the language of text
def language_detection_example(client):
    try:
        documents = ["Ce document est rédigé en Français."]
        response = client.detect_language(documents = documents, country_hint = 'us')[0]
        print("Language: ", response.primary_language.name)

    except Exception as err:
        print("Encountered exception. {}".format(err))
language_detection_example(client)
```


### Output

```console
Language:  French
```
