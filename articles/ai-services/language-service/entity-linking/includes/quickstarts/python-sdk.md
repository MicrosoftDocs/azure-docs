[Reference documentation](/python/api/azure-ai-textanalytics/azure.ai.textanalytics?preserve-view=true&view=azure-python) | [More samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/samples) | [Package (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-textanalytics/5.2.0/) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics)

Use this quickstart to create an entity linking application with the client library for Python. In the following example, you create a Python application that can identify and disambiguate entities found in text.


## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* [Python 3.7 or later](https://www.python.org/)


## Setting up

[!INCLUDE [Create an Azure resource](../../../includes/create-resource.md)]



[!INCLUDE [Get your key and endpoint](../../../includes/get-key-endpoint.md)]



[!INCLUDE [Create environment variables](../../../includes/environment-variables.md)]


### Install the client library

After installing Python, you can install the client library with:

```console
pip install azure-ai-textanalytics==5.2.0
```



## Code example

Create a new Python file and copy the below code. Then run the code. 

```python
# This example requires environment variables named "LANGUAGE_KEY" and "LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT"
language_key = os.environ.get('LANGUAGE_KEY')
language_endpoint = os.environ.get('LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT')

from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

# Authenticate the client using your key and endpoint. 
def authenticate_client():
    ta_credential = AzureKeyCredential(language_key)
    text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(
            endpoint=language_endpoint, 
            credential=ta_credential)
    return text_analytics_client

client = authenticate_client()

# Example function for recognizing entities and providing a link to an online data source.
def entity_linking_example(client):

    try:
        documents = ["""Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, 
        to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. 
        During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman,
        chief executive officer, president and chief software architect, 
        while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014."""]
        result = client.recognize_linked_entities(documents = documents)[0]

        print("Linked Entities:\n")
        for entity in result.entities:
            print("\tName: ", entity.name, "\tId: ", entity.data_source_entity_id, "\tUrl: ", entity.url,
            "\n\tData Source: ", entity.data_source)
            print("\tMatches:")
            for match in entity.matches:
                print("\t\tText:", match.text)
                print("\t\tConfidence Score: {0:.2f}".format(match.confidence_score))
                print("\t\tOffset: {}".format(match.offset))
                print("\t\tLength: {}".format(match.length))
            
    except Exception as err:
        print("Encountered exception. {}".format(err))
entity_linking_example(client)
```



### Output
