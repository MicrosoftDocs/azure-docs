[Reference documentation](/java/api/overview/azure/ai-textanalytics-readme?preserve-view=true&view=azure-java-stable) | [Additional samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/src/samples) | [Package (Maven)](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-ai-textanalytics/5.2.0) |  [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics)

Use this quickstart to create a key phrase extraction application with the client library for Java. In the following example, you will create a Java application that can identify key words and phrases found in text.

[!INCLUDE [Use Language Studio](../../../includes/use-language-studio.md)]

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (JDK) with version 8 or above
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics"  title="Create a Language resource"  target="_blank">create a Language resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint.  After it deploys, select **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`Free F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
* To use the Analyze feature, you will need a Language resource with the standard (S) pricing tier.



## Setting up

### Add the client library

Create a Maven project in your preferred IDE or development environment. Then add the following dependency to your project's *pom.xml* file. You can find the implementation syntax [for other build tools](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-ai-textanalytics/5.2.0) online.

```xml
<dependencies>
     <dependency>
        <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
        <artifactId>azure-ai-textanalytics</artifactId>
        <version>5.2.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```




## Code example


Create a Java file named `Example.java`. Open the file and copy the below code. Remember to replace the `key` variable with the key for your resource, and replace the `endpoint` variable with the endpoint for your resource. Then run the code. 

[!INCLUDE [find the key and endpoint for a resource](../../../includes/find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```java
import com.azure.core.credential.AzureKeyCredential;
import com.azure.ai.textanalytics.TextAnalyticsClientBuilder;
import com.azure.ai.textanalytics.TextAnalyticsClient;


public class Example {

    private static String KEY = "replace-with-your-key-here";
    private static String ENDPOINT = "replace-with-your-endpoint-here";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextAnalyticsClient client = authenticateClient(KEY, ENDPOINT);
        extractKeyPhrasesExample(client);
    }
    // Method to authenticate the client object with your key and endpoint
    static TextAnalyticsClient authenticateClient(String key, String endpoint) {
        return new TextAnalyticsClientBuilder()
                .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(key))
                .endpoint(endpoint)
                .buildClient();
    }
    // Example method for extracting key phrases from text
    static void extractKeyPhrasesExample(TextAnalyticsClient client)
    {
        // The text to be analyzed
        String text = "Dr. Smith has a very modern medical office, and she has great staff.";

        System.out.printf("Recognized phrases: %n");
        for (String keyPhrase : client.extractKeyPhrases(text)) {
            System.out.printf("%s%n", keyPhrase);
        }
    }
}

```




### Output

```console
Recognized phrases: 

modern medical office
Dr. Smith
great staff
```
