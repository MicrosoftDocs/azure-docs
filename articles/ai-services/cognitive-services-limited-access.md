# Limited Access features for Azure AI services

Our vision is to empower developers and organizations to use AI to transform society in positive ways. We encourage responsible AI practices to protect the rights and safety of individuals. To achieve this, Microsoft has implemented a Limited Access policy grounded in our [AI Principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai) to support responsible deployment of Azure services. 

## What is Limited Access? 

Limited Access services require registration, and only customers managed by Microsoft, meaning those who are working directly with Microsoft account teams, are eligible for access. The use of these services is limited to the use case selected at the time of registration. Customers must acknowledge that they've reviewed and agree to the terms of service. Microsoft may require customers to reverify this information. 

Limited Access services are made available to customers under the terms governing their subscription to Microsoft Azure Services (including the [Service Specific Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2018760)). Review these terms carefully as they contain important conditions and obligations governing your use of Limited Access services.

Please use an email address affiliated with your organization in your registration form. Registration forms submitted with personal email addresses will be denied. 

If you're not a managed customer, we invite you to submit an application using the same forms and we will reach out to you about any opportunities to join an eligibility program. 

### What is a managed customer? What if I don't know whether I'm a managed customer? 

Managed customers work with Microsoft account teams. We invite you to submit a registration form for the features you'd like to use, and we'll verify your eligibility for access. We are not able to accept requests to become a managed customer at this time.

### What happens if I'm an existing customer and I don't register? 

Existing customers have until June 30, 2023 to submit a registration form and be approved to continue using Limited Access services after June 30, 2023. We recommend allowing 10 business days for review. Without an approved application, you will be denied access after June 30, 2023.

### I'm an existing customer who applied for access to Custom Neural Voice or Speaker Recognition, do I have to register to keep using these services? 

We're always looking for opportunities to improve our Responsible AI program, and Limited Access is an update to our service gating processes.

If you're an existing customer using Custom Neural Voice or Speaker Recognition on June 21, 2022, you have until June 30, 2023 to submit a registration form with your selected use case and receive approval to continue using these services after June 30, 2023. We recommend allowing 10 days for application processing. Existing customers can continue using the service until June 30, 2023, after which they must be approved for access.

Your data is subject to Microsoft's data retention [policies](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy/data-management#:~:text=If%20you%20terminate%20a%20cloud,data%20or%20renew%20your%20subscription.).
