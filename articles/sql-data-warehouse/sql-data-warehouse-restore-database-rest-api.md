# Restore an Azure SQL Data Warehouse (REST API)

- [REST][]

In this article you will learn how to restore an Azure SQL Data Warehouse using the REST API.

## Before you begin

**Verify your DTU capacity.** Each SQL Data Warehouse is hosted by a SQL server (e.g. myserver.database.windows.net) which has a default DTU quota.  Before you can restore a SQL Data Warehouse, verify that the your SQL server has enough remaining DTU quota for the database being restored. To learn how to calculate DTU needed or to request more DTU, see [Request a DTU quota change][].

## Restore an active or paused database

To restore a database:

1. Get the list of database restore points using the Get Database Restore Points operation.
2. Begin your restore by using the [Create database restore request][] operation.
3. Track the status of your restore by using the [Database operation status][] operation.

>[AZURE.NOTE] After the restore has completed, you can configure your recovered database by following the [Finalize a recovered database][] guide.

## Restore a deleted database

To restore a deleted database:

1.	List all of your restorable deleted databases by using the [List restorable dropped databases][] operation.
2.	Get the details for the deleted database you want to restore by using the [Get restorable dropped database][] operation.
3.	Begin your restore by using the [Create database restore request][] operation.
4.	Track the status of your restore by using the [Database operation status][] operation.

>[AZURE.NOTE] After the restore has completed, you can configure your recovered database by following the [Finalize a recovered database][] guide.
