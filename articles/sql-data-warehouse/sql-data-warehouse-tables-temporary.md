Temporary tables are very useful when processing data - especially during transformation where the intermediate results are transient. In SQL Data Warehouse temporary tables exist at the session level.  They are only visible to the session in which they were created and are automatically dropped when that session logs off.  Temporary tables offer a performance benefit because their results are written to local rather than remote storage.  Temporary tables are slightly different in Azure SQL Data Warehouse than Azure SQL Database as they can be accessed from anywhere inside the session, including both inside and outside of a stored procedure.

This article contains essential guidance for using temporary tables and highlights the principles of session level temporary tables. Using the information in this article can help you modularize your code, improving both reusability and ease of maintenance of your code.

## Create a temporary table

Temporary tables are created by simply prefixing your table name with a `#`.  For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE #stats_ddl
(
	[schema_name]		NVARCHAR(128) NOT NULL
,	[table_name]            NVARCHAR(128) NOT NULL
,	[stats_name]            NVARCHAR(128) NOT NULL
,	[stats_is_filtered]     BIT           NOT NULL
,	[seq_nmbr]              BIGINT        NOT NULL
,	[two_part_name]         NVARCHAR(260) NOT NULL
,	[three_part_name]       NVARCHAR(400) NOT NULL
)
WITH
(
	DISTRIBUTION = HASH([seq_nmbr])
,	HEAP
)
```

Temporary tables can also be created with a `CTAS` using exactly the same approach:

```sql
CREATE TABLE #stats_ddl
WITH
(
	DISTRIBUTION = HASH([seq_nmbr])
,	HEAP
)
AS
(
SELECT
		sm.[name]				                                                AS [schema_name]
,		tb.[name]				                                                AS [table_name]
,		st.[name]				                                                AS [stats_name]
,		st.[has_filter]			                                                AS [stats_is_filtered]
,       ROW_NUMBER()
        OVER(ORDER BY (SELECT NULL))                                            AS [seq_nmbr]
,								 QUOTENAME(sm.[name])+'.'+QUOTENAME(tb.[name])  AS [two_part_name]
,		QUOTENAME(DB_NAME())+'.'+QUOTENAME(sm.[name])+'.'+QUOTENAME(tb.[name])  AS [three_part_name]
FROM	sys.objects			AS ob
JOIN	sys.stats			AS st	ON	ob.[object_id]		= st.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.stats_columns	AS sc	ON	st.[stats_id]		= sc.[stats_id]
									AND st.[object_id]		= sc.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.columns			AS co	ON	sc.[column_id]		= co.[column_id]
									AND	sc.[object_id]		= co.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.tables			AS tb	ON	co.[object_id]		= tb.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.schemas			AS sm	ON	tb.[schema_id]		= sm.[schema_id]
WHERE	1=1
AND		st.[user_created]   = 1
GROUP BY
		sm.[name]
,		tb.[name]
,		st.[name]
,		st.[filter_definition]
,		st.[has_filter]
)
SELECT
    CASE @update_type
    WHEN 1
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+');'
    WHEN 2
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+') WITH FULLSCAN;'
    WHEN 3
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+') WITH SAMPLE '+CAST(@sample_pct AS VARCHAR(20))+' PERCENT;'
    WHEN 4
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+') WITH RESAMPLE;'
    END AS [update_stats_ddl]
,   [seq_nmbr]
FROM    t1
;
``` 

>[AZURE.NOTE] `CTAS` is a very powerful command and has the added advantage of being very efficient in its use of transaction log space. 


## Dropping temporary tables

When a new session is created, no temporary tables should exist.  However, if you are calling the same stored procedure, which creates a temporary with the same name, to ensure that your `CREATE TABLE` statements are successful a simple pre-existence check with a `DROP` can be used as in the below example:

```sql
IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb..#stats_ddl') IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
	DROP TABLE #stats_ddl
END
```

For coding consistency, it is a good practice to use this pattern for both tables and temporary tables.  It is also a good idea to use `DROP TABLE` to remove temporary tables when you have finished with them in your code.  In stored procedure development it is quite common to see the drop commands bundled together at the end of a procedure to ensure these objects are cleaned up.

```sql
DROP TABLE #stats_ddl
```

## Modularizing code

Since temporary tables can be seen anywhere in a user session, this can be exploited to help you modularize your application code.  For example, the stored procedure below brings together the recommended practices from above to generate DDL which will update all statistics in the database by statistic name.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE    [dbo].[prc_sqldw_update_stats]
(   @update_type    tinyint -- 1 default 2 fullscan 3 sample 4 resample
	,@sample_pct     tinyint
)
AS

IF @update_type NOT IN (1,2,3,4)
BEGIN;
    THROW 151000,'Invalid value for @update_type parameter. Valid range 1 (default), 2 (fullscan), 3 (sample) or 4 (resample).',1;
END;

IF @sample_pct IS NULL
BEGIN;
    SET @sample_pct = 20;
END;

IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb..#stats_ddl') IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
	DROP TABLE #stats_ddl
END

CREATE TABLE #stats_ddl
WITH
(
	DISTRIBUTION = HASH([seq_nmbr])
)
AS
(
SELECT
		sm.[name]				                                                AS [schema_name]
,		tb.[name]				                                                AS [table_name]
,		st.[name]				                                                AS [stats_name]
,		st.[has_filter]			                                                AS [stats_is_filtered]
,       ROW_NUMBER()
        OVER(ORDER BY (SELECT NULL))                                            AS [seq_nmbr]
,								 QUOTENAME(sm.[name])+'.'+QUOTENAME(tb.[name])  AS [two_part_name]
,		QUOTENAME(DB_NAME())+'.'+QUOTENAME(sm.[name])+'.'+QUOTENAME(tb.[name])  AS [three_part_name]
FROM	sys.objects			AS ob
JOIN	sys.stats			AS st	ON	ob.[object_id]		= st.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.stats_columns	AS sc	ON	st.[stats_id]		= sc.[stats_id]
									AND st.[object_id]		= sc.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.columns			AS co	ON	sc.[column_id]		= co.[column_id]
									AND	sc.[object_id]		= co.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.tables			AS tb	ON	co.[object_id]		= tb.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.schemas			AS sm	ON	tb.[schema_id]		= sm.[schema_id]
WHERE	1=1
AND		st.[user_created]   = 1
GROUP BY
		sm.[name]
,		tb.[name]
,		st.[name]
,		st.[filter_definition]
,		st.[has_filter]
)
SELECT
    CASE @update_type
    WHEN 1
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+');'
    WHEN 2
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+') WITH FULLSCAN;'
    WHEN 3
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+') WITH SAMPLE '+CAST(@sample_pct AS VARCHAR(20))+' PERCENT;'
    WHEN 4
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+') WITH RESAMPLE;'
    END AS [update_stats_ddl]
,   [seq_nmbr]
FROM    t1
;
GO
```

At this stage the only action that has occurred is the creation of a stored procedure which will simply generated a temporary table, #stats_ddl, with DDL statements.  This stored procedure will drop #stats_ddl if it already exists to ensure it does not fail if run more than once within a session.  However, since there is no `DROP TABLE` at the end of the stored procedure, when the stored procedure completes, it will leave the created table so that it can be read outside of the stored procedure.  In SQL Data Warehouse, unlike other SQL Server databases, it is possible to use the temporary table outside of the procedure that created it.  SQL Data Warehouse temporary tables can be used **anywhere** inside the session. This can lead to more modular and manageable code as in the below example:

```sql
EXEC [dbo].[prc_sqldw_update_stats] @update_type = 1, @sample_pct = NULL;

DECLARE @i INT              = 1
,       @t INT              = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM #stats_ddl)
,       @s NVARCHAR(4000)   = N''

WHILE @i <= @t
BEGIN
    SET @s=(SELECT update_stats_ddl FROM #stats_ddl WHERE seq_nmbr = @i);

    PRINT @s
    EXEC sp_executesql @s
    SET @i+=1;
END

DROP TABLE #stats_ddl;
```

## Temporary table limitations

SQL Data Warehouse does impose a couple of limitations when implementing temporary tables.  Currently, only session scoped temporary tables are supported.  Global Temporary Tables are not supported.  In addition, views cannot be created on temporary tables.
