# Export or delete settings in the Azure portal
You can export and delete the following settings from the Azure portal settings menu:
* Azure portal private dashboards
* User settings like favorite subscriptions or directories, and last logged in directory
* Themes and customizations

We strongly recommend that you export and review your settings before you delete them. It can be time consuming to rebuild the dashboards and re-add your customizations.

**Export or delete your portal settings**

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com).
2. On the top right of the portal, select **Settings**.

3. Select **Export all settings** or **Delete all settings and private dashboards**.

      The following table describes these settings. 

      | Setting | Description |
      | --- | --- |
      | **Export all settings** | Creates a .json file that contains your user settings like your dashboard theme.|
      | **Delete all settings and private dashboards** | Deletes all links to private dashboards and other user customizations you've made to the portal dashboard. |
