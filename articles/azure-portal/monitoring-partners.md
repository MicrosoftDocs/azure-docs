## DataDog
Datadog is the world’s leading monitoring service for cloud-scale applications, bringing together data from servers, databases, tools and services to present a unified view of your entire stack. These capabilities are provided on a SaaS-based data analytics platform that enables Dev and Ops teams to work collaboratively to avoid downtime, resolve performance problems, and ensure that development and deployment cycles finish on time. By integrating Datadog and Azure, you can collect and view metrics from across your infrastructure, correlate VM metrics with application-level metrics, and slice and dice your metrics using any combination of properties and custom tags.

## Dynatrace
The Dynatrace OneAgent integrates with Azure VMs and App Services via the according Azure extension mechanisms. 
This way we can gather performance metrics about hosts, network and services.
Besides just displaying metrics we visualize environments end-to-end, showing transactions from the client side to the database layer.
AI-based correlation of problems and fully integrated root-cause-analysis, including method level insights into code and database, make troubleshooting and performance optimizations much easier.
