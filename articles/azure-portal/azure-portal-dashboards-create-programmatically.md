# Programmatically create Azure dashboards

This article walks you through the process of programmatically creating and publishing Azure dashboards. The sample dashboard shown below is referenced throughout the document.

## Overview

Shared dashboards in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) are [resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md), just like virtual machines and storage accounts. You can manage resources programmatically by using the [Azure Resource Manager REST APIs](/rest/api/), the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure), and [Azure PowerShell commands](/powershell/azure/get-started-azureps).

Many features build on these APIs to make resource management easier. Each of these APIs and tools offers ways to create, list, retrieve, modify, and delete resources. Since dashboards are resources, you can pick your favorite API or tool to use.

Whichever tools you use, to create a dashboard programmatically, you construct a JSON representation of your dashboard object. This object contains information about the tiles on the dashboard. It includes sizes, positions, resources they're bound to, and any user customizations.

The most practical way to generate this JSON document is to use the Azure portal to create an initial dashboard with the tiles you want. Then export the JSON and create a template from the result that you can modify further and use in scripts, programs, and deployment tools.

## Create a dashboard

To create a dashboard, select **Dashboard** from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) menu, then select **New dashboard**.

For detailed instructions, see [Create a dashboard in the Azure portal](azure-portal-dashboards.md).

## Share the dashboard

After you configure the dashboard, the next step is to publish the dashboard using the **Share** command.

When you share a dashboard, you'll need to choose which subscription and resource group to publish to. You must have write access to the subscription and resource group that you choose. For more information, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).

For detailed instructions, see [Share Azure dashboards by using Azure role-based access control](azure-portal-dashboard-share-access.md).

## Fetch the JSON representation of the dashboard

Sharing the dashboard only takes a few seconds. When it's done, the next step is to export the JSON using the **Download** command.

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-portal-dashboards-create-programmatically/download-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the command to export the JSON representation of a template in the Azure portal.":::

You can also retrieve information about the dashboard resource programmatically by using [REST APIs](/rest/api/resources/Resources/Get) or other methods.

## Create a template from the JSON

The next step is to create a template from this JSON. You'll be able to use the template programmatically with the appropriate resource management APIs, command-line tools, or within the portal.

You don't have to fully understand the dashboard JSON structure to create a template. In most cases, you want to preserve the structure and configuration of each tile. Then parameterize the set of Azure resources that the tiles point to.

Look at your exported JSON dashboard and find all occurrences of Azure resource IDs. Our example dashboard has multiple tiles that all point at a single Azure virtual machine. That's because our dashboard only looks at this single resource. If you search the sample JSON, included at the end of the document, for "/subscriptions", you'll find several occurrences of this ID.

`/subscriptions/6531c8c8-df32-4254-d717-b6e983273e5d/resourceGroups/contoso/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM1`

To publish this dashboard for any virtual machine in the future, parameterize every occurrence of this string within the JSON.

There are two approaches for APIs that create resources in Azure:

- Imperative APIs create one resource at a time. For more information, see [Resources](/rest/api/resources/resources).
- A template-based deployment system that creates multiple, dependent resources with a single API call. For more information, see  [Deploy resources with Resource Manager templates and Azure PowerShell](../azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-powershell.md).

Template-based deployment supports parameterization and templating. We use this approach in this article.

## Programmatically create a dashboard from your template using a template deployment

Azure offers the ability to orchestrate the deployment of multiple resources. You create a deployment template that expresses the set of resources to deploy and the relationships between them.  The JSON format of each resource is the same as if you were creating them one by one. The difference is that the template language adds a few concepts like variables, parameters, basic functions, and more. This extended syntax is only supported in the context of a template deployment. It doesn't work if used with the imperative APIs discussed earlier. For more information, see [Understand the structure and syntax of Azure Resource Manager templates](../azure-resource-manager/templates/syntax.md).

Parameterization should be done using the template's parameter syntax.  You replace all instances of the resource ID we found earlier as shown here.

Example JSON property with hard-coded resource ID:

```json
id: "/subscriptions/6531c8c8-df32-4254-d717-b6e983273e5d/resourceGroups/contoso/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM1"
```

Example JSON property converted to a parameterized version based on template parameters

```json
id: "[resourceId(parameters('virtualMachineResourceGroup'), 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines', parameters('virtualMachineName'))]"
```

Declare required template metadata and the parameters at the top of the JSON template like this:

```json

{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {
        "virtualMachineName": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "virtualMachineResourceGroup": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "dashboardName": {
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "variables": {},

    ... rest of template omitted ...
```

Once you've configured your template, deploy it using any of the following methods:

- [REST APIs](/rest/api/resources/deployments)
- [PowerShell](../azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-powershell.md)
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/deployment/group#az-deployment-group-create)
- [The Azure portal template deployment page](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template)

Next you'll see two versions of our example dashboard JSON. The first is the version that we exported from the portal that was already bound to a resource. The second is the template version that can be programmatically bound to any virtual machine and deployed using Azure Resource Manager.

### JSON representation of our example dashboard

This example is similar to what you'll see if you followed along with this article. The instructions exported the JSON representation of a dashboard that is already deployed. The hard-coded resource identifiers show that this dashboard is pointing at a specific Azure virtual machine.

### Template representation of our example dashboard

The template version of the dashboard has defined three parameters called `virtualMachineName`, `virtualMachineResourceGroup`, and `dashboardName`.  The parameters let you point this dashboard at a different Azure virtual machine every time you deploy. This dashboard can be programmatically configured and deployed to point to any Azure virtual machine. To test this feature, copy the following template and paste it into the [Azure portal template deployment page](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template).

This example deploys a dashboard by itself, but the template language lets you deploy multiple resources, and bundle one or more dashboards alongside them.

Now that you've seen an example of using a parameterized template to deploy a dashboard, you can try deploying the template by using the [Azure Resource Manager REST APIs](/rest/api/), the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure), or [Azure PowerShell commands](/powershell/azure/get-started-azureps).

## Programmatically create a dashboard by using Azure CLI

Prepare your environment for the Azure CLI.

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

- These examples use the following dashboard: [portal-dashboard-template-testvm.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-docs-powershell-samples/master/azure-portal/portal-dashboard-template-testvm.json). Be sure to replace all of the content in angled brackets with your values.

Run the [az portal dashboard create](/cli/azure/portal/dashboard#az-portal-dashboard-create) command to create a dashboard based on your template:

```azurecli
az portal dashboard create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name 'Simple VM Dashboard' \
   --input-path portal-dashboard-template-testvm.json --location centralus
```

You can update a dashboard by using the [az portal dashboard update](/cli/azure/portal/dashboard#az-portal-dashboard-update) command:

```azurecli
az portal dashboard update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name 'Simple VM Dashboard' \
--input-path portal-dashboard-template-testvm.json --location centralus
```

See the details of a dashboard by running the [az portal dashboard show](/cli/azure/portal/dashboard#az-portal-dashboard-show) command:

```azurecli
az portal dashboard show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name 'Simple VM Dashboard'
```

To see all the dashboards for the current subscription, use [az portal dashboard list](/cli/azure/portal/dashboard#az-portal-dashboard-list):

```azurecli
az portal dashboard list
```

You can also see all the dashboards for a resource group:

```azurecli
az portal dashboard list --resource-group myResourceGroup
```
