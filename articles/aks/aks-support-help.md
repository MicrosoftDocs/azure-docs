# Support and troubleshooting for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

## Self help troubleshooting

The [AKS troubleshooting documentation](/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/welcome-azure-kubernetes) provides guidance for how to diagnose and resolve issues that you might encounter when using AKS. These articles cover how to troubleshoot deployment failures, security-related problems, connection issues, and more.

## Post a question on Microsoft Q&A

:::image type="icon" source="./media/logos/microsoft-logo.png" alt-text="":::

Azure's preferred destination for community support, [Microsoft Q&A](/answers/products/azure), allows you to ask technical questions and engage with Azure engineers, Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs), partners, and customers. When you ask a question, make sure you use the `azure-kubernetes-service` tag. You can also submit your own answers and help other community members with their questions.

If you can't find an answer to your problem using search, you can submit a new question to Microsoft Q&A and tag it with the appropriate Azure service and area.

The following table lists the tags for AKS and related services:

| Area | Tag |
|-------|----------------------|
| [Azure Kubernetes Service](intro-kubernetes.md) | [azure-kubernetes-service](/answers/topics/azure-kubernetes-service.html)|

## Create an Azure support request

Explore the range of [Azure support options](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans) and choose a plan that best fits your needs. Azure customers can create and manage support requests in the Azure portal.

If you already have an Azure Support Plan, you can [open a support request](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest).

## Create a GitHub issue
