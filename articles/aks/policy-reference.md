# Azure Policy built-in definitions for Azure Kubernetes Service

This page is an index of [Azure Policy](../governance/policy/overview.md) built-in policy
definitions for Azure Kubernetes Service. For additional Azure Policy built-ins for other services,
see [Azure Policy built-in definitions](../governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies.md).

The name of each built-in policy definition links to the policy definition in the Azure portal. Use
the link in the **Version** column to view the source on the
[Azure Policy GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy).
