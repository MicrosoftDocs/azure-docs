abstract:
  description: Azure Media Services is a cloud-based media workflow platform that enables you to build solutions that require encoding, packaging, content-protection, and live event broadcasting. Azure Media Services integrates seamlessly with the Azure CDN to scale delivery with CDN services from Akamai and Verizon, enabling customers to select the right solution for their needs—for example, for load balance across content delivery networks. Azure Media Services Video Indexer enables you to extract metadata and insights using AI with the built-in video and audio analyzer presets. You can easily improve accuracy by training the provided AI models with your own content using the Video Indexer API.
