#How to configure on-premise encoders when using Azure Media Services to create multi-bitrate streams

This topic lists on-premises live encoders that you can use to capture your live events and send a single bitrate live stream to AMS channels (that are live encoding enabled) for further processing. The topic also links to tutorials that show how to configure listed encoders.
