### Examine and edit the sample files

As part of the prerequisites, you downloaded the sample code to a folder. Follow these steps to examine and edit the sample files.

1. In Visual Studio Code, go to *src/edge*. You see your *.env* file and a few deployment template files.

    The deployment template refers to the deployment manifest for the edge device. It includes some placeholder values. The *.env* file includes the values for those variables.
1. Go to the *src/cloud-to-device-console-app* folder. Here you see your *appsettings.json* file and a few other files:

    * ***c2d-console-app.csproj*** - The project file for Visual Studio Code.
    * ***operations.json*** - A list of the operations that you want the program to run.
    * ***Program.cs*** - The sample program code. This code:

        * Loads the app settings.
        * Invokes direct methods that the Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge module exposes. You can use the module to analyze live video streams by invoking its [direct methods](../../../direct-methods.md).
        * Pauses so that you can examine the program's output in the **TERMINAL** window and examine the events that were generated by the module in the **OUTPUT** window.
        * Invokes direct methods to clean up resources.
1. Edit the *operations.json* file:
    * Change the link to the graph topology:

        `"topologyUrl" : "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/live-video-analytics/master/MediaGraph/topologies/httpExtension/topology.json"`

    * Under `GraphInstanceSet`, edit the name of the graph topology to match the value in the preceding link:

      `"topologyName" : "InferencingWithHttpExtension"`

    * Under `GraphTopologyDelete`, edit the name:

      `"name": "InferencingWithHttpExtension"`

### Generate and deploy the IoT Edge deployment manifest

1. Right-click the *src/edge/ deployment.yolov3.template.json* file and then select **Generate IoT Edge Deployment Manifest**.

    ![Generate IoT Edge Deployment Manifest](../../../media/quickstarts/generate-iot-edge-deployment-manifest-yolov3.png)  

    The *deployment.yolov3.amd64.json* manifest file is created in the *src/edge/config* folder.
1. If you completed the [Detect motion and emit events](../../../detect-motion-emit-events-quickstart.md) quickstart, then skip this step. 

    Otherwise, near the **AZURE IOT HUB** pane in the lower-left corner, select the **More actions** icon and then select **Set IoT Hub Connection String**. You can copy the string from the *appsettings.json* file. Or, to ensure you've configured the proper IoT hub within Visual Studio Code, use the [Select IoT hub command](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azure-iot-toolkit/wiki/Select-IoT-Hub).
    
    ![Set IoT Hub Connection String](../../../media/quickstarts/set-iotconnection-string.png)
1. Right-click *src/edge/config/ deployment.yolov3.amd64.json* and select **Create Deployment for Single Device**. 

    ![Create Deployment for Single Device](../../../media/quickstarts/create-deployment-single-device.png)
1. When you're prompted to select an IoT Hub device, select **lva-sample-device**.
1. After about 30 seconds, in the lower-left corner of the window, refresh Azure IoT Hub. The edge device now shows the following deployed modules:

    * The Live Video Analytics module, named `lvaEdge`.
    * The `rtspsim` module, which simulates an RTSP server and acts as the source of a live video feed.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you are using your own edge device instead of the one provisioned by our setup script, go to your edge device and run the following commands with **admin rights**, to pull and store the sample video file used for this quickstart:  
        
        ```
        mkdir /home/lvaadmin/samples
        mkdir /home/lvaadmin/samples/input    
        curl https://lvamedia.blob.core.windows.net/public/camera-300s.mkv > /home/lvaadmin/samples/input/camera-300s.mkv  
        chown -R lvaadmin /home/lvaadmin/samples/  
        ```
        * The `yolov3` module, which is the YoloV3 object detection model that applies computer vision to the images and returns multiple classes of object types
 
      ![Modules that are deployed in the edge device](../../../media/quickstarts/yolov3.png)

### Prepare to monitor events

Right-click the Live Video Analytics device and select **Start Monitoring Built-in Event Endpoint**. You need this step to monitor the IoT Hub events in the **OUTPUT** window of Visual Studio Code. 

![Start monitoring](../../../media/quickstarts/start-monitoring-iothub-events.png) 

### Run the sample program

1. To start a debugging session, select the F5 key. You see messages printed in the **TERMINAL** window.
1. The *operations.json* code starts off with calls to the direct methods `GraphTopologyList` and `GraphInstanceList`. If you cleaned up resources after you completed previous quickstarts, then this process will return empty lists and then pause. To continue, select the Enter key.

   ```
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Executing operation GraphTopologyList
   -----------------------  Request: GraphTopologyList  --------------------------------------------------
   {
   "@apiVersion": "1.0"
   }
   ---------------  Response: GraphTopologyList - Status: 200  ---------------
   {
   "value": []
   }
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Executing operation WaitForInput
   Press Enter to continue
   ```

    The **TERMINAL** window shows the next set of direct method calls:

     * A call to `GraphTopologySet` that uses the preceding `topologyUrl`
     * A call to `GraphInstanceSet` that uses the following body:

         ```
         {
           "@apiVersion": "1.0",
           "name": "Sample-Graph-1",
           "properties": {
             "topologyName": "InferencingWithHttpExtension",
             "description": "Sample graph description",
             "parameters": [
               {
                 "name": "rtspUrl",
                 "value": "rtsp://rtspsim:554/media/camera-300s.mkv"
               },
               {
                 "name": "rtspUserName",
                 "value": "testuser"
               },
               {
                 "name": "rtspPassword",
                 "value": "testpassword"
               }
             ]
           }
         }
         ```

     * A call to `GraphInstanceActivate` that starts the graph instance and the flow of video
     * A second call to `GraphInstanceList` that shows that the graph instance is in the running state
1. The output in the **TERMINAL** window pauses at a `Press Enter to continue` prompt. Don't select Enter yet. Scroll up to see the JSON response payloads for the direct methods you invoked.
1. Switch to the **OUTPUT** window in Visual Studio Code. You see messages that the Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge module is sending to the IoT hub. The following section of this quickstart discusses these messages.
1. The media graph continues to run and print results. The RTSP simulator keeps looping the source video. To stop the media graph, return to the **TERMINAL** window and select Enter. 

    The next series of calls cleans up resources:
      * A call to `GraphInstanceDeactivate` deactivates the graph instance.
      * A call to `GraphInstanceDelete` deletes the instance.
      * A call to `GraphTopologyDelete` deletes the topology.
      * A final call to `GraphTopologyList` shows that the list is empty.
