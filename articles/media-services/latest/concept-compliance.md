# Media Services regulatory compliance

[!INCLUDE [media services api v3 logo](./includes/v3-hr.md)]

Media Services meets the demanding requirements of the US Federal Risk & Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) and of the US Department of Defense, from information impact levels 2 through 5. By deploying protected services including Azure Government, Office 365 U.S. Government, and Dynamics 365 Government, federal, and defense agencies can use a rich array of compliant services.

## FedRAMP and US Department of Defense compliance

Media Services Public services are compliant with the Department of Defense Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide 2 (DoD CC SRG IL 2) and FedRAMP High.

Media Services Government services are compliant with DoD CC SRG IL 2, DoD CC SRG IL 4, DoD CC SRG IL 5, and FedRAMP High.

A review of Media Services by 3PAO and JAB isn't planned for 2020.

Read more about Azure services compliance in the [Azure services by FedRAMP and DoD CC SRG audit scope](../../azure-government/compliance/azure-services-in-fedramp-auditscope.md) article.
