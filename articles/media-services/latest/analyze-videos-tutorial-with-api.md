# Tutorial: Analyze videos with Azure Media Services 

This tutorial shows you how to analyze videos with Azure Media Services. There are many scenarios in which you might want to gain deep insights into recorded videos or audio content. For example, to achieve higher customer satisfaction, organizations can run speech-to-text processing to convert customer support recordings into a searchabe catalog, with indexes and dashboards. Then, they can obtain insights into their business such as a list of common complaints, sources of such complaints, etc.

This tutorial shows you how to:

## Prerequisites

If you do not have Visual Studio installed, you can get [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15).

## Download the sample

Clone a GitHub repository that contains the .NET sample to your machine using the following command:  

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet-tutorials.git
 ```

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

[!INCLUDE [media-services-cli-create-v3-account-include](../../../includes/media-services-cli-create-v3-account-include.md)]

[!INCLUDE [media-services-v3-cli-access-api-include](../../../includes/media-services-v3-cli-access-api-include.md)]

## Examine the sample code in detail

This section examines functions defined in the [Program.cs](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet-tutorials/blob/master/AMSV3Tutorials/AnalyzeVideos/Program.cs) file of the *AnalyzeVideos* project.

### Start using Media Services APIs with .NET SDK

To start using Media Services APIs with .NET, you need to create an **AzureMediaServicesClient** object. To create the object, you need to supply credentials needed for the client to connect to Azure using Azure AD. You first need to get a token and then create a **ClientCredential** object from the returned token. In the code you cloned at the beginning of the article, the **ArmClientCredential** object is used to get the token.  

```csharp
private static IAzureMediaServicesClient CreateMediaServicesClient(ConfigWrapper config)
{
    ArmClientCredentials credentials = new ArmClientCredentials(config);

    return new AzureMediaServicesClient(config.ArmEndpoint, credentials)
    {
        SubscriptionId = config.SubscriptionId,
    };
}
```

### Create an output asset to store the result of a job 

The output asset stores the result of your job. The project defines the **DownloadResults** function that downloads the results from this output asset into the "output" folder, so you can see what you got.

```csharp
private static Asset CreateOutputAsset(IAzureMediaServicesClient client, string resourceGroupName, string accountName, string assetName)
{
    // Check if an Asset already exists
    Asset outputAsset = client.Assets.Get(resourceGroupName, accountName, assetName);
    Asset asset = new Asset();
    string outputAssetName = assetName;

    if (outputAsset != null)
    {
        // Name collision! In order to get the sample to work, let's just go ahead and create a unique asset name
        // Note that the returned Asset can have a different name than the one specified as an input parameter.
        // You may want to update this part to throw an Exception instead, and handle name collisions differently.
        string uniqueness = @"-" + Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
        outputAssetName += uniqueness;
    }

    return client.Assets.CreateOrUpdate(resourceGroupName, accountName, outputAssetName, asset);
}
```
### Create a transform and a job that analyzes videos

When encoding or processing content in Media Services, it is a common pattern to set up the encoding settings as a recipe. You would then submit a **Job** to apply that recipe to a video. By submitting new Jobs for each new video, you are applying that recipe to all the videos in your library. A recipe in Media Services is called as a **Transform**. For more information, see [Transforms and jobs](transform-concept.md). The sample described in this tutorial defines a recipe that analyzes the specified video. 

#### Transform

When creating a new **Transform** instance, you need to specify what you want it to produce as an output. The required parameter is a **TransformOutput** object, as shown in the code above. Each **TransformOutput** contains a **Preset**. **Preset** describes step-by-step instructions of video and/or audio processing operations that are to be used to generate the desired **TransformOutput**. In this example, the **VideoAnalyzerPreset** preset is used and the language ("en-US") is passed to its constructor. This preset enables you to extract multiple audio and video insights from a video. You can use the **AudioAnalyzerPreset** preset if you need to extract multiple audio insights from a video. 

When creating a **Transform**, you should first check if one already exists using the **Get** method, as shown in the code that follows.  In Media Services v3, **Get** methods on entities return **null** if the entity doesn’t exist (a case-insensitive check on the name).

```csharp
private static Transform EnsureTransformExists(IAzureMediaServicesClient client, 
    string resourceGroupName, 
    string accountName, 
    string transformName, 
    Preset preset)
{
    // Does a Transform already exist with the desired name? Assume that an existing Transform with the desired name
    // also uses the same recipe or Preset for processing content.
    Transform transform = client.Transforms.Get(resourceGroupName, accountName, transformName);

    if (transform == null)
    {
        // Start by defining the desired outputs.
        TransformOutput[] outputs = new TransformOutput[]
        {
            new TransformOutput(preset),
        };

        transform = client.Transforms.CreateOrUpdate(resourceGroupName, accountName, transformName, outputs);
    }

    return transform;
}
```

#### Job

As mentioned above, the **Transform** object is the recipe and a **Job** is the actual request to Media Services to apply that **Transform** to a given input video or audio content. The **Job** specifies information like the location of the input video, and the location for the output. You can specify the location of your video using: HTTPS URLs, SAS URLs, or Assets that are in your Media Service account. 

In this example, the input video is uploaded from a specified HTTPS URL.  

```csharp
private static Job SubmitJob(IAzureMediaServicesClient client, string resourceGroupName, string accountName, string transformName, string jobName, string outputAssetName)
{
    JobInputHttp jobInput =
        new JobInputHttp(files: new[] { "https://nimbuscdn-nimbuspm.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/2b533311-b215-4409-80af-529c3e853622/Ignite-short.mp4" });
            
    string uniqueJobName = jobName;
    Job job = client.Jobs.Get(resourceGroupName, accountName, transformName, jobName);

    if (job != null)
    {
        // Job already exists with the same name, so let's append a GUID
        string uniqueness = @"-" + Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
        uniqueJobName += uniqueness;
    }

    JobOutput[] jobOutputs =
    {
        new JobOutputAsset(outputAssetName),
    };

    job = client.Jobs.Create(
                resourceGroupName,
                accountName,
                transformName,
                uniqueJobName,
                new Job
                {
                    Input = jobInput,
                    Outputs = jobOutputs,
                });

    return job;
}
```

### Wait for the job to complete

The job takes some time to complete and when it does you want to be notified. There are different options to get notified about the job completion. The simplest option (that is shown here) is to use polling. 

Polling is not a recommended best practice for production applications because of potential latency. Polling can be throttled if overused on an account. Developers should instead use Event Grid.

Event Grid is designed for high availability, consistent performance, and dynamic scale. With Event Grid, your apps can listen for and react to events from virtually all Azure services, as well as custom sources. Simple, HTTP-based reactive event handling helps you build efficient solutions through intelligent filtering and routing of events. See [Route events to a custom web endpoint](job-state-events-cli-how-to.md).

The **Job** usually goes through the following states: **Scheduled**, **Queued**, **Processing**, **Finished** (the final state). If the job has encountered an error, you get the **Error** state. If the job is in the process of being canceled, you get **Canceling** and **Canceled** when it is done.

```csharp
private static Job WaitForJobToFinish(IAzureMediaServicesClient client,
    string resourceGroupName,
    string accountName,
    string transformName,
    string jobName)
{
    int SleepInterval = 60 * 1000;

    Job job = null;

    while (true)
    {
        job = client.Jobs.Get(resourceGroupName, accountName, transformName, jobName);

        if (job.State == JobState.Finished || job.State == JobState.Error || job.State == JobState.Canceled)
        {
            break;
        }

        Console.WriteLine($"Job is {job.State}.");
        for (int i = 0; i < job.Outputs.Count; i++)
        {
            JobOutput output = job.Outputs[i];
            Console.Write($"\tJobOutput[{i}] is {output.State}.");
            if (output.State == JobState.Processing)
            {
                Console.Write($"  Progress: {output.Progress}");
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(SleepInterval);
    }

    return job;
}
```

### Download the result of the job

 The following function downloads the results from the output asset into the "output" folder, so you can examine the results of the job. 

```csharp
private static void DownloadResults(IAzureMediaServicesClient client,
    string resourceGroup,
    string accountName,
    string assetName,
    string resultsFolder)
{
    AssetContainerSas assetContainerSas = client.Assets.ListContainerSas(
            resourceGroup,
            accountName,
            assetName,
            permissions: AssetContainerPermission.Read,
            expiryTime: DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(1).ToUniversalTime()
            );

    Uri containerSasUrl = new Uri(assetContainerSas.AssetContainerSasUrls.FirstOrDefault());
    CloudBlobContainer container = new CloudBlobContainer(containerSasUrl);

    string directory = Path.Combine(resultsFolder, assetName);
    Directory.CreateDirectory(directory);

    Console.WriteLine("Downloading results to {0}.", directory);

    foreach (IListBlobItem blobItem in container.ListBlobs(null, true, BlobListingDetails.None))
    {
        if (blobItem is CloudBlockBlob)
        {
            CloudBlockBlob blob = blobItem as CloudBlockBlob;
            string filename = Path.Combine(directory, blob.Name);

            blob.DownloadToFile(filename, FileMode.Create);
        }
    }

    Console.WriteLine("Download complete.");
}
```

### Clean up resource in your Media Services account

Generally, you should clean up everything except objects that you are planning to reuse (typically, you will reuse Transforms, and you will persist StreamingLocators, etc.). If you want for your account to be clean after experimenting, you should delete the resources that you do not plan to reuse. For example, the following code deletes Jobs.

```csharp
static void CleanUp(IAzureMediaServicesClient client,
        string resourceGroupName,
        string accountName, 
        string transformName)
{
    foreach (var job in client.Jobs.List(resourceGroupName, accountName, transformName))
    {
        client.Jobs.Delete(resourceGroupName, accountName, transformName, job.Name);
    }

    foreach (var asset in client.Assets.List(resourceGroupName, accountName))
    {
        client.Assets.Delete(resourceGroupName, accountName, asset.Name);
    }
}
```

## Run the sample app

Press Ctrl+F5 to run the *AnalyzeVideos* application.

When we run the program, the job produces thumbnails for each face that it finds in the video. It also produces the insights.json file.

## Examine the output

The output file of analyzing videos is called insights.json. This file contains insights about your video. You can find description of  elements found in the json file in the [Media intelligence](intelligence-concept.md) article.

## Clean up resources

If you no longer need any of the resources in your resource group, including the Media Services and storage accounts you created for this tutorial, delete the resource group you created earlier. You can use the **CloudShell** tool.

In the **CloudShell**, execute the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name amsResourceGroup
```

## Multithreading

The Azure Media Services v3 SDKs are not thread-safe. When working with multi-threaded application, you should generate a new  AzureMediaServicesClient object per thread.
