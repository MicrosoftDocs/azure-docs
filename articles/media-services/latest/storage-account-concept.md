# Cloud upload and storage

To start managing, encrypting, encoding, analyzing, and streaming media content in Azure, you need to create a Media Services account. When creating a Media Services account, you need to supply the name of an Azure Storage account resource. The specified storage account is attached to your Media Services account. 

The Media Services account and all associated storage accounts must be in the same Azure subscription. It is strongly recommended to use storage accounts in the same location as the Media Services account to avoid additional latency and data egress costs

You must have one **Primary** storage account and you can have any number of **Secondary** storage accounts associated with your Media Services account. Media Services supports **General-purpose v2** (GPv2) or **General-purpose v1** (GPv1) accounts. 

>[!NOTE]
> Blob only accounts are not allowed as **Primary**. 

We recommend that you use GPv2, so you can take advantage of choosing between hot and cool storage tiers. To learn more about storage accounts, see [Azure Storage account overview](../../storage/common/storage-account-overview.md). 

There are different SKUs you can choose for your storage account. For more information, see [storage accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/account?view=azure-cli-latest). If you want to experiment with storage accounts, use `--sku Standard_LRS`. However, when picking a SKU for production you should consider, `--sku Standard_RAGRS`, which provides geographic replication for business continuity. 

## Assets in a storage account

In Media Services v3, the Storage APIs are used to upload files into assets. For more information, see [Assets concept](assets-concept.md).

> [!Note]
> You should not attempt to change the contents of blob containers that were generated by the Media Services SDK without using Media Services APIs.
 
## Storage side encryption

To protect your Assets at rest, the assets should be encrypted by the storage side encryption. The following table shows how the storage side encryption works in Media Services v3:

|Encryption option|Description|Media Services v3|
|---|---|---|
|Media Services Storage Encryption|	AES-256 encryption, key managed by Media Services|Not supported<sup>(1)</sup>|
|[Storage Service Encryption for Data at Rest](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption)|Server-side encryption offered by Azure Storage, key managed by Azure or by customer|Supported|
|[Storage Client-Side Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-client-side-encryption)|Client-side encryption offered by Azure storage, key managed by customer in Key Vault|Not supported|

<sup>1</sup> In Media Services v3, storage encryption (AES-256 encryption) is only supported for backwards compatibility when your Assets were created with Media Services v2. Meaning v3 works with existing storage encrypted assets but will not allow creation of new ones.
