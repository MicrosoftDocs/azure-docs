# Create a job input from a local file

In Media Services v3, when you submit Jobs to process your videos, you have to tell Media Services where to find the input video. The input video can be stored as a Media Service Asset, in which case you create an input asset based on a file (stored locally or in Azure Blob storage). This topic shows how to create a job input from a local file. For a full example, see this [github sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-v3-dotnet-quickstarts/blob/master/AMSV3Quickstarts/EncodeAndStreamFiles/Program.cs).

## .Net sample

The following code shows how to create an input asset and use it as the input for the job. The CreateInputAsset function performs the following actions:

* Creates the Asset 
* Gets a writable [SAS URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1) to the Asset’s [container in storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-dotnet?tabs=windows#upload-blobs-to-the-container)
* Uploads the file into the container in storage using the SAS URL

```csharp
private static Asset CreateInputAsset(IAzureMediaServicesClient client, string resourceGroupName, string accountName, string assetName, string fileToUpload)
{
    // Call Media Services API to create an Asset.
    // This method creates a container in storage for the Asset.
    // The files (blobs) associated with the asset will be stored in this container.
    Asset asset = client.Assets.CreateOrUpdate(resourceGroupName, accountName, assetName, new Asset());

    // Use Media Services API to get back a response that contains
    // SAS URL for the Asset container into which to upload blobs.
    // That is where you would specify read-write permissions 
    // and the exparation time for the SAS URL.
    var response = client.Assets.ListContainerSas(resourceGroupName, accountName, assetName, new ListContainerSasInput()
    {
        Permissions = AssetContainerPermission.ReadWrite,
        ExpiryTime = DateTimeOffset.Now.AddHours(4)
    });

    var sasUri = new Uri(response.AssetContainerSasUrls.First());
    
    // Use Storage API to get a reference to the Asset container
    // that was created by calling Asset's CreateOrUpdate method.  
    CloudBlobContainer container = new CloudBlobContainer(sasUri);
    var blob = container.GetBlockBlobReference(Path.GetFileName(fileToUpload));
    
    // Use Strorage API to upload the file into the container in storage.
    blob.UploadFromFile(fileToUpload);

    return asset;
}

private static Job SubmitJob(IAzureMediaServicesClient client, string transformName, string jobName, string outputAssetName)
{
    string inputAssetName = Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + "-input";
    JobInput jobInput = new JobInputAsset(assetName: inputAssetName);

    CreateInputAsset(client, inputAssetName, "ignite.mp4")

    JobOutput[] jobOutputs =
    {
        new JobOutputAsset(outputAssetName),
    };

    Job job = client.Jobs.CreateOrUpdate(
        transformName,
        jobName,
        new Job
        {
            Input = jobInput,
            Outputs = jobOutputs,
        });

    return job;
}
```
