## Overview
This tutorial walks you through the steps of creating a **Channel** that receives a single-bitrate live stream and encodes it to multi-bitrate stream.

For more conceptual information related to Channels that are enabled for live encoding, see [Live streaming using Azure Media Services to create multi-bitrate streams](media-services-manage-live-encoder-enabled-channels.md).

## Common Live Streaming Scenario
The following steps describe tasks involved in creating common live streaming applications.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the max recommended duration of a live event is 8 hours. Please contact amslived@microsoft.com if you need to run a Channel for longer periods of time.

1. Connect a video camera to a computer. Launch and configure an on-premises live encoder that can output a single bitrate stream in one of the following protocols: RTMP or Smooth Streaming. For more information, see [Azure Media Services RTMP Support and Live Encoders](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532824).

    This step could also be performed after you create your Channel.

2. Create and start a Channel.
3. Retrieve the Channel ingest URL.

    The ingest URL is used by the live encoder to send the stream to the Channel.

4. Retrieve the Channel preview URL.

    Use this URL to verify that your channel is properly receiving the live stream.

5. Create an asset.
6. If you want for the asset to be dynamically encrypted during playback, do the following:
7. Create a content key.
8. Configure the content key's authorization policy.
9. Configure asset delivery policy (used by dynamic packaging and dynamic encryption).
10. Create a program and specify to use the asset that you created.
11. Publish the asset associated with the program by creating an OnDemand locator.

    >[!NOTE]
    >When your AMS account is created a **default** streaming endpoint is added to your account in the **Stopped** state. The streaming endpoint from which you want to stream content has to be in the **Running** state. 

12. Start the program when you are ready to start streaming and archiving.
13. Optionally, the live encoder can be signaled to start an advertisement. The advertisement is inserted in the output stream.
14. Stop the program whenever you want to stop streaming and archiving the event.
15. Delete the Program (and optionally delete the asset).

## What you'll learn
This article shows you how to execute different operations on channels and programs using Media Services .NET SDK. Because many operations are long-running .NET APIs that manage long running operations are used.

The article shows how to do the following:

1. Create and start a channel. Long-running APIs are used.
2. Get the channels ingest (input) endpoint. This endpoint should be provided to the encoder that can send a single bitrate live stream.
3. Get the preview endpoint. This endpoint is used to preview your stream.
4. Create an asset that is used to store your content. The asset delivery policies should be configured as well, as shown in this example.
5. Create a program and specify to use the asset that was created earlier. Start the program. Long-running APIs are used.
6. Create a locator for the asset, so the content gets published and can be streamed to your clients.
7. Show and hide slates. Start and stop advertisements. Long-running APIs are used.
8. Clean up your channel and all the associated resources.

## Prerequisites
The following are required to complete the tutorial.

* An Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). You get credits that can be used to try out paid Azure services. Even after the credits are used up, you can keep the account and use free Azure services and features, such as the Web Apps feature in Azure App Service.
* A Media Services account. To create a Media Services account, see [Create Account](media-services-portal-create-account.md).
* Visual Studio 2010 SP1 (Professional, Premium, Ultimate, or Express) or later versions.
* You must use Media Services .NET SDK version 3.2.0.0 or newer.
* A webcam and an encoder that can send a single bitrate live stream.

## Considerations
* Currently, the max recommended duration of a live event is 8 hours. Please contact amslived@Microsoft.com if you need to run a Channel for longer periods of time.
* There is a limit of 1,000,000 policies for different AMS policies (for example, for Locator policy or ContentKeyAuthorizationPolicy). You should use the same policy ID if you are always using the same days / access permissions, for example, policies for locators that are intended to remain in place for a long time (non-upload policies). For more information, see [this](media-services-dotnet-manage-entities.md#limit-access-policies) article.

You can download the sample that is described in this article from [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/samples/media-services-dotnet-encode-live-stream-with-ams-clear/).

## Set up for development with Media Services SDK for .NET

Set up your development environment and populate the app.config file with connection information, as described in [Media Services development with .NET](media-services-dotnet-how-to-use.md). 

## Code example

```csharp

using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Configuration;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Net;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MediaServices.Client;

            string previewEndpoint = channel.Preview.Endpoints.FirstOrDefault().Url.ToString();

            Console.WriteLine("Preview URL: {0}", previewEndpoint);

            // When Live Encoding is enabled, you can now get a preview of the live feed as it reaches the Channel. 
            // This can be a valuable tool to check whether your live feed is actually reaching the Channel.
