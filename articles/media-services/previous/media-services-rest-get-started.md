# Get started with delivering content on demand using REST  

> [!NOTE]
> No new features or functionality are being added to Media Services v2. <br/>Check out the latest version, [Media Services v3](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/latest/). Also, see [migration guidance from v2 to v3](../latest/migrate-from-v2-to-v3.md)

This quickstart walks you through the steps of implementing a Video-on-Demand (VoD) content delivery application using Azure Media Services (AMS) REST APIs.

The tutorial introduces the basic Media Services workflow and the most common programming objects and tasks required for Media Services development. At the completion of the tutorial, you are able to stream or progressively download a sample media file that you uploaded, encoded, and downloaded.

The following image shows some of the most commonly used objects when developing VoD applications against the Media Services OData model.

## Prerequisites
The following prerequisites are required to start developing with Media Services with REST APIs.

* An Azure account. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* A Media Services account. To create a Media Services account, see [How to Create a Media Services Account](media-services-portal-create-account.md).
* Understanding of how to develop with Media Services REST API. For more information, see [Media Services REST API overview](media-services-rest-how-to-use.md).
* An application of your choice that can send HTTP requests and responses. This tutorial uses [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler).

The following tasks are shown in this quickstart.

1. Start streaming endpoint (using the Azure portal).
2. Connect to the Media Services account with REST API.
3. Create a new asset and upload a video file with REST API.
4. Encode the source file into a set of adaptive bitrate MP4 files with REST API.
5. Publish the asset and get streaming and progressive download URLs with REST API.
6. Play your content.

>[!NOTE]
>There is a limit of 1,000,000 policies for different AMS policies (for example, for Locator policy or ContentKeyAuthorizationPolicy). Use the same policy ID if you are always using the same days / access permissions, for example, policies for locators that are intended to remain in place for a long time (non-upload policies). For more information, see [this](media-services-dotnet-manage-entities.md#limit-access-policies) article.

For details about AMS REST entities used in this article, see [Azure Media Services REST API Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/operations/azure-media-services-rest-api-reference). Also, see [Azure Media Services concepts](media-services-concepts.md).

>[!NOTE]
>When accessing entities in Media Services, you must set specific header fields and values in your HTTP requests. For more information, see [Setup for Media Services REST API Development](media-services-rest-how-to-use.md).

## Start streaming endpoints using the Azure portal

When working with Azure Media Services, one of the most common scenarios is delivering video via adaptive bitrate streaming. Media Services provides dynamic packaging, which allows you to deliver your adaptive bitrate MP4 encoded content in streaming formats supported by Media Services (MPEG DASH, HLS, Smooth Streaming) just-in-time, without you having to store pre-packaged versions of each of these streaming formats.

>[!NOTE]
>When your AMS account is created a **default** streaming endpoint is added to your account in the **Stopped** state. To start streaming your content and take advantage of dynamic packaging and dynamic encryption, the streaming endpoint from which you want to stream content has to be in the **Running** state.

To start the streaming endpoint, do the following:

1. Log in at the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. In the Settings window, click Streaming endpoints.
3. Click the default streaming endpoint.

    The DEFAULT STREAMING ENDPOINT DETAILS window appears.

4. Click the Start icon.
5. Click the Save button to save your changes.

## <a id="connect"></a>Connect to the Media Services account with REST API

For information on how to connect to the AMS API, see [Access the Azure Media Services API with Azure AD authentication](media-services-use-aad-auth-to-access-ams-api.md). 

## <a id="upload"></a>Create a new asset and upload a video file with REST API

In Media Services, you upload your digital files into an asset. The **Asset** entity can contain video, audio, images, thumbnail collections, text tracks and closed caption files (and the metadata about these files.)  Once the files are uploaded into the asset, your content is stored securely in the cloud for further processing and streaming.

One of the values that you have to provide when creating an asset is asset creation options. The **Options** property is an enumeration value that describes the encryption options that an Asset can be created with. A valid value is one of the values from the list below, not a combination of values from this list:

* **None** = **0** - No encryption is used. When using this option your content is not protected in transit or at rest in storage.
    If you plan to deliver an MP4 using progressive download, use this option.
* **StorageEncrypted** = **1** - Encrypts your clear content locally using AES-256 bit encryption and then uploads it to Azure Storage where it is stored encrypted at rest. Assets protected with Storage Encryption are automatically unencrypted and placed in an encrypted file system prior to encoding, and optionally re-encrypted prior to uploading back as a new output asset. The primary use case for Storage Encryption is when you want to secure your high-quality input media files with strong encryption at rest on disk.
* **CommonEncryptionProtected** = **2** - Use this option if you are uploading content that has already been encrypted and protected with Common Encryption or PlayReady DRM (for example, Smooth Streaming protected with PlayReady DRM).
* **EnvelopeEncryptionProtected** = **4** – Use this option if you are uploading HLS encrypted with AES. The files must have been encoded and encrypted by Transform Manager.

### Create an asset
An asset is a container for multiple types or sets of objects in Media Services, including video, audio, images, thumbnail collections, text tracks, and closed caption files. In the REST API, creating an Asset requires sending POST request to Media Services and placing any property information about your asset in the request body.

The following example shows how to create an asset.

**HTTP Request**

    POST https://wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net/api/Assets HTTP/1.1

    }

### Create an AssetFile
The [AssetFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/operations/assetfile) entity represents a video or audio file that is stored in a blob container. An asset file is always associated with an asset, and an asset may contain one or many AssetFiles. The Media Services Encoder task fails if an asset file object is not associated with a digital file in a blob container.

After you upload your digital media file into a blob container, you use the **MERGE** HTTP request to update the AssetFile with information about your media file (as shown later in the topic).

**HTTP Request**

    POST https://wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net/api/Files HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    DataServiceVersion: 1.0;NetFx
    MaxDataServiceVersion: 3.0;NetFx

       "MimeType":"video/mp4",
       "ContentChecksum":null
    }


### Creating the AccessPolicy with write permission
Before uploading any files into blob storage, set the access policy rights for writing to an asset. To do that, POST an HTTP request to the AccessPolicies entity set. Define a DurationInMinutes value upon creation or you receive a 500 Internal Server error message back in response. For more information on AccessPolicies, see [AccessPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/operations/accesspolicy).

The following example shows how to create an AccessPolicy:

**HTTP Request**

    POST https://wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net/api/AccessPolicies HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    DataServiceVersion: 1.0;NetFx
    MaxDataServiceVersion: 3.0;NetFx
    Accept: application/json
    Accept-Charset: UTF-8
    Authorization: Bearer <ENCODED JWT TOKEN>
    x-ms-version: 2.19
    Host: wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net
    Content-Length: 74

    {"Name":"NewUploadPolicy", "DurationInMinutes":"440", "Permissions":"2"}

**HTTP Response**

If successful, the following response is returned:

    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Cache-Control: no-cache
    Content-Length: 312
    Content-Type: application/json;odata=minimalmetadata;streaming=true;charset=utf-8
    Location: https://wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net/api/AccessPolicies('nb%3Apid%3AUUID%3Abe0ac48d-af7d-4877-9d60-1805d68bffae')

    DataServiceVersion: 3.0;
    X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
    Date: Sun, 18 Jan 2015 22:18:06 GMT

    {  
       "odata.metadata":"https://wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net/api/$metadata#AccessPolicies/@Element",
       "Id":"nb:pid:UUID:be0ac48d-af7d-4877-9d60-1805d68bffae",
       "Created":"2015-01-18T22:18:06.6370575Z",
       "LastModified":"2015-01-18T22:18:06.6370575Z",
       "Name":"NewUploadPolicy",
       "DurationInMinutes":440.0,
       "Permissions":2
    }

### Get the Upload URL

To receive the actual upload URL, create a SAS Locator. Locators define the start time and type of connection endpoint for clients that want to access Files in an Asset. You can create multiple Locator entities for a given AccessPolicy and Asset pair to handle different client requests and needs. Each of these Locators uses the StartTime value plus the DurationInMinutes value of the AccessPolicy to determine the length of time a URL can be used. For more information, see [Locator](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/operations/locator).

A SAS URL has the following format:

    {https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net}/{asset name}/{video file name}?{SAS signature}

Some considerations apply:

* You cannot have more than five unique Locators associated with a given Asset at one time. 
* If you need to upload your files immediately, you should set your StartTime value to five minutes before the current time. This is because there may be clock skew between your client machine and Media Services. Also, your StartTime value must be in the following DateTime format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (for example, "2014-05-23T17:53:50Z").    
* There may be a 30-40 second delay after a Locator is created to when it is available for use. This issue applies to both [SAS URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1) and Origin Locators.

The following example shows how to create a SAS URL Locator, as defined by the Type property in the request body ("1" for a SAS locator and "2" for an On-Demand origin locator). The **Path** property returned contains the URL that you must use to upload your file.

**HTTP Request**

    POST https://wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net/api/Locators HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    DataServiceVersion: 1.0;NetFx

       "Name":null
    }

### Upload a file into a blob storage container
Once you have the AccessPolicy and Locator set, the actual file is uploaded to an Azure blob storage container using the Azure Storage REST APIs. You must upload the files as block blobs. Page blobs are not supported by Azure Media Services.  

> [!NOTE]
> You must add the file name for the file you want to upload to the Locator **Path** value received in the previous section. For example, `https://storagetestaccount001.blob.core.windows.net/asset-e7b02da4-5a69-40e7-a8db-e8f4f697aac0/BigBuckBunny.mp4?`.
>
>

For more information on working with Azure storage blobs, see [Blob Service REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/Blob-Service-REST-API).

### Update the AssetFile
Now that you've uploaded your file, update the FileAsset size (and other) information. For example:

    MERGE https://wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net/api/Files('nb%3Acid%3AUUID%3Af13a0137-0a62-9d4c-b3b9-ca944b5142c5') HTTP/1.1

    Accept-Charset: UTF-8
    Authorization: Bearer <ENCODED JWT TOKEN>
    x-ms-version: 2.19
    Host: wamsbayclus001rest-hs.cloudapp.net

    {  
       "ContentFileSize":"1186540",
       "Id":"nb:cid:UUID:f13a0137-0a62-9d4c-b3b9-ca944b5142c5",

       "ParentAssetId":"nb:cid:UUID:9bc8ff20-24fb-4fdb-9d7c-b04c7ee573a1"
    }

## <a id="encode"></a>Encode the source file into a set of adaptive bitrate MP4 files

After ingesting Assets into Media Services, media can be encoded, transmuxed, watermarked, and so on, before it is delivered to clients. These activities are scheduled and run against multiple background role instances to ensure high performance and availability. These activities are called Jobs and each Job is composed of atomic Tasks that do the actual work on the Asset file (for more information, see [Job](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/operations/job), [Task](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/operations/task) descriptions).

As was mentioned earlier, when working with Azure Media Services one of the most common scenarios is delivering adaptive bitrate streaming to your clients. Media Services can dynamically package a set of adaptive bitrate MP4 files into one of the following formats: HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), Smooth Streaming, MPEG DASH.

The following section shows how to create a job that contains one encoding task. The task specifies to transcode the mezzanine file into a set of adaptive bitrate MP4s using **Media Encoder Standard**. The section also shows how to monitor the job processing progress. When the job is complete, you would be able to create locators that are needed to get access to your assets.

### Get a media processor
In Media Services, a media processor is a component that handles a specific processing task, such as encoding, format conversion, encrypting, or decrypting media content. For the encoding task shown in this tutorial, we are going to use the Media Encoder Standard.

### Create a job
Each Job can have one or more Tasks depending on the type of processing that you want to accomplish. Through the REST API, you can create Jobs and their related Tasks in one of two ways: Tasks can be defined inline through the Tasks navigation property on Job entities, or through OData batch processing. The Media Services SDK uses batch processing. However, for the readability of the code examples in this article, tasks are defined inline. For information on batch processing, see [Open Data Protocol (OData) Batch Processing](https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/batch-processing/).

The following example shows you how to create and post a Job with one Task set to encode a video at a specific resolution and quality. The following documentation section contains the list of all the [task presets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt269960) supported by the Media Encoder Standard processor.

There are a few important things to note in any Job request:

* TaskBody properties MUST use literal XML to define the number of input, or output assets that are used by the Task. The Task article contains the XML Schema Definition for the XML.
* In the TaskBody definition, each inner value for `<inputAsset>` and `<outputAsset>` must be set as JobInputAsset(value) or JobOutputAsset(value).
* A task can have multiple output assets. One JobOutputAsset(x) can only be used once as an output of a task in a job.
* You can specify JobInputAsset or JobOutputAsset as an input asset of a task.
* Tasks must not form a cycle.
* The value parameter that you pass to JobInputAsset or JobOutputAsset represents the index value for an Asset. The actual Assets are defined in the InputMediaAssets and OutputMediaAssets navigation properties on the Job entity definition.

> [!NOTE]
> Because Media Services is built on OData v3, the individual assets in InputMediaAssets and OutputMediaAssets navigation property collections are referenced through a "__metadata : uri" name-value pair.
>
>

* InputMediaAssets maps to one or more Assets you have created in Media Services. OutputMediaAssets are created by the system. They do not reference an existing asset.
* OutputMediaAssets can be named using the assetName attribute. If this attribute is not present, then the name of the OutputMediaAsset is whatever the inner text value of the `<outputAsset>` element is with a suffix of either the Job Name value, or the Job Id value (in the case where the Name property isn't defined). For example, if you set a value for assetName to "Sample", then the OutputMediaAsset Name property would be set to "Sample". However, if you did not set a value for assetName, but did set the job name to "NewJob", then the OutputMediaAsset Name would be "JobOutputAsset(value)_NewJob".

    The following example shows how to set the assetName attribute:

        "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?><taskBody><inputAsset>JobInputAsset(0)</inputAsset><outputAsset assetName=\"CustomOutputAssetName\">JobOutputAsset(0)</outputAsset></taskBody>"
* To enable task chaining:

  * A job must have at least two tasks
  * There must be at least one task whose input is output of another task in the job.

For more information see, [Creating an Encoding Job with the Media Services REST API](media-services-rest-encode-asset.md).

### Monitor Processing Progress
You can retrieve the Job status by using the State property, as shown in the following example:

## <a id="publish_get_urls"></a>Publish the asset and get streaming and progressive download URLs with REST API

To stream or download an asset, you first need to "publish" it by creating a locator. Locators provide access to files contained in the asset. Media Services supports two types of locators: OnDemandOrigin locators, used to stream media (for example, MPEG DASH, HLS, or Smooth Streaming) and Access Signature (SAS) locators, used to download media files. 

Once you create the locators, you can build the URLs that are used to stream or download your files.

>[!NOTE]
>When your AMS account is created a **default** streaming endpoint is added to your account in the **Stopped** state. To start streaming your content and take advantage of dynamic packaging and dynamic encryption, the streaming endpoint from which you want to stream content has to be in the **Running** state.

A streaming URL for Smooth Streaming has the following format:

    {streaming endpoint name-media services account name}.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/{locator ID}/{filename}.ism/Manifest

A streaming URL for HLS has the following format:

    {streaming endpoint name-media services account name}.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/{locator ID}/{filename}.ism/Manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)

A streaming URL for MPEG DASH has the following format:

    {streaming endpoint name-media services account name}.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/{locator ID}/{filename}.ism/Manifest(format=mpd-time-csf)

A SAS URL used to download files has the following format:

    {blob container name}/{asset name}/{file name}/{SAS signature}

This section shows how to perform the following tasks necessary to "publish" your assets.  

* Creating the AccessPolicy with read permission
* Creating a SAS URL for downloading content
* Creating an origin URL for streaming content

### Creating the AccessPolicy with read permission
Before downloading or streaming any media content, first define an AccessPolicy with read permissions and create the appropriate Locator entity that specifies the type of delivery mechanism you want to enable for your clients. For more information on the properties available, see [AccessPolicy Entity Properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/operations/accesspolicy#accesspolicy_properties).

The following example shows how to specify the AccessPolicy for read permissions for a given Asset.

    POST https://wamsbayclus001rest-hs.net/API/AccessPolicies HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    DataServiceVersion: 3.0
    MaxDataServiceVersion: 3.0
    x-ms-version: 2.19
    Authorization: Bearer <ENCODED JWT TOKEN>
    Host: wamsbayclus001rest-hs.net
    Content-Length: 74
    Expect: 100-continue

    {"Name": "DownloadPolicy", "DurationInMinutes" : "300", "Permissions" : 1}

If successful, a 201 success code is returned describing the AccessPolicy entity that you created. You then use the AccessPolicy Id along with the Asset Id of the asset that contains the file you want to deliver(such as an output asset) to create the Locator entity.

> [!NOTE]
> This basic workflow is the same as uploading a file when ingesting an Asset (as was discussed earlier in this topic). Also, like uploading files, if you (or your clients) need to access your files immediately, set your StartTime value to five minutes before the current time. This action is necessary because there may be clock skew between the client and Media Services. The StartTime value must be in the following DateTime format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (for example, "2014-05-23T17:53:50Z").
>
>

### Creating a SAS URL for downloading content
The following code shows how to get a URL that can be used to download a media file created and uploaded previously. The AccessPolicy has read permissions set and the Locator path refers to a SAS download URL.

    POST https://wamsbayclus001rest-hs.net/API/Locators HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    DataServiceVersion: 3.0
    MaxDataServiceVersion: 3.0
    x-ms-version: 2.19
    Authorization: Bearer <ENCODED JWT TOKEN>
    Host: wamsbayclus001rest-hs.net
    Content-Length: 182
    Expect: 100-continue

    {"AccessPolicyId": "nb:pid:UUID:38c71dd0-44c5-4c5f-8418-08bb6fbf7bf8", "AssetId" : "nb:cid:UUID:71d2dd33-efdf-ec43-8ea1-136a110bd42c", "StartTime" : "2014-05-17T16:45:53", "Type":1}

If successful, the following response is returned:

The returned **Path** property contains the SAS URL.

> [!NOTE]
> If you download storage encrypted content, you must manually decrypt it before rendering it, or use the Storage Decryption MediaProcessor in a processing task to output processed files in the clear to an OutputAsset and then download from that Asset. For more information on processing, see Creating an Encoding Job with the Media Services REST API. Also, SAS URL Locators cannot be updated after they have been created. For example, you cannot reuse the same Locator with an updated StartTime value. This is because of the way SAS URLs are created. If you want to access an asset for download after a Locator has expired, then you must create a new one with a new StartTime.
>
>

### Download files
Once you have the AccessPolicy and Locator set, you can download files using the Azure Storage REST APIs.

> You must add the file name for the file you want to download to the Locator **Path** value received in the previous section. For example, `https://storagetestaccount001.blob.core.windows.net/asset-e7b02da4-5a69-40e7-a8db-e8f4f697aac0/BigBuckBunny.mp4`? . . .

For more information on working with Azure storage blobs, see [Blob Service REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/Blob-Service-REST-API).

As a result of the encoding job that you performed earlier (encoding into Adaptive MP4 set), you have multiple MP4 files that you can progressively download. For example:

To stream a Smooth Streaming origin URL in a streaming media player, you must append the Path property with the name of the Smooth Streaming manifest file, followed by "/manifest".

    http://amstestaccount001.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/ebf733c4-3e2e-4a68-b67b-cc5159d1d7f2/BigBuckBunny.ism/manifest

To stream HLS, append (format=m3u8-aapl) after the "/manifest".

    http://amstestaccount001.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/ebf733c4-3e2e-4a68-b67b-cc5159d1d7f2/BigBuckBunny.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)

To stream MPEG DASH, append (format=mpd-time-csf) after the "/manifest".

    http://amstestaccount001.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/ebf733c4-3e2e-4a68-b67b-cc5159d1d7f2/BigBuckBunny.ism/manifest(format=mpd-time-csf)
