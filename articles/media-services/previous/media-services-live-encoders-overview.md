# How to configure on-premises encoders when using Azure Media Services to create multi-bitrate streams
This topic lists on-premises live encoders that you can use to capture your live events and send a single bitrate live stream to AMS channels (that are live encoding enabled) for further processing. The topic also links to tutorials that show how to configure listed encoders.

## Flash Media Live Encoder
For information on how to configure the [Flash Media Live Encoder](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-media-encoder.html) (FMLE) encoder to send a single bitrate live stream to an AMS Channel, see [Configuring FMLE](media-services-configure-fmle-live-encoder.md).

## Haivision KB Encoder
For information on how to configure the [Haivision KB Encoder](https://www.haivision.com/products/kb-series/) encoder to send a single bitrate live stream to an AMS Channel, see [Configuring Haivision KB Encoder](media-services-configure-kb-live-encoder.md).

## Telestream Wirecast
For information on how to configure the [Telestream Wirecast](http://www.telestream.net/wirecast/overview.htm) encoder to send a single bitrate live stream to an AMS Channel, see [Configuring Wirecast](media-services-configure-wirecast-live-encoder.md).

## NewTek TriCaster
For information on how to configure the [Tricaster](http://newtek.com/products/tricaster-40.html) encoder to send a single bitrate live stream to an AMS Channel, see [Configuring Tricaster](media-services-configure-tricaster-live-encoder.md).
