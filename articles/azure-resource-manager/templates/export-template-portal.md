## Export template from a resource group

To export one or more resources from a resource group:

1. Select the resource group that contains the resources you want to export.

1. Select one or more resources by selecting the checkboxes. To select all, select the checkbox on the left of **Name**. The **Export template** from the top menu only becomes enabled after you've selected at least one resource.
