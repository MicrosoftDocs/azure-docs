# View deployment history with Azure Resource Manager

Azure Resource Manager enables you to view your deployment history. You can examine specific operations in past deployments and see which resources were deployed. This history contains information about any errors.

The deployment history for a resource group is limited to 800 deployments. As you near the limit, deployments are automatically deleted from the history. For more information, see [Automatic deletions from deployment history](deployment-history-deletions.md).

For help with resolving particular deployment errors, see [Troubleshoot common Azure deployment errors](../troubleshooting/common-deployment-errors.md).

## Correlation ID and support

Each deployment has a correlation ID, which is used to track related events. If you [create an Azure support request](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request), support may ask you for the correlation ID. Support uses the correlation ID to identify the operations for the failed deployment.

The examples in this article show how to retrieve the correlation ID.

## Resource group deployments

You can view details about a resource group deployment through the Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API.

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Select the **resource group** you want to examine.

   :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-history/select-resource-group.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting resource group.":::

1. Select the link under **Deployments**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-history/select-deployment-history.png" alt-text="Screenshot of resource group overview that shows successful deployment.":::

1. Select one of the deployments from the deployment history.

   :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-history/select-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of highlighted link for a resource deployment.":::

1. A summary of the deployment is displayed, including the correlation ID.

   :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-history/show-correlation-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of resource group deployment history that highlights correlation ID.":::

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

To list all deployments for a resource group, use the [Get-AzResourceGroupDeployment](/powershell/module/az.resources/Get-AzResourceGroupDeployment) command.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup
```

To get a specific deployment from a resource group, add the `DeploymentName` parameter.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup -DeploymentName ExampleDeployment
```

To get the correlation ID, use:

```azurepowershell-interactive
(Get-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup -DeploymentName ExampleDeployment).CorrelationId
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To list all the deployments for a resource group, use [az deployment group list](/cli/azure/deployment/group#az-deployment-group-list).

```azurecli-interactive
az deployment group list --resource-group ExampleGroup
```

To get a specific deployment, use the [az deployment group show](/cli/azure/deployment/group#az-deployment-group-show).

```azurecli-interactive
az deployment group show --resource-group ExampleGroup --name ExampleDeployment
```

To get the correlation ID, use:

```azurecli-interactive
az deployment group show --resource-group ExampleGroup --name ExampleDeployment --query properties.correlationId
```

# [HTTP](#tab/http)

To list the deployments for a resource group, use the following operation. For the latest API version number to use in the request, see  [Deployments - List By Resource Group](/rest/api/resources/deployments/listbyresourcegroup).

```rest
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deployments/?api-version={api-version}
```

To get a specific deployment, use the following operation. For the latest API version number to use in the request, see [Deployments - Get](/rest/api/resources/deployments/get).

```rest
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/microsoft.resources/deployments/{deployment-name}?api-version={api-version}
```

The response includes the correlation ID.

```json
{
 ...
 "properties": {
   "mode": "Incremental",
   "provisioningState": "Failed",
   "timestamp": "2019-11-26T14:18:36.4518358Z",

## Deployment operations and error message

Each deployment can include multiple operations. To see more details about a deployment, view the deployment operations. When a deployment fails, the deployment operations include an error message.

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. On the summary for a deployment, select **Operation details**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-history/get-operation-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of failed deployment that highlights link for operation details.":::

1. You see the details for that step of the deployment. When an error occurs, the details include the error message.

   :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-history/see-operation-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of failed deployment's operation details.":::

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

To view the deployment operations for deployment to a resource group, use the [Get-AzResourceGroupDeploymentOperation](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azresourcegroupdeploymentoperation) command.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzResourceGroupDeploymentOperation -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup -DeploymentName ExampleDeployment
```

To view failed operations, filter operations with **Failed** state.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzResourceGroupDeploymentOperation -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup -Name ExampleDeployment | Where-Object { $_.ProvisioningState -eq "Failed" }
```

To get the status message of failed operations, use the following command:

```azurepowershell-interactive
(Get-AzResourceGroupDeploymentOperation -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup -Name ExampleDeployment | Where-Object { $_.ProvisioningState -eq "Failed" }).StatusMessage
```

To view deployment operations for other scopes, use:

* [Get-AzDeploymentOperation](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azdeploymentoperation)
* [Get-AzManagementGroupDeploymentOperation](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azmanagementgroupdeploymentoperation)
* [Get-AzTenantDeploymentOperation](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-aztenantdeploymentoperation)

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To view the deployment operations for deployment to a resource group, use the [az deployment operation group list](/cli/azure/deployment/operation/group#az-deployment-operation-group-list) command. You must have Azure CLI 2.6.0 or later.

```azurecli-interactive
az deployment operation group list --resource-group ExampleGroup --name ExampleDeployment
```

To view failed operations, filter operations with **Failed** state.

```azurecli-interactive
az deployment operation group list --resource-group ExampleGroup --name ExampleDeployment --query "[?properties.provisioningState=='Failed']"
```

To get the status message of failed operations, use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az deployment operation group list --resource-group ExampleGroup --name ExampleDeployment --query "[?properties.provisioningState=='Failed'].properties.statusMessage.error"
```

To view deployment operations for other scopes, use:

* [az deployment operation sub list](/cli/azure/deployment/operation/sub#az-deployment-operation-sub-list)
* [az deployment operation mg list](/cli/azure/deployment/operation/sub)
* [az deployment operation tenant list](/cli/azure/deployment/operation/sub).

# [HTTP](#tab/http)

To get deployment operations, use the following operation. For the latest API version number to use in the request, see [Deployment Operations - List](/rest/api/resources/deploymentoperations/list).

```rest
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/microsoft.resources/deployments/{deployment-name}/operations?$skiptoken={skiptoken}&api-version={api-version}
```

The response includes an error message.
