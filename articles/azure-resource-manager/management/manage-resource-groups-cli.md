# Manage Azure resource groups by using Azure CLI

Learn how to use Azure CLI with [Azure Resource Manager](overview.md) to manage your Azure resource groups.

## Prerequisites

* Azure CLI. For more information, see [How to install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

* An authenticated account. After installing Azure CLI, sign in for the first time. For more information, see [How to sign in to the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli#how-to-sign-into-the-azure-cli).

## What is a resource group

A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide how to add resources to resource groups based on what makes the most sense for your organization. Generally, add resources that share the same lifecycle to the same resource group so you can easily deploy, update, and delete them as a group.

The resource group stores metadata about the resources. When you specify a location for the resource group, you're specifying where that metadata is stored. For compliance reasons, you might need to ensure that your data is stored in a particular region.

## Create resource groups

To create a resource group, use [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create).

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name demoResourceGroup --location westus
```

## List resource groups

To list the resource groups in your subscription, use [az group list](/cli/azure/group#az-group-list).

```azurecli-interactive
az group list
```

To get one resource group, use [az group show](/cli/azure/group#az-group-show).

```azurecli-interactive
az group show --name exampleGroup
```

## Delete resource groups

To delete a resource group, use [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete).

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name exampleGroup
```

For more information about how Azure Resource Manager orders the deletion of resources, see [Azure Resource Manager resource group deletion](delete-resource-group.md).

## Deploy resources

You can deploy Azure resources by using Azure CLI, or by deploying an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template or Bicep file.

### Deploy resources by using storage operations

The following example creates a storage account. The name you provide for the storage account must be unique across Azure.

```azurecli-interactive
az storage account create --resource-group exampleGroup --name examplestore --location westus --sku Standard_LRS --kind StorageV2
```

### Deploy resources by using an ARM template or Bicep file

To deploy an ARM template or Bicep file, use [az deployment group create](/cli/azure/deployment/group#az-deployment-group-create).

```azurecli-interactive
az deployment group create --resource-group exampleGroup --template-file storage.bicep
```

The following example shows the Bicep file named `storage.bicep` that you're deploying:

```bicep
@minLength(3)
@maxLength(11)
param storagePrefix string

var uniqueStorageName = concat(storagePrefix, uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))

resource uniqueStorage 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2022-09-01' = {
  name: uniqueStorageName
  location: 'eastus'
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
  properties: {
    supportsHttpsTrafficOnly: true
  }
}
```

For more information about deploying an ARM template, see [Deploy resources with Resource Manager templates and Azure CLI](../templates/deploy-cli.md).

For more information about deploying a Bicep file, see [Deploy resources with Bicep and Azure CLI](../bicep/deploy-cli.md).

## Lock resource groups

Locking prevents other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources.

To prevent a resource group and its resources from being deleted, use [az lock create](/cli/azure/lock#az-lock-create).

```azurecli-interactive
az lock create --name LockGroup --lock-type CanNotDelete --resource-group exampleGroup
```

To get the locks for a resource group, use [az lock list](/cli/azure/lock#az-lock-list).

```azurecli-interactive
az lock list --resource-group exampleGroup
```

To delete a lock, use [az lock delete](/cli/azure/lock#az-lock-delete).

```azurecli-interactive
az lock delete --name exampleLock --resource-group exampleGroup
```

For more information, see [Lock resources with Azure Resource Manager](lock-resources.md).

## Tag resource groups

You can apply tags to resource groups and resources to logically organize your assets. For information, see [Using tags to organize your Azure resources](tag-resources-cli.md).

## Export resource groups to templates

To assist with creating ARM templates, you can export a template from existing resources. For more information, see [Use Azure CLI to export a template](../templates/export-template-cli.md).

## Manage access to resource groups

To manage access to a resource group, use [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../../role-based-access-control/overview.md). For more information, see [Add or remove Azure role assignments using Azure CLI](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli.md).
