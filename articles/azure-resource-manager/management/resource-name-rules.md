# Naming rules and restrictions for Azure resources

This article summarizes naming rules and restrictions for Azure resources. For recommendations about how to name resources, see [Recommended naming and tagging conventions](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging).

This article also lists resources by resource provider namespace. For a list of how resource providers match Azure services, see [Azure resource providers for Azure services](azure-services-resource-providers.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Resource and resource group names are case-insensitive unless specifically noted in the **Valid Characters** column.
>
> When using various APIs to retrieve the name for a resource or resource group, the returned value might have different casing than what you originally specified for the name. The returned value could also display different case values than what is listed in the **Valid Characters** column.
>
> Always perform a case-insensitive comparison of names.

In the following tables, the term alphanumeric refers to:

* **a** through **z** (lowercase letters)
* **A** through **Z** (uppercase letters)
* **0** through **9** (numbers)

> [!NOTE]
> Resources with a public endpoint can't include reserved words or trademarks in the name. For a list of blocked words, see [Resolve reserved resource name errors](../templates/error-reserved-resource-name.md).
>
> Don't use `#` in a resource name since this interferes with URL parsing during Azure Resource Manager requests.

> [!NOTE]
> A web site must have a globally unique URL. When you create a web site that uses a hosting plan, the URL is `http://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net`. The app name must be globally unique. When you create a web site that uses an App Service Environment, the app name must be unique within the [domain for the App Service Environment](../../app-service/environment/using-an-ase.md#app-access). For both cases, the URL of the site is globally unique.
>
> Azure Functions has the same naming rules and restrictions as Microsoft.Web/sites. When generating the host ID, the function app name is truncated to 32 characters. This can cause host ID collision when a shared storage account is used. For more information, see [Host ID considerations](../../azure-functions/storage-considerations.md#host-id-considerations). 
>
> Unicode characters are parsed to Punycode using the [IdnMapping.GetAscii method](/dotnet/api/system.globalization.idnmapping.getascii)

## Next steps

* For recommendations about how to name resources, see [Ready: Recommended naming and tagging conventions](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging).

* Resources with public endpoints can't include reserved words or trademarks in their names. For a list of the blocked words, see [Resolve reserved resource name errors](../templates/error-reserved-resource-name.md).
