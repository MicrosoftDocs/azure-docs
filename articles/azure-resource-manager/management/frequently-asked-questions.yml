title: Frequently asked questions for managing resources with Azure Resource Manager
summary: |
  This article provides answers to common questions about Azure Resource Manager and how you use it for manage resources.

sections:
  - name: Resource groups
    questions:
      - question: Can a resource group be renamed?
        answer: |
          No, you can't rename a resource group. You need to create a new resource group with the desired name and move the resources to 
          the new resource group.
          
      - question: Are resource group names case sensitive?
        answer: |
          No, Azure resource group names aren't case sensitive. They're treated as case-insensitive, meaning "ResourceGroup1" and "resourcegroup1" are considered the same.

          When using various APIs to retrieve the name for a resource or resource group, the returned value may have different casing than what you 
          originally specified for the name.

          For more information about resource group names, see [Naming rules and restrictions](resource-name-rules.md#microsoftresources).  

      - question: What location should I choose for a resource group?  
        answer: |
          To ensure state consistency for the resource group, all control plane operations are routed through the resource group's location. When selecting a 
          resource group location, we recommend that you select a location close to where your control operations originate. Typically, this location is the one closest to 
          your current location.

      - question: Can I move a resource group to a different subscription?
        answer: |
          No, you can't move a resource group to a new subscription. But, you can move all of the resources in the resource group to a resource group in another 
          subscription. Settings such as tags, role assignments, and policies aren't automatically transferred from the original resource group to the destination resource group. 
          You need to reapply these settings to the new resource group. For more information, see [Move resources to new resource group or subscription](./move-support-resources.md).

  - name: Resources
    questions:
      - question: What happens if two operations update the same resource at the same time?
        answer: |
          Azure Resource Manager detects the conflict and permits only one operation to complete successfully. The other operation fails and returns a 409 conflict error.
          If the blocked operation has the correct state, you can retry the operation.``
