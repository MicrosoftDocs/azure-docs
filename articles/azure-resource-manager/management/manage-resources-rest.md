# Manage Azure resources by using the REST API

Learn how to use the REST API for [Azure Resource Manager](overview.md) to manage your Azure resources. For a comprehensive reference of how to structure Azure REST calls, see [Getting Started with REST](/rest/api/azure/). View the [Resource Management REST API reference](/rest/api/resources/) for more details on the available operations.

## Obtain an access token

To make a REST API call to Azure, you first need to obtain an access token. Include this access token in the headers of your Azure REST API calls using the `Authorization` header and setting the value to `Bearer {access-token}`.

If you need to programmatically retrieve new tokens as part of your application, you can obtain an access token by [Registering your client application with Microsoft Entra ID](/rest/api/azure/#register-your-client-application-with-azure-ad).

To test Azure REST APIs using your individual token, retrieve your current access token with either Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli-interactive
token=$(az account get-access-token --query accessToken --output tsv)
```

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
$token = (Get-AzAccessToken).Token
```

## Operation scope

You can call many Azure Resource Manager operations at different scopes:

| Type | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Management group | `providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{managementGroupId}` |
| Subscription | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}` |
| Resource group | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}` |
| Resource | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/{resourceProviderName}/{resourceType}/{resourceName}` |

## List resources

The following REST operation returns the resources within a provided resource group.

```http
GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/resources?api-version=2021-04-01 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <bearer-token>
Host: management.azure.com
```

Here's an example cURL command that you can use to list all resources in a resource group using the Azure Resource Manager API:

```curl
curl  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X GET 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/resources?api-version=2021-04-01'
```

With the authentication step, this example looks like:

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli-interactive
token=$(az account get-access-token --query accessToken --output tsv)
curl  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X GET 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/resources?api-version=2021-04-01'
```

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
$token = (Get-AzAccessToken).Token
$headers = @{Authorization="Bearer $token"}
Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -Headers $headers -Uri 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/resources?api-version=2021-04-01'
```

## Deploy resources to an existing resource group

You can deploy Azure resources directly by using the REST API, or deploy a Resource Manager template to create Azure resources.

### Deploy a resource

The following REST operation creates a storage account. To see this example in more detail, see [Create an Azure Storage account with the REST API](/rest/api/storagerp/storage-sample-create-account). Complete reference documentation and samples for the Storage Resource Provider are available in the [Storage Resource Provider REST API Reference](/rest/api/storagerp/).

```http
PUT /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{accountName}?api-version=2018-02-01 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <bearer-token>
Content-Type: application/json
Host: management.azure.com

{
  "sku": {
    "name": "Standard_GRS"
  },
  "kind": "StorageV2",
  "location": "eastus2",
}
```

### Deploy a template

The following operations deploy a Quickstart template to create a storage account. For more information, see [Quickstart: Create Azure Resource Manager templates by using Visual Studio Code](../templates/quickstart-create-templates-use-visual-studio-code.md). For the API reference of this call, see [Deployments - Create Or Update](/rest/api/resources/deployments/create-or-update).

```http
PUT /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deployments/my-deployment?api-version=2021-04-01 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <bearer-token>
Content-Type: application/json
Host: management.azure.com

{
  "properties": {
    "templateLink": {
      "uri": "https://example.com/azuretemplates/azuredeploy.json"
    },
    "parametersLink": {
        "uri": "https://example.com/azuretemplates/azuredeploy.parameters.json"
    },
    "mode": "Incremental"
  }
}
```

For the REST APIs, the value of `uri` can't be a local file or a file that is only available on your local network. Azure Resource Manager must access the template. Provide a URI value that is downloadable as HTTP or HTTPS.
For more information, see [Deploy resources with Resource Manager templates and Azure PowerShell](../templates/deploy-powershell.md).

## Deploy a resource group and resources

You can create a resource group and deploy resources to the group by using a template. For more information, see [Create resource group and deploy resources](../templates/deploy-to-subscription.md#resource-groups).

## Deploy resources to multiple subscriptions or resource groups

Typically, you deploy all the resources in your template to a single resource group. However, there are scenarios where you want to deploy a set of resources together but place them in different resource groups or subscriptions. For more information, see [Deploy Azure resources to multiple subscriptions or resource groups](../templates/deploy-to-resource-group.md).

## Delete resources

The following operation shows how to delete a storage account.

```http
DELETE /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{accountName}?api-version=2022-09-01 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <bearer-token>
Host: management.azure.com
```

For more information about how Azure Resource Manager orders the deletion of resources, see [Azure Resource Manager resource group deletion](delete-resource-group.md).

## Manage access to resources

[Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../../role-based-access-control/overview.md) is the way that you manage access to resources in Azure. For more information, see [Add or remove Azure role assignments using REST](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-rest.md).
