# Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints

This document lists some of the most common Microsoft Azure limits, which are also sometimes called quotas.

- To learn more about Azure pricing, see the [Azure pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) overview and details page.
- The Azure pricing page provides details for specific services; for example, [Windows Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/Windows/).
- You can also use the Azure [pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) to estimate your costs.
- See [What is Microsoft Billing?](../../cost-management-billing/cost-management-billing-overview.md) for tips to help manage your costs.

## How to manage limits

> [!NOTE]
> Some services have adjustable limits.
>
> When the limit can be adjusted, the tables include **Default limit** and **Maximum limit** headers. The limit can be raised above the default limit but not above the maximum limit. Some services with adjustable limits use different headers with information about adjusting the limit.
>
> When a service doesn't have adjustable limits, the following tables use the header **Limit** without any additional information about adjusting the limit. In those cases, the default and the maximum limits are the same.
>
> If you want to raise the limit or quota above the default limit, [open an online customer support request at no charge](../templates/error-resource-quota.md#solution).
>
> The terms *soft limit* and *hard limit* are often used informally to describe the current, adjustable limit (soft limit) and the maximum limit (hard limit). If a limit isn't adjustable, there won't be a soft limit but only a hard limit.

[Free Azure trial subscriptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p) aren't eligible for limit or quota increases. If you have this type of subscription, you can upgrade to a [Pay-as-you-go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) one. For more information, see [Upgrade your Azure account](../../cost-management-billing/manage/upgrade-azure-subscription.md) and the overviews for [Try Azure for free or pay as you go](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/free-account-faq).

Some limits are managed at a regional level. You decide what your quotas must be for your workload in any one region, and then request that amount for each region into which you want to deploy.

For example, with virtual central processing unit (vCPU) quotas:

- To request a quota increase with support for vCPUs, you decide how many vCPUs to use in which regions.
- You then request an increase in vCPU quotas for the amounts and regions that you want.
- If you need to use 30 vCPUs in West Europe to run your application there, you specifically request 30 vCPUs in West Europe.
- Your vCPU quota doesn't increase in any other region; only West Europe has the 30-vCPU quota.

See [Resolve errors for resource quotas](../templates/error-resource-quota.md) for more information about how to determine quotas for specific regions.

## General limits

- See [Naming rules and restrictions for Azure resources](resource-name-rules.md) for limits on resource names.
- See [Understand how Azure Resource Manager throttles requests](request-limits-and-throttling.md) to learn about Resource Manager API read and write limits.
