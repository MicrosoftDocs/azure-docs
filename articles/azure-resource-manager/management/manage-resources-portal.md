# Manage Azure resources by using the Azure portal

Learn how to use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with [Azure Resource Manager](overview.md) to manage your Azure resources. For managing resource groups, see [Manage Azure resource groups by using the Azure portal](manage-resource-groups-portal.md).

[!INCLUDE [Handle personal data](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/gdpr-intro-sentence.md)]

## Deploy resources to a resource group

After you create a Resource Manager template, use the Azure portal to deploy your Azure resources. For creating a template, see [Quickstart: Create and deploy Azure Resource Manager templates by using the Azure portal](../templates/quickstart-create-templates-use-the-portal.md). For deploying a template using the portal, see [Deploy resources with Resource Manager templates and Azure portal](../templates/deploy-portal.md).

## Open resources

The Azure portal organizes resources by Azure service and resource group. The following procedures show how to open a storage account called **mystorage0207**. The virtual machine resides in a resource group called **mystorage0207rg**.

To open a resource by the service type:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. In the left pane, select the Azure service. In this case, select **Storage accounts**. If you don't see the service listed, select **All services**, and then select the service type.

3. Select the resource you want to open.

    A storage account looks like:

To open a resource by resource group:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. In the left pane, select **Resource groups** to list the resources within the group.
3. Select the resource you want to open.

## Manage resources

When you view a resource in the portal, you see the options for managing that particular resource.

The preceding screenshot shows the management options for an Azure virtual machine. You can perform operations such as starting, restarting, and stopping a virtual machine.

## Delete resources

1. Open the resource in the portal. For the steps, see [Open resources](#open-resources).
2. Select **Delete**. The following screenshot shows the management options for a virtual machine.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-resources-portal/manage-azure-resources-portal-delete-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Delete option for a virtual machine.":::
3. To confirm the deletion, type the name of the resource and select **Delete**.

For more information about how Azure Resource Manager orders the deletion of resources, see [Azure Resource Manager resource group deletion](delete-resource-group.md).

## Move resources

1. Open the resource in the portal. For the steps, see [Open resources](#open-resources).
2. Select **Move**. The following screenshot shows the management options for a storage account.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-resources-portal/manage-azure-resources-portal-move-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal displaying the Move option for a storage account.":::
3. Select **Move to another resource group** or **Move to another subscription** depending on your needs.

For more information, see [Move resources to new resource group or subscription](move-resource-group-and-subscription.md).

## Lock resources

Locking prevents other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources, such as Azure subscription, resource group, or resource.

1. Open the resource in the portal. For the steps, see [Open resources](#open-resources).
2. Select **Locks**. The following screenshot shows the management options for a storage account.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-resources-portal/manage-azure-resources-portal-lock-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Locks option for a storage account.":::
3. Select **Add**, and then specify the lock properties.

For more information, see [Lock resources with Azure Resource Manager](lock-resources.md).

## Tag resources

Tagging helps you organize your resource group and resources logically.

1. Open the resource in the portal. For the steps, see [Open resources](#open-resources).
2. Select **Tags**. The following screenshot shows the management options for a storage account.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-resources-portal/manage-azure-resources-portal-tag-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal displaying the Tags option for a storage account.":::
3. Specify the tag properties, and then select **Save**.

For more information, see [Using tags to organize your Azure resources](tag-resources-portal.md).

## Monitor resources

When you open a resource, the portal presents default graphs and tables for monitoring that resource type. The following screenshot shows the graphs for a virtual machine:

:::image type="content" source="./media/manage-resources-portal/manage-azure-resources-portal-monitor-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing monitoring graphs for a virtual machine.":::

To pin the graph to the dashboard, select the pin icon on the upper right corner of the graphs. To learn about working with dashboards, see [Creating and sharing dashboards in the Azure portal](/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards).

## Manage access to resources

[Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../../role-based-access-control/overview.md) is the way that you manage access to resources in Azure. For more information, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.yml).
