# Install Bicep tools

Prepare your environment for working with Bicep files. To author and deploy Bicep files, we recommend any of the following options:

| Tasks | Options | Bicep CLI installation |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| Author | [Visual Studio Code and Bicep extension](#visual-studio-code-and-bicep-extension) | automatic |
|  | [Visual Studio and Bicep extension](#visual-studio-and-bicep-extension) | automatic |
| Deploy | [Azure CLI](#azure-cli) | automatic |
|  | [Azure PowerShell](#azure-powershell) | [manual](#install-manually) |
|  | [Visual Studio Code and Bicep extension](#visual-studio-code-and-bicep-extension) | [manual](#install-manually) |
|  | [Air-gapped cloud](#install-on-air-gapped-cloud) | download |

> [!WARNING]
> The Bicep CLI's stability in emulated environments isn't guaranteed, as emulation tools like Rosetta2 and QEMU typically don't perfectly emulate the architecture.

## Visual Studio Code and Bicep extension

To create Bicep files, you need a good Bicep editor. We recommend:

- **Visual Studio Code** - If you don't already have Visual Studio Code, [install it](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Bicep extension for Visual Studio Code**.  Visual Studio Code with the Bicep extension provides language support and resource autocompletion. The extension helps you create and validate Bicep files.

  To install the extension, search for _bicep_ in the **Extensions** tab or in the [Visual Studio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep).

  Select **Install**.

To verify you've installed the extension, open any file with the `.bicep` file extension. You should see the language mode in the lower right corner change to **Bicep**.

If you get an error during installation, see [Troubleshoot Bicep installation](installation-troubleshoot.md).

You can deploy your Bicep files directly from the Visual Studio Code editor. For more information, see [Deploy Bicep files with Visual Studio Code](deploy-vscode.md).

### Configure Bicep extension

To see the settings:

1. From the `View` menu, select `Extensions`.
1. Select `Bicep` from the list of extensions.
1. Select the `FEATURE CONTRIBUTIONS` tab:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/install/bicep-extension-feature-contributions-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Bicep extension settings.":::

    The Bicep extension has these settings and default values:

    | ID | Default value | Description |
    |-----|-------------|---------|
    | bicep.decompileOnPaste | true | Automatically convert pasted JSON values, JSON ARM templates or resources from a JSON ARM template into Bicep (use Undo to revert). For more information, see the [Paste JSON as Bicep command](./visual-studio-code.md#paste-json-as-bicep-command).|
    | bicep.enableOutputTimestamps | true | Prepend each line displayed in the Bicep Operations output channel with a timestamp. |
    | bicep.suppressedWarnings | | Warnings that are being suppressed because a 'Don't show again' button was pressed. Remove items to reset.|
    | bicep.enableSurveys | true | Enable occasional surveys to collect feedback that helps us improve the Bicep extension. |
    | bicep.completions.getAllAccessibleAzureContainerRegistries | false | When completing 'br:' module references, query Azure for all container registries accessible to the user (might be slow). If this option is off, only  registries configured under [moduleAliases](./bicep-config-modules.md#aliases-for-modules) in [_bicepconfig.json_ files](./bicep-config.md) will be listed. |
    | bicep.trace.server | off | Configure tracing of messages sent to the Bicep language server. |

To configure the settings:

1. From the **File** menu, select **Preferences** and then **Settings**.
1. Expand **Extensions** to select **Bicep**:

## Visual Studio and Bicep extension

To author Bicep file from Visual Studio, you need:

- **Visual Studio** - If you don't already have Visual Studio, [install it](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
- **Bicep extension for Visual Studio**.  Visual Studio with the Bicep extension provides language support and resource autocompletion. The extension helps you create and validate Bicep files. Install the extension from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.visualstudiobicep).

To walk through a tutorial, see [Quickstart: Create Bicep files with Visual Studio](./quickstart-create-bicep-use-visual-studio.md).

## Azure CLI

When you use Azure CLI with Bicep, you have everything you need to [deploy](deploy-cli.md) and [decompile](decompile.md) Bicep files. Azure CLI automatically installs the Bicep CLI when a command is executed that needs it.

You must have Azure CLI version **2.20.0 or later** installed. To install or update the Azure CLI on different operating systems, see:

- [Install on Windows](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows)
- [Install on Linux](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux)
- [Install on macOS](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-macos)

To verify your current version, run:

```azurecli
az --version
```

To validate your Bicep CLI installation, use:

```azurecli
az bicep version
```

To upgrade to the latest version, use:

```azurecli
az bicep upgrade
```

For more commands, see [Bicep CLI](bicep-cli.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure CLI installs a self-contained instance of the Bicep CLI. This instance doesn't conflict with any versions you may have manually installed. The Azure CLI doesn't add Bicep CLI to your PATH.

You're done with setting up your Bicep environment. The rest of this article describes installation steps that you don't need when using the Azure CLI.

## Azure PowerShell

You must have Azure PowerShell version **5.6.0 or later** installed. To update or install, see [Install Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).

Azure PowerShell doesn't automatically install the Bicep CLI. Instead, you must [manually install the Bicep CLI](#install-manually).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The self-contained instance of the Bicep CLI installed by the Azure CLI isn't available to PowerShell commands. Azure PowerShell deployments fail if you haven't manually installed the Bicep CLI.

When you manually install the Bicep CLI, run the Bicep commands with the `bicep` syntax, instead of the `az bicep` syntax for Azure CLI.

To check your Bicep CLI version, run:

```cmd
bicep --version
```

## Install manually

The following methods install the Bicep CLI and add it to your PATH. You must manually install for any use other than the Azure CLI.

When installing manually, select a location that is different than the one managed by the Azure CLI. All of the following examples use a location named **bicep** or **.bicep**. This location won't conflict with the location managed by the Azure CLI, which uses **.azure**.

- [Linux](#linux)
- [macOS](#macos)
- [Windows](#windows)

### Linux

```sh
# Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
curl -Lo bicep https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-linux-x64
# Mark it as executable
chmod +x ./bicep
# Add bicep to your PATH (requires admin)
sudo mv ./bicep /usr/local/bin/bicep
# Verify you can now access the 'bicep' command
bicep --help
# Done!
```

> [!NOTE]
> For lightweight Linux distributions like [Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/), use **bicep-linux-musl-x64** instead of **bicep-linux-x64** in the preceding script.

### macOS

#### Via homebrew

```sh
# Add the tap for bicep
brew tap azure/bicep

# Install the tool
brew install bicep
```

#### Via BASH

```sh
# Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
curl -Lo bicep https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-osx-x64
# Mark it as executable
chmod +x ./bicep
# Add Gatekeeper exception (requires admin)
sudo spctl --add ./bicep
# Add bicep to your PATH (requires admin)
sudo mv ./bicep /usr/local/bin/bicep
# Verify you can now access the 'bicep' command
bicep --help
# Done!
```

> [!NOTE]
> A [Bicep CLI](./install.md#visual-studio-code-and-bicep-extension) version 0.16.X or later installation doesn't need a Gatekeeper exception. However, [nightly builds](#install-the-nightly-builds) of the Bicep CLI still require the exception.

### Windows

#### Windows Installer

Download and run the [latest Windows installer](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-setup-win-x64.exe). The installer doesn't require administrative privileges. After the installation, the Bicep CLI is added to your user PATH. Close and reopen any open command shell windows for the PATH change to take effect.

#### Chocolatey

```powershell
choco install bicep
```

#### Winget

```powershell
winget install -e --id Microsoft.Bicep
```

#### Manual with PowerShell

```powershell
# Create the install folder
$installPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\.bicep"
$installDir = New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $installPath -Force
$installDir.Attributes += 'Hidden'
# Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-win-x64.exe", "$installPath\bicep.exe")
# Add bicep to your PATH
$currentPath = (Get-Item -path "HKCU:\Environment" ).GetValue('Path', '', 'DoNotExpandEnvironmentNames')
if (-not $currentPath.Contains("%USERPROFILE%\.bicep")) { setx PATH ($currentPath + ";%USERPROFILE%\.bicep") }
if (-not $env:path.Contains($installPath)) { $env:path += ";$installPath" }
# Verify you can now access the 'bicep' command.
bicep --help
# Done!
```

## Install on air-gapped cloud

The `bicep install` and `bicep upgrade` commands don't work in an air-gapped environment. To install Bicep CLI in an air-gapped environment, you need to download the Bicep CLI executable manually and save it to **.azure/bin**. This location is where the instance managed by Azure CLI is installed.

- **Linux**

    1. Download **bicep-linux-x64** from the [Bicep release page](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/) in a non-air-gapped environment.
    1. Copy the executable to the **$HOME/.azure/bin** directory on an air-gapped machine. Rename file to **bicep**.

- **macOS**

    1. Download **bicep-osx-x64** from the [Bicep release page](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/) in a non-air-gapped environment.
    1. Copy the executable to the **$HOME/.azure/bin** directory on an air-gapped machine. Rename file to **bicep**.

- **Windows**

    1. Download **bicep-win-x64.exe** from the [Bicep release page](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/) in a non-air-gapped environment.
    1. Copy the executable to the **%UserProfile%/.azure/bin** directory on an air-gapped machine. Rename file to **bicep.exe**.

When using the [Azure CLI task](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-cli-v2) on air-gapped cloud, you must set the `useGlobalConfig` property of the task to `true`. The default value is `false`. See [CI/CD with Azure Pipelines and Bicep files](./add-template-to-azure-pipelines.md) for an example.

## Install the nightly builds

If you'd like to try the latest pre-release bits of Bicep before they're released, see [Install nightly builds](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/blob/main/docs/installing-nightly.md).

> [!WARNING]
> These pre-release builds are much more likely to have known or unknown bugs.

## Install the NuGet package

The Bicep team has made the [Azure.Bicep.Core NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Bicep.Core) publicly available on nuget.org. While it's public, it isn't a supported package. Any dependency you take on this package will be done at your own risk and we reserve the right to push breaking changes to this package at any time.

For more information about installing and consuming NuGet packages, see [Consume packages](/nuget/consume-packages/overview-and-workflow).
