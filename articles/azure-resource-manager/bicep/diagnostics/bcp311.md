# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP311

This diagnostic occurs when you provide an invalid index number. Arrays in Bicep are zero-based. For more information, see [Arrays](../data-types.md#arrays).

## Description

The provided index value of \<index-value> isn't valid for type \<type-name>. Indexes for this type must be between 0 and \<zero-based-tuple-index>.

## Level

Error

## Solutions

Use the correct index number.

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because the index is out of bounds:

```bicep
var exampleArray = [
  1
  2
  3
]

output bar int = exampleArray[3]
```

You can fix the diagnostic by using the correct index number:

```bicep
var exampleArray = [
  1
  2
  3
]

output bar int = exampleArray[2]
```
