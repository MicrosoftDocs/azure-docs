# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP333

This diagnostic occurs when an assigned string or array is shorter than the allowable length.

## Description

The provided value (whose length will always be less than or equal to \<length>) is too short to assign to a target for which the minimum allowable length is \<min-length>.

## Level

Warning / Error

## Solution

Assign a string whose length is within the allowable range.

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because the value `st` is shorter than the allowable length:

```bicep
@minLength(3)
@maxLength(10)
param storageAccountName string = 'st'
```

You can fix the diagnostic by assigning a string whose length is within the allowable range.

```bicep
@minLength(3)
@maxLength(10)
param storageAccountName string = 'myStorage'
```
