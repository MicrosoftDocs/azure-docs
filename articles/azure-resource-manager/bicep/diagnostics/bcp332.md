# Bicep error/warning code - BCP332

This error/warning occurs when a string or array exceeding the allowable length is assigned.  

## Error/warning description

`The provided value (whose length will always be greater than or equal to <length>) is too long to assign to a target for which the maximum allowable length is <max-length>.`

## Solution

Assign a string whose length is within the allowable range.

## Examples

The following example raises the error because the value `longerThan10` exceeds the allowable length:

```bicep
@minLength(3)
@maxLength(10)
param storageAccountName string = 'longerThan10'
```

You can fix the error by assigning a string whose length is within the allowable range.

```bicep
@minLength(3)
@maxLength(10)
param storageAccountName string = 'myStorage'
```
