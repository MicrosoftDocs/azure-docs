# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP082

This diagnostic is similar to [BCP057](./bcp057.md), it occurs when the referenced name doesn't exist, likely due to a typo. The compiler identifies and suggests a similarly named symbol.

## Description

The name \<name> doesn't exist in the current context. Did you mean \<name>?

## Level

Warning / Error

## Solutions

Fix the typo.

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because `substirng` looks like a typo.

```bicep
var prefix = substirng('1234567890', 0, 11)
```

You can fix the diagnostic by using `substring` instead:

```bicep
var prefix = substring('1234567890', 0, 11)
```
