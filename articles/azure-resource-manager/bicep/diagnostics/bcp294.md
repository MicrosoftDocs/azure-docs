# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP294

This diagnostic occurs when you use values of different [data types](../data-types.md) in a [union type](../data-types.md#union-types) definition.

## Description

Type unions must be reducible to a single ARM type (such as 'string', 'int', or 'bool').

## Level

Error

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because there are different types used in the union type:

```bicep
type foo = 'a' | 1
```

You can fix the diagnostic by using a single data type for the union type definition:

```bicep
type foo = 'a' | 'b'
```
