# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP048

This diagnostic occurs when a function has two or more possible signatures, but the input provided doesn't match any of them.

## Description

Can't resolve function overload.

## Level

Error

## Solution

Ensure that the argument passed to the function matches one of the expected types defined in its overload signatures.

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because the [`length()`](../bicep-functions-string.md#contains) function requires its argument to be a string, an object, or an array.

```bicep
output stringLength int = length(3)
```

You can fix the issue by providing an argument that matches the required argument type:

```bicep
output stringLength int = length('three')
```
