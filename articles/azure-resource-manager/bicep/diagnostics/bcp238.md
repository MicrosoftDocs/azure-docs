# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP238

In Bicep, arrays or objects can be declared on a single line or across multiple lines. In single-line declarations, values are separated by commas (,), while in multi-line declarations, commas aren't used. You can combine single-line and multi-line styles, but each element must be separated by no more than one comma or one set of new lines. This diagnostic occurs when this rule isn't followed. For more information, see [Arrays](../data-types.md#arrays) or [Objects](../data-types.md#objects).

## Description

Unexpected new line character after a comma.

## Level

Error

## Solution

Remove Use a name of a value.

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because a comma and a new line are used in between _'def'_ and _'ghi'_:

```bicep
var mixedArray = ['abc', 'def',
    'ghi']
```

You can fix the diagnostic by removing either the comma or the new line:

```bicep
var mixedArray = ['abc', 'def'
    'ghi']
```

```bicep
var mixedArray = ['abc', 'def', 'ghi']
```
