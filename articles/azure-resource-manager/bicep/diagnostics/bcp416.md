# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP416

This diagnostic occurs when the supplied string doesn't match the expected pattern.

## Description

The supplied string does not match the expected pattern of \<expected-pattern>.

## Level

Error

## Examples

The following code raises the diagnostic code because the resource name isn't valid according to Azure rules - the `-`(dash) character isn't permitted. For more information, see [Resource name rules](../../management/resource-name-rules.md#microsoftstorage).

```bicep
param location string = resourceGroup().location

resource accounts 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2025-01-01' = {
  name: 'storage-account'
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}
```

You can fix the issue by correcting the resource name property value to meet the naming requirements:

```bicep
param location string = resourceGroup().location

resource accounts 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2025-01-01' = {
  name: 'storageaccount'
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}
```
