# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP009

This diagnostic occurs when a declaration is not completed.

## Description

Expected a literal value, an array, an object, a parenthesized expression, or a function call at this location.

## Level

Error

## Solution

Include the missing part.  For more information, see [Bicep file](../file.md).

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because the `metadata` declaration isn't completed:

```bicep
metadata description = 
```

You can fix the diagnostic by using completing the declaration.

```bicep
metadata description = 'Creates a storage account and a web app'
```

For more information, see [Metadata](../file.md#metadata).
