# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP081

This diagnostic is raised when Bicep can't find the resource type or the API version specified. 

## Description

Resource type \<resource-type@api-version> doesn't have types available. Bicep is unable to validate resource properties prior to deployment, but this won't block the resource from being deployed.

## Level

Warning

## Solutions

Use the correct resource type and API version. You can find the resource types and the API versions in the [Azure template reference](/azure/templates).

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because the resource type is `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts`, not `storageAccount` (singular).

```bicep
param location string = resourceGroup().location

resource storage 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccount@2025-01-01' = {
  name: 'mystorageacct'
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}
```

The following example raises the diagnostic because `2025-01-02` isn't a valid API version for the `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts`.

```bicep
param location string = resourceGroup().location

resource storage 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccount@2025-01-02' = {
  name: 'mystorageacct'
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}
```

You can fix the diagnostic by fixing the typos:

```bicep
param location string = resourceGroup().location

resource storage 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2025-01-01' = {
  name: 'mystorageacct'
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}
```
