# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP083

This diagnostic occurs when you reference a property of a type that appears to be a typo.

## Description

The type \<type-definition> does not contain property \<property-name>. Did you mean \<property-name>?

## Level

Warning / Error

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because _foo.type1_ looks like a typo.

```bicep
type foo = {
  type: string
}

type bar = foo.type1
```

You can fix the diagnostic by correcting the typo:

```bicep
type foo = {
  type: string
}

type bar = foo.type
```
