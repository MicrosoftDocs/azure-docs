# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP327

This diagnostic occurs when you assign a value that is greater than the allowable value.

## Description

The provided value (which will always be greater than or equal to \<value>) is too large to assign to a target for which the maximum allowable value is \<max-value>.

## Level

Warning / Error

## Solution

Assign a value that falls within the permitted range.

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because `13` is greater than maximum allowable value:

```bicep
@minValue(1)
@maxValue(12)
param month int = 13
```

You can fix the diagnostic by assigning a value within the permitted range:

```bicep
@minValue(1)
@maxValue(12)
param month int = 12
```
