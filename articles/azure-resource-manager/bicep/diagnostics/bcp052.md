# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP052

This diagnostic occurs when you reference a property that isn't defined in the [data type](../data-types.md) or the [user-defined data type](../user-defined-data-types.md).

## Description

The type \<type-name> does not contain property \<property-name>.

## Level

Warning / Error

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic _object_ doesn't contain a property called _bar_:

```bicep
type foo = object.bar
```

You can fix the diagnostic by removing the property:

```bicep
type foo = object
```
