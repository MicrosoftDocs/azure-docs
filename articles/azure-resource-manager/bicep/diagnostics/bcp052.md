# Bicep error/warning code - BCP052

This error/warning occurs when you reference a property that isn't defined in the [data type](../data-types.md) or the [user-defined data type]().

## Error/warning description

`The type <type-name> does not contain property <property-name>.`

## Examples

The following example raises the error _object_ doesn't contain a property called _bar_:

```bicep
type foo = object.bar
```

You can fix the error by removing the property:

```bicep
type foo = object
```
