# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP420

In Bicep, every resource or module must have a known deployment scope at compile time. The scope must be statically determinable. If the scope depends on a parameter, a variable, or an expression that can't be evaluated during compilation, Bicep throws BCP420.

## Description

The scope couldn't be resolved at compile time because the supplied expression is ambiguous or too complex. Scoping expressions must be reducible to a specific kind of scope without knowledge of parameter values.

## Level

Error

## Examples

The following code triggers BCP420 because the scope property uses a conditional expression that depends on the runtime value of the **targetResourceGroupName** parameter. Bicep requires that scope expressions resolve to a specific scope at compile time, without relying on parameter values or dynamic logic. Since the compiler can't determine the scope without evaluating **targetResourceGroupName**, it throws BCP420.

```bicep
param targetResourceGroupName string = 'my-target-rg'
param storageAccountName string = 'mystorageacct'
param location string = 'eastus'

module storageModule './module.bicep' = {
  name: 'deployStorage'
  scope: empty(targetResourceGroupName) ? resourceGroup() : resourceGroup(targetResourceGroupName)
  params: {
    storageAccountName: storageAccountName
    location: location
  }
}
```
