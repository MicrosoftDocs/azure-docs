# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP089

This diagnostic occurs when a property name seems to be a typo.

## Description

The property \<property-name> is not allowed on objects of type \<resource-type/type-definition>. Did you mean \<property-name>?

## Level

Warning / Error

## Solution

Fix the typo.

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because the property name _named_ looks like a typo.

```bicep
resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2023-05-01' existing = {
  named: 'account'
}
```

You can fix the diagnostic by correcting the typo:

```bicep
resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2023-05-01' existing = {
  name: 'account'
}
```

The following example raises the diagnostic because the property name _color1_ looks like a typo.

```bicep
type ball = {
  name: string
  color: string
}

output tennisBall ball = {
  name: 'tennis'
  color1: 'yellow'
}
```

You can fix the diagnostic by correcting the typo:

```bicep
type ball = {
  name: string
  color: string
}

output tennisBall ball = {
  name: 'tennis'
  color: 'yellow'
}
```
