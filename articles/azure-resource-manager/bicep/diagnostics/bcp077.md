# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP077

This diagnostic occurs when you reference a property that is write-only.

## Description

The property \<property-name> on type \<type-name> is write-only. Write-only properties cannot be accessed.

## Level

Warning / Error

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because `customHeaders` is a write-only property.

```bicep
resource webhook 'Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/webhooks@2023-07-01' existing = {
  name: 'registry/webhook'
}

output customerHeaders object = webhook.properties.customHeaders
```
