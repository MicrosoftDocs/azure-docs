# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP132

This diagnostic occurs when you have a decorator but there is no declaration following it.

## Description

Expected a declaration after the decorator.

## Level

Error

## Solutions

Add the proper type declarations after the decorator.

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because there are no declarations after the decorator.

```bicep
@description()
```

You can fix the diagnostic by removing the decorator or adding the declaration after the decorator.  

```bicep
@description('Declare a existing storage account.')
resource store 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2023-05-01' existing = {
  name: 'mystore'
}
```

For a list of valid decorators, see [Decorators](../file.md#decorators).
