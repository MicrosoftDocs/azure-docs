# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP062

This diagnostic occurs when the referenced declaration has an error.

## Description

The referenced declaration with name \<type-name> is not valid.

## Level

Error

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because the referenced [user-defined data type](../user-defined-data-types.md) has an error:

```bicep
type ball = object.bar

output tennisBall ball = {
  name: 'tennis'
  color: 'yellow'
}
```

You can fix the diagnostic by fixing the _ball_ definition:

```bicep
type ball = object

output tennisBall ball = {
  name: 'tennis'
  color: 'yellow'
}
```
