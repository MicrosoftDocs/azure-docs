# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP288

This diagnostic occurs when the name specified is a type, but it's being used as a value.

## Description

\<name> refers to a type but is being used as a value here.

## Level

Error

## Solution

Use a name of a value.

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because _bar_ is a name of a [user-defined data type](../user-defined-data-types.md), not a value:

```bicep
type bar = 'white'
var foo = bar 
```

You can fix the diagnostic by assigning a value to the variable _foo_:

```bicep
var bar = 'white'
var foo = bar 
```
