# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP055

This diagnostic occurs when you reference a nonexistent property of a type.

## Description

Cannot access properties of type \<type-name>. A \<type-name> type is required.

## Level

Error

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because _string.bar_ isn't defined:

```bicep
type foo = string.bar
```

You can fix the diagnostic by removing the reference:

```bicep
type foo = string
```
