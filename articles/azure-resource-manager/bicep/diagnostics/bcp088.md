# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP088

This diagnostic occurs when a value of a property seems to be a typo.

## Description

The property \<property-name> expected a value of type \<type-name> but the provided value is of type \<type-name>. Did you mean \<type-name>?

## Level

Warning / Error

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because _name_ value _ad_ looks like a typo.

```bicep
resource kv 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults@2023-07-01' existing = {
  name: 'vault'
 
  resource ap 'accessPolicies' = {
    name: 'ad'
    properties: {
      accessPolicies: []
    }
  }
}
```

You can fix the diagnostic by correcting the typo:

```bicep
resource kv 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults@2023-07-01' existing = {
  name: 'vault'
 
  resource ap 'accessPolicies' = {
    name: 'add'
    properties: {
      accessPolicies: []
    }
  }
}
```
