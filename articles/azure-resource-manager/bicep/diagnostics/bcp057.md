# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP057

This diagnostic occurs when the referenced name doesn't exist, either due to a typo or because it hasn't been declared. If it's a typo, you'll encounter [BCP082](./bcp082.md) when the compiler identifies and suggests a similarly named symbol.

## Description

The name \<name> does not exist in the current context.

## Level

Error

## Solution

Fix the typo or declare the symbol.

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because _bar_ has never been declared:

```bicep
var foo = bar 
```

The following example raises the diagnostic because _bar1_ is a typo:

```bicep
var bar = 'white'
var foo = bar1 
```

You can fix the diagnostic by declaring _bar_, or fix the typo.

```bicep
var bar = 'white'
var foo = bar 
```
