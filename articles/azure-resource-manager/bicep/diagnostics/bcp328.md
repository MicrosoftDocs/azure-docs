# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP328

This diagnostic occurs when you assign a value that is less than the allowable value.

## Description

The provided value (which will always be less than or equal to \<value>) is too small to assign to a target for which the minimum allowable value is \<min-value>.

## Level

Warning / Error

## Solution

Assign a value that falls within the permitted range.

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because `0` is less than minimum allowable value:

```bicep
@minValue(1)
@maxValue(12)
param month int = 0
```

You can fix the diagnostic by assigning a value within the permitted range:

```bicep
@minValue(1)
@maxValue(12)
param month int = 1
```
