# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP292

This diagnostic occurs when you have a decorator that is expecting to be followed by a `param` or `output` or `type` declaration, but miss the declaration.

## Description

Expected a parameter, output, or type declaration after the decorator.

## Level

Error

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because there is no type declaration after the `@metadata`, `@minValue()`, `@maxValue()`,`@minLength()`, `@maxLength()`, `@discriminator()`, or `@sealed()` decorator.

```bicep
@minLength()
```

You can fix the diagnostic by removing the decorator and adding the correct type declaration.  

```bicep
@minLength(3)
param name string
```
