# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP053

This diagnostic occurs when you reference a property that isn't defined in the resource type or [user-defined data type](../user-defined-data-types.md).

## Description

The type \<type-name> does not contain property \<property-name>. Available properties include \<property-names>.

## Level

Warning / Error

## Solution

Reference the correct property name.

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts` doesn't contain a property called `bar`.

```bicep
param location string 

resource storage 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2023-04-01' = {
  name: 'myStorage'
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}

output foo string = storage.bar 
```

You can fix the diagnostic by referencing a valid property, such as `name`:

```bicep
param location string 

resource storage 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2023-04-01' = {
  name: 'myStorage'
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}

output foo string = storage.name
```
