# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP335

This diagnostic occurs when the provided value may be too long to assign to a target with a configured maximum length.

## Description

The provided value can have a length as large as \<source-max-length> and may be too long to assign to a target with a configured maximum length of \<target-max-length>.

## Level

Warning

## Solution

Assign a string whose length is within the allowable range.

## Examples

The following code raises the diagnostic code because a storage account name must be between 3 and 24 characters, but the provided value can be up to 25 characters long. For more information, see [Resource name rules](../../management/resource-name-rules.md#microsoftstorage).

```bicep
param storageCount int

resource accounts 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2025-01-01' = [for i in range(0, storageCount): if (i % 2 == 0) {
  name: 'sa0820${i}'
  location: resourceGroup().location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}]

output storageEndpoints array = [for i in range(0, storageCount): accounts[i].?properties.primaryEndpoints.blob]

```

You can fix the diagnostic by using a short storage account name.

```bicep
param storageCount int

resource accounts 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2025-01-01' = [for i in range(0, storageCount): if (i % 2 == 0) {
  name: 'sa082${i}'
  location: resourceGroup().location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}]

output storageEndpoints array = [for i in range(0, storageCount): accounts[i].?properties.primaryEndpoints.blob]
```
