# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP135

In Bicep, scopes determine the hierarchical level at which resources are deployed within Azure. ARM provides four deployment scopesâ€”resource group, management group, subscription, and tenant. Resources must be deployed within the allowed scopes. For more information, see [Deployment scope](../deploy-to-resource-group.md#deployment-scopes).

## Description

Scope \<scope-name> isn't valid for this resource type. Permitted scopes: \<scope-name>.

## Level

Error

## Solutions

Deploy resources to the permitted scopes.

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because `storageAccounts` can't be deployed at the management group scope.

```bicep
targetScope = 'managementGroup'

resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2023-05-01' = {
  name: 'demostorage0220'
  location: 'eastus'
  sku: {
    name:  'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind:  'StorageV2'
}
```

You can fix the diagnostic by setting the `targetScope` to `resourceGroup`.  

```bicep
targetScope = 'resourceGroup'

resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2023-05-01' = {
  name: 'demostorage0220'
  location: 'eastus'
  sku: {
    name:  'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind:  'StorageV2'
}

```
