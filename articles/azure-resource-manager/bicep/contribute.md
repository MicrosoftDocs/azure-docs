# Contribute to Bicep

Bicep is an open-source project. That means you can contribute to Bicep's development, and participate in the broader Bicep community.

## Contribution types

- **Azure Quickstart Templates.** You can contribute example Bicep files and ARM templates to the Azure Quickstart Templates repository. For more information, see the [Azure Quickstart Templates contribution guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/README.md#contribution-guide).
- **Documentation.** Bicep's documentation is open to contributions, too. For more information, see our [contributor guide overview](/contribute/).
- **Snippets.** Do you have a favorite snippet you think the community would benefit from? You can add it to the Visual Studio Code extension's collection of snippets. For more information, see [Contributing to Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#snippets).
- **Code changes.** If you're a developer and you have ideas you'd like to see in the Bicep language or tooling, you can contribute a pull request. For more information, see [Contributing to Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
