# Linter rule - no unused variables

This rule finds variables that aren't referenced anywhere in the Bicep file.

## Linter rule code

Use the following value in the [Bicep configuration file](bicep-config-linter.md) to customize rule settings:

`no-unused-vars`

## Solution

To reduce confusion in your template, delete any variables that are defined but not used. This test finds all variables that aren't used anywhere in the template.

Use **Quick Fix** to remove the unused variables:
