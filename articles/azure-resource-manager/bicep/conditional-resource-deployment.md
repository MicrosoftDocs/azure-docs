# Conditional deployments in Bicep with the if expression

To optionally deploy a resource or module in Bicep, use the `if` expression. An `if` expression includes a condition that resolves to true or false. When the `if` condition is true, the resource is deployed. When the value is false, the resource isn't created. You can only apply the value to the whole resource or module.

> [!NOTE]
> Conditional deployment doesn't cascade to [child resources](child-resource-name-type.md). If you want to conditionally deploy a resource and its child resources, you must apply the same condition to each resource type.

### Training resources

If you would rather learn about conditions through step-by-step guidance, see [Build flexible Bicep templates by using conditions and loops](/training/modules/build-flexible-bicep-templates-conditions-loops/).

## Define condition for deployment

In Bicep, you can conditionally deploy a resource by passing in a parameter that specifies if the resource is deployed. Test the condition with an `if` expression in the resource declaration. The following example shows the syntax for an `if` expression in a Bicep file. It conditionally deploys a Domain Name System (DNS) zone. When `deployZone` is `true`, it deploys the DNS zone. When `deployZone` is `false`, it skips deploying the DNS zone.

```bicep
param deployZone bool

resource dnsZone 'Microsoft.Network/dnsZones@2023-07-01-preview' = if (deployZone) {
  name: 'myZone'
  location: 'global'
}
```

The following example conditionally deploys a module:

```bicep
param deployZone bool

module dnsZone 'dnszones.bicep' = if (deployZone) {
  name: 'myZoneModule'
}
```

You can use conditions with dependency declarations. For [explicit dependencies](resource-dependencies.md), Azure Resource Manager automatically removes them from the required dependencies when the resource isn't deployed. For implicit dependencies, referencing a property of a conditional resource is allowed but might produce a deployment error.

## New or existing resource

You can use conditional deployment to create a new resource or use an existing one. The following example shows how to deploy a new storage account or use an existing storage account.

```bicep
param storageAccountName string
param location string = resourceGroup().location

@allowed([
  'new'
  'existing'
])
param newOrExisting string = 'new'

resource saNew 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2023-04-01' = if (newOrExisting == 'new') {
  name: storageAccountName
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}

resource saExisting 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2023-04-01' existing = if (newOrExisting == 'existing') {
  name: storageAccountName
}

output storageAccountId string = ((newOrExisting == 'new') ? saNew.id : saExisting.id)
```

When the parameter `newOrExisting` is set to **new**, the condition evaluates to true. The storage account is deployed. Otherwise, the existing storage account is used.

> [!WARNING]
> If you reference a conditionally deployed resource but the resource isn't deployed, you get an error. The error message states that the resource isn't defined in the template.

## Runtime functions

If you use a [reference](./bicep-functions-resource.md#reference) or [list](./bicep-functions-resource.md#list) function with a resource that you specify for conditional deployment, the function gets evaluated. If the resource isn't deployed, you get an error.

Use the [conditional expression ?:](./operators-logical.md#conditional-expression--) operator to ensure that the function is only evaluated for conditions when the resource is deployed. The following example template shows how to use this function with expressions that are only conditionally valid.

```bicep
param vmName string
param location string
param logAnalytics string = ''

resource vmName_omsOnboarding 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions@2024-03-01' = if (!empty(logAnalytics)) {
  name: '${vmName}/omsOnboarding'
  location: location
  properties: {
    publisher: 'Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring'
    type: 'MicrosoftMonitoringAgent'
    typeHandlerVersion: '1.0'
    autoUpgradeMinorVersion: true
    settings: {
      workspaceId: ((!empty(logAnalytics)) ? reference(logAnalytics, '2022-10-01').customerId : null)
    }
    protectedSettings: {
      workspaceKey: ((!empty(logAnalytics)) ? listKeys(logAnalytics, '2022-10-01').primarySharedKey : null)
    }
  }
}

output mgmtStatus string = ((!empty(logAnalytics)) ? 'Enabled monitoring for VM!' : 'Nothing to enable')
```
