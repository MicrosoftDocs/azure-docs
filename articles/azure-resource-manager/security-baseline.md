# Azure security baseline for Azure Resource Manager

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Resource Manager. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Resource Manager. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Resource Manager have been excluded.

 To see how Azure Resource Manager completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Resource Manager security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32007.).

**Guidance**: Azure role-based access control (RBAC) allows you to manage access to Azure resources through role assignments. You can assign these roles to users, groups service principals and managed identities. There are pre-defined built-in roles for certain resources, and these roles can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell or the Azure portal.

You are responsible for third-party applications and marketplace services that may use default passwords.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32009.).

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

Additionally, to help you keep track of dedicated administrative accounts, you can use recommendations from Azure Security Center or built-in Azure Policies, such as:

- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

You can also enable a Just-In-Time access by using Azure AD Privileged Identity Management and Azure Resource Manager.

## Secure configuration

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Secure configuration](../security/benchmarks/security-control-secure-configuration.md).*

### 7.1: Establish secure configurations for all Azure resources

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32047.).

**Guidance**: Use Azure Policy aliases &lt;!--- in the "Microsoft.Resources" namespace --!&gt; to create custom policies to audit or enforce the configuration of your Azure resources. You may also use built-in Azure Policy definitions.

Azure Resource Manager has the ability to export the template in Java Script Object Notation (JSON), which should be reviewed to ensure that the configurations meet the security requirements for your organization.

You can also use the recommendations from Azure Security Center as a secure configuration baseline for your Azure resources.

**Guidance**: Use Azure Policy [deny] and [deploy if not exist] to enforce secure settings across your Azure resources.  In addition, you can use Azure Resource Manager templates to maintain the security configuration of your Azure resources required by your organization. 

Additionally, as an administrator, you may need to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. You can set the lock level to CanNotDelete or ReadOnly.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32068.).

**Guidance**: Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark subscriptions using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It's your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.
