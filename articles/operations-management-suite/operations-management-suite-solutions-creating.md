# Design and build a management solution in Operations Management Suite (OMS) (Preview)
> [!NOTE]
> This is preliminary documentation for creating management solutions in OMS which are currently in preview. Any schema described below is subject to change.  

Every [management solution in Operations Management Suite (OMS)](operations-management-suite-solutions.md) has unique requirements, and each one can include any set of Azure resources required to perform a particular management function. This article presents a basic process to design and build a management solution that is suitable for the most common requirements.  If you are new to building management solutions then you can use this process as a starting point and then leverage the concepts for more complex solutions as your requirements evolve.


## Solution design

You should start your management solution by building the individual components in your Azure environment.  Once you have the functionality working properly, then you can start packaging them into a [management solution file](operations-management-suite-solutions-solution-file.md).

The most common pattern for a management solution is shown in the following diagram.  The different components in this pattern are discussed in the following section.

![OMS solution overview](media/operations-management-suite-solutions/solution-overview.png)


### Data sources
The first step in designing a solution is determining the data that you require from the Log Analytics repository.  This data may be collected by a [data source](../log-analytics/log-analytics-data-sources.md) or another solution, or your solution may need to provide the process to collect it.

There are a number of ways data sources that can be collected in the Log Analytics repository as described in [Data sources in Log Analytics](../log-analytics/log-analytics-data-sources.md).  This includes events in the Windows Event Log or generated by Syslog in addition to performance counters for both Windows and Linux clients.  You can also gathered for Azure resources by Azure Monitor.  

If you require data that's not accessible through any of the data sources, then you can use the [HTTP Data Collector API](../log-analytics/log-analytics-data-collector-api.md) which allows you to write data to the Log Analytics repository from any client that can call a REST API.  The most common means of custom data collection in a management solution is to create a [runbook in Azure Automation](../automation/automation-runbook-types.md) that collects the required data and uses the Data Collector API to write to the repository.  Runbooks are written in PowerShell and can access other services and applications in Azure as well as other clouds.

### Log searches
[Log searches](../log-analytics/log-analytics-log-searches.md) are used to extract and analyze data in the Log Analytics repository.  They are used by views and alerts in addition to allowing the user to perform ad hoc analysis of data in the repository.  

You should define any queries that you think will be helpful to the user even if they aren't used by any views or alerts.  These will be available to them as Saved Searches in the portal, and you can also include then in a [List of Queries visualization part](../log-analytics/log-analytics-view-designer-parts.md#list-of-queries-part) in your custom view.

### Alerts
Alerts identify issues identified in your solution and either notify the user or automatically run an action in response. You should identify different alert conditions and include corresponding alert rules in your solution file.

In addition to notifying the user of the detected issue, alerts can create responses such as starting a runbook or calling a webhook.  

### Views
Views in Log Analytics are used to visualize data from the Log Analytics repository.  You can [create custom views using  the View Designer](../log-analytics/log-analytics-view-designer.md) which you can later export for inclusion in your solution file.

Each solution will typically contain a single view with a [tile](../log-analytics/log-analytics-view-designer-tiles.md) that is displayed on the user's main dashboard.  The view can contain any number of [visualization parts](../log-analytics/log-analytics-view-designer-parts.md) to provide different visualizations of the collected data to the user.


## Create solution file
Once you've configured and tested the components that will be part of your solution, you can [create your solution file](operations-management-suite-solutions-solution-file.md).  You will implement the solution components in a Resource Manager template that includes a [solution resource](operations-management-suite-solutions-solution-file.md#solution-resource) with relationships to the other resources in the file.  

### Best practices
See [Best practices in Operations Management Suite (OMS) management solutions](operations-management-suite-solutions-best-practices.md) for best practices that you should follow in translating the logic of your management solution into a solution file.

### Editing tools
You can use any text editor to work with solution files, but we recommend leveraging the features provided in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code as described in the following articles.

- [Creating and deploying Azure resource groups through Visual Studio](../azure-resource-manager/vs-azure-tools-resource-groups-deployment-projects-create-deploy.md)
- [Working with Azure Resource Manager Templates in Visual Studio Code](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-vs-code.md)


## Testing a management solution
Prior to deploying your management solution, it is recommended that you test it using [Test-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy.md#deploy).  This will validate your solution file and help you identify any problems before attempting to deploy it.

## Publish solution
Once you have completed and tested your solution, you can make it available to customers through either the following sources.

### Azure Quickstart templates
[Azure Quickstart templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/templates/) is a set of Resource Manager templates contributed by the community through GitHub.  You can make your solution available by following information in the [contribution guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE).

### Azure Marketplace
The [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/) allows you to distribute and sell your solution to other developers, ISVs, and IT professionals.  You can learn how to publish your solution to Azure Marketplace at [How to publish and manage an offer in the Azure Marketplace](../marketplace-publishing/marketplace-publishing-getting-started.md).



## Next steps
* [Add saved searches and alerts](operations-management-suite-solutions-resources-searches-alerts.md) to your management solution.
* [Add views](operations-management-suite-solutions-resources-views.md) to your management solution.
* [Add Automation runbooks and other resources](operations-management-suite-solutions-resources-automation.md) to your management solution.
* Learn the details of [Authoring Azure Resource Manager templates](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authoring-templates.md).
* Search [Azure Quickstart Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/templates) for samples of different Resource Manager templates.
