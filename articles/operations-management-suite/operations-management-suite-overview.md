# Operations Management Suite (OMS) overview

Microsoft Operations Management Suite (OMS) is Microsoft's cloud-based IT management solution that helps you manage and protect your on-premises and cloud infrastructure.  Since OMS is implemented as a cloud-based service, you can have it up and running quickly with minimal investment in infrastructure services.  New features are delivered automatically, saving you ongoing maintenance and upgrade costs.

In addition to providing valuable services on its own, OMS can integrate with System Center components such as System Center Operations Manger to extend your existing management investments into the cloud.  System Center and OMS can work together to provide a full hybrid management experience.

The following sections provide a high level description of the different value areas of OMS and the services that implement them.  You can refer to OMS architecture for an overview of the different OMS components before reviewing the detailed documentation for each.


## ![Log Analysis](media/operations-management-suite-overview/icon-analytics.png) Log Analysis

Log Analysis in OMS is implemented with [Log Analytics](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/log-analytics) which helps you collect, correlate, search, and act on log and performance data generated by operating systems and applications. It gives you real-time operational insights using integrated search and custom dashboards to readily analyze millions of records across all of your workloads and servers regardless of their physical location.

You can easily add solutions to Log Analytics that define data to be collected and the logic for its analysis.  Solutions may include additional functionality that is automatically delivered to agents with minimal or no configuration.  In addition to using analysis tools provided by individual solutions, you can perform custom searches across the entire dataset in order to correlate data between systems and applications.  


## ![Azure Automation](media/operations-management-suite-overview/icon-automation.png) IT Automation

IT Automation in OMS is implemented with [Azure Automation](../automation/automation-intro.md) which provides both process automation and configuration management.

Azure Automation automates administrative processes with [runbooks](../automation/automation-runbook-types.md) that are based on PowerShell and run in the Azure cloud.  Runbooks can access any product or service that can be managed with PowerShell including resources in other clouds such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).  Runbooks can also be executed on a server in your local data center to manage local resources.

Azure Automation provides configuration management with [PowerShell DSC](../automation/automation-dsc-overview.md).  You can create and manage DSC resources hosted in Azure and apply them to cloud and on-premises systems to define and automatically enforce their configuration.


## ![OMS Backup and Disaster Recovery](media/operations-management-suite-overview/icon-backup.png) Backup and Disaster Recovery

Backup and Disaster Recovery helps you protect your data and ensure the availability of your servers and applications.  Backup and recovery solutions are implemented with Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery.

[Azure Backup](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/backup) protects your application data and retains it for years without any capital investment and with minimal operating costs.  It can backup data from physical and virtual Windows servers in addition to application workloads such as SQL Server and SharePoint.  It can also be used by System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM) to replicate protected data to Azure for redundancy and long term storage.

[Azure Site Recovery](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/site-recovery) contributes to your business continuity and a disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy by orchestrating replication, failover, and recovery of on-premises Hyper-V virtual machines, VMware virtual machines, and physical Windows/Linux servers. You can replicate machines to a secondary datacenter or extend your data center by replicating them to Azure. Site Recovery also provides simple failover and recovery for workloads. It integrates with disaster recovery mechanisms such as SQL Server AlwaysOn, and provides recovery plans for easy failover of workloads that are tiered across multiple machines.


## ![OMS Security and Compliance](media/operations-management-suite-overview/icon-security.png) Security and Compliance
Security and Compliance helps you identify, assess, and mitigate security risks to your infrastructure.  These features of OMS are implemented through multiple solutions in Log Analytics that analyze log data and configuration from agent systems to assist you in ensuring the ongoing security of your environment.

- The [Security and Audit solution](log-analytics-security-audit.md ) collects and analyzes security events on managed systems to identify suspicious activity.
- The [Antimalware solution](log-analytics-malware.md ) reports on the status of antimalware protection on managed systems.  
- The System Updates solution performs an analysis of the security updates and other updates on your managed systems so that you easily identify systems requiring patching.
