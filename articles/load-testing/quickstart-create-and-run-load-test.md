# Quickstart: Create and run a load test with Azure Load Testing

In this quickstart, you'll load test a web application by creating a URL-based test with Azure Load Testing in the Azure portal. With a URL-based test, you can create a load test without prior knowledge about load testing tools or scripting. Use the Azure portal experience to configure a load test by specifying HTTP requests.

To create a URL-based load test, you perform the following steps:

1. Create an Azure Load Testing resource
1. Specify the web application endpoint and basic load configuration parameters.
1. Optionally, add more HTTP endpoints.

After you complete this quickstart, you'll have a resource and load test that you can use for other tutorials.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An Azure account with permission to create and manage resources in the subscription, such as the [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) or [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner) role.

## What problem will we solve?

Before you deploy an application, you want to make sure that the application can support the expected load. You can use load testing to simulate user traffic to your application and ensure that your application meets your requirements. Simulating load might require a complex infrastructure setup. Also, as a developer, you might not be familiar with load testing tools and test script syntax.

In this quickstart, you create a load test for your application endpoint by using Azure Load Testing. You configure the load test by adding HTTP requests for your application entirely in the Azure portal, without knowledge of load testing tools and scripting.

## Create an Azure Load Testing resource

First, you create the top-level resource for Azure Load Testing. It provides a centralized place to view and manage test plans, test results, and related artifacts.

If you already have a load testing resource, skip this section and continue to [Create a load test](#create-a-load-test).

To create a load testing resource:

[!INCLUDE [azure-load-testing-create-portal](./includes/azure-load-testing-create-in-portal/azure-load-testing-create-in-portal.md)]

## Create a load test

Azure Load Testing enables you to quickly create a load test from the Azure portal by specifying the target web application URL and the basic load testing parameters. The service abstracts the complexity of creating the load test script and provisioning the compute infrastructure.

To create a load test for a web endpoint:

1. Go to the **Overview** page of your Azure Load Testing resource.

1. On the **Get started** tab, select **Add HTTP requests** > **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-create-and-run-load-test/quick-test-resource-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to create a URL-based test from the resource overview page in the Azure portal." lightbox="media/quickstart-create-and-run-load-test/quick-test-resource-overview.png":::

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the load test details:

    |Field  |Description  |
    |-|-|
    | **Test name**                | Enter a unique test name. |
    | **Test description**         | (Optional) Enter a load test description. |
    | **Run test after creation**  | Selected. After you save the load test, the test starts automatically. |
    | **Enable advanced settings** | Leave unchecked. With advanced settings, you can add multiple HTTP requests and configure more advanced load test settings. |

1. Next, configure the application endpoint and load test parameters:

    |Field  |Description  |
    |-|-|
    | **Test URL**                | Enter the complete URL that you would like to run the test for. For example, `https://www.example.com/products`. |
    | **Specify load**            | Select *Virtual users* to specify the simulated load based on a target number of virtual users. |
    | **Number of virtual users** | Enter the total number of virtual users to simulate.<br/><br/>Azure Load Testing distributes the simulated load evenly across parallel test engine instances, with each engine handling up to 250 virtual users. For example, entering 400 virtual users results in two instances with 200 virtual users each. |
    | **Test duration (minutes)** | Enter the duration of the load test in minutes. |
    | **Ramp-up time (minutes)**  | Enter the ramp-up time of the load test in minutes. The ramp-up time is the time to reach the target number of virtual users. |

    Alternately, select the **Requests per seconds (RPS)** to configure the simulated load based on the target number of requests per second.

1. Select **Review + create** to review the load test configuration, and then select **Create** to start the load test.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-create-and-run-load-test/quickstart-test-virtual-users.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the quick test page in the Azure portal, highlighting the option for specifying virtual users." lightbox="media/quickstart-create-and-run-load-test/quickstart-test-virtual-users.png":::

After the load test is saved, Azure Load Testing generates a load test script to simulate traffic to your application endpoint. Then, the service provisions the infrastructure for simulating the target load.

## View the test results

Once the load test starts, you're redirected to the test run dashboard. While the load test is running, Azure Load Testing captures both client-side metrics and server-side metrics. In this section, you use the dashboard to monitor the client-side metrics.

1. On the test run dashboard, you can see the streaming client-side metrics while the test is running. By default, the data refreshes every five seconds.

1. Optionally, change the display filters to view a specific time range, result percentile, or error type.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-create-and-run-load-test/test-result-filters.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the filter criteria for the results of a load test." lightbox="./media/quickstart-create-and-run-load-test/test-result-filters.png":::

## Add requests to a load test

With Azure Load Testing, you can create a URL-based load test that contains multiple requests. You can add up to five HTTP requests to a load test and use any of the HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, and more.

To add an HTTP request to the load test you created previously:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to your Azure Load Testing resource.

1. In the left navigation, select **Tests**  to view all tests.

1. Select your test from the list by selecting the corresponding checkbox, and then select **Edit**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-create-and-run-load-test/edit-load-test.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the list of tests in the Azure portal, highlighting the Edit button to modify the load test settings." lightbox="./media/quickstart-create-and-run-load-test/edit-load-test.png":::

1. On the **Basics** tab, select **Enable advanced settings**.

    With advanced settings, you can define multiple HTTP requests for a load test. In addition, you can also configure test criteria and advanced load parameters.

    When you switch to advanced settings, the test URL isn't automatically added to the test. You need to re-add the test URL to the load test.

1. Go to the **Test plan** tab, and select **Add request** to add a request to the load test.

1. On the **Add request** page, enter the request details, and then select **Add**.

    |Field  |Description  |
    |-|-|
    | **Request format**   | Select *Add input in UI* to configure the request details through fields in the Azure portal. |
    | **Request name**     | Enter a unique name for the request. You can refer to this request name when you define test fail criteria. |
    | **URL**              | The URL of the application endpoint. |
    | **Method**           | Select an HTTP method from the list. Azure Load Testing supports GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, and OPTIONS. |
    | **Query parameters** | (Optional) Enter query string parameters to append to the URL. |
    | **Headers**          | (Optional) Enter HTTP headers to include in the HTTP request. |
    | **Body**             | (Optional) Depending on the HTTP method, you can specify the HTTP body content. Azure Load Testing supports the following formats: raw data, JSON view, JavaScript, HTML, and XML. |

1. (Optional) Add more requests to your load test.

1. (Optional) On to the **Load** tab, configure the load parameters.

    Notice that the advanced settings enable you to configure the number of test engine instances and choose from different load patterns.

1. Select **Apply** to update the load test configuration.

1. On the **Tests** page, select the test, and then select **Run** to run the load test with the updated configuration.

    Notice that the test run dashboard displays metrics for the different HTTP requests in the load test. You can use the **Requests** filter to only view metrics for specific requests.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-create-and-run-load-test/test-results-multiple-requests.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the test results dashboard in the Azure portal, showing the results for the different requests in the load test." lightbox="./media/quickstart-create-and-run-load-test/test-results-multiple-requests.png":::

## How did we solve the problem?

In this quickstart, you created a URL-based load test entirely in the Azure portal, without scripting or load testing tools. You configured the load test by adding HTTP requests and then used the load test dashboard to analyze the load test client-side metrics and assess the performance of the application under test. Azure Load Testing abstracts the complexity of setting up the infrastructure for simulating high-scale user load for your application.

You can further expand the load test to also monitor server-side metrics of the application under load, and to specify test fail metrics to get alerted when the application doesn't meet your requirements. To ensure that the application continues to perform well, you can also integrate load testing as part of your continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflow.
