# Service limits in Azure Load Testing

Azure uses limits and quotas to prevent budget overruns due to fraud, and to honor Azure capacity constraints. Consider these limits as you scale for production workloads. In this article, you learn about:

- Default limits on Azure resources related to Azure Load Testing.
- Requesting quota increases.

## Default resource quotas

In this section, you learn about the default and maximum quota limits.

### Test engine instances

The following limits apply on a per-region, per-subscription basis.

| Resource  | Default limit | Maximum limit |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Concurrent engine instances |     5-400 <sup>1</sup>    |     1000    |
| Engine instances per test run | 1-400 <sup>1</sup> |  400   | 

<sup>1</sup> If you aren't already at the maximum limit, you can request an increase. We aren't currently able to approve increase requests past our maximum limitations stated above. To request an increase for your default limit, contact Azure Support. Default limits vary by offer category type.

### Test runs

The following limits apply on a per-region, per-subscription basis.

| Resource  | Default limit |  Maximum limit |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Concurrent test runs | 5-50 <sup>2</sup> |     1000    |
| Test duration | 3 - 24 hours <sup>2</sup> | 24 |
| Tests per resource | 10000 | |
| Test runs per test | 5000 | |
| File uploads per test | 1000 | |
| Zip file uploads per test | 100 | |
| App Components per test or test run | 100 | |
| [Test criteria](./how-to-define-test-criteria.md#load-test-fail-criteria) per test | 50 | |

<sup>2</sup> If you aren't already at the maximum limit, you can request an increase. We aren't currently able to approve increase requests past our maximum limitations stated above. To request an increase for your default limit, contact Azure Support. Default limits vary by offer category type.

### Notifications
The following limits apply on a per-region, per-subscription basis.
| Resource  | Default limit |
|---------| ---------: | 
|Tests per notification rule  | 20 |
|Action groups per notification rule| 5| 

### Data retention

Azure Load Testing captures metrics, test results, and logs for each test run. The following data retention limits apply:

| Resource | Limit | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Server-side metrics | 90 days | Learn how to [configure server-side metrics](./how-to-monitor-server-side-metrics.md). |
| Client-side metrics | 365 days | |
| Test results | 6 months | Learn how to [export test results](./how-to-export-test-results.md). |
| Test log files | 6 months | Learn how to [download the logs for diagnosing failing load tests](./how-to-diagnose-failing-load-test.md). |
