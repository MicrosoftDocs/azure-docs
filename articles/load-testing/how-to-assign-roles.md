# Manage access to Azure Load Testing

In this article, you learn how to manage access (authorization) to an Azure load testing resource. [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/overview.md) is used to manage access to Azure resources, such as the ability to create new resources or use existing ones. You can grant role-based access to users using the Azure portal, Azure Command-Line tools, or Azure Management APIs.

## Prerequisites

To assign Azure roles, your Azure account must have:

* `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [User Access Administrator](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) or [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner).

To create a new load testing resource, your Azure account must have:

- Permission to create resources in the resource group for the load testing resource, such as the [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) or [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner) role.

## Roles in Azure Load Testing

In Azure Load Testing, access is granted by assigning the appropriate Azure role to users, groups, and applications at the load testing resource scope. Following are the built-in roles supported by a load testing resource:

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Load Test Reader** | Read-only actions in the Load Testing resource. Readers can list and view tests and test runs in the resource. Readers can't create, update, or run tests. |
| **Load Test Contributor** | View, create, edit, or delete (where applicable) tests and test runs in a Load Testing resource. |
| **Load Test Owner** | Full access to the Load Testing resource, including the ability to view, create, edit, or delete (where applicable) assets in a resource. For example, you can modify or delete the Load Testing resource. |

If you have the **Owner**, **Contributor**, or **Load Test Owner** role at the subscription level, you automatically have the same permissions as the **Load Test Owner** at the resource level.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Role access can be scoped to multiple levels in Azure. For example, someone with owner access to a resource might not have owner access to the resource group that contains the resource. For more information, see [How Azure RBAC works](../role-based-access-control/overview.md#how-azure-rbac-works).

## Role permissions

The following tables describe the specific permissions given to each role. These permissions can include *Actions*, which give permissions, and *Not Actions*, which restrict them.

### Load Test Owner

A Load Test Owner can manage everything, including access. The following table shows the permissions granted for the role:

| Actions | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.Resources/deployments/* | Create and manage resource group deployments. | 
| Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read | Gets or lists resource groups. |
| Microsoft.Insights/alertRules/* | Create and manage alert rules. |
| Microsoft.Authorization/*/read | Read authorization. |
| Microsoft.LoadTestService/* | Create and manage load testing resources. |

| DataActions | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.LoadTestService/loadtests/* | Start, stop, and manage load tests. |

### Load Test Contributor

A Load Test Contributor can manage everything except access. The following table shows the permissions granted for the role:

| Actions | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.Resources/deployments/* | Create and manage resource group deployments. | 
| Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read | Gets or lists resource groups. |
| Microsoft.Insights/alertRules/* | Create and manage alert rules. |
| Microsoft.Authorization/*/read | Read authorization. |
| Microsoft.LoadTestService/*/read | Create and manage load testing resources. |

| DataActions | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.LoadTestService/loadtests/* | Start, stop, and manage load tests. |

### Load Test Reader

A Load Test Reader can view all the resources in a load testing resource but can't make any changes. The following table shows the permissions granted for the role:

| Actions | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.Resources/deployments/* | Create and manage resource group deployments. | 
| Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read | Gets or lists resource groups. |
| Microsoft.Insights/alertRules/* | Create and manage alert rules. |
| Microsoft.Authorization/*/read | Read authorization. |
| Microsoft.LoadTestService/*/read | Create and manage load testing resources. |

| DataActions | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.LoadTestService/loadtests/readTest/action | Read load tests. |

## Configure Azure RBAC for your load testing resource

The following section shows you how to configure Azure RBAC on your load testing resource through the Azure portal and PowerShell.

### Configure Azure RBAC using the Azure portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and open your load testing resource from the **Azure Load Testing** page.

1. Select **Access control (IAM)** and select a role from the list of available roles. You can choose any of the available built-in roles that an Azure load testing resource supports or any custom role you might have defined. Assign the role to a user to which you want to give permissions.

    For detailed steps, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).

#### Remove role assignments from a user

You can remove the access permission for a user who isn't managing the Azure load testing resource, or who no longer works for the organization. The following steps show how to remove the role assignments from a user. For detailed steps, see [Remove Azure role assignments](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-remove):

1. Open **Access control (IAM)** at a scope, such as management group, subscription, resource group, or resource, where you want to remove access.

1. Select the **Role assignments** tab to view all the role assignments at this scope.

1. In the list of role assignments, add a checkmark next to the user with the role assignment you want to remove.

1. Select **Remove**, and then select **Yes** to confirm.

### Configure Azure RBAC using PowerShell

You can also configure role-based access to a load testing resource using the following [Azure PowerShell cmdlets](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-powershell):

* [Get-AzRoleDefinition](/powershell/module/Az.Resources/Get-AzRoleDefinition) lists all Azure roles that are available in Microsoft Entra ID. You can use this cmdlet with the Name parameter to list all the actions that a specific role can perform.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Get-AzRoleDefinition -Name 'Load Test Contributor'
    ```
    
    The following snippet is the example output:

    ```output
    Name             : Load Test Contributor
    Id               : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
    IsCustom         : False
    Description      : View, create, update, delete and execute load tests. View and list load test resources but can not make any changes.
    Actions          : {Microsoft.LoadTestService/*/read, Microsoft.Authorization/*/read, Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*, Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/readâ€¦}
    NotActions       : {}
    DataActions      : {Microsoft.LoadTestService/loadtests/*}
    NotDataActions   : {}
    AssignableScopes : {/}
    ```

* [Get-AzRoleAssignment](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azroleassignment) lists Azure role assignments at the specified scope. Without any parameters, this cmdlet returns all the role assignments made under the subscription. Use the `ExpandPrincipalGroups` parameter to list access assignments for the specified user, and the groups that the user belongs to.

    **Example**: Use the following cmdlet to list all the users and their roles within a load testing resource.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Get-AzRoleAssignment -Scope '/subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/resourcegroups/<Resource Group Name>/Providers/Microsoft.LoadTestService/loadtests/<Load Test Name>'
    ```

* Use [New-AzRoleAssignment](/powershell/module/Az.Resources/New-AzRoleAssignment) to assign access to users, groups, and applications to a particular scope.

    **Example**: Use the following command to assign the "Load Test Reader" role for a user in the load testing resource scope.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    New-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName <sign-in Id of a user you wish to grant access> -RoleDefinitionName 'Load Test Reader' -Scope '/subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/resourcegroups/<Resource Group Name>/Providers/Microsoft.LoadTestService/loadtests/<Load Testing resource name>'
    ```

* Use [Remove-AzRoleAssignment](/powershell/module/Az.Resources/Remove-AzRoleAssignment) to remove access of a specified user, group, or application from a particular scope.

    **Example**: Use the following command to remove the user from the Load Test Reader role in the load testing resource scope.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Remove-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName <sign-in Id of a user you wish to remove> -RoleDefinitionName 'Load Test Reader' -Scope '/subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/resourcegroups/<Resource Group Name>/Providers/Microsoft.LoadTestService/loadtests/<Load Testing resource name>'
    ```

## Troubleshooting

This section lists steps to troubleshoot common problems with user access in Azure Load Testing.

### Unable to create or run a test with `You are not authorized to use this resource`

You encounter this message if your Azure account doesn't have the necessary permissions to manage tests. Make sure to grant the user the [Load Test Owner](#load-test-owner) or [Load Test Contributor](#load-test-contributor) role on the load testing resource.
