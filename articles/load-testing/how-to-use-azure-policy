# Secure your Azure Load Testing resource with Azure Policy

[Azure Policy](../../governance/policy/index.yml) is a governance tool that gives users the ability to audit and manage their Azure environment at scale. Azure Policy provides the ability to place guardrails on Azure resources to ensure they're compliant with assigned policy rules. It allows users to perform audit, real-time enforcement, and remediation of their Azure environment. The results of audits performed by policy will be available to users in a compliance dashboard where they'll be able to see a drill down of which resources and components are compliant and which aren't.  For more information, see the [Overview of the Azure Policy service](../../governance/policy/overview.md).

Example Usage Scenarios:

- You want to ensure that load tests can only be run against private endpoints that are behind a firewall or accessible from within a virtual network and block load tests against publicly accessible endpoints. 
- You want to ensure that the resources needed for a load test run get created only in a set of virtual networks in your subscription. 

## Types of policy effects and guidance

When enforcing a policy, you can determine its effect over the resulting evaluation. Each policy definition allows you to choose one of multiple effects. Therefore, policy enforcement may behave differently depending on the type of operation you're evaluating. In general, the effects for policies that integrate with Key Vault include:

- [**Audit**](../../governance/policy/concepts/effects.md#audit): when the effect of a policy is set to `Audit`, the policy won't cause any breaking changes to your environment. It will only alert you to Azure Load Testing resources that don't comply with the policy definitions within a specified scope, by marking these components as non-compliant in the policy compliance dashboard. Audit is default if no policy effect is selected.

- [**Deny**](../../governance/policy/concepts/effects.md#deny): when the effect of a policy is set to `Deny`, the policy will block the creation of new test runs that don't comply with the policy definition. Existing non-compliant test runs aren't affected. The 'audit' capabilities will continue to operate.
  
## Available Built-In Policy Definitions

Predetermined policies, referred to as 'built-ins', facilitate governance over your load testing resources so you don't have to write custom policies in JSON format to enforce commonly used rules associated with best security practices. Even though built-ins are predetermined, certain policies require you to define parameters. For example, by defining the effect of the policy, you can audit the key vault and its objects before enforcing a deny operation to prevent outages. Current built-ins for Azure Key Vault are categorized in four major groups: key vault, certificates, keys, and secrets management. Within each category, policies are grouped towards driving specific security goals.

## Enabling and managing a load testing policy through the Azure portal

### Select a Policy Definition

1. Log in to the Azure portal.
1. Search "Policy" in the Search Bar and Select **Policy**.

1. In the Policy window, select **Definitions**.

    ![Screenshot that highlights the Definitions option.](../media/policy-img2.png)

1. In the Category Filter, Unselect **Select All** and select **Azure Load Testing**. 

    ![Screenshot that shows the Category Filter and the selected Key Vault category.](../media/policy-img3.png)

1. Now you should be able to see all the policies available for Azure Load Testing. Make sure you have read and understood the policy guidance section above and select a policy you want to assign to a scope.

### Assign a Policy to a Scope 

1. Select a policy you wish to apply, in this example, the **MALT policy for VNet** policy is shown. Click the assign button in the top-left corner.

1. Select the subscription where you want the policy to be applied. You can choose to restrict the scope to only a single resource group within a subscription. If you want to apply the policy to the entire subscription and exclude some resource groups, you can also configure an exclusion list. Set the policy enforcement selector to **Enabled** if you want the effect of the policy (audit or deny) to occur or **Disabled** to turn the effect (audit or deny) off.

1. Click on the parameters tab at the top of the screen in order to specify the maximum validity period in months that you want. If you need to input the parameters, you can uncheck 'Only show parameters that need input or review' option. Select **audit** or **deny** for the effect of the policy following the guidance in the sections above. Then select the review + create button.

### View Compliance Results

1. Go back to the Policy blade and select the compliance tab. Click on the policy assignment you wish to view compliance results for.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Compliance tab where you can select the policy assignment you want to view compliance results for.](../media/policy-img8.png)

1. From this page you can filter results by compliant or non-compliant vaults. Here you can see a list of non-compliant key vaults within the scope of the policy assignment. A vault is considered non-compliant if any of the components (certificates) in the vault are non-compliant. You can select an individual vault to view the individual non-compliant components (certificates).

1. View the name of the components within a vault that are non-compliant

    ![Screenshot that shows where you can view the name of the components within a vault that are non-compliant.](../media/policy-img10.png)

1. If you need to check whether users are being denied the ability to create resources within the key vault, you can click on the **Component Events (preview)** tab to view a summary of denied certificate operations with the requestor and timestamps of requests.

## Feature Limitations

Assigning a policy with a "deny" effect may take up to 30 mins (average case) and 1 hour (worst case) to start denying the creation of non-compliant resources. The delay refers to following scenarios -
1. A new policy is assigned.
2. An existing policy assignment is modified.
3. A new KeyVault (resource) is created in a scope with existing policies.

The policy evaluation of existing components in a vault may take up to 1 hour (average case) and 2 hours (worst case) before compliance results are viewable in the portal UI.

If the compliance results show up as "Not Started" it may be due to the following reasons:

- The policy valuation hasn't completed yet. Initial evaluation latency can take up to 2 hours in the worst-case scenario.
- There are no key vaults in the scope of the policy assignment.
- There are no key vaults with certificates within the scope of the policy assignment.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Policy [Resource Provider modes](../../governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure.md#resource-provider-modes), such as those for Azure Key Vault, provide information about compliance on the [Component Compliance](../../governance/policy/how-to/get-compliance-data.md#component-compliance)
