# Deploy a DHCP server in Azure on a virtual machine

Learn how to deploy a highly available DHCP server in Azure on a virtual machine. This server is used as a target for an on-premises DHCP relay agent to provide dynamic IP address allocation to on-premises clients. Broadcast packets directly from clients to a DHCP Server don't work in an Azure Virtual Network by design.

> [!NOTE]
> The on-premises client to DHCP Server (source port UDP/68, destination port UDP/67) is still not supported in Azure, since this traffic is intercepted and handled differently. This will result in timeout messages at the time of DHCP RENEW at T1 when the client directly attempts to reach the DHCP Server in Azure. The DHCP RENEW will succeed when the DHCP RENEW attempt is made at T2 via DHCP Relay Agent. For more details on the T1 and T2 DHCP RENEW timers, see [RFC 2131](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2131.txt).

## Create internal load balancer

In this section, you create an internal load balancer that load balances virtual machines. An internal load balancer is used to load balance traffic inside a virtual network with a private IP address.

During the creation of the load balancer, you configure:

* Frontend IP address
* Backend pool
* Inbound load-balancing rules

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Load balancer**. Select **Load balancers** in the search results.

1. In the **Load balancer** page, select **Create**.

1. In the **Basics** tab of the **Create load balancer** page, enter, or select the following information: 

    | Setting                 | Value                                              |
    | ---                     | ---                                                |

    | **Subnet mask** | Enter **255.255.255.0**. |

1. Select **OK**.

1. Select **Close**.

### Enable routing between the loopback interface and the network adapter

Use the following steps to enable routing between the loopback interface and the network adapter:

1. Open **CMD** as an administrator.

1. Run the following command to list the network interfaces:

    ```cmd
    netsh int ipv4 show int
    ```

    ```output
    C:\Users\azureuser>netsh int ipv4 show int

    Idx     Met         MTU          State                Name
    ---  ----------  ----------  ------------  ---------------------------
      1          75  4294967295  connected     Loopback Pseudo-Interface 1
      6           5        1500  connected     Ethernet
     11          25        1500  connected     Ethernet 3
    ```

    In this example, the network interface connected to the Azure Virtual network is **Ethernet**. The loopback interface that you installed in the previous section is **Ethernet 3**.

    **Make note of the `Idx` number for the primary network adapter and the loopback adapter. In this example the primary network adapter is `6` and the loopback adapter is `11`. You'll need these values for the next steps.**

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Don't confuse the **Loopback Loopback Pseudo-Interface 1** with the **Microsoft Loopback Adapter**. The **Loopback Pseudo-Interface 1** isn't used in this scenario.

1. Run the following command to enable **weakhostreceive** and **weakhostsend** on the primary network adapter:

    ```cmd
    netsh int ipv4 set int 6 weakhostreceive=enabled weakhostsend=enabled
    ```

1. Run the following command to enable **weakhostreceive** and **weakhostsend** on the loopback adapter:

    ```cmd    
    netsh int ipv4 set int 11 weakhostreceive=enabled weakhostsend=enabled
    ```

1. Close the bastion connection to **vm-1**.

1. Repeat the previous steps to configure **vm-2**. Replace the IP address of **10.0.0.100** with **10.0.0.200** in the static IP address configuration of the loopback adapter.

## Next step

In this article, you learned how to deploy a highly available DHCP server in Azure on a virtual machine. You also learned how to configure the network adapters and installed the DHCP role on the virtual machines. Further configuration of the DHCP server is required to provide DHCP services to on-premises clients from the Azure Virtual Machines. The DHCP relay agent on the on-premises network must be configured to forward DHCP requests to the DHCP servers in Azure. Consult the manufacturer's documentation for the DHCP relay agent for configuration steps.
