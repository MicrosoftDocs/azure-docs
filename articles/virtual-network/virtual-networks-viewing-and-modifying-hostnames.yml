  View and modify hostnames
introduction: |
  The hostname identifies your virtual machine (VM) in the user interface and
  Azure operations. You first assign the hostname of a VM in the **Virtual
  machine name** field during the creation process in the Azure portal. After
  you create a VM, you can view and modify the hostname either through a remote
  connection or in the Azure portal.

  ### View hostnames
  
  You can view the hostname of your VM in a cloud service by using any of the following tools.

  ### Azure portal

  In the Azure portal, go to your VM, and on the service menu, select **Properties**. On the **Properties** page, you can view the hostname under
  **Computer Name**.

  ### Remote desktop

  You can connect to your VM by using a remote desktop tool like Remote Desktop (Windows), Windows PowerShell remoting (Windows), SSH (Linux and Windows) or Bastion (Azure portal). You can then view the hostname in a few ways:

  * Enter **hostname** in PowerShell, the command prompt, or an SSH terminal.
  * Enter `ipconfig /all` in the command prompt (Windows only).
  * View the computer name in the system settings (Windows only).

      Azure API
    summary: |  
      From a REST client, follow these instructions:
    steps:
      - |
        Ensure that you have an authenticated connection to the Azure portal.
        Follow the steps presented in
        [Create a Microsoft Entra application and service principal that can access resources](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

      - |
        Send a request in the following format:

        ```http
        GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vmName}?api-version=2022-11-01`. 
        ```

        For more information on GET requests for VMs, see
        [Virtual machines - GET](/rest/api/compute/virtual-machines/get).
      - |
        Look for the `osProfile` and then the `computerName` element to find the hostname.

        > [!WARNING]
        > You can also view the internal domain suffix for your cloud service by
        > running `ipconfig /all` from a command prompt in a remote desktop
        > session (Windows) or by running `cat /etc/resolv.conf` from an SSH
        > terminal (Linux).

      Modify a hostname
    summary: |  
      You can modify the hostname for any VM by renaming the computer from a
      remote desktop session or by using **Run command** in the Azure portal.
    steps:
      - |
        Change the hostname.
        * From a remote session:
          * For Windows, you can change the hostname from PowerShell by using the
            [Rename-Computer](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/rename-computer)
            command.
          * For Linux, you can change the hostname by using `hostnamectl`.

        * From the Azure portal:
          You can also run these commands to find the hostname for your VM
          from the Azure portal by using **Run command**. In the Azure portal,
          go to your VM, and on the service menu, select **Run command**.
          On the **Run command** page in the Azure portal:

          * For Windows, select **RunPowerShellScript** and use `Rename-Computer`
            in the **Run Command Script** pane.
          * For Linux, select **RunShellScript** and use `hostnamectl` in the
            **Run Command Script** pane.

          The following image shows the **Run command** page in the Azure portal for a Windows VM.

        After you run either `Rename-Computer` or `hostnamectl` on your VM, you
        need to restart your VM for the hostname to change.

        ### Azure classic deployment model

        The Azure classic deployment model uses a configuration file that you
        can download and upload to change the hostname. To allow your hostname
        to reference your role instances, you must set the value for the host
        name in the service configuration file for each role. You do that by
        adding the hostname that you want to the `vmName` attribute of the `Role`
        element. The value of the `vmName` attribute is used as a base for the
        hostname of each role instance.

        For example, if `vmName` is `webrole` and there are three instances of
        that role, the hostnames of the instances are `webrole0`, `webrole1`,
        and `webrole2`. You don't need to specify a hostname for VMs in the configuration file because the hostname for a VM is
        populated based on the VM name. For more information about
        configuring an Azure service, see
        [Azure service configuration schema (.cscfg File)](/previous-versions/azure/reference/ee758710(v=azure.100)).

        ### Service configuration file

        In the Azure classic deployment model, you can download the service
        configuration file for a deployed service from the **Configure** pane of
        the service in the Azure portal. You can then look for the `vmName`
        attribute for the `Role name` element to see the hostname. This hostname is used as a base for the hostname of each
        role instance. For example, if `vmName` is `webrole` and there are
        three instances of that role, the hostnames of the instances are
        `webrole0`, `webrole1`,
        and `webrole2`. For more information, see
        [Azure Virtual Network configuration schema](/previous-versions/azure/reference/jj157100(v=azure.100)).
