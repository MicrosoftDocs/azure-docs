# Name resolution for resources in Azure virtual networks

You can use Azure to host infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and hybrid solutions. To facilitate communication between the virtual machines (VMs) and other resources deployed in a virtual network, it might be necessary to allow them to communicate with each other. The use of easily remembered and unchanging names simplifies the communication process, rather than relying on IP addresses.

When resources deployed in virtual networks need to resolve domain names to internal IP addresses, they can use one of four methods:

* [Azure Private DNS zones](../dns/private-dns-overview.md)
* [Azure-provided name resolution](#azure-provided-name-resolution)
* [Name resolution that uses your own Domain Name System (DNS) server](#name-resolution-that-uses-your-own-dns-server) (which might forward queries to the Azure-provided DNS servers)
* [Azure DNS Private Resolver](../dns/dns-private-resolver-overview.md)

The type of name resolution you use depends on how your resources need to communicate with each other. The following table illustrates scenarios and corresponding name resolution solutions.

Azure Private DNS zones are the preferred solution and give you flexibility in managing your DNS zones and records. For more information, see [Use Azure DNS for private domains](../dns/private-dns-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Azure-provided DNS, the appropriate DNS suffix is automatically applied to your VMs.
> For all other options, you must either use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) or manually apply the appropriate DNS suffix to your VMs.

## Azure-provided name resolution

Azure-provided name resolution provides only basic authoritative DNS capabilities. Azure manages the DNS zone names and records if you use the DNS provided by Azure. You aren't able to control the DNS zone names or the life cycle of DNS records. If you need a fully featured DNS solution for your virtual networks, you can use [Azure Private DNS zones](../dns/private-dns-overview.md) with [Customer-managed DNS servers](#name-resolution-that-uses-your-own-dns-server) or [Azure DNS Private Resolver](../dns/dns-private-resolver-overview.md).

Along with resolution of public DNS names, Azure provides internal name resolution for VMs and role instances that reside within the same virtual network or cloud service. VMs and instances in a cloud service share the same DNS suffix, so the hostname alone is sufficient. But in virtual networks deployed by using the classic deployment model, different cloud services have different DNS suffixes. In this situation, you need the FQDN to resolve names between different cloud services.

 In virtual networks deployed by using the Azure Resource Manager deployment model, the DNS suffix is consistent across all the VMs within a virtual network, so the FQDN isn't needed. You can assign DNS names to both VMs and network interfaces. Although Azure-provided name resolution doesn't require any configuration, it isn't the appropriate choice for all deployment scenarios, as described in the previous table.

> [!NOTE]
> When you use Azure Cloud Services web and worker roles, you can also access the internal IP addresses of role instances by using the Azure Service Management REST API. For more information, see the [Service Management REST API reference](/previous-versions/azure/ee460799(v=azure.100)). The address is based on the role name and instance number.

### Features

Azure-provided name resolution includes the following features:

* You don't need to configure anything.
* You don't need to create and manage clusters of your own DNS servers because of high availability.
* You can use the service with your own DNS servers to resolve both on-premises and Azure hostnames.
* You can use name resolution between VMs and role instances within the same cloud service, without the need for an FQDN.
* You can use name resolution between VMs in virtual networks that use the Resource Manager deployment model, without need for an FQDN. Virtual networks in the classic deployment model require an FQDN when you resolve names in different cloud services.
* You can use hostnames that best describe your deployments, rather than working with autogenerated names.

### Considerations

When you use Azure-provided name resolution, consider the following points:

* The Azure-created DNS suffix can't be modified.
* DNS lookup is scoped to a virtual network. DNS names created for one virtual network can't be resolved from other virtual networks.
* Manual registration of your own records isn't allowed.
* WINS and NetBIOS aren't supported. You can't see your VMs in Windows Explorer.
* Host names must be DNS compatible. Names must use only 0 to 9, a to z, and a hyphen (-). Names can't start or end with a hyphen.
* DNS query traffic is throttled for each VM. Throttling shouldn't affect most applications. If you observe request throttling, ensure that client-side caching is enabled. For more information, see [DNS client configuration](#dns-client-configuration).
* A different name must be used for each VM in a virtual network to avoid DNS resolution issues.
* Only VMs in the first 180 cloud services are registered for each virtual network in a classic deployment model. This limit doesn't apply to virtual networks in Resource Manager.
* The Azure DNS IP address is 168.63.129.16. This address is a static IP address and doesn't change.

### Reverse DNS considerations

Reverse DNS for VMs is supported in all virtual networks based on Resource Manager. Azure-managed reverse DNS, also known as pointer (PTR), records of form `\[vmname\].internal.cloudapp.net` are automatically added to DNS when you start a VM. They're removed when the VM is stopped (deallocated). See the following example:

```cmd
C:\>nslookup -type=ptr 10.11.0.4
Server:  UnKnown
Address:  168.63.129.16

Non-authoritative answer:
4.0.11.10.in-addr.arpa  name = myeastspokevm1.internal.cloudapp.net
```

The `internal.cloudapp.net` reverse DNS zone is Azure managed and can't be directly viewed or edited. Forward lookup on the FQDN of form `\[vmname\].internal.cloudapp.net` resolves to the IP address assigned to the VM.

If an [Azure Private DNS zone](../dns/private-dns-overview.md) is linked to the virtual network with a [virtual network link](../dns/private-dns-virtual-network-links.md) and [autoregistration](../dns/private-dns-autoregistration.md) is enabled on that link, then reverse DNS queries return two records. One record is of the form `\[vmname\].[privatednszonename]` and the other is of the form `\[vmname\].internal.cloudapp.net`. See the following example:

```cmd
C:\>nslookup -type=ptr 10.20.2.4
Server:  UnKnown
Address:  168.63.129.16

Non-authoritative answer:
4.2.20.10.in-addr.arpa  name = mywestvm1.internal.cloudapp.net
4.2.20.10.in-addr.arpa  name = mywestvm1.azure.contoso.com
```

When two PTR records are returned as shown previously, forward lookup of either FQDN returns the IP address of the VM.

Reverse DNS lookups are scoped to a specific virtual network, even if it's peered to other virtual networks. Reverse DNS queries for IP addresses of VMs located in peered virtual networks return `NXDOMAIN`.

Reverse DNS (PTR) records aren't stored in a forward private DNS zone. Reverse DNS records are stored in a reverse DNS (`in-addr.arpa`) zone. The default reverse DNS zone associated with a virtual network isn't viewable or editable.

You can disable the reverse DNS function in a virtual network. Create your own reverse lookup zone by using [Azure Private DNS zones](../dns/private-dns-overview.md). Then link this zone to your virtual network. For example, if the IP address space of your virtual network is 10.20.0.0/16, you can create an empty private DNS zone `20.10.in-addr.arpa` and link it to the virtual network. This zone overrides the default reverse lookup zones for the virtual network. This zone is empty. Reverse DNS returns `NXDOMAIN` unless you manually create these entries.

Autoregistration of PTR records isn't supported. If you want to create entries, enter them manually. You must disable autoregistration in the virtual network if it's enabled for other zones. This limitation is because of [restrictions](../dns/private-dns-autoregistration.md#restrictions) that permit only one private zone to be linked if autoregistration is enabled. For information on how to create a private DNS zone and link it to a virtual network, see the [Azure Private DNS quickstart](../dns/private-dns-getstarted-portal.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Because Azure DNS private zones are global, you can create a reverse DNS lookup to span across multiple virtual networks. You need to create an [Azure Private DNS zone](../dns/private-dns-overview.md) for reverse lookups (an `in-addr.arpa` zone), and then link it to the virtual networks. You have to manually manage the reverse DNS records for the VMs.

## DNS client configuration

This section covers client-side caching and client-side retries.

### Client-side caching

Not every DNS query needs to be sent across the network. Client-side caching helps reduce latency and improve resilience to network blips by resolving recurring DNS queries from a local cache. DNS records contain a time-to-live mechanism, which allows the cache to store the record for as long as possible without affecting record freshness. Client-side caching is suitable for most situations.

The default Windows DNS client has a DNS cache built in. Some Linux distributions don't include caching by default. If you find that there isn't a local cache already, add a DNS cache to each Linux VM.

Many different DNS caching packages are available (such as `dnsmasq`). Here's how to install `dnsmasq` on the most common distributions:

# [RHEL](#tab/redhat)

#### RHEL (uses NetworkManager)

1. Install the `dnsmasq` package with the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install dnsmasq
    ```

1. Enable the `dnsmasq` service with the following command:

    ```bash
    systemctl enable dnsmasq.service
    ```

1. Start the `dnsmasq` service with the following command:

    ```bash
    systemctl start dnsmasq.service
    ```

1. Use a text editor to add `prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;` to `/etc/dhclient-eth0.conf`:

1. Use the following command to restart the network service:

    ```bash
    service network restart
    ```

# [openSUSE, SLES](#tab/suse)

#### openSUSE/SLES (uses netconf)

1. Install the `dnsmasq` package with the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo zypper install dnsmasq
    ```

1. Enable the `dnsmasq` service with the following command:

    ```bash
    systemctl enable dnsmasq.service
    ```

1. Start the `dnsmasq` service with the following command:

    ```bash
    systemctl start dnsmasq.service
    ```

1. Use a text editor to edit `/etc/sysconfig/network/config`. Change ``NETCONFIG_DNS_FORWARDER=""`` to `dnsmasq`.

1. Use the following command to update `resolv.conf` to set the cache as the local DNS resolver:

    ```bash
    netconfig update
    ```

# [Ubuntu, Debian](#tab/ubuntu)

#### Ubuntu/Debian (uses resolvconf)

Use the following command to install the `dnsmasq` package:

```bash
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq
```

---

> [!NOTE]
> The `dnsmasq` package is only one of many DNS caches available for Linux. Before you use it, check its suitability for your particular needs and check that no other cache is installed.

### Client-side retries

DNS is primarily a User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Because the UDP protocol doesn't guarantee message delivery, retry logic is handled in the DNS protocol itself. Each DNS client (operating system) can exhibit different retry logic, depending on the creator's preference:

* Windows operating systems retry after one second, and then again after another two seconds, four seconds, and another four seconds.
* The default Linux setup retries after five seconds. We recommend that you change the retry specifications to five times, at one-second intervals.

Check the current settings on a Linux VM with `cat /etc/resolv.conf`. Look at the `options` line, for example:

```output
options timeout:1 attempts:5
```

The `resolv.conf` file is autogenerated and shouldn't be edited. The specific steps for adding the `options` line vary by distribution.

# [RHEL](#tab/redhat)

#### RHEL (uses NetworkManager)

1. Use a text editor to add the line `RES_OPTIONS="options timeout:1 attempts:5"` to the file `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0`.

1. Use the following command to restart the `NetworkManager` service:

    ```bash
    systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
    ```

# [openSUSE, SLES](#tab/suse)

#### openSUSE/SLES (uses netconf)

1. Use a text editor to add `**timeout:1 attempts:5**` to the `NETCONFIG_DNS_RESOLVER_OPTIONS=""` parameter in `/etc/sysconfig/network/config`.

1. Use the following command to update `netconfig`:

    ```bash
    netconfig update
    ```

# [Ubuntu, Debian](#tab/ubuntu)

#### Ubuntu/Debian (uses resolvconf)

1. Use a text editor to add the `options` line to `/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail`.

1. Use the following command to update `resolvconf`:

    ```bash
    resolvconf -u
    ```

## Name resolution that uses your own DNS server

This section covers VMs, role instances, and web apps.

> [!NOTE]
> [Azure DNS Private Resolver](../dns/dns-private-resolver-overview.md) replaces the need to use VM-based DNS servers in a virtual network. The following section is provided if you want to use a VM-based DNS solution. The many benefits of using Azure DNS Private Resolver include cost reduction, built-in high availability, scalability, and flexibility.

### VMs and role instances

Your name resolution needs might go beyond the features provided by Azure. For example, you might need to use Windows Server Active Directory domains to resolve DNS names between virtual networks. To cover these scenarios, you can use your own DNS servers.

DNS servers within a virtual network can forward DNS queries to the recursive resolvers in Azure. By using this procedure, you can resolve hostnames within that virtual network. For example, a domain controller (DC) running in Azure can respond to DNS queries for its domains and forward all other queries to Azure. Forwarding queries allows VMs to see both your on-premises resources (via the DC) and Azure-provided hostnames (via the forwarder). Access to the recursive resolvers in Azure is provided via the virtual IP 168.63.129.16.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If Azure VPN Gateway is used in this setup along with custom DNS server IPs on a virtual network, Azure DNS IP (168.63.129.16) must be added in the list to maintain undisrupted service.

DNS forwarding also enables DNS resolution between virtual networks and allows your on-premises machines to resolve Azure-provided hostnames. To resolve a VM's hostname, the DNS server VM must reside in the same virtual network and be configured to forward hostname queries to Azure. Because the DNS suffix is different in each virtual network, you can use conditional forwarding rules to send DNS queries to the correct virtual network for resolution.

Two virtual networks and an on-premises network use this method to do DNS resolution between virtual networks, as shown in the following diagram. An example DNS forwarder is available in the [Azure Quickstart Templates gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/dns-forwarder) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/demos/dns-forwarder).

> [!NOTE]
> A role instance can perform name resolution of VMs within the same virtual network. It uses the FQDN, which consists of the VM's hostname and the `internal.cloudapp.net` DNS suffix. In this case, name resolution is successful only if the role instance has the VM name defined in the [Role Schema (.cscfg file)](/previous-versions/azure/reference/jj156212(v=azure.100)): `<Role name="<role-name>" vmName="<vm-name>">`.
>
> Role instances that need to perform name resolution of VMs in another virtual network (FQDN by using the `internal.cloudapp.net` suffix) have to use the method described in this section (custom DNS servers forwarding between the two virtual networks).

![Diagram that shows the DNS between virtual networks](./media/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances/inter-vnet-dns.png).

When you use Azure-provided name resolution, the Azure Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides an internal DNS suffix (`.internal.cloudapp.net`) to each VM. This suffix enables hostname resolution because the hostname records are in the `internal.cloudapp.net` zone. When you use your own name resolution solution, this suffix isn't supplied to VMs because it interferes with other DNS architectures (like domain-joined scenarios). Instead, Azure provides a nonfunctioning placeholder (*reddog.microsoft.com*).

If necessary, you can determine the internal DNS suffix by using PowerShell or the API.

For virtual networks in Resource Manager deployment models, the suffix is available via the [network interface REST API](/rest/api/virtualnetwork/networkinterfaces), the [Get-AzNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.network/get-aznetworkinterface) PowerShell cmdlet, and the [az network nic show](/cli/azure/network/nic#az-network-nic-show) Azure CLI command.

If forwarding queries to Azure doesn't suit your needs, provide your own DNS solution or deploy [Azure DNS Private Resolver](../dns/dns-private-resolver-overview.md).

If you provide your own DNS solution, it needs to:

* Provide appropriate hostname resolution, via [dynamic DNS (DDNS)](virtual-networks-name-resolution-ddns.md), for example. If you use DDNS, you might need to disable DNS record scavenging. The Azure DHCP leases are long, and scavenging might remove DNS records prematurely.
* Provide appropriate recursive resolution to allow resolution of external domain names.
* Be accessible (TCP and UDP on port 53) from the clients it serves, and be able to access the internet.
* Be secured against access from the internet to mitigate threats posed by external agents.

For best performance, when you use Azure VMs as DNS servers, IPv6 should be disabled.

Network security groups (NSGs) act as firewalls for your DNS resolver endpoints. Modify or override your NSG security rules to allow access for UDP Port 53 (and optionally, TCP Port 53) to your DNS listener endpoints. After custom DNS servers are set on a network, the traffic through port 53 bypasses the NSGs of the subnet and the NIC.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use Windows DNS servers as custom DNS servers forwarding DNS requests to Azure DNS servers, make sure you increase the Forwarding Timeout value more than four seconds to allow Azure recursive DNS servers to perform proper recursion operations.
>
> For more information about this issue, see [Forwarders and conditional forwarders resolution timeouts](/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/forwarders-resolution-timeouts).
>
> This recommendation might also apply to other DNS server platforms with forwarding timeout values of three seconds or less.
>
> Failing to do so might result in Private DNS zone records being resolved with public IP addresses.

### Web apps

Suppose you need to perform name resolution from your web app built by using App Service, linked to a virtual network, to VMs in the same virtual network. In addition to setting up a custom DNS server that has a DNS forwarder that forwards queries to Azure (virtual IP 168.63.129.16), perform the following steps:

- If you haven't already, enable virtual network integration for your web app, as described in [Integrate your app with a virtual network](../app-service/overview-vnet-integration.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).
- If you need to perform name resolution from your virtual network-linked web app (built by using App Service) to VMs in a different virtual network that's *not linked* to the same private zone, use custom DNS servers or [Azure DNS Private Resolvers](../dns/dns-private-resolver-overview.md) on both virtual networks.

To use custom DNS servers:

* Set up a DNS server in your target virtual network on a VM that can also forward queries to the recursive resolver in Azure (virtual IP 168.63.129.16). An example DNS forwarder is available in the [Azure Quickstart Templates gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/dns-forwarder/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/demos/dns-forwarder).
* Set up a DNS forwarder in the source virtual network on a VM. Configure this DNS forwarder to forward queries to the DNS server in your target virtual network.
* Configure your source DNS server in your source virtual network's settings.
* Enable virtual network integration for your web app to link to the source virtual network by following the instructions in [Integrate your app with a virtual network](../app-service/overview-vnet-integration.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).

To use Azure DNS Private Resolver, see [Ruleset links](../dns/private-resolver-endpoints-rulesets.md#ruleset-links).

## Specify DNS servers

When you use your own DNS servers, you can specify multiple DNS servers per virtual network. You can also specify multiple DNS servers per network interface (for Resource Manager) or per cloud service (for the classic deployment model). DNS servers specified for a network interface or cloud service get precedence over DNS servers specified for the virtual network.

> [!NOTE]
> Network connection properties, such as DNS server IPs, shouldn't be edited directly within VMs. They might get erased during service heal when the virtual network adaptor gets replaced. This caution applies to both Windows and Linux VMs.

When you use the Resource Manager deployment model, you can specify DNS servers for a virtual network and a network interface. For more information, see [Manage a virtual network](manage-virtual-network.yml) and [Manage a network interface](virtual-network-network-interface.md).

If you opt for custom DNS server for your virtual network, you must specify at least one DNS server IP address. Otherwise, the virtual network ignores the configuration and uses Azure-provided DNS instead.

> [!NOTE]
> If you change the DNS settings for a virtual network or VM that's already deployed, for the new DNS settings to take effect, you must perform a DHCP lease renewal on all affected VMs in the virtual network. For VMs that run the Windows OS, enter `ipconfig /renew` directly in the VM. The steps vary depending on the OS. See the relevant documentation for your OS type.
