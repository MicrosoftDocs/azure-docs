  Update the address space for a peered virtual network using the Azure portal
introduction: |
  In this article, you learn how to update a peered virtual network by modifying, adding, or deleting an address space using the Azure portal. These updates don't incur downtime interruptions. This feature is useful when you need to grow or resize the virtual networks in Azure after scaling your workloads.
prerequisites:
  summary: |
    There are two items:
  dependencies:
    - An existing peered virtual network with two virtual networks
    - If you add an address space, ensure that it doesn't overlap other address spaces

      Modify the address range prefix of an existing address range
    summary: 
      In this section, you modify the address range prefix for an existing address range within your peered virtual network.
    steps: 
      - |
        In the search box at the top of the Azure portal, enter *virtual networks*. Select **Virtual networks** from the search results.
      - |
        From the list of virtual networks, select the virtual network to modify.
      - |
        Under **Settings**, select **Address space**.
      - |
        On the **Address space** page, change the address range prefix per your requirements, and select **Save**.

      - |
        Under **Settings**, select **Peerings** and select the checkbox for the peering that you want to sync.
      - |
        Select **Sync** from the taskbar.

      - |
        Select the name of the other peered virtual network under **Peer**.
      - |
        Under **Settings** for the peered virtual network, select **Address space** and verify that the address space listed has been updated.

        > [!NOTE]
        > When you update the address space for a virtual network, you need to sync the virtual network peer for each remote peered virtual network. We recommend that you run sync after every resize address space operation instead of performing multiple resizing operations and then running the sync operation.
        >
        > The following actions require you to sync:
        >
        > - Modifying the address range prefix of an existing address range, for example changing 10.1.0.0/16 to 10.1.0.0/18
        > - Adding address ranges to a virtual network
        > - Deleting address ranges from a virtual network

      Add an address range
    summary: |
      In this section, you add an IP address range to the IP address space of a peered virtual network.
    steps: 
      - |
        In the search box at the top of the Azure portal, enter *virtual networks*. Select **Virtual networks** from the search results.
      - |
        From the list of virtual networks, select the virtual network where you're adding an address range.
      - |
        Under **Settings**, select **Address space**.
      - |
        On the **Address space** page, add the address range per your requirements, and select **Save** when finished.

      - |
        Under **Settings**, select **Peering**, and sync the peering connection.
      - |
        Under **Settings** for the peered virtual network, select **Address space** and verify that the address space listed has been updated.
  - title: |
      Delete an address range
    summary: |
      In this task, you delete an IP address range from an address space. First, delete any existing subnets, and then delete the IP address range.
    
      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Before you can delete an address space, it must be empty. If a subnet exists in the address range, you can't remove the address range. To remove an address range, you must first delete any subnets and any of the subnet's resources which exist in the address range.
    steps: 
      - |  
        In the search box at the top of the Azure portal, enter *virtual networks*. Select **Virtual networks** from the search results.
      - |
        From the list of virtual networks, select the virtual network from which to remove the address range.
      - |
        Under **Settings**, select **Subnets**.
      - |
        To the right of the address range you want to remove, select **...** and select **Delete** from the dropdown list. Choose **Yes** to confirm deletion.

      - |
        Select **Save** after you complete your changes.
      - |
        Under **Settings**, select **Peering** and sync the peering connection.
      - |
        Under **Settings** for the peered virtual network, select **Address space** and verify that the address space listed has been updated.
