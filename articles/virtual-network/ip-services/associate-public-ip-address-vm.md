# Associate a public IP address to a virtual machine

In this article, you learn how to associate a public IP address to an existing virtual machine (VM). To do so, you associate the public IP address to an IP configuration of a network interface attached to a VM. You can use the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell by selecting the tab for the method you want to use.

 If you want to instead create a new VM with a public IP address, you can use the [Azure portal](virtual-network-deploy-static-pip-arm-portal.md), the [Azure CLI](virtual-network-deploy-static-pip-arm-cli.md), or [Azure PowerShell](virtual-network-deploy-static-pip-arm-ps.md).

Public IP addresses have a nominal fee. For details, see [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ip-addresses/). There's a limit to the number of public IP addresses that you can use per subscription. For details, see [limits](../../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#publicip-address).

[!INCLUDE [ephemeral-ip-note.md](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/ephemeral-ip-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. You can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the portal, search for and select the VM that you want to add the public IP address to.

1. Under **Settings** in the left pane, select **Networking**, and then select the network interface you want to add the public IP address to.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Public IP addresses are associated to the network interfaces that are attached to a VM. In this screenshot, the VM has only one network interface. If the VM had multiple network interfaces, they would all appear, and you'd select the network interface you want to associate the public IP address to.

1. From the **Network interface** window, under **Settings**, select **IP configurations***, and then select an IP configuration from the list.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/associate-public-ip-address-vm/select-ip-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to select the I P configuration of a network interface.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > Public IP addresses are associated to the IP configurations for a network interface. In this screenshot, the network interface has only one IP configuration. If the network interface had multiple IP configurations, they would all appear in the list, and you'd select the IP configuration that you want to associate the public IP address to.

1. In the **Edit IP configuration** window, select **Associate public IP address**, then select **Public IP address** to choose an existing public IP address from the drop-down list. If no public IP addresses are listed, you need to create one. To learn how, see [Create a public IP address](virtual-network-public-ip-address.md#create-a-public-ip-address).

    :::image type="content" source="./media/associate-public-ip-address-vm/choose-public-ip-address.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to select, create, and associate a new public IP address.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > The public IP addresses that appear in the drop-down list are those that exist in the same region as the VM. If you have multiple public IP addresses created in the region, all will appear here. Any address that's already associated to a different resource is grayed out.

1. Select **Save**.

1. In the **IP Configurations** window, view the public IP address assigned to the IP configuration. It might take a few seconds for a newly associated IP address to appear.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/associate-public-ip-address-vm/view-assigned-public-ip-address.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the newly assigned public I P.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > An IP address is assigned from the pool of public IP addresses reserved for an Azure region. For a list of the address pools used in each region, see [Azure IP ranges and service tags](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519). If you need the address to be assigned from a specific prefix, use a [Public IP address prefix](public-ip-address-prefix.md).

1. Open the necessary ports in your security groups by adjusting the security rules in the network security groups. For information, see [Allow network traffic to the VM](#allow-network-traffic-to-the-vm).

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Install the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) on your machine, or use Azure Cloud Shell. Cloud Shell is a free Bash shell that you can run directly within the Azure portal. It includes the Azure CLI preinstalled and configured to use with your Azure account. Select the **Open Cloudshell** button in the Azure CLI code examples that follow. When you select **Open Cloudshell**, Cloud Shell loads in your browser and prompts you to sign into your Azure account.

1. If you're using the Azure CLI locally in Bash, sign in to Azure with `az login`.

1. Use the [az network nic ip-config update](/cli/azure/network/nic/ip-config#az-network-nic-ip-config-update) command to associate a public IP address to an IP configuration. The following example associates an existing public IP address named *myPublicIP* to an IP configuration named *ipconfig1*. This IP configuration belongs to an existing network interface named *myVMNic* in a resource group named *myResourceGroup*.
  
   ```azurecli-interactive
   az network nic ip-config update \
     --name ipconfig1 \
     --nic-name myVMNic \
     --resource-group myResourceGroup \
     --public-ip-address myPublicIP
   ```

1. If you don't have an existing public IP address, use the [az network public-ip create](/cli/azure/network/public-ip#az-network-public-ip-create) command to create one. For example, the following command creates a public IP address named *myPublicIP* in a resource group named *myResourceGroup*.
  
     ```azurecli-interactive
     az network public-ip create --name myPublicIP --resource-group myResourceGroup
     ```

     > [!NOTE]
     > This command creates a public IP address with default values for several settings that you may want to customize. For more information about public IP address settings, see [Create a public IP address](virtual-network-public-ip-address.md#create-a-public-ip-address). An IP address is assigned from the pool of public IP addresses reserved for an Azure region. For a list of the address pools used in each region, see [Azure IP ranges and service tags](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519). If you need the address to be assigned from a specific prefix, use a [Public IP address prefix](public-ip-address-prefix.md).

1. If you don't know the names of the network interfaces attached to your VM, use the [az vm nic list](/cli/azure/vm/nic#az-vm-nic-list) command to view them. For example, the following command lists the network interfaces attached to a VM named *myVM* in a resource group named *myResourceGroup*:

     ```azurecli-interactive
     az vm nic list --vm-name myVM --resource-group myResourceGroup
     ```

     The output includes one or more lines that are similar to the following example, where *myVMNic* is the name of the network interface:
  
     ```output
     "id": "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/myVMNic",
     ```

1. If you don't know the names of the IP configurations for a network interface, use the [az network nic ip-config list](/cli/azure/network/nic/ip-config#az-network-nic-ip-config-list) command to retrieve them. For example, the following command lists the names of the IP configurations for a network interface named *myVMNic* in a resource group named *myResourceGroup*:

     ```azurecli-interactive
     az network nic ip-config list --nic-name myVMNic --resource-group myResourceGroup --out table
     ```

1. View the public IP address assigned to the IP configuration with the [az vm list-ip-addresses](/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-list-ip-addresses) command. The following example shows the IP addresses assigned to an existing VM named *myVM* in a resource group named *myResourceGroup*.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az vm list-ip-addresses --name myVM --resource-group myResourceGroup --out table
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > An IP address is assigned from the pool of public IP addresses reserved for an Azure region. For a list of the address pools used in each region, see [Azure IP ranges and service tags](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519). If you need the address to be assigned from a specific prefix, use a [Public IP address prefix](public-ip-address-prefix.md).

1. Open the necessary ports in your network security groups by adjusting the inbound security rules. For information, see [Allow network traffic to the VM](#allow-network-traffic-to-the-vm).

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Install [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) on your machine, or use Cloud Shell. Cloud Shell is a free Bash shell that you can run directly within the Azure portal. It includes Azure PowerShell preinstalled and configured to use with your Azure account. Select the **Open Cloudshell** button in the Azure PowerShell code examples that follow. When you select **Open Cloudshell**, Cloud Shell loads in your browser and prompts you to sign into your Azure account.

1. If you're using Azure PowerShell locally, sign in to Azure with `Connect-AzAccount`.

1. Use the [Get-AzVirtualNetwork](/powershell/module/Az.Network/Get-AzVirtualNetwork) command to retrieve the virtual networks in a resource group. Then, use the [Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig](/powershell/module/Az.Network/Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig) command to retrieve the subnet configurations in a virtual network.

1. Use the [Get-AzNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/Az.Network/Get-AzNetworkInterface) command to retrieve the network interfaces in a resource group. Then, use the [Get-AzPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/az.network/get-azpublicipaddress) command to retrieve the existing public IP addresses in a resource group.

1. Use the [Set-AzNetworkInterfaceIpConfig](/powershell/module/Az.Network/Set-AzNetworkInterfaceIpConfig) command to associate the public IP address to the IP configuration. Then, use the [Set-AzNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/Az.Network/Set-AzNetworkInterface) command to write the new IP configuration to the network interface.

   The following example associates an existing public IP address named *myPublicIP* to an IP configuration named *ipconfig1*. This IP configuration belongs to an existing network interface named *myVMNic* that exists in a subnet named *mySubnet* in a virtual network named *myVNet*. All resources are in a resource group named *myResourceGroup*.
  
   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name myVNet -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
   $subnet = Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name mySubnet -VirtualNetwork $vnet
   $nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface -Name myVMNic -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
   $pip = Get-AzPublicIpAddress -Name myPublicIP -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
   $nic | Set-AzNetworkInterfaceIpConfig -Name ipconfig1 -PublicIPAddress $pip -Subnet $subnet
   $nic | Set-AzNetworkInterface
   ```

1. If you don't have an existing public IP address, use the [New-AzPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/Az.Network/New-AzPublicIpAddress) command to create one. For example, the following command creates a dynamic public IP address named *myPublicIP* in a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* region.
  
     ```azurepowershell-interactive
     New-AzPublicIpAddress -Name myPublicIP -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -AllocationMethod Dynamic -Location eastus
     ```

     > [!NOTE]
     > This command creates a public IP address with default values for several settings that you may want to customize. For more information about public IP address settings, see [Create a public IP address](virtual-network-public-ip-address.md#create-a-public-ip-address). An IP address is assigned from the pool of public IP addresses reserved for an Azure region. For a list of the address pools used in each region, see [Azure IP ranges and service tags](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519). If you need the address to be assigned from a specific prefix, use a [Public IP address prefix](public-ip-address-prefix.md).

1. If you want to know the names and properties of the network interfaces attached to your VM, use the [Get-AzVM](/powershell/module/Az.Compute/Get-AzVM) command to view them. For example, the following command lists the network interfaces attached to a VM named *myVM* in a resource group named *myResourceGroup*:

     ```azurepowershell-interactive
     $vm = Get-AzVM -name myVM -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
     $vm.NetworkProfile
     ```

     The output includes one or more lines that are similar to the example that follows. In the example output, *myVMNic* is the name of the network interface.
  
     ```output
     "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/myVMNic",
     ```

1. To retrieve the names of the virtual networks or subnets that a network interface is in, use the [Get-AzNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.network/get-aznetworkinterface) command. For example, the following command gets the virtual network and subnet information for a network interface named *myVMNic* in a resource group named *myResourceGroup*:

     ```azurepowershell-interactive
     $nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface -Name myVMNic -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
     $ipConfigs = $nic.IpConfigurations
     $ipConfigs.Subnet | Select Id
     ```

     The output includes one or more lines that are similar to the example that follows. In the example output, *myVNet* is the name of the virtual network and *mySubnet* is the name of the subnet.
  
     ```output
     "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVNet/subnets/mySubnet",
     ```

1. To retrieve the names of the IP configurations for a network interface, use the [Get-AzNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/Az.Network/Get-AzNetworkInterface) command. For example, the following command lists the names of the IP configurations for a network interface named *myVMNic* in a resource group named *myResourceGroup*:

     ```azurepowershell-interactive
     $nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface -Name myVMNic -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
     $nic.IPConfigurations
     ```

     The output includes one or more lines that are similar to the example that follows. In the example output, *ipconfig1* is the name of an IP configuration.
  
     ```output
     Id : /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/myVMNic/ipConfigurations/ipconfig1
     ```

1. View the public IP address assigned to the IP configuration with the [Get-AzPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/az.network/get-azpublicipaddress) command. The following example retrieves the addresses assigned to a public IP address named *myPublicIP* in a resource group named *myResourceGroup*.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Get-AzPublicIpAddress -Name myPublicIP -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup | Select IpAddress
   ```

1. For a list of the public IP addresses assigned to an IP configuration, run the following commands:

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface -Name myVMNic -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
   $nic.IPConfigurations
   $address = $nic.IPConfigurations.PublicIpAddress
   $address | Select Id
   ```

   The output includes one or more lines that are similar to the example that follows. In the example output, *myPublicIP* is the name of the public IP address assigned to the IP configuration.

   ```output
   "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myPublicIP"
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > An IP address is assigned from the pool of public IP addresses reserved for an Azure region. For a list of the address pools used in each region, see [Azure IP ranges and service tags](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519). If you need the address to be assigned from a specific prefix, use a [Public IP address prefix](public-ip-address-prefix.md).

1. Open the necessary ports in your network security groups by adjusting the inbound security rules. For information, see [Allow network traffic to the VM](#allow-network-traffic-to-the-vm).

---
> [!NOTE]  
> To share a VM with an external user, you must add a public IP address to the VM. Alternatively, external users can connect to VM's private IP address through Azure Bastion.

## Allow network traffic to the VM

Before you can connect to a public IP address from the internet, you must open the necessary ports/protocols in your network security groups. These ports must be open in any network security group that you might have associated to the network interface, the subnet of the network interface, or both. Although network security groups filter traffic to the private IP address of the network interface, after inbound internet traffic arrives at the public IP address, Azure translates the public address to the private IP address. Therefore, if a network security group prevents the traffic flow, the communication with the public IP address fails.

You can view the effective security rules for a network interface and its subnet for the [Azure portal](../../virtual-network/diagnose-network-traffic-filter-problem.md#diagnose-using-azure-portal), the [Azure CLI](../../virtual-network/diagnose-network-traffic-filter-problem.md#diagnose-using-azure-cli), or [Azure PowerShell](../../virtual-network/diagnose-network-traffic-filter-problem.md#diagnose-using-powershell).

## Limits
* If a new public IP address is added to the VM and traffic needs to switch over to the new IP address, the VM needs to be restarted as this will reset all existing flows.
