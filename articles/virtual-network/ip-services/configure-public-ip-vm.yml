  Manage a public IP address with an Azure Virtual Machine
introduction: |
  Public IP addresses are available in two SKUs; standard, and basic. The selection of SKU determines the features of the IP address. The SKU determines the resources that the IP address can be associated with.  

  Azure Virtual Machines is the main compute service in Azure. Customers can create Linux or Windows virtual machines. A public IP address can be assigned to a virtual machine for inbound connections to the virtual machine. 

  A virtual machine doesn't require a public IP address for its configuration.

  In this article, you'll learn how to create an Azure Virtual Machine using an existing public IP in your subscription. You'll learn how to add a public IP address to a virtual machine. You'll change the IP address. Finally, you'll learn how to remove the public IP.

prerequisites: 
  summary: |
    There are three itmes required:
  dependencies:
    - An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).
    - Two standard SKU public IP addresses in your subscription. The IP address can't be associated with any resources. For more information on creating a standard SKU public IP address, see [Create a public IP - Azure portal](./create-public-ip-portal.md). For the examples in this article, name the new public IP addresses **myStandardPublicIP-1** and **myStandardPublicIP-2**.
    - One standard SKU public IP address with the routing preference of **Internet** in your subscription. For more information on creating a public IP with the **Internet** routing preference, see [Configure routing preference for a public IP address using the Azure portal](./routing-preference-portal.md). For the example in this article, name the new public IP address **myStandardPublicIP-3**.
