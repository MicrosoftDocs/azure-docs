# Manage a public IP address with a VPN gateway

Public IP addresses are available in two SKUs; standard, and basic. The selection of SKU determines the features of the IP address. The SKU determines the resources that the IP address can be associated with. 

A VPN gateway is a virtual network gateway used to send encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public Internet. You can also use a VPN gateway to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks over the Microsoft network. Each virtual network can have only one VPN gateway. A VPN gateway requires a public IP address for its configuration. A public IP address is used as the external connection point of the VPN.

VPN gateway supports standard and basic SKU public IP addresses depending on the SKU of the VPN gateway. Public IP prefixes aren't supported. 

In this article, you learn how to create a VPN gateway using an existing public IP in your subscription. 

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- One standard SKU public IP address in your subscription. The IP address can't be associated with any resources. For more information on creating a standard SKU public IP address, see [Create a public IP address using the Azure portal](./create-public-ip-portal.md).
    - For the purposes of the examples in this article, name the new public IP addresses **myStandardPublicIP**.

## Create VPN gateway using existing public IP

In this section, you create a VPN gateway. You select the IP address you created in the prerequisites as the public IP for the VPN gateway.

### Create virtual network

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual network**.

1. In the search results, select **Virtual networks**.

1. Select **+ Create**.

1. In **Create virtual network**, enter or select the following information.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Project details** |   |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **Create new**.</br> Enter **myResourceGroupVPN**.</br> Select **OK**. |
    | **Instance details** |   |
    | Name | Enter **myVNet**. |
    | Region | Select **West US 2**. |
    
1. Select the **Review + create** tab, or select the blue **Review + create** button.

7. Select **Create**.

8. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual network**.

9. In the search results, select **Virtual networks**.

10. Select **myVNET** in **Virtual networks**.

11. Select **Subnets** in **Settings** of **myVNET**.

12. Select **+ Subnet**.

    | Region | Select **West US 2**. |
    | Gateway type | Leave the default of **VPN**. |
    | SKU | Select **VpnGw1AZ**. |
    | Generation | Leave the default of **Generation2**. |
    | Virtual network | Select **myVNet**. |
    | Subnet | Entry will autoselect the **GatewaySubnet** created earlier. |
    | **Public IP address** |   |

## Change or remove public IP address

VPN Gateway doesn't support changing the primary public IP address after creation.

## Caveats

* Public IPv6 addresses aren't supported for VPN Gateways at this time.
