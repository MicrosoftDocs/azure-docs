# Create a custom IPv6 address prefix in Azure

In this article, you learn how to create a custom IPv6 address prefix. You prepare a range to provision, provision the range for IP allocation, and enable the range to be advertised by Microsoft.

A custom IPv6 address prefix enables you to bring your own IPv6 ranges to Microsoft and associate it to your Azure subscription. The range would continue to be owned by you, though Microsoft would be permitted to advertise it to the Internet. A custom IP address prefix functions as a regional resource that represents a contiguous block of customer owned IP addresses.

For this article, choose between the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell to create a custom IPv6 address prefix.

## Differences between using BYOIPv4 and BYOIPv6

[!INCLUDE [ip-services-ipv4-ipv6-differences](../../../includes/ip-services-ipv4-ipv6-differences.md)]

## Prerequisites

# [Azure portal](#tab/azureportal)

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- A customer owned IPv6 range to provision in Azure. A sample customer range (2a05:f500:2::/48) is used for this example, but wouldn't be validated by Azure; you need to replace the example range with yours.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azurecli/)

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- This tutorial requires version 2.37 or later of the Azure CLI (you can run az version to determine which you have). If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.
- Sign in to Azure CLI and ensure you've selected the subscription with which you want to use this feature using `az account`.
- A customer owned IPv6 range to provision in Azure.
    - In this example, a sample customer range (2a05:f500:2::/48) is used. This range won't be validated by Azure. Replace the example range with yours.

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azurepowershell/)

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Azure PowerShell installed locally or Azure Cloud Shell.
- Sign in to Azure PowerShell and ensure you've selected the subscription with which you want to use this feature. For more information, see [Sign in with Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/authenticate-azureps).
- Ensure your Az.Network module is 5.1.1 or later. To verify the installed module, use the command `Get-InstalledModule -Name "Az.Network"`. If the module requires an update, use the command `Update-Module -Name "Az.Network"` if necessary.
- A customer owned IPv6 range to provision in Azure. A sample customer range (2a05:f500:2::/48) is used for this example, but wouldn't be validated by Azure; you need to replace the example range with yours.

If you choose to install and use PowerShell locally, this article requires the Azure PowerShell module version 5.4.1 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` to find the installed version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell). If you're running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> For problems encountered during the provisioning process, please see [Troubleshooting for custom IP prefix](manage-custom-ip-address-prefix.md#troubleshooting-and-faqs).

## Pre-provisioning steps

To utilize the Azure BYOIP feature, you must perform and number of steps prior to the provisioning of your IPv6 address range. Refer to the [IPv4 instructions](create-custom-ip-address-prefix-portal.md#pre-provisioning-steps) for details. All these steps should be completed for the IPv6 global (parent) range.

> [!NOTE]
> When hexadecimal IPv6 characters (a-f) are used in an IPv6 Prefix (CIDR), the case of the Custom IP Prefix IPv6 Prefix (CIDR) used in the Custom IP Prefix object must match the case of the IPv6 prefix as generated for your Custom IP Prefix Signed message.

## Provisioning for IPv6

The following steps display the modified steps for provisioning a sample global (parent) IPv6 range (2a05:f500:2::/48) and regional (child) IPv6 ranges. Some of the steps have been abbreviated or condensed from the [IPv4 instructions](create-custom-ip-address-prefix-portal.md) to focus on the differences between IPv4 and IPv6.

> [!NOTE]
> Clean up or delete steps aren't shown on this page given the nature of the resource. For information on removing a provisioned custom IP prefix, see [Manage custom IP prefix](manage-custom-ip-address-prefix.md).

# [Azure portal](#tab/azureportal)

### Provision a global custom IPv6 address prefix

The following flow creates a custom IP prefix in the specified region and resource group. No zonal properties are provided because the global range isn't associated with any particular region (and therefore no regional availability zones).

### Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

### Create and provision a custom IPv6 address prefix

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Custom IP**.

2. In the search results, select **Custom IP Prefixes**.

3. Select **+ Create**.

4. In **Create a custom IP prefix**, enter or select the following information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Project details** |   |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription |
    | Resource group | Select **Create new**.</br> Enter **myResourceGroup**.</br> Select **OK**. |
    | **Instance details** |   |
    | Name | Enter **myCustomIPv6GlobalPrefix**. |
    | Region | Select **West US 2**. |
    | IP Version | Select IPv6. |
    | IP prefix range | Select Global. |
    | Global IPv6 Prefix (CIDR) | Enter **2a05:f500:2::/48**. |
    | ROA expiration date | Enter your ROA expiration date in the **yyyymmdd** format. |
    | Signed message | Paste in the output of **$byoipauthsigned** from the pre-provisioning section. |

    :::image type="content" source="./media/create-custom-ip-address-prefix-ipv6/create-custom-ipv6-prefix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of create custom IP prefix page in Azure portal.":::

5. Select the **Review + create** tab or the blue **Review + create** button at the bottom of the page.

6. Select **Create**.

The range is pushed to the Azure IP Deployment Pipeline. The deployment process is asynchronous. You can check the status by reviewing the **Commissioned state** field for the custom IP prefix.

### Provision a regional custom IPv6 address prefix

After the global custom IP prefix is in a **Provisioned** state, regional custom IP prefixes can be created. These ranges must always be of size /64 to be considered valid. The ranges can be created in any region (it doesn't need to be the same as the global custom IP prefix), keeping in mind any geolocation restrictions associated with the original global range. The "children" custom IP prefixes advertise from the region they're created in. Because the validation is only done for global custom IP prefix provision, no Authorization or Signed message is required (but availability zones can be utilized).

In the same **Create a custom IP prefix** page as before, enter or select the following information:

| Setting | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| **Project details** |   |
| Subscription | Select your subscription |
| Resource group | Select **Create new**.</br> Enter **myResourceGroup**.</br> Select **OK**. |
| **Instance details** |   |
| Name | Enter **myCustomIPv6RegionalPrefix**. |
| Region | Select **West US 2**. |
| IP Version | Select IPv6. | 
| IP prefix range | Select Regional. |
| Custom IP prefix parent | Select myCustomIPv6GlobalPrefix (2a05:f500:2::/48) from the drop-down menu. |
| Regional IPv6 Prefix (CIDR) | Enter **2a05:f500:2:1::/64**. |
| ROA expiration date | Enter your ROA (Route Origin Expiration) expiration date in the **yyyymmdd** format. |
| Signed message | Paste in the output of **$byoipauthsigned** from the pre-provisioning section. |
| Availability Zones | Select **Zone-redundant**. |

Similar to IPv4 custom IP prefixes, after the regional custom IP prefix is in a **Provisioned** state, public IP prefixes can be derived from the regional custom IP prefix. These public IP prefixes and any public IP addresses derived from them can be attached to networking resources, though they aren't yet being advertised.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Public IPv6 prefixes derived from regional custom IPv6 prefixes can only utilize the first 2048 IPs of the /64 range.

### Commission the custom IPv6 address prefixes

When you commission custom IPv6 prefixes, the global and regional prefixes are treated separately. In other words, commissioning a regional custom IPv6 prefix isn't connected to commissioning the global custom IPv6 prefix.

:::image type="content" source="./media/create-custom-ip-address-prefix-ipv6/any-region-prefix.png" alt-text="Diagram of custom IPv6 prefix showing parent prefix and child prefixes across multiple regions.":::

The safest strategy for range migrations is as follows:
1. Provision all required regional custom IPv6 prefixes in their respective regions. Create public IPv6 prefixes and public IP addresses and attach to resources.
2. Commission each regional custom IPv6 prefix and test connectivity to the IPs within the region. Repeat for each regional custom IPv6 prefix.
3. After all regional custom IPv6 prefixes (and derived prefixes/IPs) have been verified to work as expected, commission the global custom IPv6 prefix, which will advertise the larger range to the Internet.

To commission a custom IPv6 prefix (regional or global) using the portal:

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Custom IP** and select **Custom IP Prefixes**.

2. Verify the custom IPv6 prefix is in a **Provisioned** state.

3. In **Custom IP Prefixes**, select the desired custom IPv6 prefix.

4. In **Overview** page of the custom IPv6 prefix, select the **Commission** button near the top of the screen. If the range is global, it begins advertising from the Microsoft WAN. If the range is regional, it advertises only from the specific region.

Using the example ranges above, the sequence would be to first commission myCustomIPv6RegionalPrefix, followed by a commission of myCustomIPv6GlobalPrefix.

> [!NOTE]
> The estimated time to fully complete the commissioning process for a custom IPv6 global prefix is 3-4 hours. The estimated time to fully complete the commissioning process for a custom IPv6 regional prefix is 30 minutes.

It's possible to commission the global custom IPv6 prefix prior to the regional custom IPv6 prefixes. Doing this advertises the global range to the Internet before the regional prefixes are ready so it's not recommended for migrations of active ranges. You can decommission a global custom IPv6 prefix while there are still active (commissioned) regional custom IPv6 prefixes. Also, you can decommission a regional custom IP prefix while the global prefix is still active (commissioned).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As the global custom IPv6 prefix transitions to a **Commissioned** state, the range is being advertised with Microsoft from the local Azure region and globally to the Internet by Microsoft's wide area network under Autonomous System Number (ASN) 8075. Advertising this same range to the Internet from a location other than Microsoft at the same time could potentially create BGP routing instability or traffic loss. For example, a customer on-premises building. Plan any migration of an active range during a maintenance period to avoid impact.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azurecli/)

### Create a resource group and specify the prefix and authorization messages

Create a resource group in the desired location for provisioning the global range resource.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although the resource for the global range will be associated with a region, the prefix will be advertised by the Microsoft WAN globally.

```azurecli-interactive
  az group create \
    --name myResourceGroup \
    --location westus2
```

### Provision a global custom IPv6 address prefix

The following command creates a custom IP prefix in the specified region and resource group. Specify the exact prefix in CIDR notation as a string to ensure there's no syntax error. (The `-authorization-message` and `-signed-message` parameters are constructed in the same manner as they are for IPv4; for more information, see [Create a custom IP prefix - CLI](create-custom-ip-address-prefix-cli.md).)   No zonal properties are provided because the global range isn't associated with any particular region (and therefore no regional availability zones).

```azurecli-interactive
  byoipauth="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx|2a05:f500:2::/48|yyyymmdd"
  
  az network custom-ip prefix create \
    --name myCustomIPv6GlobalPrefix \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --location westus2 \
    --cidr ‘2a05:f500:2::/48’ \
    --authorization-message $byoipauth \
    --signed-message $byoipauthsigned
```

### Provision a regional custom IPv6 address prefix

After the global custom IP prefix is in a **Provisioned** state, regional custom IP prefixes can be created. These ranges must always be of size /64 to be considered valid. The ranges can be created in any region (it doesn't need to be the same as the global custom IP prefix), keeping in mind any geolocation restrictions associated with the original global range. The "children" custom IP prefixes advertise from the region they're created in. Because the validation is only done for global custom IP prefix provision, no Authorization or Signed message is required (but availability zones can be utilized).

```azurecli-interactive
  az network custom-ip prefix create \
    --name myCustomIPv6RegionalPrefix \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --location westus2 \
    --cidr ‘2a05:f500:2:1::/64’ \
    --zone 1 2 3
```

Similar to IPv4 custom IP prefixes, after the regional custom IP prefix is in a **Provisioned** state, public IP prefixes can be derived from the regional custom IP prefix.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$rg =@{
    Name = 'myResourceGroup'

}
New-AzResourceGroup @rg
```

### Provision a global custom IPv6 address prefix

The following command creates a custom IP prefix in the specified region and resource group. Specify the exact prefix in CIDR notation as a string to ensure there's no syntax error. (The `-AuthorizationMessage` and `-SignedMessage` parameters are constructed in the same manner as they are for IPv4; for more information, see [Create a custom IP prefix - PowerShell](create-custom-ip-address-prefix-powershell.md).)
