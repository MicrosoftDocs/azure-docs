# Manage a public IP address with Azure Bastion

Public IP addresses are available in two SKUs; standard, and basic. The selection of SKU determines the features of the IP address. The SKU determines the resources that the IP address can be associated with.

Azure Bastion is deployed to provide secure management connectivity to virtual machines in a virtual network. Azure Bastion Service enables you to securely and seamlessly RDP & SSH to the VMs in your virtual network. Azure Bastion enables connections without exposing a public IP on the VM. Connections are made directly from the Azure portal, without the need of an extra client/agent or piece of software. Azure Bastion supports standard SKU public IP addresses.

An Azure Bastion host requires a public IP address for its configuration.

In this article, you learn how to create an Azure Bastion host using an existing public IP in your subscription. Azure Bastion doesn't support the change of the public IP address after creation. Azure Bastion supports assigning an IP address within an IP prefix range but not assigning the IP prefix range itself.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).
- One standard SKU public IP address in your subscription. The IP address can't be associated with any resources. For more information on creating a standard SKU public IP address, see [Create a public IP - Azure portal](./create-public-ip-portal.md).
    - For the purposes of the examples in this article, name the new public IP address **myStandardPublicIP**.

## Create Azure Bastion using existing IP

In this section, you create an Azure Bastion host. You select the IP address you created in the prerequisites as the public IP for bastion host.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Bastion**.

3. In the search results, select **Bastion**.

4. Select **+ Create**.

## Change or remove public IP address

Azure Bastion doesn't support the changing of the public IP address after creation.

## More information

* There isn't a requirement for a separate public IP on the virtual machine when connecting via Azure Bastion. Traffic is first routed to the public IP of Bastion. Bastion then routes RDP or SSH connections to the private IP address associated with the virtual machine. 

## Caveats

* Public IPv6 addresses aren't supported for Azure Bastion at this time.
