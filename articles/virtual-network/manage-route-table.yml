  Create, change, or delete a route table  

introduction: |
  Azure automatically routes traffic between Azure subnets, virtual networks, and on-premises networks. If you want to change Azure's default routing, you do so by creating a route table. If you're new to routing in virtual networks, you can learn more about it in [virtual network traffic routing](virtual-networks-udr-overview.md) or by completing a [tutorial](tutorial-create-route-table-portal.md).

prerequisites:
  summary: |
    If you don't have one, set up an Azure account with an active subscription.
    [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).
    Then complete one of these tasks before starting steps in any section of
    this article:
    - **Portal users**: Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
      with your Azure account.
    - **PowerShell users**: Either run the commands in the
      [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/powershell), or run PowerShell
      from your computer. The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that
      you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools
      preinstalled and configured to use with your account. In the Azure Cloud
      Shell browser tab, find the **Select environment** dropdown list, then
      choose **PowerShell** if it isn't already selected.
      
      If you're running PowerShell locally, use Azure PowerShell module version
      1.0.0 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az.Network` to find the
      installed version. If you need to upgrade, see
      [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).
      Also run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.
    - **Azure CLI users**: Run the commands via either the
      [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/bash) or the Azure CLI running
      locally. Use Azure CLI version 2.0.31 or later if you're running the Azure
      CLI locally. Run `az --version` to find the installed version. If you need
      to install or upgrade, see
      [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Also run `az login` to
      create a connection with Azure.  

      Assign the
      [Network contributor role](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#network-contributor)

  - title: | 
      Associate a route table to a subnet
    summary: |   
      You can optionally associate a route table to a subnet. A route table can be associated to zero or more subnets. Route tables aren't associated to virtual networks. You must associate a route table to each subnet you want the route table associated to.

      Azure routes all traffic leaving the subnet based on routes you've created:

      * Within route tables

      * [Default routes](virtual-networks-udr-overview.md#default)

      * Routes propagated from an on-premises network, if the virtual network is connected to an Azure virtual network gateway (ExpressRoute or VPN).

      You can only associate a route table to subnets in virtual networks that exist in the same Azure location and subscription as the route table.
    steps: 
      - |
        Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to manage your virtual network. Search for and select **Virtual networks**.
      - |
        In the virtual network list, choose the virtual network that contains the subnet you want to associate a route table to.
      - |
        In the virtual network menu bar, choose **Subnets**.
      - |
        Select the subnet you want to associate the route table to.
      - |
        In **Route table**, choose the route table you want to associate to the subnet.

          :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-route-table/subnet-route-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot of associating a route table to a subnet.":::
      - |
        Select **Save**.

        If your virtual network is connected to an Azure VPN gateway, don't associate a route table to the [gateway subnet](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateway-settings.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#gwsub) that includes a route with a destination of *0.0.0.0/0*. Doing so can prevent the gateway from functioning properly. For more information about using *0.0.0.0/0* in a route, see [Virtual network traffic routing](virtual-networks-udr-overview.md#default-route).

      - |
        Enter the **Address prefix**, in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation, that you want to route traffic to. The prefix can't be duplicated in more than one route within the route table, though the prefix can be within another prefix. For example, if you defined *10.0.0.0/16* as a prefix in one route, you can still define another route with the *10.0.0.0/22* address prefix. Azure selects a route for traffic based on longest prefix match. To learn more, see [How Azure selects a route](virtual-networks-udr-overview.md#how-azure-selects-a-route).
      - |
        Choose a **Next hop type**. To learn more about next hop types, see [Virtual network traffic routing](virtual-networks-udr-overview.md).

      View effective routes
    summary: | 
      The effective routes for each VM-attached network interface are a combination of route tables that you've created, Azure's default routes, and any routes propagated from on-premises networks via the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) through an Azure virtual network gateway. Understanding the effective routes for a network interface is helpful when troubleshooting routing problems. You can view the effective routes for any network interface that's attached to a running VM.
    steps: 
      - | 
        Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to manage your VMs. Search for and select **Virtual machines**.

      Validate routing between two endpoints
    summary: |
      You can determine the next hop type between a virtual machine and the IP address of another Azure resource, an on-premises resource, or a resource on the Internet. Determining Azure's routing is helpful when troubleshooting routing problems. To complete this task, you must have an existing network watcher. If you don't have an existing network watcher, create one by completing the steps in [Create a Network Watcher instance](../network-watcher/network-watcher-create.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).
    steps: 
      - |
        Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to manage your network watchers. Search for and select **Network Watcher**.
      - |
        In the network watcher menu bar, choose **Next hop**.
      - |
        In the **Network Watcher | Next hop** page:

        | Network interface | Select the **network interface** you want to test next hop from. |
        | Source IP address | The default **source IP** has been selected for you. You can change the source IP if the network interface has more than one. |
        | Destination IP address | Enter the **destination IP** to want to view the next hop for the VM. |
      - |
        Select **Next hop**.
        
        After a short wait, Azure tells you the next hop type and the ID of the route that routed the traffic. Learn more about next hop types that you see returned in [Virtual network traffic routing](virtual-networks-udr-overview.md).
