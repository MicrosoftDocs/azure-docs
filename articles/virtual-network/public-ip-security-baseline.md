## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32270.).

**Guidance**: Azure Public IPs can be assigned tags. Use resource tags for network security groups and other resources related to network security.  Use any of the built-in Azure Policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources.  

You can use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look-up or perform actions on resources based on their tags.
