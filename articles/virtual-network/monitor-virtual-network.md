For a list of available metrics for Virtual Network, see [Azure Virtual Network monitoring data reference](monitor-virtual-network-reference.md#metrics).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enabling these settings requires additional Azure services (storage account, event hub, or Log Analytics), which might increase your cost. To calculate an estimated cost, visit the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator).

### Analyzing metrics

Azure Monitor currently doesn't support analyzing *Azure virtual network* metrics from the metrics explorer. To view *Azure virtual network* metrics, select **Metrics** under **Monitoring** from the virtual network you want to analyze.
