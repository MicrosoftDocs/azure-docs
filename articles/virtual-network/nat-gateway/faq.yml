    questions:
      - question: Is the Virtual Network NAT public IP address static?  
        answer: |
          Yes. When Virtual Network NAT is configured on a subnet, all outbound connectivity uses your specified static public IP address(es).  

      - question: What is the maximum number of public IP addresses that can be used by Virtual Network NAT?
        answer: |
          The Virtual Network NAT gateway resource can use up to 16 public IP addresses. The Virtual Network NAT can use any combination of public IP addresses and public IP address prefixes totaling to 16 addresses. The maximum prefix size that can be used by Virtual Network NAT is /28 (16 addresses).  

      - question: Can IPs of existing Virtual Network NAT be changed? 
        answer: |
          No, an existing IP attached to the Virtual Network NAT can't be changed. A different IP can be attached to Virtual Network NAT by first removing the old IP, then adding a new IP and then attaching the new IP to the Virtual Network NAT.  

      - question: If multiple public IP addresses are assigned to a NAT gateway resource, will there be a disruption of traffic if one of the IP addresses is removed?
        answer: |
          No. If the Virtual Network NAT gateway resource has multiple public IPs, it will load balance traffic between the assigned IPs. Removing one of the IPs won't cause any downtime. It is advised that if you decide to remove one of the public IP addresses from the NAT gateway resource, use a maintenance window for the removal.

      - question: I see a message saying I have no internet connection.
        answer: |
          To use Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, you need an internet connection. For more information about connecting to the internet on your HoloLens, visit [this support article](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12629).

      - question: Can Virtual Network NAT be attached to multiple virtual networks?  
        answer: |
          No. Virtual Network NAT cannot be attached to multiple virtual networks.  

      - question: Can Virtual Network NAT be attached to multiple subnets? 
        answer: |
          Yes. Virtual Network NAT can be associated with multiple subnets within a virtual network. It isn't required to be associated with all subnets within a virtual network. Each subnet within a virtual network can be configured with its own Virtual Network NAT. 

      - question: Can Virtual Network NAT be associated with a gateway subnet? 
        answer: |
          No. Virtual Network NAT cannot be associated with a gateway subnet.

      - question: Why does audio sometimes cut out even in quiet environments?
        answer: |
          If Dynamics 365 Remote Assist is used in a loud environment, use headphones on both ends for better communication. Using headphones for both users prevents any echo filtering from proactively turning on noise cancellation, which turns off audio.

      - question: I signed in to my HoloLens, but I still can't sign in to Dynamics 365 Remote Assist.
        answer: |
          If you’re having trouble signing in to Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, try the following:

          - Make sure you’re using a work or school account, not a Microsoft account (MSA), to sign in to HoloLens.

          -  Make sure that the work or school account you’re using has a valid [Microsoft 365 Business](https://products.office.com/business/office) Premium or Essentials subscription with [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) enabled.

          - Make sure your HoloLens is connected to the internet.

          - Check with your administrator to make sure your device and network are set up to work with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist.

      - question: Can I share files from SharePoint on Dynamics 365 Remote Assist?
        answer: |
          No, you can only share local files and files from OneDrive.

      - question: Can a Teams desktop user show the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user a video or PowerPoint?
        answer: |
          Yes. We understand that technicians, inspectors, and remote collaborators want to refer to a wide variety of resources and reference documents during the call. By using the Teams desktop **Share** feature, the Teams desktop user can show the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens whatever they are looking at on their desktop or in a specific application window. For example, the Teams desktop user can show the technician a video playing in a web browser. Furthermore, because the Teams desktop user's screen or application window is shared in real time, all call participants will see when the Teams desktop user pauses or restarts the video.

      - question: When a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call ends, how can I access the messages, snapshots, and files from the call?
        answer: |
          All messages, links, or images sent in the text chat will be available for all participants via Teams chat, but not via Dynamics 365 Remote Assist chat. Additional details below.

          **Snapshots from Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user:** Snapshots are saved differently depending on whether the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call is associated with a Dynamics 365 Field Service booking.
          - If a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call is associated with a booking, the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user will take a snapshot and decide whether to save it to OneDrive or to the booking.
          - If a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call is not associated with a booking, the Dynamics 365 Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user’s snapshot will automatically be saved in OneDrive.  

          Then, regardless of how snapshots are saved, a link to the snapshot is sent via the text chat, and the Teams user can view the snapshot and also view the link to the snapshot. 

          **Files:** When a Teams user shares a file, a link to the file is sent in the chat. During the call, the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user can use the controls in the top-right corner of a file to save it to their OneDrive.

      - question: How can I improve hologram stability?
        answer: |
          Hologram stability refers to how well a placed hologram stays where you placed it – be this perceptual or actual.

          - *Perceptual* instability could refer to a hologram that seems to move with your head motion, instead of tracking the placed position in space.
          - *Actual* instability could refer to a hologram whose coordinates have changed in virtual space, or whose position relative to a real-world object has shifted regardless of user input or head tracking.

          Holograms are always going to be most stable **when your head (not your eyes) is pointed directly at them**. The expected tolerance for hologram stability is that they remain within 1 cm of the placed position for every 1 m of distance from the device.

          To improve hologram stability, complete eye calibration. 

          - To complete eye calibration on HoloLens, [manually start the calibration process]( https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens-calibration#calibrating-your-hololens-1st-gen). 
          - HoloLens 2 will prompt you to calibrate the device under several circumstances. [Complete eye calibration]( https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens-calibration#calibrating-your-hololens-2) when requested. It will only take about 20 seconds.

      - question: Multiple people in my organization use Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on the same HoloLens. How do I clean my HoloLens?
        answer: |
          Learn how to clean [HoloLens](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens1-hardware#care-and-cleaning) and [HoloLens 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens2-maintenance).

      - question: Can I save call artifacts to a Field Service work order?
        answer: |
          Yes! If you opened a Field Service booking and then made a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call, at the end of the call, you'll be prompted to post the call log and files shared during the call to the work order associated with that booking.

          To view the call log and files, sign into Field Service and select the work order. Two new notes will have been created and attached to the work order. One note will include call log info. The other note will include and a link to each file in plain text. You can also edit the note to include the Stream link of the recorded call, which can be found in your Teams chat.
