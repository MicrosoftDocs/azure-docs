# Set up DPDK in a Linux virtual machine

Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) on Azure offers a faster user-space packet processing framework for performance-intensive applications. This framework bypasses the virtual machine’s kernel network stack.

In typical packet processing that uses the kernel network stack, the process is interrupt-driven. When the network interface receives incoming packets, there's a kernel interrupt to process the packet and a context switch from the kernel space to the user space. DPDK eliminates context switching and the interrupt-driven method in favor of a user-space implementation that uses poll mode drivers for fast packet processing.

DPDK consists of sets of user-space libraries that provide access to lower-level resources. These resources can include hardware, logical cores, memory management, and poll mode drivers for network interface cards.

DPDK can run on Azure virtual machines that are supporting multiple operating system distributions. DPDK provides key performance differentiation in driving network function virtualization implementations. These implementations can take the form of network virtual appliances (NVAs), such as virtual routers, firewalls, VPNs, load balancers, evolved packet cores, and denial-of-service (DDoS) applications.

A list of setup instructions for DPDK on MANA VMs is available here: [Microsoft Azure Network Adapter (MANA) and DPDK on Linux](setup-dpdk-mana.md)

## Benefit

**Higher packets per second (PPS)**: Bypassing the kernel and taking control of packets in the user space reduces the cycle count by eliminating context switches. It also improves the rate of packets that are processed per second in Azure Linux virtual machines.

## Supported operating systems minimum versions

The following distributions from the Azure Marketplace are supported:

| Linux OS     | Kernel version               |
|--------------|---------------------------   |
| Ubuntu 18.04 | 4.15.0-1014-azure+           |
| SLES 15 SP1  | 4.12.14-8.19-azure+          |
| RHEL 7.5     | 3.10.0-862.11.6.el7.x86_64+  |
| Debian 10    | 4.19.0-1-cloud+              |

The noted versions are the minimum requirements. Newer versions are supported too.

A list of requirements for DPDK on MANA VMs is available here: [Microsoft Azure Network Adapter (MANA) and DPDK on Linux](setup-dpdk-mana.md)

**Custom kernel support**

For any Linux kernel version that's not listed, see [Patches for building an Azure-tuned Linux kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-linux-kernel). For more information, you can also contact [aznetdpdk@microsoft.com](mailto:aznetdpdk@microsoft.com).

## Region support

All Azure regions support DPDK.

## Prerequisites

Accelerated networking must be enabled on a Linux virtual machine. The virtual machine should have at least two network interfaces, with one interface for management. Enabling Accelerated networking on management interface isn't recommended. Learn how to [create a Linux virtual machine with accelerated networking enabled](create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli.md).

In addition, DPDK uses RDMA verbs to create data queues on the Network Adapter. In the VM, ensure the correct RDMA kernel drivers are loaded. They can be mlx4_ib, mlx5_ib or mana_ib depending on VM sizes.



## Install DPDK manually (recommended)

### Compile and install DPDK manually

1. [Download the latest DPDK](https://core.dpdk.org/download). Version 22.11 LTS or newer is recommended for Azure.

2. Build the default config with `meson builddir`.

3. Compile with `ninja -C builddir`.

4. Install with `DESTDIR=<output folder> ninja -C builddir install`.

## Configure the runtime environment

After restarting, run the following commands once:

1. Hugepages

    * Configure hugepage by running the following command, once for each numa node:

    ```bash
     echo 1024 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/node/node*/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages
    ```

    * Create a directory for mounting with `mkdir /mnt/huge`.

    * Mount hugepages with `mount -t hugetlbfs nodev /mnt/huge`.

    * Check that hugepages are reserved with `grep Huge /proc/meminfo`.

    * The example above is for 2M huge pages. 1G huge pages can also be used.

     > [!NOTE]
     > There is a way to modify the grub file so that hugepages are reserved on boot by following the [instructions](https://dpdk.org/doc/guides/linux_gsg/sys_reqs.html#use-of-hugepages-in-the-linux-environment) for the DPDK. The instructions are at the bottom of the page. When you're using an Azure Linux virtual machine, modify files under **/etc/config/grub.d** instead, to reserve hugepages across reboots.

2. MAC & IP addresses: Use `ifconfig –a` to view the MAC and IP address of the network interfaces. The *VF* network interface and *NETVSC* network interface have the same MAC address, but only the *NETVSC* network interface has an IP address. *VF* interfaces are running as subordinate interfaces of *NETVSC* interfaces.

3. PCI addresses

   * Use `ethtool -i <vf interface name>` to find out which PCI address to use for *VF*.

   * If *eth0* has accelerated networking enabled, make sure that testpmd doesn’t accidentally take over the *VF* pci device for *eth0*. If the DPDK application accidentally takes over the management network interface and causes you to lose your SSH connection, use the serial console to stop the DPDK application. You can also use the serial console to stop or start the virtual machine.

4. Load *ibuverbs* on each reboot with `modprobe -a ib_uverbs`. For SLES 15 only, also load *mlx4_ib* with `modprobe -a mlx4_ib`.

## Master PMD

DPDK applications must run over the master PMD that is exposed in Azure. If the application runs directly over the VF PMD, it doesn't receive all packets that are destined to the VM, since some packets show up over the synthetic interface. DPDK supports two types of master PMDs: NetVSC PMD and Failsafe PMD. A master PMD guarantees that the application receives all packets that are destined to it. It also makes sure that the application keeps running in DPDK mode over master PMD, even if the VF is revoked when the host is being serviced.

## NetVSC PMD

NetVSC is the recommended PMD to run as a master PMD in Azure. It guarantees that the application receives all packets that are destined to it. It also makes sure that the application keeps running in DPDK mode, even if the VF is revoked when the host is being serviced. For more information about how to use and configure NetVSC PMD, see (https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/nics/netvsc.html).

## Failsafe PMD

Note: running with failsafe PMD is not recommended in Azure. If your DPDK version is 22.11 LTS or newer, use NetVSC PMD is recommended.

As an alternative, you can run a DPDK application over the failsafe PMD. For more information about failsafe PMD see [Fail-safe poll mode driver library](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/nics/fail_safe.html).


## Run testpmd

To run testpmd in root mode, use `sudo` before the *testpmd* command.

### Basic: Sanity check, failsafe adapter initialization

1. Run the following commands to start a single port testpmd application:

   ```bash
   testpmd -w <pci address from previous step> \
     -- -i \
     --port-topology=chained
    ```

2. Run the following commands to start a dual port testpmd application:

   ```bash
   testpmd -w <pci address nic1> \
   -w <pci address nic2> \
   -- -i
   ```

After it's started, run `show port info all` to check port information. You should see one or two DPDK ports that are net_netvsc.

3.  Use `start <port> /stop <port>` to start traffic.

The previous commands start *testpmd* in interactive mode, which is recommended for trying out  testpmd commands.

### Basic: Single sender/single receiver

The following commands periodically print the packets per second statistics:

1. On the TX side, run the following command:

   ```bash
   testpmd \
     -l <core-list> \
     -n <num of mem channels> \
     -w <pci address of the device you plan to use> \
     -- --port-topology=chained \
     --nb-cores <number of cores to use for test pmd> \
     --forward-mode=txonly \
     --eth-peer=<port id>,<receiver peer MAC address> \
     --stats-period <display interval in seconds>
   ```

2. On the RX side, run the following command:

   ```bash
   testpmd \
     -l <core-list> \
     -n <num of mem channels> \
     -w <pci address of the device you plan to use> \
     -- --port-topology=chained \
     --nb-cores <number of cores to use for test pmd> \
     --forward-mode=rxonly \
     --eth-peer=<port id>,<sender peer MAC address> \
     --stats-period <display interval in seconds>
   ```

When you're running the previous commands on a virtual machine, change *IP_SRC_ADDR* and *IP_DST_ADDR* in `app/test-pmd/txonly.c` to match the actual IP address of the virtual machines before you compile. Otherwise, the packets are dropped before reaching the receiver.

### Advanced: Single sender/single forwarder

The following commands periodically print the packets per second statistics:

1. On the TX side, run the following command:

   ```bash
   testpmd \
     -l <core-list> \
     -n <num of mem channels> \
     -w <pci address of the device you plan to use> \
     -- --port-topology=chained \
     --nb-cores <number of cores to use for test pmd> \
     --forward-mode=txonly \
     --eth-peer=<port id>,<receiver peer MAC address> \
     --stats-period <display interval in seconds>
    ```

2. On the FWD side, run the following command:

   ```bash
   testpmd \
     -l <core-list> \
     -n <num of mem channels> \
     -w <pci address NIC1> \
     -w <pci address NIC2> \
     -- --nb-cores <number of cores to use for test pmd> \
     --forward-mode=io \
     --eth-peer=<recv port id>,<sender peer MAC address> \
     --stats-period <display interval in seconds>
    ```

When you're running the previous commands on a virtual machine, change *IP_SRC_ADDR* and *IP_DST_ADDR* in `app/test-pmd/txonly.c` to match the actual IP address of the virtual machines before you compile. Otherwise, the packets are dropped before reaching the forwarder. You can't have a third machine receive forwarded traffic, because the *testpmd* forwarder doesn’t modify the layer-3 addresses, unless you make some code changes.
