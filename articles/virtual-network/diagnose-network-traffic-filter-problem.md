# Diagnose a virtual machine network traffic filter problem

In this article, you learn how to diagnose network traffic filter issues for a virtual machine (VM). The process involves viewing the effective security rules applied by the network security group (NSG).

NSGs enable you to control the types of traffic that flow in and out of a VM. You can associate an NSG to a subnet in an Azure virtual network, a network interface attached to a VM, or both. The effective security rules applied to a network interface are an aggregation of the rules that exist in the NSG associated to a network interface, and the subnet the network interface is in. Rules in different NSGs can sometimes conflict with each other and affect a VM's network connectivity. You can view all the effective security rules from NSGs that are applied on your VM's network interfaces. If you're not familiar with virtual network, network interface, or NSG concepts, see [Virtual network overview](virtual-networks-overview.md), [Network interface](virtual-network-network-interface.md), and [Network security groups overview](./network-security-groups-overview.md).

## Scenario

You attempt to connect to a VM over port 80 from the internet, but the connection fails. To determine why you can't access port 80 from the Internet, you can view the effective security rules for a network interface using the Azure [portal](#diagnose-using-azure-portal), [PowerShell](#diagnose-using-powershell), or the [Azure CLI](#diagnose-using-azure-cli).

The steps that follow assume you have an existing VM to view the effective security rules for. If you don't have an existing VM, first deploy a [Linux](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) or [Windows](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) VM to complete the tasks in this article with. The examples in this article are for a VM named *myVM* with a network interface named *myVMVMNic*. The VM and network interface are in a resource group named *myResourceGroup*, and are in the *East US* region. Change the values in the steps, as appropriate, for the VM you're diagnosing the problem for.

## Diagnose using Azure portal

1. Log into the Azure [portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an Azure account that has the [necessary permissions](virtual-network-network-interface.md#permissions).

1. At the top of the Azure portal, enter the name of the VM in the search box. When the name of the VM appears in the search results, select it.

1. Expand **Networking** in the left pane. Select **Network settings**. The following figures show the network security group settings for the VM's network interface.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-network-traffic-filter-problem/view-security-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot of security rules for NSG nsg-subnet." lightbox="./media/diagnose-network-traffic-filter-problem/view-security-rules.png":::

    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-network-traffic-filter-problem/view-security-rules2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of security rules for NSG nsg-nic." lightbox="./media/diagnose-network-traffic-filter-problem/view-security-rules2.png":::
  

   The rules you see listed in the previous figures are for a network interface named **vm-1445**. You see that there are **Inbound port rules** for the network interface from two different network security groups:
   
   - **nsg-subnet**: Associated to the subnet that the network interface is in.
   - **nsg-nic**: Associated to the network interface in the VM named **vm-1445**.

   The rule named **DenyAllInBound** is what's preventing inbound communication to the VM over port 80, from the internet, as described in the [scenario](#scenario). The rule lists *0.0.0.0/0* for **SOURCE**, which includes the internet. No other rule with a higher priority (lower number) allows port 80 inbound. To allow port 80 inbound to the VM from the internet, see [Resolve a problem](#resolve-a-problem). To learn more about security rules and how Azure applies them, see [Network security groups](./network-security-groups-overview.md).

   At the bottom of the picture, you also see **Outbound port rules**. The outbound port rules for the network interface are listed. 

    Though the picture only shows four inbound rules for each NSG, your NSGs might have many more than four rules. In the picture, you see **VirtualNetwork** under **Source** and **Destination** and **AzureLoadBalancer** under **SOURCE**. **VirtualNetwork** and **AzureLoadBalancer** are [service tags](./network-security-groups-overview.md#service-tags). Service tags represent a group of IP address prefixes to help minimize complexity for security rule creation.

1. To view the effective security rules, select the interface in the network settings of the virtual machine. Ensure the VM is in a running state before proceeding.

1. In the settings for the network interface, expand **Help**, then select **Effective security rules**.

    The following example shows the example network interface **vm-1445** with the **Effective security rules** selected.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-network-traffic-filter-problem/view-effective-security-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot of effective security rules for network interface vm-1445." lightbox="./media/diagnose-network-traffic-filter-problem/view-effective-security-rules.png":::
  
   The rules listed are the same as you saw in step 3, though there are different tabs for the NSG associated to the network interface and the subnet. As you can see in the picture, only the first 50 rules are shown. To download a .csv file that contains all of the rules, select **Download**.

1. The previous steps showed the security rules for a network interface named **vm-1445**. What if a VM has two network interfaces? The VM in this example has two network interfaces attached to it. The effective security rules can be different for each network interface.

   To see the rules for the **vm-nic-2** network interface, select it. As shown in the example that follows, the network interface has the same rules associated to its subnet as the **vm-1445** network interface, because both network interfaces are in the same subnet. When you associate an NSG to a subnet, its rules are applied to all network interfaces in the subnet.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/diagnose-network-traffic-filter-problem/view-security-rules3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of security rules for nic vm-nic-2." lightbox="./media/diagnose-network-traffic-filter-problem/view-security-rules3.png":::

   Unlike the **vm-1445** network interface, the **vm-nic-2** network interface doesn't have a network security group associated to it. Each network interface and subnet can have zero, or one, NSG associated to it. The NSG associated to each network interface or subnet can be the same, or different. You can associate the same network security group to as many network interfaces and subnets as you choose.

Though effective security rules were viewed through the VM, you can also view effective security rules through an individual:
- **Network interface**: Learn how to [view a network interface](virtual-network-network-interface.md#view-network-interface-settings).
- **NSG**: Learn how to [view an NSG](manage-network-security-group.md#view-details-of-a-network-security-group).

## Diagnose using PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/updated-for-az.md)]

You can run the commands that follow in the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/powershell), or by running PowerShell from your computer. The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account. If you run PowerShell from your computer, you need the Azure PowerShell module, version 1.0.0 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` on your computer, to find the installed version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell). If you're running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzAccount` to log into Azure with an account that has the [necessary permissions](virtual-network-network-interface.md#permissions)].

Get the effective security rules for a network interface with [Get-AzEffectiveNetworkSecurityGroup](/powershell/module/az.network/get-azeffectivenetworksecuritygroup). The following example gets the effective security rules for a network interface named *vm-nic* that is in a resource group named *test-rg*:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$Params = @{
  NetworkInterfaceName = "vm-nic"
  ResourceGroupName    = "test-rg"
}
Get-AzEffectiveNetworkSecurityGroup @Params
```

Output is returned in json format. To understand the output, see [interpret command output](#interpret-command-output).
Output is only returned if an NSG is associated with the network interface, the subnet the network interface is in, or both. The VM must be in the running state. A VM might have multiple network interfaces with different NSGs applied. When troubleshooting, run the command for each network interface.

If you're still having a connectivity problem, see [more diagnoses](#more-diagnoses) and [considerations](#considerations).

If you only know the VM name, use the following commands to list all network interface IDs attached to the VM.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$Params = @{
  Name              = "vm-1"
  ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
}
$VM = Get-AzVM @Params
$VM.NetworkProfile
```

You receive output similar to the following example:

```output
NetworkInterfaces
-----------------
{/subscriptions/<ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/vm-nic
```

In the previous output, the network interface name is *vm-nic*.

## Diagnose using Azure CLI

If using Azure CLI commands to complete tasks in this article, either run the commands in the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/bash), or by running the Azure CLI from your computer. This article requires the Azure CLI version 2.0.32 or later. Run `az --version` to find the installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). If you're running the Azure CLI locally, you also need to run `az login` and log into Azure with an account that has the [necessary permissions](virtual-network-network-interface.md#permissions).

Get the effective security rules for a network interface with [az network nic list-effective-nsg](/cli/azure/network/nic#az-network-nic-list-effective-nsg). The following example gets the effective security rules for a network interface named *vm-nic* that is in a resource group named *test-rg*:

```azurecli-interactive
az network nic list-effective-nsg \
  --name vm-nic \
  --resource-group test-rg
```

Output is returned in json format. To understand the output, see [interpret command output](#interpret-command-output).
Output is only returned if an NSG is associated with the network interface, the subnet the network interface is in, or both. The VM must be in the running state. A VM might have multiple network interfaces with different NSGs applied. When troubleshooting, run the command for each network interface.

If you're still having a connectivity problem, see [more diagnoses](#more-diagnoses) and [considerations](#considerations).

If you only know the VM name, use the following commands to list all network interface IDs attached to the VM.

```azurecli-interactive
az vm show \
  --name vm-1 \
  --resource-group test-rg
```

Within the returned output, you see information similar to the following example:

```output
"networkProfile": {
    "additionalProperties": {},
    "networkInterfaces": [
      {
        "additionalProperties": {},
        "id": "/subscriptions/<ID>/resourceGroups/test-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/vm-nic",
        "primary": true,
        "resourceGroup": "test-rg"
      },
```

In the previous output, the network interface name is **vm-nic**

## Interpret command output

Regardless of whether you used the [PowerShell](#diagnose-using-powershell), or the [Azure CLI](#diagnose-using-azure-cli) to diagnose the problem, you receive output that contains the following information:

- **NetworkSecurityGroup**: The ID of the network security group.
- **Association**: Indicates whether the network security group is linked to a *NetworkInterface* or *Subnet*. If the NSG's association status changes right before running the command, wait a few seconds for the output to reflect the update.
- **EffectiveSecurityRules**: An explanation of each property is detailed in [Create a security rule](manage-network-security-group.md#create-a-security-rule). Rule names prefaced with *defaultSecurityRules/* are default security rules that exist in every NSG. Rule names prefaced with *securityRules/* are user created rules. Rules that specify a [service tag](./network-security-groups-overview.md#service-tags), such as **Internet**, **VirtualNetwork**, and **AzureLoadBalancer** for the **destinationAddressPrefix** or **sourceAddressPrefix** properties, also have values for the **expandedDestinationAddressPrefix** property. The **expandedDestinationAddressPrefix** property lists all address prefixes represented by the service tag.

Duplicate rules appear in the output when an NSG is linked to both the network interface and the subnet. Default rules and any custom rules shared between the NSGs cause these duplicates.

The rule named **defaultSecurityRules/DenyAllInBound** is what's preventing inbound communication to the VM over port 80, from the internet, as described in the [scenario](#scenario). No other rule with a higher priority (lower number) allows port 80 inbound from the internet.

## Resolve a problem

You can diagnose the problem described in the [scenario](#scenario) using the Azure [portal](#diagnose-using-azure-portal), [PowerShell](#diagnose-using-powershell), or the [Azure CLI](#diagnose-using-azure-cli). The solution is to create a network security rule with the following properties:

| Property                | Value                                                                              |
|---------                |---------                                                                           |
| Source                  | Any                                                                                |
| Source port ranges      | Any                                                                                |
| Destination             | The IP address of the VM, a range of IP addresses, or all addresses in the subnet. |
| Destination port ranges | 80                                                                                 |
| Protocol                | TCP                                                                                |
| Action                  | Allow                                                                              |
| Priority                | 100                                                                                |
| Name                    | Allow-HTTP-All                                                                     |

After rule creation, port 80 is allowed inbound from the internet because its priority is higher than the default *DenyAllInBound* rule. If NSGs are associated with both the network interface and the subnet, create the same rule in both NSGs. Learn how to [create a security rule](manage-network-security-group.md#create-a-security-rule).

When Azure processes inbound traffic, it processes rules in the NSG associated to the subnet (if there's an associated NSG), and then it processes the rules in the NSG associated to the network interface. If there's an NSG associated to the network interface and the subnet, the port must be open in both NSGs, for the traffic to reach the VM. To ease administration and communication problems, we recommend that you associate an NSG to a subnet, rather than individual network interfaces. If VMs within a subnet need different security rules, you can make the network interfaces members of an application security group (ASG), and specify an ASG as the source and destination of a security rule. Learn more about [application security groups](./network-security-groups-overview.md#application-security-groups).

If you're still having communication problems, see [Considerations](#considerations) and more diagnosis.

## Considerations

Consider the following points when troubleshooting connectivity problems:

* Default security rules block inbound access from the internet, and only permit inbound traffic from the virtual network. To allow inbound traffic from the Internet, add security rules with a higher priority than default rules. Learn more about [default security rules](./network-security-groups-overview.md#default-security-rules), or how to [add a security rule](manage-network-security-group.md#create-a-security-rule).
* For peered virtual networks, by default, the **VIRTUAL_NETWORK** service tag automatically expands to include prefixes for peered virtual networks. To troubleshoot any issues related to virtual network peering, you can view the prefixes in the **ExpandedAddressPrefix** list. Learn more about [virtual network peering](virtual-network-peering-overview.md) and [service tags](./network-security-groups-overview.md#service-tags).
* Azure only shows effective security rules for a network interface when an NSG is associated with the VM's network interface or subnet. Additionally, the VM must be in the running state.

* If the network interface or subnet lacks an associated NSG, all ports remain open for inbound and outbound access when a VM has a [public IP address](./ip-services/virtual-network-public-ip-address.md). This configuration allows unrestricted access to and from anywhere. To secure the VM, apply an NSG to the subnet hosting the network interface if it has a public IP address.

## More diagnoses

* To run a quick test to determine if traffic is allowed to or from a VM, use the [IP flow verify](../network-watcher/diagnose-vm-network-traffic-filtering-problem.md) capability of Azure Network Watcher. IP flow verify tells you if traffic is allowed or denied. If denied, IP flow verify tells you which security rule is denying the traffic.
* If there are no security rules causing a VM's network connectivity to fail, the problem might be due to:
  * Firewall software running within the VM's operating system
  * Routes configured for virtual appliances or on-premises traffic. Internet traffic can be redirected to your on-premises network via [forced-tunneling](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-forced-tunneling-rm.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json). If you force tunnel internet traffic to a virtual appliance, or on-premises, you might not be able to connect to the VM from the internet. To learn how to diagnose route problems that might impede the flow of traffic out of the VM, see [Diagnose a virtual machine network traffic routing problem](diagnose-network-routing-problem.md).
