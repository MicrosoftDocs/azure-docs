# Tutorial: Filter network traffic with a network security group

You can use a network security group to filter inbound and outbound network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network.

Network security groups contain security rules that filter network traffic by IP address, port, and protocol. When a network security group is associated with a subnet, security rules are applied to resources deployed in that subnet.

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

[!INCLUDE [virtual-network-create.md](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/virtual-network-create.md)]

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

First create a resource group for all the resources created in this article with [New-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup). The following example creates a resource group in the _westus2_ location:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$rg = @{
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Location = "westus2"
}

New-AzResourceGroup @rg
```

Create a virtual network with [New-AzVirtualNetwork](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azvirtualnetwork). The following example creates a virtual named _vnet-1_:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$vnet = @{
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Location = "westus2"
    Name = "vnet-1"
    AddressPrefix = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

$virtualNetwork = New-AzVirtualNetwork @vnet
```

Create a subnet configuration with [New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azvirtualnetworksubnetconfig), and then write the subnet configuration to the virtual network with [Set-AzVirtualNetwork](/powershell/module/az.network/set-azvirtualnetwork). The following example adds a subnet named _subnet-1_ to the virtual network and associates the _nsg-1_ network security group to it:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$subnet = @{
    Name = "subnet-1"
    VirtualNetwork = $virtualNetwork
    AddressPrefix = "10.0.0.0/24"
}
Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig @subnet

$virtualNetwork | Set-AzVirtualNetwork
```

### [CLI](#tab/cli)

First create a resource group for all the resources created in this article with [az group create](/cli/azure/group). The following example creates a resource group in the *westus2* location: 

```azurecli-interactive
az group create \
  --name test-rg \
  --location westus2
```

Create a virtual network with [az network vnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet). The following example creates a virtual named *vnet-1*:

```azurecli-interactive 
az network vnet create \
  --name vnet-1 \
  --resource-group test-rg \
  --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/16
```

Add a subnet to a virtual network with [az network vnet subnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet). The following example adds a subnet named *subnet-1* to the virtual network and associates the *nsg-1* network security group to it:

```azurecli-interactive
az network vnet subnet create \
  --vnet-name vnet-1 \
  --resource-group test-rg \
  --name subnet-1 \
  --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/24
```

   | Region               | Select **East US 2**.     |

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. Select **Create**.

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Create an application security group with [New-AzApplicationSecurityGroup](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azapplicationsecuritygroup). An application security group enables you to group servers with similar port filtering requirements. The following example creates two application security groups.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$web = @{
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Name = "asg-web"
    Location = "westus2"
}
$webAsg = New-AzApplicationSecurityGroup @web

$mgmt = @{
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Name = "asg-mgmt"
    Location = "westus2"
}
$mgmtAsg = New-AzApplicationSecurityGroup @mgmt
```

### [CLI](#tab/cli)

Create an application security group with [az network asg create](/cli/azure/network/asg). An application security group enables you to group servers with similar port filtering requirements. The following example creates two application security groups.

```azurecli-interactive
az network asg create \
  --resource-group test-rg \
  --name asg-web \
  --location westus2

az network asg create \
  --resource-group test-rg \
  --name asg-mgmt \
  --location westus2
```

## Create a network security group

A [network security group (NSG)](network-security-groups-overview.md) secures network traffic in your virtual network.

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Network security group**. Select **Network security groups** in the search results.

   > [!NOTE]
   > In the search results for **Network security groups**, you may see **Network security groups (classic)**. Select **Network security groups**.

1. Select **+ Create**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of **Create network security group**, enter, or select this information:

   | Setting              | Value                     |
   | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
   | **Project details**  |                           |
   | Subscription         | Select your subscription. |
   | Resource group       | Select **test-rg**.       |
   | **Instance details** |                           |
   | Name                 | Enter **nsg-1**.          |
   | Location             | Select **East US 2**.     |

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. Select **Create**.

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Create a network security group with [New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworksecuritygroup). The following example creates a network security group named _nsg-1_:

```powershell-interactive
$nsgParams = @{
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Location = "westus2"
    Name = "nsg-1"
}
$nsg = New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup @nsgParams
```

### [CLI](#tab/cli)

Create a network security group with [az network nsg create](/cli/azure/network/nsg). The following example creates a network security group named *nsg-1*: 

```azurecli-interactive 
# Create a network security group
az network nsg create \
  --resource-group test-rg \
  --name nsg-1
```

---

## Associate network security group to subnet

In this section, you associate the network security group with the subnet of the virtual network you created earlier.

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Network security group**. Select **Network security groups** in the search results.

1. Select **nsg-1**.

1. Select **Subnets** from the **Settings** section of **nsg-1**.

1. In the **Subnets** page, select **+ Associate**:

1. Under **Associate subnet**, select **vnet-1 (test-rg)** for **Virtual network**.

1. Select **subnet-1** for **Subnet**, and then select **OK**.

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Use [Get-AzVirtualNetwork](/powershell/module/az.network/get-azvirtualnetwork) to retrieve the virtual network object, and then use [Set-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig](/powershell/module/az.network/set-azvirtualnetworksubnetconfig) to associate the network security group with the subnet. The following example retrieves the virtual network object and updates the subnet configuration to associate the network security group:

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Retrieve the virtual network
$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name "vnet-1" -ResourceGroupName "test-rg"

# Update the subnet configuration to associate the network security group
$subnetConfigParams = @{
    VirtualNetwork = $vnet
    Name = "subnet-1"
    AddressPrefix = $vnet.Subnets[0].AddressPrefix
    NetworkSecurityGroup = Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -Name "nsg-1" -ResourceGroupName "test-rg"
}
Set-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig @subnetConfigParams

# Update the virtual network with the new subnet configuration
$vnet | Set-AzVirtualNetwork
```

### [CLI](#tab/cli)

Use [az network vnet subnet update](/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet) to associate the network security group with the subnet. The following example associates the *nsg-1* network security group with the *subnet-1* subnet:

```azurecli-interactive
az network vnet subnet update \
  --resource-group test-rg \
  --vnet-name vnet-1 \
  --name subnet-1 \
  --network-security-group nsg-1
```

## Create security rules

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. Select **Inbound security rules** from the **Settings** section of **nsg-1**.

1. In **Inbound security rules** page, select **+ Add**.

1. Create a security rule that allows ports 80 and 443 to the **asg-web** application security group. In **Add inbound security rule** page, enter or select the following information:

   | Setting                                 | Value                                  |
   | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
   | Source                                  | Leave the default of **Any**.          |
   | Source port ranges                      | Leave the default of **(\*)**.         |
   | Destination                             | Select **Application security group**. |
   | Destination application security groups | Select **asg-web**.                    |
   | Service                                 | Leave the default of **Custom**.       |
   | Destination port ranges                 | Enter **80,443**.                      |
   | Protocol                                | Select **TCP**.                        |
   | Action                                  | Leave the default of **Allow**.        |
   | Priority                                | Leave the default of **100**.          |
   | Name                                    | Enter **allow-web-all**.               |

1. Select **Add**.

1. Complete the previous steps with the following information:

   | Setting                                | Value                                  |
   | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
   | Source                                 | Leave the default of **Any**.          |
   | Source port ranges                     | Leave the default of **(\*)**.         |
   | Destination                            | Select **Application security group**. |
   | Destination application security group | Select **asg-mgmt**.                   |
   | Service                                | Select **RDP**.                        |
   | Action                                 | Leave the default of **Allow**.        |
   | Priority                               | Leave the default of **110**.          |
   | Name                                   | Enter _allow-rdp-all_.                 |

1. Select **Add**.

> [!CAUTION]
> In this article, RDP (port 3389) is exposed to the internet for the VM that is assigned to the **asg-mgmt** application security group.
>
> For production environments, instead of exposing port 3389 to the internet, it's recommended that you connect to Azure resources that you want to manage using a VPN, private network connection, or Azure Bastion.
>
> For more information on Azure Bastion, see [What is Azure Bastion?](../bastion/bastion-overview.md).

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Create a security rule with [New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworksecurityruleconfig). The following example creates a rule that allows traffic inbound from the internet to the _asg-web_ application security group over ports 80 and 443:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$webAsgParams = @{
    Name = "asg-web"
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
}
$webAsg = Get-AzApplicationSecurityGroup @webAsgParams

$webRuleParams = @{
    Name = "Allow-Web-All"
    Access = "Allow"
    Protocol = "Tcp"
    Direction = "Inbound"
    Priority = 100
    SourceAddressPrefix = "Internet"
    SourcePortRange = "*"
    DestinationApplicationSecurityGroupId = $webAsg.id
    DestinationPortRange = 80,443
}
$webRule = New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig @webRuleParams
```

The following example creates a rule that allows traffic inbound from the internet to the *asg-mgmt* application security group over port 3389:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$mgmtAsgParams = @{
    Name = "asg-mgmt"
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
}
$mgmtAsg = Get-AzApplicationSecurityGroup @mgmtAsgParams

$mgmtRuleParams = @{
    Name = "Allow-RDP-All"
    Access = "Allow"
    Protocol = "Tcp"
    Direction = "Inbound"
    Priority = 110
    SourceAddressPrefix = "Internet"
    SourcePortRange = "*"
    DestinationApplicationSecurityGroupId = $mgmtAsg.id
    DestinationPortRange = 3389
}
$mgmtRule = New-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig @mgmtRuleParams
```

Use [Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup](/powershell/module/az.network/get-aznetworksecuritygroup) to retrieve the existing network security group, and then add the new rules with the `+=` operator. Finally, update the network security group with [Set-AzNetworkSecurityGroup](/powershell/module/az.network/set-aznetworksecuritygroup):

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Retrieve the existing network security group
$nsg = Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -Name "nsg-1" -ResourceGroupName "test-rg"

# Add the new rules to the security group
$nsg.SecurityRules += $webRule
$nsg.SecurityRules += $mgmtRule

# Update the network security group with the new rules
Set-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -NetworkSecurityGroup $nsg
```

> [!CAUTION]
> In this article, RDP (port 3389) is exposed to the internet for the VM that is assigned to the **asg-mgmt** application security group.
>
> For production environments, instead of exposing port 3389 to the internet, it's recommended that you connect to Azure resources that you want to manage using a VPN, private network connection, or Azure Bastion.
>
> For more information on Azure Bastion, see [What is Azure Bastion?](../bastion/bastion-overview.md).

### [CLI](#tab/cli)

Create a security rule with [az network nsg rule create](/cli/azure/network/nsg/rule). The following example creates a rule that allows traffic inbound from the internet to the *asg-web* application security group over ports 80 and 443:

```azurecli-interactive
az network nsg rule create \
  --resource-group test-rg \
  --nsg-name nsg-1 \
  --name Allow-Web-All \
  --access Allow \
  --protocol Tcp \
  --direction Inbound \
  --priority 100 \
  --source-address-prefix Internet \
  --source-port-range "*" \
  --destination-asgs "asg-web" \
  --destination-port-range 80 443
```

The following example creates a rule that allows traffic inbound from the Internet to the *asg-mgmt* application security group over port 22:

```azurecli-interactive
az network nsg rule create \
  --resource-group test-rg \
  --nsg-name nsg-1 \
  --name Allow-SSH-All \
  --access Allow \
  --protocol Tcp \
  --direction Inbound \
  --priority 110 \
  --source-address-prefix Internet \
  --source-port-range "*" \
  --destination-asgs "asg-mgmt" \
  --destination-port-range 22
```

> [!CAUTION]
> In this article, SSH (port 22) is exposed to the internet for the VM that is assigned to the **asg-mgmt** application security group.
>
> For production environments, instead of exposing port 22 to the internet, it's recommended that you connect to Azure resources that you want to manage using a VPN, private network connection, or Azure Bastion.

1. Select the **Review + create** tab, or select the blue **Review + create** button at the bottom of the page.

1. Select **Create**. The VM might take a few minutes to deploy.

1. Repeat the previous steps to create a second virtual machine named **vm-mgmt**.

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Before creating the VMs, retrieve the virtual network object with the subnet with [Get-AzVirtualNetwork](/powershell/module/az.network/get-azvirtualnetwork):

```powershell-interactive
$virtualNetworkParams = @{
    Name = "vnet-1"
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
}
$virtualNetwork = Get-AzVirtualNetwork @virtualNetworkParams
```

Create a public IP address for each VM with [New-AzPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azpublicipaddress):

```powershell-interactive
$publicIpWebParams = @{
    AllocationMethod = "Static"
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Location = "westus2"
    Name = "public-ip-vm-web"
}
$publicIpWeb = New-AzPublicIpAddress @publicIpWebParams

$publicIpMgmtParams = @{
    AllocationMethod = "Static"
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Location = "westus2"
    Name = "public-ip-vm-mgmt"
}
$publicIpMgmt = New-AzPublicIpAddress @publicIpMgmtParams
```

Create two network interfaces with [New-AzNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworkinterface), and assign a public IP address to the network interface. The following example creates a network interface, associates the _public-ip-vm-web_ public IP address to it.

```powershell-interactive
$webNicParams = @{
    Location = "westus2"
    Name = "vm-web-nic"
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    SubnetId = $virtualNetwork.Subnets[0].Id
    PublicIpAddressId = $publicIpWeb.Id
}
$webNic = New-AzNetworkInterface @webNicParams
```

The following example creates a network interface, associates the _public-ip-vm-mgmt_ public IP address to it.

```powershell-interactive
$mgmtNicParams = @{
    Location = "westus2"
    Name = "vm-mgmt-nic"
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    SubnetId = $virtualNetwork.Subnets[0].Id
    PublicIpAddressId = $publicIpMgmt.Id
}
$mgmtNic = New-AzNetworkInterface @mgmtNicParams
```

Create two VMs in the virtual network so you can validate traffic filtering in a later step.

Create a VM configuration with [New-AzVMConfig](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvmconfig), then create the VM with [New-AzVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvm). The following example creates a VM that serves as a web server. The `-AsJob` option creates the VM in the background, so you can continue to the next step:

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Create user object
$cred = Get-Credential -Message "Enter a username and password for the virtual machine."

$webVmConfigParams = @{
    VMName = "vm-web"
    VMSize = "Standard_DS1_V2"
}

$vmOSParams = @{
    ComputerName = "vm-web"
    Credential = $cred
}

$vmImageParams = @{
    PublisherName = "MicrosoftWindowsServer"
    Offer = "WindowsServer"
    Skus = "2022-Datacenter"
    Version = "latest"
}

$webVmConfig = New-AzVMConfig @webVmConfigParams | Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -Windows @vmOSParams | Set-AzVMSourceImage @vmImageParams | Add-AzVMNetworkInterface -Id $webNic.Id

$webVmParams = @{
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Location = "westus2"
    VM = $webVmConfig
}

New-AzVM @webVmParams -AsJob
```

Create a VM to serve as a management server:

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Create user object
$cred = Get-Credential -Message "Enter a username and password for the virtual machine."

$webVmConfigParams = @{
    VMName = "vm-mgmt"
    VMSize = "Standard_DS1_V2"
}

$vmOSParams = @{
    ComputerName = "vm-mgmt"
    Credential = $cred
}

$vmImageParams = @{
    PublisherName = "MicrosoftWindowsServer"
    Offer = "WindowsServer"
    Skus = "2022-Datacenter"
    Version = "latest"
}

$mgmtVmConfig = New-AzVMConfig @webVmConfigParams | Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -Windows @vmOSParams | Set-AzVMSourceImage @vmImageParams | Add-AzVMNetworkInterface -Id $mgmtNic.Id

$mgmtVmParams = @{
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Location = "westus2"
    VM = $mgmtVmConfig
}

New-AzVM @mgmtVmParams
```

The virtual machine takes a few minutes to create. Don't continue with the next step until Azure finishes creating the VM.

### [CLI](#tab/cli)

Create two VMs in the virtual network so you can validate traffic filtering in a later step. 

Create a VM with [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm). The following example creates a VM that serves as a web server. The `--nsg ""` option is specified to prevent Azure from creating a default network security group for the network interface Azure creates when it creates the VM. The command prompts you to create a password for the VM. SSH keys aren't used in this example to facilitate the later steps in this article. In a production environment, use SSH keys for security.

```azurecli-interactive
az vm create \
  --resource-group test-rg \
  --name vm-web \
  --image Ubuntu2204 \
  --vnet-name vnet-1 \
  --subnet subnet-1 \
  --nsg "" \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --authentication-type password \
  --assign-identity
```

The VM takes a few minutes to create. After the VM is created, output similar to the following example is returned: 

```output
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/test-rg/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm-web",
  "location": "westus2",
  "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-23-9A-49",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "203.0.113.24",
  "resourceGroup": "test-rg"
}
```

Create a VM with [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm). The following example creates a VM that serves as a management server. 

The following example creates a VM and adds a user account. The `--generate-ssh-keys` parameter causes the CLI to look for an available ssh key in `~/.ssh`. If one is found, that key is used. If not, one is generated and stored in `~/.ssh`. Finally, we deploy the latest `Ubuntu 22.04` image.

```azurecli-interactive
az vm create \
  --resource-group test-rg \
  --name vm-mgmt \
  --image Ubuntu2204 \
  --vnet-name vnet-1 \
  --subnet subnet-1 \
  --nsg "" \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --generate-ssh-keys \
  --assign-identity
```

The VM takes a few minutes to create. Don't continue with the next step until Azure finishes creating the VM.

## Associate network interfaces to an ASG

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

When you created the VMs, Azure created a network interface for each VM, and attached it to the VM.

Add the network interface of each VM to one of the application security groups you created previously:

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machine**. Select **Virtual machines** in the search results, then select **vm-web**.

1. Select **Application security groups** from the **Networking** section of **vm-web**.

1. Select **Add application security groups**, then in the **Add application security groups** tab, select **asg-web**. Finally, select **Add**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-filter-network-traffic/configure-app-sec-groups.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Configure application security groups." border="true" lightbox="./media/tutorial-filter-network-traffic/configure-app-sec-groups.png":::

1. Repeat the previous steps for **vm-mgmt**, selecting **asg-mgmt** in the **Add application security groups** tab.

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Use [Get-AzNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.network/get-aznetworkinterface) to retrieve the network interface of the virtual machine, and then use [Get-AzApplicationSecurityGroup](/powershell/module/az.network/get-azapplicationsecuritygroup) to retrieve the application security group. Finally, use [Set-AzNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.network/set-aznetworkinterface) to associate the application security group with the network interface. The following example associates the _asg-web_ application security group with the _vm-web-nic_ network interface:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$params1 = @{
    Name = "vm-web-nic"
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
}
$nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface @params1

$params2 = @{
    Name = "asg-web"
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
}
$asg = Get-AzApplicationSecurityGroup @params2

$nic.IpConfigurations[0].ApplicationSecurityGroups = @($asg)

$params3 = @{
    NetworkInterface = $nic
}
Set-AzNetworkInterface @params3
```

Repeat the command to associate the _asg-mgmt_ application security group with the _vm-mgmt-nic_ network interface.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$params1 = @{
    Name = "vm-mgmt-nic"
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
}
$nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface @params1

$params2 = @{
    Name = "asg-mgmt"
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
}
$asg = Get-AzApplicationSecurityGroup @params2

$nic.IpConfigurations[0].ApplicationSecurityGroups = @($asg)

$params3 = @{
    NetworkInterface = $nic
}
Set-AzNetworkInterface @params3
```

### [CLI](#tab/cli)

Use [az network nic update](/cli/azure/network/nic) to associate the network interface with the application security group. The following example associates the *asg-web* application security group with the *vm-web-nic* network interface:

```azurecli-interactive
# Retrieve the network interface name associated with the virtual machine
nic_name=$(az vm show --resource-group test-rg --name vm-web --query 'networkProfile.networkInterfaces[0].id' -o tsv | xargs basename)

# Associate the application security group with the network interface
az network nic ip-config update \
    --name ipconfigvm-web \
    --nic-name $nic_name \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --application-security-groups asg-web
```

Repeat the command to associate the *asg-mgmt* application security group with the *vm-mgmt-nic* network interface.

```azurecli-interactive
# Retrieve the network interface name associated with the virtual machine
nic_name=$(az vm show --resource-group test-rg --name vm-mgmt --query 'networkProfile.networkInterfaces[0].id' -o tsv | xargs basename)

# Associate the application security group with the network interface
az network nic ip-config update \
    --name ipconfigvm-mgmt \
    --nic-name $nic_name \
    --resource-group test-rg \
    --application-security-groups asg-mgmt
```

---

## Test traffic filters

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machine**. Select **Virtual machines** in the search results.

1. Select **vm-mgmt**.

1. On the **Overview** page, select the **Connect** button and then select **Native RDP**.

1. Select **Download RDP file**.

1. Open the downloaded rdp file and select **Connect**. Enter the username and password you specified when creating the VM.

1. Select **OK**.

1. You might receive a certificate warning during the connection process. If you receive the warning, select **Yes** or **Continue**, to continue with the connection.

   The connection succeeds, because inbound traffic from the internet to the **asg-mgmt** application security group is allowed through port 3389.

   The network interface for **vm-mgmt** is associated with the **asg-mgmt** application security group and allows the connection.

1. Open a PowerShell session on **vm-mgmt**. Connect to **vm-web** using the following:

   ```powershell
   mstsc /v:vm-web
   ```

   The RDP connection from **vm-mgmt** to **vm-web** succeeds because virtual machines in the same network can communicate with each other over any port by default.

   You can't create an RDP connection to the **vm-web** virtual machine from the internet. The security rule for the **asg-web** prevents connections to port 3389 inbound from the internet. Inbound traffic from the Internet is denied to all resources by default.

1. To install Microsoft IIS on the **vm-web** virtual machine, enter the following command from a PowerShell session on the **vm-web** virtual machine:

   ```powershell
   Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools
   ```

1. After the IIS installation is complete, disconnect from the **vm-web** virtual machine, which leaves you in the **vm-mgmt** virtual machine remote desktop connection.

1. Disconnect from the **vm-mgmt** VM.

1. Search for **vm-web** in the portal search box.

1. On the **Overview** page of **vm-web**, note the **Public IP address** for your VM. The address shown in the following example is 203.0.113.103. Your address is different:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-filter-network-traffic/public-ip-address.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Public IP address of a virtual machine in the Overview page." border="true" lightbox="./media/tutorial-filter-network-traffic/public-ip-address.png":::

1. To confirm that you can access the **vm-web** web server from the internet, open an internet browser on your computer and browse to `http://<public-ip-address-from-previous-step>`.

You see the IIS default page, because inbound traffic from the internet to the **asg-web** application security group is allowed through port 80.

The network interface attached for **vm-web** is associated with the **asg-web** application security group and allows the connection.

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Use [Get-AzPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/az.network/get-azpublicipaddress) to return the public IP address of a VM. The following example returns the public IP address of the _vm-mgmt_ VM:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$params = @{
    Name = "public-ip-vm-mgmt"
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
}
$publicIP = Get-AzPublicIpAddress @params | Select IpAddress
```

Use the following command to create a remote desktop session with the _vm-mgmt_ VM from your local computer.

```
mstsc /v:$publicIP
```

Enter the user name and password you specified when creating the VM (you might need to select **More choices**, then **Use a different account**, to specify the credentials you entered when you created the VM), then select **OK**. You might receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. Select **Yes** to proceed with the connection.

The connection succeeds. Port 3389 is allowed inbound from the internet to the _asg-mgmt_ application security group. The network interface attached to the _vm-mgmt_ VM is in this group.

Use the following command to create a remote desktop connection to the _vm-web_ VM, from the _vm-mgmt_ VM, with the following command, from PowerShell:

```
mstsc /v:vm-web
```

The connection succeeds because a default security rule within each network security group allows traffic over all ports between all IP addresses within a virtual network. You can't create a remote desktop connection to the _vm-web_ VM from the internet because the security rule for the _asg-web_ doesn't allow port 3389 inbound from the internet.

Use the following command to install Microsoft IIS on the _vm-web_ VM from PowerShell:

```powershell
Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools
```

After the IIS installation is complete, disconnect from the _vm-web_ VM, which leaves you in the _vm-mgmt_ VM remote desktop connection. To view the IIS welcome screen, open an internet browser and browse to http://vm-web.

Disconnect from the _vm-mgmt_ VM.

On your computer, enter the following command from PowerShell to retrieve the public IP address of the _vm-web_ server:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$params = @{
    Name = "public-ip-vm-web"
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
}
Get-AzPublicIpAddress @params | Select IpAddress
```

To confirm that you can access the _vm-web_ web server from outside of Azure, open an internet browser on your computer and browse to `http://<public-ip-address-from-previous-step>`. The connection succeeds. Port 80 is allowed inbound from the internet to the _asg-web_ application security group. The network interface attached to the _vm-web_ VM is in this group.

### [CLI](#tab/cli)

Using an SSH client of your choice, connect to the VMs created previously. For example, the following command can be used from a command line interface such as [Windows Subsystem for Linux](/windows/wsl/install) to create an SSH session with the *vm-mgmt* VM. You can sign-in to the virtual machines using your Microsoft Entra ID credentials or you can use the SSH key that you used to create the VMs. In the following example, we use the SSH key to sign in to management VM and then sign in to the web VM from the management VM with a password.

For more information about how to SSH to a Linux VM and sign in with Microsoft Entra ID, see [Sign in to a Linux virtual machine in Azure by using Microsoft Entra ID and OpenSSH](/entra/identity/devices/howto-vm-sign-in-azure-ad-linux).

### Store IP address of VM in order to SSH

Run the following command to store the IP address of the VM as an environment variable:

```bash
export IP_ADDRESS=$(az vm show --show-details --resource-group test-rg --name vm-mgmt --query publicIps --output tsv)
```

```bash
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@$IP_ADDRESS
```

The connection succeeds because the network interface attached to the *vm-mgmt* VM is in the *asg-mgmt* application security group, which allows port 22 inbound from the Internet.

Use the following command to SSH to the *vm-web* VM from the *vm-mgmt* VM:

```bash 
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@vm-web
```

The connection succeeds because a default security rule within each network security group allows traffic over all ports between all IP addresses within a virtual network. You can't SSH to the *vm-web* VM from the Internet because the security rule for the *asg-web* doesn't allow port 22 inbound from the Internet.

Use the following commands to install the nginx web server on the *vm-web* VM:

```bash 
# Update package source
sudo apt-get -y update

# Install NGINX
sudo apt-get -y install nginx
```

The *vm-web* VM is allowed outbound to the Internet to retrieve nginx because a default security rule allows all outbound traffic to the Internet. Exit the *vm-web* SSH session, which leaves you at the `username@vm-mgmt:~$` prompt of the *vm-mgmt* VM. To retrieve the nginx welcome screen from the *vm-web* VM, enter the following command:

```bash
curl vm-web
```

Sign out of the *vm-mgmt* VM. To confirm that you can access the *vm-web* web server from outside of Azure, enter `curl <publicIpAddress>` from your own computer. The connection succeeds because the *asg-web* application security group, which the network interface attached to the *vm-web* VM is in, allows port 80 inbound from the Internet.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you:

- Created a network security group and associated it to a virtual network subnet.
- Created application security groups for web and management.
- Created two virtual machines and associated their network interfaces with the application security groups.
- Tested the application security group network filtering.

To learn more about network security groups, see [Network security group overview](./network-security-groups-overview.md) and [Manage a network security group](manage-network-security-group.md).

Azure routes traffic between subnets by default. You might instead, choose to route traffic between subnets through a VM, serving as a firewall, for example.

To learn how to create a route table, advance to the next tutorial.
