# Release notes 2026: Azure Health Data Services

Release notes describe features, enhancements, and bug fixes released in 2026 for the FHIR&reg; service and DICOM&reg; service in Azure Health Data Services.

## February 2026
### FHIR service
**Metadata-only updates and versioning configuration with `$bulk-update`**: Introduced new query parameter "_meta-history" for bulk update when versioning policy is set to either "versioned" or "version-update". The new query parameter is used to configure whether or not the old version is saved as a historical record. "_meta-history=true" is the default. By default, the resource version is incremented, a new version is created, and the old version is saved as a historical record. "_meta-history=false" can be configured so that the resource version is incremented, a new version is created, but the old version isn't saved as a historical record. For more information, visit [metadata-only updates and versioning](./fhir/fhir-versioning-policy-and-history-management.md#metadata-only-updates-and-versioning).  

#### Bug fixes:

**Bug fix for `$bulk-delete` queries with paged results exceeding 100 included items**: There was an issue where some `$bulk-delete` queries that return paged results exceeding 1,000 included items with related links could return an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error. The issue is fixed, and the results are returned correctly now.

**Bug fix for queries combining `_include` and `_revinclude`**: There was an issue where queries combining `_include` and `_revinclude` (for example, `GET /Patient?_include=Patient:organization&_revinclude=Observation:patient`) could return an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error. This issue is fixed, and results are returned correctly now.

**Pagination bug in FHIR search fix**: There was an issue where a pagination bug in FHIR search queries caused resources to be intermittently skipped when results span multiple pages and use continuation tokens. The issue is fixed.

**Allow `_meta-history` in transaction bundles**: Previously, there was a limitation where `_meta-history` parameter was not working in [transaction bundles](./fhir/rest-api-capabilities.md#batch-and-transaction-bundles). This issue has been fixed, and the `_meta-history` parameter can now be used in transaction bundles.

**Soft deletes in transaction bundles**: For a [transaction bundle](./fhir/rest-api-capabilities.md#batch-and-transaction-bundles), all supported interactions or operations either succeed or fail together. When a transaction bundle fails, the FHIR service returns a single OperationOutcome. Previously, there was an issue where soft delete operations were not being considered for the transaction bundle scope, which could cause a discrepancy in the all-or-nothing behavior of the transaction bundle if soft delete operations were part of the transaction bundle. The issue has been fixed. 

## January 2026
### FHIR service

**Metadata-only updates and versioning configuration with PATCH**: Introduced new query parameter "_meta-history" for PATCH updates when versioning policy is set to either "versioned" or "version-update." The new query is used to configure whether or not the old version is saved as a historical record. "_meta-history = true" is the default. By default, the resource version is incremented, a new version is created, and the old version is saved as a historical record. "_meta-history=false" can be configured so that the resource version is incremented, a new version is created, but the old version isn't saved as a historical record. For more information, visit [metadata-only updates and versioning](./fhir/fhir-versioning-policy-and-history-management.md#metadata-only-updates-and-versioning).

**Updates to responses for update and deletion of FHIR spec-defined search parameters**: There are a few updates to the behaviors and responses for update and deletion of FHIR spec-defined search parameters:
  - Deletion of out-of-box FHIR spec-defined search parameters previously returned a "204 No Content" and the parameter wasn't deleted. The response is updated to correctly return "405 Method Not Allowed."
  - Update of out-of-box FHIR spec-defined search parameters previously returned "201 Created," which can cause unintended behavior. The response is updated to return "405 Method Not Allowed." If you wish to update an out-of-box FHIR spec-defined search parameter, create a new custom search parameter with a different URL.

**Enhanced response logging for deletion of non-existent search parameters**:  Deletion of nonexistent search parameters previously returned a "204 No Content." The response is improved to be more informative and now returns "404 Not Found."

**Improved error handling for PATCH requests with an empty body**:  Previously, [PATCH](./fhir/rest-api-capabilities.md#patch-and-conditional-patch) requests sent to the FHIR with an empty body returned "HTTP 500 Internal Server Error." The error is improved to return "HTTP 400 Bad Request" with more informative messaging to inform users that Content-Type and body are required.

**Improved capability statement refresh after profile updates**: Improved latency for profile updates to reflect in the Capability Statement.

#### Bug fixes:

**Bug fix for duplicate IDs used in search**: There was a regression where searching for duplicate IDs with `_id` and no other search parameters would return an "HTTP 500 Internal Server Error". This issue has been fixed, and correct search results are now returned.

**Bug fix for `_sort` with multiple _include/_revinclude parameters**: Resolved issue where using multiple `_include`/`_revinclude` parameters in a search with `_sort` could lead to the includes continuation tokens to get into an infinite loop if there are more than two pages of results. This issue is fixed, and the includes continuation tokens are correct now. 

**Bug fix for profile version in capability statement**: The [capability statement](./fhir/store-profiles-in-fhir.md#profiles-in-the-capability-statement) lists details of the stored profiles on the FHIR server. There was a bug where the capability statement wasn't showing the profile version that is currently loaded into the FHIR server. The issue is fixed, and the capability statement now correctly states the profile version that is loaded on the FHIR server.
