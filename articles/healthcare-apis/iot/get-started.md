# Get started with the MedTech service 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of 2/26/2025 the MedTech service will no longer be available in the following regions: UK West, UAE North, South Africa North, Qatar Central.

This article and diagram outlines the basic steps to get started with the MedTech service in the [Azure Health Data Services](../healthcare-apis-overview.md). These steps might help you to assess the [MedTech service deployment methods](deploy-choose-method.md) and determine which deployment method is best for you.

As a prerequisite, you need an Azure subscription and granted the proper permissions to deploy Azure resource groups and resources. You can follow all the steps, or skip some if you have an existing environment. Also, you can combine all the steps and complete them in Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API scripts.

> [!TIP]
> See the MedTech service article, [Choose a deployment method for the MedTech service](deploy-choose-method.md), for a description of the different deployment methods that can help to simplify and automate the deployment of the MedTech service.

## Deploy resources

After you obtain the required subscription prerequisites, the first step is to deploy the MedTech service prerequisite resources:

* Azure resource group.
* Azure Event Hubs namespace and event hub.
* Azure Health Data Services workspace.
* Azure Health Data Service FHIR&reg; service.

Once the prerequisite resources are available, deploy:
 
* Azure Health Data Services MedTech service.

### Deploy a resource group 

Deploy a [resource group](../../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal.md) to contain the prerequisite resources and the MedTech service.

### Deploy an Event Hubs namespace and event hub

Deploy an Event Hubs namespace into the resource group. Event Hubs namespaces are logical containers for event hubs. Once the namespace is deployed, you can deploy an event hub, which the MedTech service reads device messages from. For information about deploying Event Hubs namespaces and event hubs, see [Create an event hub using Azure portal](../../event-hubs/event-hubs-create.md).

### Deploy an Azure Health Data Services workspace

 Deploy an [Azure Health Data Services workspace](../workspace-overview.md). After you create an Azure Health Data Services workspace using the [Azure portal](../healthcare-apis-quickstart.md), a FHIR service and MedTech service can be deployed from the Azure Health Data Services workspace.

### Deploy a FHIR service

Deploy a [FHIR service](../fhir/fhir-portal-quickstart.md) into your resource group using your workspace. The MedTech service persists transformed device data into the FHIR service. 

### Deploy a MedTech service

If you successfully deployed the prerequisite resources, you're now ready to deploy the [MedTech service](deploy-manual-portal.md) using your workspace.
