# How to enable diagnostic settings for the MedTech service

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of 2/26/2025 the MedTech service will no longer be available in the following regions: UK West, UAE North, South Africa North, Qatar Central.

In this article, learn how to enable diagnostic settings for the MedTech service to:

* Create a diagnostic setting to export logs and metrics for audit, analysis, or troubleshooting of the MedTech service.
* Use the Azure Log Analytics workspace to view the MedTech service logs.
* Access the MedTech service predefined Azure Log Analytics queries.

## Create a diagnostic setting for the MedTech service

1. To enable logs and metrics export for your MedTech service, select **MedTech service** in your workspace under **Services**.
 
   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/select-medtech-service-in-workspace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of select the MedTech service within workspace." lightbox="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/select-medtech-service-in-workspace.png":::

2. Select the MedTech service that you want to enable a diagnostic setting for. In this example, we'll be using a MedTech service named *mt-azuredocsdemo*. You'll be selecting a MedTech service within your own Azure Health Data Services workspace.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/select-medtech-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of select the MedTech service for exporting metrics." lightbox="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/select-medtech-service.png":::

3. Select the **Diagnostic settings** option under **Monitoring**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/select-diagnostic-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of select the Diagnostic settings." lightbox="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/select-diagnostic-settings.png"::: 

4. Select the **+ Add diagnostic setting** option.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/add-diagnostic-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of select the + Add diagnostic setting." lightbox="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/add-diagnostic-settings.png"::: 

5. The **+ Add diagnostic setting** page will open, requiring configuration information from you.  

   1. Enter a display name in the **Diagnostic setting name** box. For this example, we'll name it *MedTech_service_All_Logs_and_Metrics*. You'll enter a display name of your own choosing.  
   
   2. Under **Logs**, select the **AllLogs** option.
   
   3. Under **Metrics**, select the **AllMetrics** option.

      > [!Note]
      > To view a complete list of MedTech service metrics associated with **AllMetrics**, see [Supported metrics with Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported#microsofthealthcareapisworkspacesiotconnectors). 

   4. Under **Destination details**, select the destination or destinations you want to use for your exported MedTech service logs and metrics. In this example, we've selected an Azure Log Analytics workspace named *la-azuredocsdemo*. You'll select a destination of your own choosing.
   
      > [!Important]
      > Each **Destination details** selection requires that certain resources (for example, an existing Azure Log Analytics workspace or storage account) be created and available before the selection can be successfully configured. Choose each selection to see which resources are required.
      >
      > For a successful configuration, you should only have a single destination per **diagnostic setting**.

      Metrics can be exported to the following destinations:

      |Destination|Description|
      |-----------|-----------|
      |[Azure Log Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview)|Metrics are converted to log form. Sending the metrics to the Azure Monitor Logs store (which is searchable via Log Analytics) enables you to integrate them into queries, alerts, and visualizations with existing log data.|
      |[Azure storage account](../../storage/index.yml)|Archiving logs and metrics to an Azure storage account is useful for audit, static analysis, or backup. Compared to Azure Monitor Logs and a Log Analytics workspace, Azure storage is less expensive, and logs can be kept there indefinitely.|
      |[Azure event hub](../../event-hubs/index.yml)|Sending logs and metrics to an event hub allows you to stream data to external systems such as third-party Security Information and Event Managements (SIEMs) and other Log Analytics solutions.|
      |Azure Monitor partner integrations|Specialized integrations between Azure Monitor and other non-Microsoft monitoring platforms. Useful when you're already using one of the partners.|

   5. Select the **Save** option to save your diagnostic setting selections.
   
      :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/select-all-logs-and-metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of diagnostic setting and required fields." lightbox="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/select-all-logs-and-metrics.png":::  

6. Once you've selected the **Save** option, the page will display a message that the diagnostic setting for your MedTech service has been saved successfully.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/diagnostic-settings-successfully-saved.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a successful diagnostic setting save." lightbox="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/diagnostic-settings-successfully-saved.png"::: 

   > [!Note] 
   > It might take up to 15 minutes for the first MedTech service logs and metrics to display in the destination of your choice.

7. To view your saved diagnostic setting, select **Diagnostic settings**.

## Use the Azure Log Analytics workspace to view the MedTech service logs

If you choose to include your Log Analytics workspace as a destination option for your diagnostic setting, you can view the logs within **Logs** in your MedTech service. If there are any logs, they'll be a result of exceptions for your MedTech service (for example: *HealthCheck* exceptions).

1. To access your Log Analytics workspace, select the **Logs** button within your MedTech service.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/select-logs-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of logs option." lightbox="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/select-logs-button.png":::

2. Copy the below table query string into your Log Analytics workspace query area and select **Run**. Using the *AHDSMedTechDiagnosticLogs* table will provide you with all logs contained in the entire table for the selected **Time range** setting (the default value is **Last 24 hours**). The MedTech service provides five predefined queries that will be addressed in the article section titled [Accessing the MedTech service predefined Azure Log Analytics queries](#accessing-the-medtech-service-predefined-azure-log-analytics-queries).

   ```Kusto
   AHDSMedTechDiagnosticLogs
   ```
   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/select-run-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot of query run option." lightbox="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/select-run-query.png":::

3. If your MedTech service is configured correctly and healthy, then the query should come back with no error logs.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/query-result-clean.png" alt-text="Screenshot of query with no health issues." lightbox="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/query-result-clean.png":::

4. If your MedTech service is misconfigured or unhealthy, then the query will come back with error logs.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/query-result-with-errors.png" alt-text="Screenshot of query with health issues." lightbox="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/query-result-with-errors.png":::

5. Select the down arrow in one of the error logs to display the full error log message, which can be used to help troubleshoot issues with your MedTech service. In this example, the error log message shows that the MedTech service wasn't able to authenticate with the FHIR&reg; service.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/display-log-error-message.png" alt-text="Screenshot of log error message." lightbox="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/display-log-error-message.png":::

6. Once you've resolved the issue, you can adjust the **Time range** setting (for this example, we'll be using **Last 30 minutes**) and select **Run** to see that the error logs have cleared for the issue that you resolved with your MedTech service.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/clean-query-result-post-error-fix.png" alt-text="Screenshot of query after fixing error." lightbox="media/how-to-enable-diagnostic-settings/clean-query-result-post-error-fix.png":::

> [!WARNING]
> The above custom query is not saved and will have to be recreated if you leave your Log Analytics workspace without saving the custom query.
>
> To learn how to save a custom query in Log Analytics, see [Save a query in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/save-query)
