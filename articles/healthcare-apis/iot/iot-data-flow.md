# MedTech service data flow

This article provides an overview of the MedTech service data flow. You'll learn about the different data processing stages within the MedTech service that transforms device data into Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;)-based [Observation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html) resources.

Data from health-related devices or medical devices flows through a path in which the MedTech service transforms data into FHIR, and then data is stored on and accessed from the FHIR service. The health data path follows these steps in this order: ingest, normalize, group, transform, and persist. Health data is retrieved from the device in the first step of ingestion. After the data is received, it's processed, or normalized per a user-selected/user-created schema template called the device mapping. Normalized health data is simpler to process and can be grouped. In the next step, health data is grouped into three Operate parameters. After the health data is normalized and grouped, it can be processed or transformed through a FHIR destination mapping, and then saved or persisted on the FHIR service.

This article goes into more depth about each step in the data flow. The next steps are [Deploy the MedTech service using the Azure portal](deploy-iot-connector-in-azure.md) by using a device mapping (the normalization step) and a FHIR destination mapping (the transformation step).

This next section of the article describes the stages that IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) device data goes through as it processed through the MedTech service.

## Ingest
Ingest is the first stage where device data is received into the MedTech service. The ingestion endpoint for device data is hosted on an [Azure Event Hubs](../../event-hubs/index.yml). The Azure Event Hubs platform supports high scale and throughput with ability to receive and process millions of messages per second. It also enables the MedTech service to consume messages asynchronously, removing the need for devices to wait while device data gets processed.

> JSON is the only supported format at this time for device data.

## Normalize
Normalize is the next stage where device data is retrieved from the above event hub and processed using the device mapping. This mapping process results in transforming device data into a normalized schema. 

The normalization process not only simplifies data processing at later stages but also provides the capability to project one input message into multiple normalized messages. For instance, a device could send multiple vital signs for body temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure, and respiration rate in a single message. This input message would create four separate FHIR resources. Each resource would represent different vital sign, with the input message projected into four different normalized messages.

## Group
Group is the next stage where the normalized messages available from the previous stage are grouped using three different parameters:

* Device identity
* Measurement type 
* Time period

Device identity and measurement type grouping enable use of [SampledData](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#SampledData) measurement type. This type provides a concise way to represent a time-based series of measurements from a device in FHIR. And time period controls the latency at which Observation resources generated by the MedTech service are written to FHIR service.

> The time period value is defaulted to 15 minutes and cannot be configured for preview.

## Transform
In the Transform stage, grouped-normalized messages are processed through FHIR destination mapping templates. Messages matching a template type get transformed into FHIR-based Observation resources as specified through the mapping.

At this point, [Device](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/device.html) resource, along with its associated [Patient](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html) resource, is also retrieved from the FHIR service using the device identifier present in the message. These resources are added as a reference to the Observation resource being created.

> [!NOTE]
>
> All identity look ups are cached once resolved to decrease load on the FHIR service. If you plan on reusing devices with multiple patients it is advised you create a virtual device resource that is specific to the patient and send virtual device identifier in the message payload. The virtual device can be linked to the actual device resource as a parent.

If no Device resource for a given device identifier exists in the FHIR service, the outcome depends upon the value of `Resolution Type` set at the time of creation. When set to `Lookup`, the specific message is ignored, and the pipeline will continue to process other incoming messages. If set to `Create`, the MedTech service will create a bare-bones Device and Patient resources on the FHIR service.  

## Persist
Once the Observation FHIR resource is generated in the Transform stage, the resource is saved into the FHIR service. If the Observation FHIR resource is new, it will be created on the FHIR service. If the Observation FHIR resource already existed, it will get updated.
