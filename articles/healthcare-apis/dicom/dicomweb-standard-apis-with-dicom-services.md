# Access DICOMweb APIs to manage DICOM data

The DICOM&reg; service allows you to store, review, search, and delete DICOM objects by using a subset of DICOMweb APIs. The DICOMweb APIs are web-based services that follow the DICOM standard. Using these APIs, you can access and manage your organization's DICOM data without requiring complex protocols or formats.

The supported services are:

- [Store (STOW-RS)](dicom-services-conformance-statement-v2.md#store-stow-rs): Upload DICOM objects to the server.
- [Retrieve (WADO-RS)](dicom-services-conformance-statement-v2.md#retrieve-wado-rs): Download DICOM objects from the server.
- [Search (QIDO-RS)](dicom-services-conformance-statement-v2.md#search-qido-rs): Find DICOM objects on the server based on criteria.
- [Delete](dicom-services-conformance-statement-v2.md#delete): Remove DICOM objects from the server.
- [Worklist Service (UPS Push and Pull SOPs)](dicom-services-conformance-statement-v2.md#worklist-service-ups-rs): Manage and track medical imaging workflows.

In addition to the subset of DICOMweb APIs, the DICOM service supports these custom APIs that are unique to Microsoft:

- [Change feed](change-feed-overview.md): Track changes to DICOM data over time.
- [Extended query tags](dicom-extended-query-tags-overview.md): Define custom tags for querying DICOM data.
- [Bulk update](update-files.md)
- [Bulk import](import-files.md)
- [Export](export-dicom-files.md)

## Prerequisites

- **Deploy an instance of the DICOM service**. For more information, see [Deploy the DICOM service using Azure portal](deploy-dicom-services-in-azure.md).

- **Find your Service URL**. Use Azure portal to navigate to the instance of the DICOM service to find the Service URL. The Service URL to access your DICOM service uses this format: ```https://<workspacename-dicomservicename>.dicom.azurehealthcareapis.com```. Make sure to specify the version as part of the URL when making requests. For more information, see [API versioning for the DICOM service](api-versioning-dicom-service.md).

## Use REST API methods to interact with the DICOM service

The DICOM service provides a web-based interface that follows REST (representational state transfer) principles. The REST API allows different applications or systems to communicate with each other using standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. To interact with the DICOM service, use any programming language that supports HTTP requests and responses.

Refer to the language-specific examples. You can view Postman collection examples in several languages including the following.

- Go 
- Java 
- JavaScript 
- C# 
- PHP 
- C 
- NodeJS
- Objective-C
- OCaml
- PowerShell
- Python
- Ruby 
- Swift

### C#

Refer to [Use DICOMweb Standard APIs with C#](dicomweb-standard-apis-c-sharp.md) to learn how to use C# with DICOM service.

### cURL

cURL is a common command-line tool for calling web endpoints and is available for most operating systems. To get started, [download cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html).

To learn how to use cURL with the DICOM service, see [Using DICOMWeb™ Standard APIs with cURL](dicomweb-standard-apis-curl.md).

### Python

For more information about how to use Python with the DICOM service, see [Using DICOMWeb™ Standard APIs with Python](dicomweb-standard-apis-python.md).

### Postman

Postman is an excellent tool for designing, building, and testing REST APIs. [Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to get started. For more information, see [Postman learning site](https://learning.postman.com/).

One important caution with Postman and the DICOMweb standard is that Postman only supports uploading DICOM files by using the single-part payload defined in the DICOM standard. This is because Postman can't support custom separators in a multipart/related POST request. For more information, see [Multipart POST not working for me # 576](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/576). All examples in the Postman collection for uploading DICOM documents by using a multipart request are prefixed with **[won't work - see description]**. The examples for uploading by using a single-part request are included in the collection and are prefixed with **Store-Single-Instance**.

To use the Postman collection, download it locally and then import the collection through Postman.
