# Use DICOMweb Standard APIs with Python

This article shows how to work with the DICOMweb service using Python and sample .dcm DICOM&reg; files.

Use these sample files:

- blue-circle.dcm
- dicom-metadata.csv
- green-square.dcm
- red-triangle.dcm

The filename, studyUID, seriesUID, and instanceUID of the sample DICOM files are:

| File | StudyUID | SeriesUID | InstanceUID |
| --- | --- | --- | ---|
|green-square.dcm|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.45787841905473114233124723359129632652|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.12714725698140337137334606354172323212|

> [!NOTE]
> Each of these files represents a single instance and is part of the same study. Also, the green-square and red-triangle are part of the same series, while the blue-circle is in a separate series.

## Prerequisites

To use the DICOMweb Standard APIs, you must have an instance of the DICOM service deployed. For more information, see [Deploy DICOM service using the Azure portal](deploy-dicom-services-in-azure.md).

After you deploy an instance of the DICOM service, retrieve the URL for your App service:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search **Recent resources** and select your DICOM service instance.
1. Copy the **Service URL** of your DICOM service. 
2. If you don't have a token, see [Get access token for the DICOM service using Azure CLI](dicom-get-access-token-azure-cli.md). 

For this code, you access a Public Preview Azure service. It's important that you don't upload any private health information (PHI).

## Work with the DICOM service

The DICOMweb Standard makes heavy use of `multipart/related` HTTP requests combined with DICOM specific accept headers. Developers familiar with other REST-based APIs often find working with the DICOMweb standard awkward. However, after it's up and running, it's easy to use. It just takes a little familiarity to get started.

### Import the Python libraries

First, import the necessary Python libraries.

We implement this example by using the synchronous `requests` library. For asynchronous support, consider using `httpx` or another async library. Additionally, we're importing two supporting functions from `urllib3` to support working with `multipart/related` requests.

Additionally, we're importing `DefaultAzureCredential` to log into Azure and get a token.

```python
import requests
import pydicom
from pathlib import Path
from urllib3.filepost import encode_multipart_formdata, choose_boundary
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
```

### Configure user-defined variables

Replace all variable values wrapped in { } with your own values. Additionally, validate that any constructed variables are correct.  For instance, `base_url` is constructed using the Service URL and then appended with the version of the REST API being used. The Service URL of your DICOM service is: ```https://<workspacename-dicomservicename>.dicom.azurehealthcareapis.com```. You can use the Azure portal to navigate to the DICOM service and obtain your Service URL. You can also visit the [API Versioning for DICOM service Documentation](api-versioning-dicom-service.md) for more information on versioning. If you're using a custom URL, you need to override that value with your own.

```python
dicom_service_name = "{server-name}"
path_to_dicoms_dir = "{path to the folder that includes green-square.dcm and other dcm files}"

base_url = f"{Service URL}/v{version}"

study_uid = "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420"; #StudyInstanceUID for all 3 examples
series_uid = "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.45787841905473114233124723359129632652"; #SeriesInstanceUID for green-square and red-triangle
instance_uid = "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.47359123102728459884412887463296905395"; #SOPInstanceUID for red-triangle
```

### Authenticate to Azure and get a token

`DefaultAzureCredential` allows us to use various ways to get tokens to log into the service. In this example, use the `AzureCliCredential` to get a token to log into the service. There are other credential providers such as `ManagedIdentityCredential` and `EnvironmentCredential` that you may use. To use the AzureCliCredential, you need to sign in to Azure from the CLI before running this code. For more information, see [Get access token for the DICOM service using Azure CLI](dicom-get-access-token-azure-cli.md). Alternatively, copy and paste the token retrieved while signing in from the CLI.

> [!NOTE]
> `DefaultAzureCredential` returns several different Credential objects. We reference the `AzureCliCredential` as the 5th item in the returned collection. This may not always be the case. If not, uncomment the `print(credential.credential)` line. This will list all the items. Find the correct index, recalling that Python uses zero-based indexing.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not logged into Azure using the CLI, this will fail. You must be logged into Azure from the CLI for this to work. 

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

#print(credential.credentials) # this can be used to find the index of the AzureCliCredential
token = credential.credentials[4].get_token('https://dicom.healthcareapis.azure.com')
bearer_token = f'Bearer {token.token}'
```

### Create supporting methods to support `multipart\related`

The `Requests` libraries (and most Python libraries) don't work with `multipart\related` in a way that supports DICOMweb. Because of these libraries, we must add a few methods to support working with DICOM files.

`encode_multipart_related` takes a set of fields (in the DICOM case, these libraries are generally Part 10 dam files) and an optional user-defined boundary. It returns both the full body, along with the content_type, which can be used.

```python
def encode_multipart_related(fields, boundary=None):
    if boundary is None:
        boundary = choose_boundary()

    body, _ = encode_multipart_formdata(fields, boundary)
    content_type = str('multipart/related; boundary=%s' % boundary)

    return body, content_type
```

### Create a `requests` session

Creates a `requests` session, called `client` that is used to communicate with the DICOM service.


```python
client = requests.session()
```

### Verify authentication is configured correctly

Call the changefeed API endpoint, which returns a 200 if authentication is successful.

```python
headers = {"Authorization":bearer_token}
url= f'{base_url}/changefeed'

response = client.get(url,headers=headers)
if (response.status_code != 200):
    print('Error! Likely not authenticated!')
```

## Upload DICOM instances (STOW)

The following examples highlight persisting DICOM files.

### Store instances using `multipart/related`

This example demonstrates how to upload a single DICOM file, and it uses Python to preload the DICOM file into memory as bytes. When an array of files is passed to the fields parameter `encode_multipart_related`, multiple files can be uploaded in a single POST. It's sometimes used to upload several instances inside a complete series or study.

_Details:_

* Path: ../studies
* Method: POST
* Headers:
    * Accept: application/dicom+json
    * Content-Type: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"
    * Authorization: Bearer $token"

* Body:
    * Content-Type: application/dicom for each file uploaded, separated by a boundary value

Some programming languages and tools behave differently. For example, some require you to define your own boundary. For those languages and tools, you might need to use a slightly modified Content-Type header. These languages and tools can be used successfully.
* Content-Type: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; boundary=ABCD1234
* Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary=ABCD1234
* Content-Type: multipart/related

```python
#upload blue-circle.dcm
filepath = Path(path_to_dicoms_dir).joinpath('blue-circle.dcm')

# Read through file and load bytes into memory 
with open(filepath,'rb') as reader:
    rawfile = reader.read()
files = {'file': ('dicomfile', rawfile, 'application/dicom')}

#encode as multipart_related
body, content_type = encode_multipart_related(fields = files)

headers = {'Accept':'application/dicom+json', "Content-Type":content_type, "Authorization":bearer_token}

url = f'{base_url}/studies'
response = client.post(url, body, headers=headers, verify=False)
```

### Store instances for a specific study

This example demonstrates how to upload multiple DICOM files into the specified study. It uses Python to preload the DICOM file into memory as bytes.  

When an array of files is passed to the fields parameter `encode_multipart_related`, multiple files can be uploaded in a single POST. It's sometimes used to upload a complete series or study. 

_Details:_
* Path: ../studies/{study}
* Method: POST
* Headers:
    * Accept: application/dicom+json
    * Content-Type: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"
    * Authorization: Bearer $token"
* Body:
    * Content-Type: application/dicom for each file uploaded, separated by a boundary value


```python

filepath_red = Path(path_to_dicoms_dir).joinpath('red-triangle.dcm')
filepath_green = Path(path_to_dicoms_dir).joinpath('green-square.dcm')

# Open up and read through file and load bytes into memory 
with open(filepath_red,'rb') as reader:
    rawfile_red = reader.read()
with open(filepath_green,'rb') as reader:
    rawfile_green = reader.read()  
       
files = {'file_red': ('dicomfile', rawfile_red, 'application/dicom'),
         'file_green': ('dicomfile', rawfile_green, 'application/dicom')}

#encode as multipart_related
body, content_type = encode_multipart_related(fields = files)

headers = {'Accept':'application/dicom+json', "Content-Type":content_type, "Authorization":bearer_token}

url = f'{base_url}/studies'
response = client.post(url, body, headers=headers, verify=False)
```
### Store single instance (nonstandard)

The following code example demonstrates how to upload a single DICOM file. It's a nonstandard API endpoint that simplifies uploading a single file as binary bytes sent in the body of a request

_Details:_
* Path: ../studies
* Method: POST
* Headers:
   *  Accept: application/dicom+json
   *  Content-Type: application/dicom
   *  Authorization: Bearer $token"
* Body:
    * Contains a single DICOM file as binary bytes.

```python
#upload blue-circle.dcm
filepath = Path(path_to_dicoms_dir).joinpath('blue-circle.dcm')

# Open up and read through file and load bytes into memory 
with open(filepath,'rb') as reader:
    body = reader.read()

headers = {'Accept':'application/dicom+json', 'Content-Type':'application/dicom', "Authorization":bearer_token}

url = f'{base_url}/studies'
response = client.post(url, body, headers=headers, verify=False)
response  # response should be a 409 Conflict if the file was already uploaded in the above request
```

## Retrieve DICOM instances (WADO)

The following examples highlight retrieving DICOM instances.

### Retrieve all instances within a study

This example retrieves all instances within a single study.

_Details:_
* Path: ../studies/{study}
* Method: GET
* Headers:
   * Accept: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=*
   * Authorization: Bearer $token"

All three of the dcm files that uploaded previously are part of the same study, so the response should return all three instances. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that all three instances are returned.

```python
url = f'{base_url}/studies/{study_uid}'
headers = {'Accept':'multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=*', "Authorization":bearer_token}

response = client.get(url, headers=headers) #, verify=False)
```

### Use the retrieved instances

The instances are retrieved as binary bytes. You can loop through the returned items and convert the bytes into a file that `pydicom` can read as follows.


```python
import requests_toolbelt as tb
from io import BytesIO

mpd = tb.MultipartDecoder.from_response(response)
for part in mpd.parts:
    # Note that the headers are returned as binary!
    print(part.headers[b'content-type'])
    
    # You can convert the binary body (of each part) into a pydicom DataSet
    #   And get direct access to the various underlying fields
    dcm = pydicom.dcmread(BytesIO(part.content))
    print(dcm.PatientName)
    print(dcm.SOPInstanceUID)
```
