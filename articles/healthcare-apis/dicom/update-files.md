# Update DICOM files

The bulk update operation lets you make changes to imaging metadata for multiple files stored in the DICOM&reg; service. For example, bulk update enables you to modify DICOM attributes for one or more studies in a single, asynchronous operation. You can use this API to perform updates to patient demographic changes and avoid the costs of repeating time-consuming uploads. 

Beyond the efficiency gains, the bulk update capability preserves a record of the changes in the [change feed](change-feed-overview.md) and persists the original, unmodified instances for future retrieval. 

## Limitations
There are a few limitations when you use the bulk update operation:

- A maximum of 50 studies can be updated in a single operation.
- Only one bulk update operation can be performed at a time.
- You can't delete only the latest version of a study, or revert back to the original version. 
- You can't update any field from non-null to a null value.

## Use the bulk update operation
Bulk update is an asynchronous, long-running operation available at a study's endpoint. The request payload includes one or more studies to update, the set of attributes to update, and the new values for those attributes. 

### Update instances in multiple studies
The bulk update endpoint starts a long-running operation that updates all instances in each study with the specified attributes.

```http
POST {dicom-service-url}/{version}/studies/$bulkUpdate
```

```http
POST {dicom-service-url}/{version}/partitions/{PartitionName}/studies/$bulkUpdate
```

#### Request header

| Name         | Required  | Type   | Description                     |
| ------------ | --------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| Content-Type | False     | string | `application/json` is supported |

#### Request body

The request body contains the specification for studies to update. Both the `studyInstanceUids` and `changeDataset` are required.

```json
{
    "studyInstanceUids": ["1.113654.3.13.1026"],
    "changeDataset": { 
        "00100010": { 
            "vr": "PN", 
            "Value": 
            [
                { 
                    "Alphabetic": "New Patient Name 1" 
                }
            ] 
        } 
    }
}
```

#### Responses
When a bulk update operation starts successfully, the API returns a `202` status code. The body of the response contains a reference to the operation.

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "id": "1323c079a1b64efcb8943ef7707b5438",
    "href": "../v1/operations/1323c079a1b64efcb8943ef7707b5438"
}
```

If the operation fails to start successfully, the response includes information about the failure in the errors list, including UIDs of one or more failing instances. 

```http
{
    "operationId": "1323c079a1b64efcb8943ef7707b5438",
    "type": "update",
    "createdTime": "2023-05-08T05:01:30.1441374Z",
    "lastUpdatedTime": "2023-05-08T05:01:42.9067335Z",
    "status": "failed",
    "percentComplete": 100,
    "results": {
        "studyUpdated": 0,
        "studyFailed": 1,
        "instanceUpdated": 0,
        "errors": [
            "Failed to update instances for study 1.113654.3.13.1026"
        ]
    }
}
```

### Operation Status
The `href` URL can be polled for the current status of the update operation until completion. A return code of `200` indicates the operation completed successfully.

```http
GET {dicom-service-url}/{version}/operations/{operationId}
```

#### URI Parameters

| Name        | In   | Required | Type   | Description      |

## Retrieving study versions
The [Retrieve (WADO-RS)](dicom-services-conformance-statement-v2.md#retrieve-wado-rs) transaction allows you to retrieve both the original and latest version of a study, series, or instance. By default, the latest version of a study, series, or instance is returned. The original version is returned by setting the `msdicom-request-original` header to `true`. An example request follows.

```http 
GET {dicom-service-url}/{version}/studies/{study}/series/{series}/instances/{instance}
Accept: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=*
msdicom-request-original: true
Content-Type: application/dicom
 ```

## Delete
The [delete](dicom-services-conformance-statement-v2.md#delete) method deletes both the original and latest version of a study, series, or instance.

## Change feed
The [change feed](change-feed-overview.md) records update actions in the same manner as create and delete actions. 

## Supported DICOM modules
Any attributes in the [Patient Identification Module](https://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.2.html#table_C.2-2) and [Patient Demographic Module](https://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.2.html#table_C.2-3) that aren't sequences can be updated using the bulk update operation. Supported attributes are called out in the tables.

### Attributes automatically changed in bulk updates

When you perform a bulk update, the DICOM service updates the requested attributes and two additional metadata fields automatically. Following is the information that is updated automatically.

| Tag           | Attribute name        | Description           | Value |
| --------------| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------|
| (0002,0012)   | Implementation Class UID | Uniquely identifies the implementation that wrote this file and its content. | 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.129 |
| (0002,0013)   | Implementation Version Name | Identifies a version for an Implementation Class UID (0002,0012) | Assembly version of the DICOM service (for example, 0.1.4785) |

The UID `1.3.6.1.4.1.311.129` is a registered under [Microsoft OID arc](https://oidref.com/1.3.6.1.4.1.311) in IANA.
