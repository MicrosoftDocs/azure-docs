# Use C# and DICOMweb Standard APIs

This article shows how to work with the DICOMweb service using C# and sample .dcm DICOM&reg; files.

Use these sample files:

- blue-circle.dcm
- dicom-metadata.csv
- green-square.dcm
- red-triangle.dcm

The filename, studyUID, seriesUID, and instanceUID of the sample DICOM files are:

| File | StudyUID | SeriesUID | InstanceUID |
| --- | --- | --- | ---|
|green-square.dcm|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.45787841905473114233124723359129632652|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.12714725698140337137334606354172323212|
|red-triangle.dcm|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.45787841905473114233124723359129632652|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.47359123102728459884412887463296905395|
|blue-circle.dcm|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.77033797676425927098669402985243398207|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13273713909719068980354078852867170114|

> [!NOTE]
> Each of these files represents a single instance and is part of the same study. Also, the green-square and red-triangle are part of the same series, while the blue-circle is in a separate series.

## Prerequisites

To use the DICOMweb Standard APIs, you need an instance of the DICOM service deployed. For more information, see [Deploy DICOM service using the Azure portal](deploy-dicom-services-in-azure.md).

After you deploy an instance of the DICOM service, retrieve the URL for your app service:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search **Recent resources** and select your DICOM service instance.
1. Copy the **Service URL** of your DICOM service. Make sure to specify the version as part of the url when making requests. For more information, see [API versioning for the DICOM service](api-versioning-dicom-service.md).

In your application, install the following NuGet packages:

*  [DICOM Client](https://microsofthealthoss.visualstudio.com/FhirServer/_artifacts/feed/Public/NuGet/Microsoft.Health.Dicom.Client/)

*  [fo-dicom](https://www.nuget.org/packages/fo-dicom/)

## Create a DicomWebClient

After you deploy your DICOM service, you create a DicomWebClient. Run the code snippet to create DicomWebClient, which you use for the rest of this tutorial. Ensure you have both NuGet packages installed. For more information, see [Get access token for the DICOM service using Azure CLI](dicom-get-access-token-azure-cli.md).

```c#
string webServerUrl ="{Your DicomWeb Server URL}"
var httpClient = new HttpClient();
httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri(webServerUrl);
IDicomWebClient client = new DicomWebClient(httpClient);
client.HttpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new System.Net.Http.Headers.AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", “{Your token value}”); 
```
With the DicomWebClient, we can now perform the Store, Retrieve, Search, and Delete operations.

## Store DICOM instances (STOW)

Using the DicomWebClient, we can now store DICOM files.

### Store single instance

Store single instance demonstrates how to upload a single DICOM file.

_Details:_

* POST /studies

```c#
DicomFile dicomFile = await DicomFile.OpenAsync(@"{Path To blue-circle.dcm}");
DicomWebResponse response = await client.StoreAsync(new[] { dicomFile });
```

### Store instances for a specific study

Store instances for a specific study demonstrates how to upload a DICOM file into a specified study.

_Details:_

* POST /studies/{study}

```c#
DicomFile dicomFile = await DicomFile.OpenAsync(@"{Path To red-triangle.dcm}");
DicomWebResponse response = await client.StoreAsync(new[] { dicomFile }, "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420");
```

Before moving on to the next part of the tutorial, upload the `green-square.dcm` file using either of the preceding methods.

## Retrieve DICOM instance (WADO)

The code snippets show how to perform each of the retrieve queries using the DicomWebClient created previously.

The variables are used throughout the rest of the examples.

```c#
string studyInstanceUid = "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420"; //StudyInstanceUID for all 3 examples
string seriesInstanceUid = "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.45787841905473114233124723359129632652"; //SeriesInstanceUID for green-square and red-triangle
string sopInstanceUid = "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.47359123102728459884412887463296905395"; //SOPInstanceUID for red-triangle
```

### Retrieve all instances within a study

_Details:_

* GET /studies/{study}

```c#
DicomWebResponse response = await client.RetrieveStudyAsync(studyInstanceUid);
```

All three of the dcm files that you uploaded previously are part of the same study, so the response should return all three instances. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that all three instances are returned.

### Use the retrieved instances

The following code snippet shows how to access the instances that are retrieved. It also shows how to access some of the fields of the instances, and how to save it as a dcm file.

```c#
DicomWebAsyncEnumerableResponse<DicomFile> response = await client.RetrieveStudyAsync(studyInstanceUid);
await foreach (DicomFile file in response)
{
    string patientName = file.Dataset.GetString(DicomTag.PatientName);
    string studyId = file.Dataset.GetString(DicomTag.StudyID);
    string seriesNumber = file.Dataset.GetString(DicomTag.SeriesNumber);
    string instanceNumber = file.Dataset.GetString(DicomTag.InstanceNumber);

    file.Save($"<path_to_save>\\{patientName}{studyId}{seriesNumber}{instanceNumber}.dcm");
}
```

### Retrieve metadata of all instances in study

This response retrieves the metadata for all instances within a single study.

_Details:_

* GET /studies/{study}/metadata

```c#
DicomWebResponse response = await client.RetrieveStudyMetadataAsync(studyInstanceUid);
```

All three of the dcm files that we uploaded previously are part of the same study, so the response should return the metadata for all three instances. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that all the metadata is returned.

### Retrieve all instances within a series

This response retrieves all instances within a single series.

_Details:_

* GET /studies/{study}/series/{series}


```c#
DicomWebResponse response = await client.RetrieveSeriesAsync(studyInstanceUid, seriesInstanceUid);
```

This series has two instances (green-square and red-triangle), so the response should return both instances. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that both instances are returned.

### Retrieve metadata of all instances within a series

This response retrieves the metadata for all instances within a single study.

_Details:_

* GET /studies/{study}/series/{series}/metadata

```c#
DicomWebResponse response = await client.RetrieveSeriesMetadataAsync(studyInstanceUid, seriesInstanceUid);
```

The series has two instances (green-square and red-triangle), so the response should return metadata for both instances. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that both instances of the metadata are returned.

### Retrieve a single instance within a series of a study

This request retrieves a single instance.

_Details:_

* GET /studies/{study}/series{series}/instances/{instance}

The response should only return the instance red-triangle. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that the instance is returned.

### Retrieve metadata of a single instance within a series of a study

This request retrieves the metadata for a single instance within a single study and series.

_Details:_

* GET /studies/{study}/series/{series}/instances/{instance}/metadata

```c#
DicomWebResponse response = await client.RetrieveInstanceMetadataAsync(studyInstanceUid, seriesInstanceUid, sopInstanceUid);
```

The response should only return the metadata for the instance red-triangle. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that the metadata is returned.

### Retrieve one or more frames from a single instance

This request retrieves one or more frames from a single instance.

_Details:_

* GET /studies/{study}/series/{series}/instances/{instance}/frames/{frames}

```c#
DicomWebResponse response = await client.RetrieveFramesAsync(studyInstanceUid, seriesInstanceUid, sopInstanceUid, frames: new[] { 1 });

```

The response should return the only frame from the red-triangle. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that the frame is returned.
