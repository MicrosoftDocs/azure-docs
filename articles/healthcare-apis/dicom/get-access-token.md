# Get an access token

To use the DICOM&reg; service, users and applications need to prove their identity and permissions by getting an access token. An access token is a string that identifies a user or an application, and grants them permission to access a resource. Using access tokens enhances security by preventing unauthorized access and reducing the need for repeated authentication. 

## Use the Azure command-line interface

 You get an access token using the [Azure command-line interface (CLI)](/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli). Azure CLI is a set of commands used to create and manage Azure resources. You can use it to interact with Azure services, including the DICOM service. You can install Azure CLI on your computer or use it in the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://azure.microsoft.com/get-started/azure-portal/cloud-shell/).

## Assign roles and grant permissions

Before you get an access token, configure access control for the DICOM service using [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../../role-based-access-control/overview.md). Azure RBAC is a system that allows you to define who can access what resources and what actions they can perform on them.

To assign roles and grant access to the DICOM service:

1. Register a client application in Microsoft Entra ID that acts as your identity provider and authentication mechanism. Use Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI to [register an application](dicom-register-application.md).

1. Assign one of the built-in roles for the DICOM data plane to the client application. The roles are: 
- **DICOM Data Owner**. Gives full access to DICOM data
- **DICOM Data Reader**. Allows read and search operations on DICOM data

## Get a token

To get an access token using Azure CLI:

1. Sign in to Azure CLI with your user account or a service principal.

1. Get the object ID of your user account or service principal by using the commands `az ad signed-in-user show` or `az ad sp list`, respectively.

1. Get the access token by using the command `az account get-access-token --resource=https://dicom.healthcareapis.azure.com`.

1. Copy the access token from the output of the command.

1. Use the access token in your requests to the DICOM service by adding it as a header with the name `Authorization` and the value `Bearer <access token>`.

#### Store a token in a variable

The DICOM service uses a `resource` or `Audience`, with uniform resource identifier (URI) equal to the URI of the DICOM server `https://dicom.healthcareapis.azure.com`. You can obtain a token and store it in a variable (named `$token`) with the following command.

```cURL
$token=$(az account get-access-token --resource=https://dicom.healthcareapis.azure.com --query accessToken --output tsv)
```

#### Tips for using a local installation of Azure CLI

* If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI with the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command. To finish authentication, follow the on-screen steps. For more information, see [Sign in with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

* If prompted on first use, install Azure CLI extensions. For more information, see [Use extensions with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).

* Run [az version](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-version) to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run [az upgrade](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-upgrade).

## Use a token with the DICOM service

You can use a token with the DICOM service [using cURL](dicomweb-standard-apis-curl.md). Following is an example.

```cURL 
-X GET --header "Authorization: Bearer $token"  https://<workspacename-dicomservicename>.dicom.azurehealthcareapis.com/v<version of REST API>/changefeed
```
