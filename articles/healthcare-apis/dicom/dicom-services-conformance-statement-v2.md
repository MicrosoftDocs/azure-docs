# DICOM Conformance Statement v2

> [!NOTE]
> API version 2 is the latest API version.  For a list of changes in v2 compared to v1, see [DICOM service API v2 changes](dicom-service-v2-api-changes.md)

The Medical Imaging Server for DICOM&reg; supports a subset of the DICOMweb Standard. Support includes:

* [Studies Service](#studies-service)
  * [Store (STOW-RS)](#store-stow-rs)
  * [Retrieve (WADO-RS)](#retrieve-wado-rs)
  * [Search (QIDO-RS)](#search-qido-rs)
  * [Delete](#delete)
* [Worklist Service (UPS Push and Pull SOPs)](#worklist-service-ups-rs)
  * [Create Workitem](#create-workitem)
  * [Retrieve Workitem](#retrieve-workitem)
  * [Update Workitem](#update-workitem)
  * [Change Workitem State](#change-workitem-state)
  * [Request Cancellation](#request-cancellation)
  * [Search Workitems](#search-workitems)

Additionally, these nonstandard APIs are supported:

* [Change Feed](change-feed-overview.md)
* [Extended Query Tags](dicom-extended-query-tags-overview.md)
* [Bulk Update](update-files.md)
* [Bulk Import](import-files.md)
* [Export](export-dicom-files.md)

The service uses REST API versioning. The version of the REST API must be explicitly specified as part of the base URL, as in the following example:

`https://<service_url>/v<version>/studies`

This version of the conformance statement corresponds to the `v2` version of the REST APIs.  

For more information on how to specify the version when making requests, see the [API Versioning Documentation](api-versioning-dicom-service.md).

You can find example requests for supported transactions in the Postman collection.

## Preamble Sanitization

The service ignores the 128-byte File Preamble, and replaces its contents with null characters. This behavior ensures that no files passed through the service are vulnerable to the [malicious preamble vulnerability](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part10/sect_7.5.html). However, this preamble sanitization also means that [preambles used to encode dual format content](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6489422/) such as TIFF can't be used with the service.

## Studies Service

The [Studies Service](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#chapter_10) allows users to store, retrieve, and search for DICOM Studies, Series, and Instances. We added the nonstandard Delete transaction to enable a full resource lifecycle.

### Store (STOW-RS)

This transaction uses the POST or PUT method to store representations of studies, series, and instances contained in the request payload.

| Method | Path               | Description                            |
| :----- | :----------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| POST   | ../studies         | Store instances.                       |
| POST   | ../studies/{study} | Store instances for a specific study.  |
| PUT    | ../studies         | Upsert instances.                      |
| PUT    | ../studies/{study} | Upsert instances for a specific study. |

Parameter `study` corresponds to the DICOM attribute StudyInstanceUID. If specified, any instance that doesn't belong to the provided study is rejected with a `43265` warning code.

The following is the only response `Accept` header supported:

* `application/dicom+json`

The following `Content-Type` headers are supported:

* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"`
* `application/dicom`

> [!NOTE]
> The server won't coerce or replace attributes that conflict with existing data for POST requests. All data is stored as provided. For upsert (PUT) requests, the existing data is replaced by the new data received. 

#### Store required attributes
The following DICOM elements are required to be present in every DICOM file attempting to be stored:

* `StudyInstanceUID`
* `SeriesInstanceUID`
* `SOPInstanceUID`
* `SOPClassUID`
* `PatientID`

> [!NOTE]
> All UIDs must be between 1 and 64 characters long, and only contain alpha numeric characters or the following special characters: `.`, `-`. `PatientID` continues to be a required tag and can have the value as null in the input. `PatientID` is validated based on its `LO` `VR` type.

Each file stored must have a unique combination of `StudyInstanceUID`, `SeriesInstanceUID`, and `SopInstanceUID`. The warning code `45070` is returned if a file with the same identifiers already exists.

Only transfer syntaxes with explicit Value Representations are accepted.

> [!NOTE]
> Requests are limited to 4GB. No single DICOM file or combination of files might exceed this limit.

#### Store changes from v1
In previous versions, a Store request would fail if any of the [required](#store-required-attributes) or [searchable attributes](#searchable-attributes) failed validation. Beginning with V2, the request fails only if **required attributes** fail validation.

Failed validation of attributes not required by the API results in the file being stored with a warning. A warning is given about each failing attribute per instance.
When a sequence contains an attribute that fails validation, or when there are multiple issues with a single attribute, only the first failing attribute reason is noted.

If an attribute is padded with nulls, the attribute is indexed when searchable and is stored as is in dicom+json metadata. No validation warning is provided.

#### Store DICOM file with external metadata

The [external metadata](external-metadata.md#store-stow-rs) documentation explains the ability to store DICOM file with external metadata.

#### Store response status codes

* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.1`
* `application/dicom; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90`
* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90`
- `*/*` (when transfer-syntax isn't specified, `*` is used as default and mediaType defaults to `application/dicom`)

#### Retrieve Frames

The following `Accept` headers are supported for retrieving frames.
* `multipart/related; type="application/octet-stream"; transfer-syntax=*`
* `multipart/related; type="application/octet-stream";` (when transfer-syntax isn't specified, `1.2.840.10008.1.2.1` is used as default)
* `multipart/related; type="application/octet-stream"; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.1`
* `multipart/related; type="image/jp2";` (when transfer-syntax isn't specified, `1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90` is used as default)
* `multipart/related; type="image/jp2";transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90`
* `application/octet-stream; transfer-syntax=*` for single frame retrieval
- `*/*` (when transfer-syntax isn't specified, `*` is used as default and mediaType defaults to `application/octet-stream`)

#### Retrieve transfer syntax

When the requested transfer syntax is different from the original file, the original file is transcoded to requested transfer syntax. The original file needs to be one of the following formats for transcoding to succeed, otherwise transcoding might fail.
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2 (Little Endian Implicit)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.1 (Little Endian Explicit)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.2 (Explicit VR Big Endian)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.50 (JPEG Baseline Process 1)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.57 (JPEG Lossless)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.70 (JPEG Lossless Selection Value 1)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90 (JPEG 2000 Lossless Only)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.91 (JPEG 2000)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.5 (RLE Lossless)

An unsupported `transfer-syntax` results in `406 Not Acceptable`.

### Retrieve metadata (for study, series, or instance)

The following `Accept` header is supported for retrieving metadata for a study, a series, or an instance.

* `application/dicom+json`

Retrieving metadata doesn't return attributes with the following value representations.

| VR Name | Description            |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| OB      | Other Byte             |
| OD      | Other Double           |
| OF      | Other Float            |
| OL      | Other Long             |
| OV      | Other 64-Bit Very Long |
| OW      | Other Word             |
| UN      | Unknown                |

Retrieved metadata includes the null character when the attribute was padded with nulls and stored as is.

> [!NOTE]
> The [external metadata](external-metadata.md#store-stow-rs) documentation explains the ability to retrieve DICOM file with external metadata.

### Retrieve metadata cache validation (for study, series, or instance)

Cache validation is supported using the `ETag` mechanism. In the response to a metadata request, ETag is returned as one of the headers. This ETag can be cached and added as an `If-None-Match` header in the later requests for the same metadata. Two types of responses are possible if the data exists.

* Data is unchanged since the last request: the `HTTP 304 (Not Modified)` response is sent with no response body.
* Data changed since the last request: the `HTTP 200 (OK)` response is sent with updated ETag. Required data is returned as part of the body.

### Retrieve rendered image (for instance or frame)

The following `Accept` headers are supported for retrieving a rendered image an instance or a frame.

- `image/jpeg`
- `image/png`

In the case that no `Accept` header is specified the service renders an `image/jpeg` by default.

The service only supports rendering of a single frame. If rendering is requested for an instance with multiple frames, by default only the first frame is rendered as an image.

When specifying a particular frame to return, frame indexing starts at 1.

The `quality` query parameter is also supported. An integer value between `1` and `100` inclusive (1 being worst quality, and 100 being best quality) might be passed as the value for the query parameter. This parameter is used for images rendered as `jpeg`, and is ignored for `png` render requests. If not specified the parameter defaults to `100`.

### Retrieve original version
Using the [bulk update](update-files.md) operation allows you to retrieve either the original or latest version of a study, series, or instance. The latest version of a study, series, or instance is always returned by default.  The original version might be returned by setting the `msdicom-request-original` header to `true`.  Here's an example request:

```http
GET ../studies/{study}/series/{series}/instances/{instance}
Accept: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=*
msdicom-request-original: true
Content-Type: application/dicom
 ```

### Retrieve response status codes

| Code | Description |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200 (OK)` | All requested data was retrieved. |
| `304 (Not Modified)` | The requested data is unchanged since the last request. Content isn't added to the response body in such case. For more information, see the preceding section **Retrieve Metadata Cache Validation (for Study, Series, or Instance)**. |
| `400 (Bad Request)` | The request was badly formatted. For example, the provided study instance identifier didn't conform to the expected UID format, or the requested transfer-syntax encoding isn't supported. |
| `401 (Unauthorized)` | The client isn't authenticated. |
| `403 (Forbidden)` | The user isn't authorized. |
| `404 (Not Found)` | The specified DICOM resource couldn't be found, or for rendered request the instance didn't contain pixel data. |
| `406 (Not Acceptable)` | The specified `Accept` header isn't supported, or for rendered and transcodes requests the file requested was too large. |
| `424 (Failed Dependency)` | The DICOM service can't access a resource it depends on to complete this request. An example is failure to access the connected Data Lake store, or the key vault for supporting customer-managed key encryption. |
| `503 (Service Unavailable)` | The service is unavailable or busy. Try again later. |

### Search (QIDO-RS)

Query based on ID for DICOM Objects (QIDO) enables you to search for studies, series, and instances by attributes.

| Method                 | Path                                             | Description                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| *Search for Studies*   | | |
| GET                    | ../studies?...                                   | Search for studies               |
| *Search for Series*    | | |
| GET                    | ../series?...                                    | Search for series                |
| GET                    | ../studies/{study}/series?...                    | Search for series in a study     |
| *Search for Instances* | | |
| GET                    | ../instances?...                                 | Search for instances             |
| GET                    | ../studies/{study}/instances?...                 | Search for instances in a study  |
| GET                    | ../studies/{study}/series/{series}/instances?... | Search for instances in a series |

The following `Accept` header is supported for searching.

* `application/dicom+json`

### Search changes from v1
In the v1 API and continued for v2, if an [extended query tag](dicom-extended-query-tags-overview.md) has any errors because one or more of the existing instances had a tag value that couldn't be indexed, then subsequent search queries containing the extended query tag returns `erroneous-dicom-attributes` as detailed in the [documentation](dicom-extended-query-tags-overview.md#tag-query-status). However, tags (also known as attributes) with validation warnings from STOW-RS are **not** included in this header. If a store request results in validation warnings for [searchable attributes](#searchable-attributes) at the time the [instance was stored](#store-changes-from-v1), those attributes may not be used to search for the stored instance. However, any [searchable attributes](#searchable-attributes) that failed validation can return results if the values are overwritten by instances in the same study or series that are stored after the failed one, or if the values are already stored correctly by a previous instance. If the attribute values aren't overwritten, they don't produce any search results.

An attribute can be corrected in the following ways.
- Delete the stored instance and upload a new instance with the corrected data
- Upload a new instance in the same study/series with corrected data

### Supported search parameters

The following parameters for each query are supported:

| Key              | Support Values          | Allowed Count | Description |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |------------------------------------------------- |
| `{attributeID}=` | `{value}`                 | 0...N         | Search for attribute/ value matching in query |
| `includefield=`  | `{attributeID}`<br/>`all` | 0...N         | The other attributes to return in the response. Both, public and private tags are supported.<br/>When `all` is provided, refer to [Search Response](#search-response) for more information.<br/>If a mixture of `{attributeID}` and `all` is provided, the server defaults to using `all` |
| `limit=`         | `{value}`                 | 0..1          | Integer value to limit the number of values returned in the response.<br/>Value can be between the range 1 >= x <= 200. Defaulted to 100 |
| `offset=`        | `{value}`                 | 0..1          | Skip `{value}` results.<br/>If an offset is provided larger than the number of search query results, a 204 (no content) response is returned. |
| `fuzzymatching=` | `true` / `false`          | 0..1          | If true fuzzy matching is applied to PatientName attribute. It does a prefix word match of any name part inside PatientName value. For example, if PatientName is "John^Doe", then "joh", "do", "jo do", "Doe" and "John Doe" all match. However "ohn" doesn't match. |

> [!NOTE]
> We do not support searching using empty string for any attributes.

#### Search matching

We support the following matching types.

| Search Type | Supported Attribute | Example |
| ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Range Query | `StudyDate`/`PatientBirthDate` | `{attributeID}={value1}-{value2}`. For date/time values, we support an inclusive range on the tag. This range is mapped to `attributeID >= {value1} AND attributeID <= {value2}`. If `{value1}` isn't specified, all occurrences of dates/times prior to, and including `{value2}` are matched. Likewise, if `{value2}` isn't specified, all occurrences of `{value1}` and subsequent dates/times are matched. However, one of these values has to be present. `{attributeID}={value1}-` and `{attributeID}=-{value2}` are valid, however, `{attributeID}=-` is invalid. |
| Exact Match | All supported attributes | `{attributeID}={value1}` |
| Fuzzy Match | `PatientName`, `ReferringPhysicianName` | Matches any component of the name that starts with the value |
| UID List Match | `StudyInstanceUID` | Matches studies identified by the values provided in the list. Supports comma (,) or a backslash (\\) as a valid separator. `{attributeID}=1.2.3,5.6.7,8.9.0` will return details associated with all the studies, given they exist. |

#### Attribute ID

Tags can be encoded in several ways for the query parameter. We partially implemented the standard as defined in [PS3.18 6.7.1.1.1](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2019a/output/chtml/part18/sect_6.7.html#sect_6.7.1.1.1). The following encodings for a tag are supported.

| Value              | Example            |
| :----------------- | :----------------- |
| `{group}{element}` | `0020000D`         |
| `{dicomKeyword}`   | `StudyInstanceUID` |

Example query searching for instances:

`../instances?Modality=CT&00280011=512&includefield=00280010&limit=5&offset=0`

> [!NOTE]
> The [external metadata](external-metadata.md#store-stow-rs) documentation explains the ability to query DICOM file with external metadata.

### Search response

| `414 (URI Too Long)` | URI exceeded maximum supported length of 8192 characters. |
| `424 (Failed Dependency)` | The DICOM service can't access a resource it depends on to complete this request. An example is failure to access the connected Data Lake store, or the key vault for supporting customer-managed key encryption. |
| `503 (Service Unavailable)` | The service is unavailable or busy. Try again later. |

### Notes

* Querying using the `TimezoneOffsetFromUTC (00080201)` isn't supported.
* The query API doesn't return `413 (request entity too large)`. If the requested query response limit is outside of the acceptable range, a bad request is returned. Anything requested within the acceptable range is resolved.
* When the target resource is Study/Series, there's a potential for inconsistent study/series level metadata across multiple instances. For example, two instances could have different `patientName`. In this case, the latest wins and you can search only on the latest data.
* Paged results are optimized to return matched _newest_ instance first, possibly resulting in duplicate records in subsequent pages if newer data matching the query was added.
* Matching is _not_ case sensitive, and _not_ accent sensitive for PN VR types.
* Matching is _not_ case sensitive, and _is_ accent sensitive for other string VR types.
* Only the first value is indexed of a single valued data element that incorrectly has multiple values.
* Using the default attributes or limiting the number of results requested maximizes performance.
* When an attribute was stored using null padding, it can be searched for with or without the null padding in uri encoding. Results retrieved are for attributes stored both with and without null padding.

### Delete

This transaction isn't part of the official DICOMweb Standard. It uses the DELETE method to remove representations of Studies, Series, and Instances from the store.

| Method | Path                                                    | Description                                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| DELETE | ../studies/{study}                                      | Delete all instances for a specific study.                 |
| DELETE | ../studies/{study}/series/{series}                      | Delete all instances for a specific series within a study. |
| DELETE | ../studies/{study}/series/{series}/instances/{instance} | Delete a specific instance within a series.                |

Parameters `study`, `series`, and `instance` correspond to the DICOM attributes `StudyInstanceUID`, `SeriesInstanceUID`, and `SopInstanceUID` respectively.

There are no restrictions on the request's `Accept` header, `Content-Type` header, or body content.

> [!NOTE]
> After a Delete transaction, the deleted instances will not be recoverable.

### Response status codes

| Code | Description |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `204 (No Content)` | When all the SOP instances are deleted. |
| `400 (Bad Request)` | The request was badly formatted. |
| `401 (Unauthorized)` | The client isn't authenticated. |
| `403 (Forbidden)` | The user isn't authorized. |
| `404 (Not Found)` | When the specified series wasn't found within a study or the specified instance wasn't found within the series. |
| `424 (Failed Dependency)` | The DICOM service can't access a resource it depends on to complete this request. An example is failure to access the connected Data Lake store, or the key vault for supporting customer-managed key encryption. |
| `503 (Service Unavailable)` | The service is unavailable or busy. Try again later. |

### Delete response payload

The response body is empty. The status code is the only useful information returned.

## Worklist Service (UPS-RS)

The DICOM service supports the Push and Pull SOPs of the [Worklist Service (UPS-RS)](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#chapter_11). This service provides access to one Worklist containing Workitems, each of which represents a Unified Procedure Step (UPS).

Throughout, the variable `{workitem}` in a URI template stands for a Workitem UID.

Available UPS-RS endpoints include:

| Verb   | Path                                                          | Description               |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| POST   | {s}/workitems{?AffectedSOPInstanceUID}                        | Create a work item        |
| POST   | {s}/workitems/{instance}{?transaction}                        | Update a work item        |
| GET    | {s}/workitems{?query*}                                        | Search for work items     |
| GET    | {s}/workitems/{instance}                                      | Retrieve a work item      |
| PUT    | {s}/workitems/{instance}/state                                | Change work item state    |
| POST   | {s}/workitems/{instance}/cancelrequest                        | Cancel work item          |
| POST   | {s}/workitems/{instance}/subscribers/{AETitle}{?deletionlock} | Create subscription       |
| POST   | {s}/workitems/1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.34.5/                       | Suspend subscription      |
| DELETE | {s}/workitems/{instance}/subscribers/{AETitle}                | Delete subscription       |
| GET    | {s}/subscribers/{AETitle}                                     | Open subscription channel |

### Create Workitem

This transaction uses the POST method to create a new Workitem.

| Method | Path                    | Description                                |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| POST   | ../workitems            | Create a Workitem.                         |
| POST   | ../workitems?{workitem} | Creates a Workitem with the specified UID. |

If not specified in the URI, the payload dataset must contain the Workitem in the `SOPInstanceUID` attribute.

The `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers are required in the request, and must both have the value `application/dicom+json`.

There are several requirements related to DICOM data attributes in the context of a specific transaction. Attributes might be
required to be present, required to not be present, required to be empty, or required to not be empty. These requirements can be
found [in this table](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part04.html#table_CC.2.5-3).

> [!NOTE]
> Although the reference table says that SOP Instance UID shouldn't be present, this guidance is specific to the DIMSE protocol and is handled differently in DICOMWeb. SOP Instance UID should be present in the dataset if not in the URI.

> [!NOTE]
> All the conditional requirement codes including 1C and 2C are treated as optional.

#### Create response status codes

| Code | Description |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `201 (Created)` | The target Workitem was successfully created. |
| `400 (Bad Request)` | There was a problem with the request. For example, the request payload didn't satisfy the requirements. |
| `401 (Unauthorized)` | The client isn't authenticated. |
| `403 (Forbidden)` | The user isn't authorized. |
| `409 (Conflict)` | The Workitem already exists. |
| `415 (Unsupported Media Type)` | The provided `Content-Type` isn't supported. |
| `424 (Failed Dependency)` | The DICOM service can't access a resource it depends on to complete this request. An example is failure to access the connected Data Lake store, or the key vault for supporting customer-managed key encryption. |
| `503 (Service Unavailable)` | The service is unavailable or busy. Try again later. |

#### Create response payload

A success response has no payload. The `Location` and `Content-Location` response headers contain a URI reference to the created Workitem.

A failure response payload contains a message describing the failure.

### Request cancellation

This transaction enables the user to request cancellation of a non-owned Workitem.

There are [four valid Workitem states](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part04.html#table_CC.1.1-1):

* `SCHEDULED`
* `IN PROGRESS`
* `CANCELED`
* `COMPLETED`

This transaction only succeeds against Workitems in the `SCHEDULED` state. Any user can claim ownership of a Workitem by setting its Transaction UID and changing its state to `IN PROGRESS`. From then on, a user can only modify the Workitem by providing the correct Transaction UID. While UPS defines Watch and Event SOP classes that allow cancellation requests and other events to be forwarded, this DICOM service doesn't implement these classes, and so cancellation requests on workitems that are `IN PROGRESS` return a failure. An owned Workitem can be canceled via the [Change Workitem State](#change-workitem-state) transaction.

| Method | Path                                  | Description                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| POST   | ../workitems/{workitem}/cancelrequest | Request the cancellation of a scheduled Workitem |

The `Content-Type` header is required, and must have the value `application/dicom+json`.

The request payload might include Action Information as [defined in the DICOM Standard](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part04.html#table_CC.2.2-1).

#### Request cancellation response status codes

| Code | Description |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `202 (Accepted)` | The request was accepted by the server, but the Target Workitem state isn't changed yet. |
| `400 (Bad Request)` | There was a problem with the syntax of the request. |
| `401 (Unauthorized)` | The client isn't authenticated. |
| `403 (Forbidden)` | The user isn't authorized. |
| `404 (Not Found)` | The Target Workitem wasn't found. |
| `409 (Conflict)` | The request is inconsistent with the current state of the Target Workitem. For example, the Target Workitem is in the `SCHEDULED` or `COMPLETED` state. |
| `415 (Unsupported Media Type)` | The provided `Content-Type` isn't supported. |
| `424 (Failed Dependency)`      | The DICOM service can't access a resource it depends on to complete this request. An example is failure to access the connected Data Lake store, or the key vault for supporting customer-managed key encryption. |
| `503 (Service Unavailable)`    | The service is unavailable or busy. Try again later. |

#### Request cancellation response payload

A success response has no payload, and a failure response payload contains a message describing the failure.
If the Workitem Instance is already in a canceled state, the response includes the following HTTP Warning header:
`299: The UPS is already in the requested state of CANCELED.`

### Retrieve Workitem

This transaction retrieves a Workitem. It corresponds to the UPS DIMSE N-GET operation.

Refer to: https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#sect_11.5

If the Workitem exists on the origin server, the Workitem is returned in an Acceptable Media Type. The returned Workitem won't contain the Transaction UID (0008,1195) Attribute. This is necessary to preserve the Attribute's role as an access lock.

| Method | Path                    | Description                    |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| GET    | ../workitems/{workitem} | Request to retrieve a Workitem |

The `Accept` header is required and must have the value `application/dicom+json`.

#### Retrieve Workitem response status codes

| Code | Description |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 200 (OK) | Workitem Instance was successfully retrieved. |
| 400 (Bad Request) | There was a problem with the request. |
| 401 (Unauthorized) | The client isn't authenticated. |
| 403 (Forbidden) | The user isn't authorized. |
| 404 (Not Found) | The Target Workitem wasn't found. |
| 424 (Failed Dependency)   | The DICOM service can't access a resource it depends on to complete this request. An example is failure to access the connected Data Lake store, or the key vault for supporting customer-managed key encryption. |
| 503 (Service Unavailable) | The service is unavailable or busy. Try again later. |

#### Retrieve Workitem response payload

* A success response has a single part payload containing the requested Workitem in the Selected Media Type.
* The returned Workitem shall not contain the Transaction UID (0008, 1195) attribute of the Workitem, since that should only be known to the Owner.

### Update Workitem

This transaction modifies attributes of an existing Workitem. It corresponds to the UPS DIMSE N-SET operation.

Refer to: https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#sect_11.6

To update a Workitem currently in the `SCHEDULED` state, the `Transaction UID` attribute shall not be present. For a Workitem in the `IN PROGRESS` state, the request must include the current Transaction UID as a query parameter. If the Workitem is already in the `COMPLETED` or `CANCELED` states, the response is `400 (Bad Request)`.

| Method | Path                                      | Description                 |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| POST   | ../workitems/{workitem}?{transaction-uid} | Update Workitem Transaction |

The `Content-Type` header is required, and must have the value `application/dicom+json`.

The request payload contains a dataset with the changes to be applied to the target Workitem. When a sequence is modified, the request must include all Items in the sequence, not just the Items to be modified. When you need to update multiple Attributes as a group, update them as multiple Attributes in a single request, not as multiple requests.

There are many requirements related to DICOM data attributes in the context of a specific transaction. Attributes might be
required to be present, required to not be present, required to be empty, or required to not be empty. These requirements can be
found in [this table](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part04.html#table_CC.2.5-3).

> [!NOTE]
> All the conditional requirement codes including 1C and 2C are treated as optional.

> [!NOTE]
> The request can't set the value of the Procedure Step State (0074,1000) attribute. Procedure Step State is managed using the Change State transaction, or the Request Cancellation transaction.

#### Update Workitem transaction response status codes

| Code | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200 (OK)` | The Target Workitem was updated. |
| `400 (Bad Request)` | There was a problem with the request. For example: (1) the Target Workitem was in the `COMPLETED` or `CANCELED` state. (2) the Transaction UID is missing. (3) the Transaction UID is incorrect. (4) the dataset didn't conform to the requirements. |
| `401 (Unauthorized)` | The client isn't authenticated. |
| `403 (Forbidden)` | The user isn't authorized. |
| `404 (Not Found)` | The Target Workitem wasn't found. |
| `409 (Conflict)` | The request is inconsistent with the current state of the Target Workitem. |
| `415 (Unsupported Media Type)` | The provided `Content-Type` isn't supported. |
| `424 (Failed Dependency)` | The DICOM service can't access a resource it depends on to complete this request. An example is failure to access the connected Data Lake store, or the key vault for supporting customer-managed key encryption. |
| `503 (Service Unavailable)` | The service is unavailable or busy. Try again later. |

#### Update Workitem transaction response payload

The origin server supports header fields as required in [Table 11.6.3-2](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#table_11.6.3-2).

A success response has either no payload, or a payload containing a Status Report document.

A failure response payload might contain a Status Report describing any failures, warnings, or other useful information.

### Change Workitem state

This transaction is used to change the state of a Workitem. It corresponds to the UPS DIMSE N-ACTION operation "Change UPS State". State changes are used to claim ownership, complete, or cancel a Workitem.

Refer to: https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#sect_11.7

If the Workitem exists on the origin server, the Workitem is returned in an Acceptable Media Type. The returned Workitem won't contain the Transaction UID (0008,1195) attribute. This is necessary to preserve the Attribute's role as an access lock as described [here.](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part04.html#sect_CC.1.1)

| Method | Path                          | Description           |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| PUT    | ../workitems/{workitem}/state | Change Workitem State |

The `Accept` header is required, and must have the value `application/dicom+json`.

The request payload contains the Change UPS State Data Elements. These data elements are as follows.

* **Transaction UID (0008, 1195)**. The request payload includes a Transaction UID. The user agent creates the Transaction UID when requesting a transition to the `IN PROGRESS` state for a given Workitem. The user agent provides that Transaction UID in subsequent transactions with that Workitem.
* **Procedure Step State (0074, 1000)**. The legal values correspond to the requested state transition. These are: `IN PROGRESS`, `COMPLETED`, or `CANCELED`.

#### Change Workitem state response status codes

| Code  | Description |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `200 (OK)` | Workitem Instance was successfully retrieved. |
| `400 (Bad Request)` | The request can't be performed for one of the following reasons: (1) the request isn't valid given the current state of the Target Workitem. (2) the Transaction UID is missing. (3) the Transaction UID is incorrect |
| `401 (Unauthorized)` | The client isn't authenticated. |
| `403 (Forbidden)` | The user isn't authorized. |
| `404 (Not Found)` | The Target Workitem wasn't found. |
| `409 (Conflict)` | The request is inconsistent with the current state of the Target Workitem. |
| `424 (Failed Dependency)` | The DICOM service can't access a resource it depends on to complete this request. An example is failure to access the connected Data Lake store, or the key vault for supporting customer-managed key encryption.    |
| `503 (Service Unavailable)` | The service is unavailable or busy. Try again later. |

#### Change Workitem state response payload

* Responses include the header fields specified in [section 11.7.3.2](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#sect_11.7.3.2).
* A success response has no payload.
* A failure response payload might contain a Status Report describing any failures, warnings, or other useful information.

### Search Workitems

This transaction enables you to search for Workitems by attributes.

| Method | Path          | Description          |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------------- |
| GET    | ../workitems? | Search for Workitems |

The following `Accept` header is supported for searching.

* `application/dicom+json`

#### Supported Search Parameters

The following parameters for each query are supported:

| Key | Support Values | Allowed Count | Description |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{attributeID}=` | `{value}` | 0...N | Search for attribute/value matching in query. |
| `includefield=`  | `{attributeID}`<br/>`all` | 0...N | The other attributes to return in the response. Only top-level attributes can be included - not attributes that are part of sequences. Both public and private tags are supported. When `all` is provided. See [Search Response](#search-response) for more information about which attributes are returned for each query type. If a mixture of `{attributeID}` and `all` is provided, the server defaults to using 'all'. |
| `limit=`         | `{value}` | 0...1 | Integer value to limit the number of values returned in the response. Value can be between the range `1 >= x <= 4000`. Defaulted to `100`. |
| `offset=` | `{value}` | 0...1 | Skip {value} results. If an offset is provided larger than the number of search query results, a `204 (no content)` response is returned. |
| `fuzzymatching=` | `true` \ `false` | 0...1 | If true fuzzy matching is applied to any attributes with the Person Name (PN) Value Representation (VR). It does a prefix word match of any name part inside these attributes. For example, if `PatientName` is `John^Doe`, then `joh`, `do`, `jo do`, `Doe` and `John Doe` all match. However `ohn` doesn't match. |

##### Searchable Attributes

We support searching on the following attributes.

| Attribute Keyword                                          |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PatientName`                                              |
| `PatientID`                                                |
| `ReferencedRequestSequence.AccessionNumber`                |
| `ReferencedRequestSequence.RequestedProcedureID`           |
| `ScheduledProcedureStepStartDateTime`                      |
| `ScheduledStationNameCodeSequence.CodeValue`               |
| `ScheduledStationClassCodeSequence.CodeValue`              |
| `ScheduledStationGeographicLocationCodeSequence.CodeValue` |
| `ProcedureStepState`                                       |
| `StudyInstanceUID`                                         |

> [!NOTE]
> We do not support searching using empty string for any attributes.

##### Search Matching

We support the following matching types.

| Search Type | Supported Attribute | Example |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Range Query | `ScheduledProcedureStepStartDateTime` | `{attributeID}={value1}-{value2}`. For date/time values, we support an inclusive range on the tag. This range is mapped to `attributeID >= {value1} AND attributeID <= {value2}`. If `{value1}` isn't specified, all occurrences of dates/times prior to, and including `{value2}` is matched. Likewise, if `{value2}` isn't specified, all occurrences of `{value1}` and subsequent dates/times are matched. However, one of these values must be present. `{attributeID}={value1}-` and `{attributeID}=-{value2}` are valid, however, `{attributeID}=-` isn't valid. |
| Exact Match | All supported attributes | `{attributeID}={value1}` |
| Fuzzy Match | `PatientName` | Matches any component of the name that starts with the value. |
| WildCard Match | `PatientID`, <br/> `ReferencedRequestSequence.AccessionNumber`, <br/> `ReferencedRequestSequence.RequestedProcedureID`, <br/> `ProcedureStepState`, <br/> `ScheduledStationNameCodeSequence.CodeValue`, <br/> `ScheduledStationClassCodeSequence.CodeValue`, <br/> `ScheduledStationGeographicLocationCodeSequence.CodeValue` | Following wildcard characters are supported: <br/> `*` - Matches zero or more characters. For example - `{attributeID}={val*}` matches "val", "valid", "value" but not "evaluate". <br/> `?` - Matches a single character. For example - `{attributeID}={valu?}` matches "value", "valu1" but not "valued" or "valu" |

> [!NOTE]
> Although we don't support full sequence matching, we do support exact match on the attributes listed that are contained in a sequence.

##### Attribute ID

Tags can be encoded in many ways for the query parameter. We partially implemented the standard as defined in [PS3.18 6.7.1.1.1](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2019a/output/chtml/part18/sect_6.7.html#sect_6.7.1.1.1). The following encodings for a tag are supported.

| Value              | Example       |
| :----------------- | :------------ |
| `{group}{element}` | `00100010`    |
| `{dicomKeyword}`   | `PatientName` |

Example query: 

`../workitems?PatientID=K123&0040A370.00080050=1423JS&includefield=00404005&limit=5&offset=0`

#### Search Response

The response is an array of `0...N` DICOM datasets with the following attributes returned.

* All attributes in [DICOM PowerShell 3.4 Table CC.2.5-3](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part04.html#table_CC.2.5-3) with a Return Key Type of 1 or 2
* All attributes in [DICOM PowerShell 3.4 Table CC.2.5-3](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part04.html#table_CC.2.5-3) with a Return Key Type of 1C for which the conditional requirements are met
* All other Workitem attributes passed as match parameters
* All other Workitem attributes passed as `includefield` parameter values

#### Search Response Codes

The query API returns one of the following status codes in the response:

| Code | Description |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `200 (OK)` | The response payload contains all the matching resource. |
| `206 (Partial Content)` | The response payload contains only some of the search results, and the rest can be requested through the appropriate request. |
| `204 (No Content)` | The search completed successfully but returned no results. |
| `400 (Bad Request)` | There was a problem with the request. For example, invalid Query Parameter syntax. The response body contains details of the failure. |
| `401 (Unauthorized)` | The client isn't authenticated. |
| `403 (Forbidden)` | The user isn't authorized. |
| `424 (Failed Dependency)` | The DICOM service can't access a resource it depends on to complete this request. An example is failure to access the connected Data Lake store, or the key vault for supporting customer-managed key encryption. |
| `503 (Service Unavailable)` | The service is unavailable or busy. Try again later. |

#### Additional notes

The query API doesn't return `413 (request entity too large)`. If the requested query response limit is outside of the acceptable range, a bad request is returned. Anything requested within the acceptable range is resolved.

* Paged results are optimized to return matched newest instance first, which might result in duplicate records in subsequent pages if newer data matching the query was added.
* Matching is case insensitive and accent insensitive for PN VR types.
* Matching is case insensitive and accent sensitive for other string VR types.
* If there's a scenario where canceling a Workitem and querying the same happens at the same time, then the query most likely excludes the Workitem that's getting updated and the response code is `206 (Partial Content)`.
