The workflow is on the left and the trigger condition is on the right.

## Overview

Follow these steps to create a Logic App workflow to consume FHIR events:

1. Set up prerequisites
2. Create a Logic App
3. Create a Logic App workflow

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, you need to have deployed a FHIR service and enabled events. For more information about deploying events, see [Deploy events using the Azure portal](events-deploy-portal.md).

## Creating a Logic App

To set up an automated workflow, you must first create a Logic App. For more information about Logic Apps, see [What is Azure Logic Apps?](./../../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md)

### Specify your Logic App details

Follow these steps:

1. Go to the Azure portal.
2. Search for **Logic App**.
3. Select **Add**.
4. Specify **Basic details**.
5. Specify **Hosting**.
6. Specify **Monitoring**.
7. Specify **Tags**.
8. **Review and create** your Logic App.

You now need to fill out the details of your Logic App. Specify information for the five categories listed in the separate tabs.

:::image type="content" source="media/events-logic-apps/events-logic-tabs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the five tabs for specifying your Logic App." lightbox="media/events-logic-apps/events-logic-tabs.png":::

- Tab 1 - **Basics**
- Tab 2 - **Hosting**
- Tab 3 - **Monitoring**
- Tab 4 - **Tags**
- Tab 5 - **Review + Create**

### Basics - Tab 1

Start by specifying the following basics:

#### Project details

- Subscription
- Resource Group

Select a current subscription and specify an existing or new resource group.

#### Instance details

- Logic App name
- Publish type
- Region

Create a name for your Logic App. You must choose Workflow or Docker Container as your publishing type. Select a region that is compatible with your plan.

#### Plan

- Plan type
- App Service Plan
- Sku and size

Choose a plan type (Standard or Consumption). Create a new Windows Plan name and specify the Sku and size.

#### Zone redundancy

- Zone redundancy deployment

Enabling your plan makes it zone redundant.

### Hosting - Tab 2

Continue specifying your Logic App by selecting **Next: Hosting**.

#### Storage

- Storage type
- Storage account

Choose the type of storage you want to use and the storage account. You can use Azure Storage or add SQL functionality. You must also create a new storage account or use an existing one.

### Monitoring - Tab 3

Continue specifying your Logic App by selecting **Next: Monitoring**.

#### Monitoring with Application Insights

- Enable Application Insights
- Application Insights
- Region

Enable Azure Monitor Application Insights to automatically monitor your application. If you enable insights, you must create a new insight and specify the region.

### Tags - Tab 4

Continue specifying your Logic App by selecting **Next: Tags**.

#### Use tags to categorize resources

Tags are name/value pairs that enable you to categorize resources and view consolidated billing by applying the same tag to multiple resources and resource groups.

This example doesn't use tagging.

### Review + create - Tab 5

Finish specifying your Logic App by selecting **Next: Review + create**.

#### Review your Logic App

Your proposed Logic app displays the following details:

- Subscription
- Resource Group
- Logic App Name
- Runtime stack
- Hosting
- Storage
- Plan
- Monitoring

If you're satisfied with the proposed configuration, select **Create**. If not, select **Previous** to go back and specify new details.

First you see an alert telling you that deployment is initializing. Next you see a new page telling you that the deployment is in progress.

If there are no errors, you'll see a notification telling you that your deployment is complete.

:::image type="content" source="media/events-logic-apps/events-logic-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the notification telling you your deployment is complete." lightbox="media/events-logic-apps/events-logic-complete.png":::

#### Your Logic App dashboard

Azure creates a dashboard when your Logic App is complete. The dashboard shows you the status of your app. You can return to your dashboard by selecting **Overview** in the Logic App menu. Following is an image of the Logic App dashboard:

:::image type="content" source="media/events-logic-apps/events-logic-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of your Logic Apps overview dashboard." lightbox="media/events-logic-apps/events-logic-overview.png":::

You can do the following activities from your dashboard.

- Browse
- Refresh
- Stop
- Restart
- Swap
- Get Publish Profile
- Reset Publish Profile
- Delete

## Creating a Logic App workflow

When your Logic App is running, follow these steps to create a Logic App workflow:

1. Initialize a workflow
2. Configuring a workflow
3. Designing a workflow
4. Adding an action
5. Giving FHIR Reader access
6. Adding a condition
7. Choosing a condition criteria
8. Testing your condition

### Initializing your workflow

Before you begin, you need to have a Logic App configured and running correctly.

Once your Logic App is running, you can create and configure a workflow. To initialize a workflow, follow these steps:

1. Start at the Azure portal.
2. Select **Logic Apps** in Azure services.
3. Select the Logic App you created.
4. Select **Workflows** in the Workflow menu on the left.
5. Select **Add** to add a workflow.

### Configuring a new workflow

You'll see a new panel on the right for creating a workflow.

:::image type="content" source="media/events-logic-apps/events-logic-panel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the panel for creating a workflow." lightbox="media/events-logic-apps/events-logic-panel.png":::

You can specify the details of the new workflow in the panel on the right.

#### Creating a new workflow for the Logic App

To set up a new workflow, fill in these details:

- Workflow Name
- State type

Provide a new name for your workflow. Indicate whether you want the workflow to be stateful or stateless. Stateful is for business processes and stateless is for processing IoT events.

When you specify the details, select **Create** to begin designing your workflow.

### Designing the workflow

In your new workflow, select the name of the enabled workflow.

You can write code to design a workflow for your application, but for this tutorial, choose the **Designer** option on the **Developer** menu.

Next, select **Choose an operation** to display the **Add a Trigger** blade on the right. Then search for "Azure Event Grid" and select the following **Azure** tab. The Event Grid isn't a Logic App Built-in.

:::image type="content" source="media/events-logic-apps/events-logic-grid.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the search results for Azure Event Grid." lightbox="media/events-logic-apps/events-logic-grid.png":::

When you see the "Azure Event Grid" icon, select it to display the **Triggers and Actions** available from Event Grid. For more information about Event Grid, see [What is Azure Event Grid?](./../../event-grid/overview.md).

Select **When a resource event occurs** to set up a trigger for the Azure Event Grid.

To tell Event Grid how to respond to the trigger, you must specify parameters and add actions.

#### Parameter settings

You need to specify the parameters for the trigger:

- Subscription
- Resource Type
- Resource Name
- Event type items

Fill in the details for subscription, resource type, and resource name. Then you must specify the event types you want to respond to. The event types used in this article are:

- Resource created.
- Resource deleted.
- Resource updated.

For more information about supported event types, see [Frequently asked questions about events](events-faqs.md).

### Adding an HTTP action

Once you specify the trigger events, you must add more details. Select the **+** below the **When a resource event occurs** button.

You need to add a specific action. Select **Choose an operation** to continue. Then, for the operation, search for "HTTP" and select **Built-in** to select an HTTP operation. The HTTP action allows you to query the FHIR service.

The options in this example are:

- Method is "Get"
- URL is `"concat('https://', triggerBody()?['subject'], '/_history/', triggerBody()?['dataVersion'])"`.
- Authentication type is **Managed Identity**.
- Audience is `"concat('https://', triggerBody()?['data']['resourceFhirAccount'])"`.

### Allow FHIR Reader access to your Logic App

At this point, you need to give the FHIR Reader access to your app, so it can verify that the event details are correct. Follow these steps to give it access:

1. Go back to your Logic App and select the **Identity** menu.

2. In the System assigned tab, make sure the **Status** is "On".

3. Select Azure role assignments. Select **Add role assignment**.

4. Specify the following options:

   - Scope = Subscription
   - Subscription = your subscription
   - Role = FHIR Data Reader.

When you've specified the first four steps, add the role assignment by Managed identity, using **Subscription, Managed identity (Logic App Standard)**, and select your Logic App by selecting the name and then the **Select** button. Finally, select **Review + assign** to assign the role.

### Add a condition

After giving FHIR Reader access to your app, go back to the Logic App workflow Designer. Then add a condition to determine whether the event is one you want to process. Select the **+** below HTTP and select "Choose an operation". On the right, search for the word **Condition**. Select **Built-in** to display the Control icon. Next select **Actions** and choose **Condition**.

When the condition is ready, you can specify what actions happen if the condition is true or false.

### Choosing a condition criteria

In order to specify whether you want to take action for the specific event, begin specifying the criteria by selecting **Condition** in the workflow. A set of condition choices are displayed.

Under the **And** box, add these two conditions:

- resourceType
- Event Type

#### resourceType

The expression for getting the resourceType is `body('HTTP')?['resourceType']`.

#### Event Type

You can select **Event Type** from the Dynamic Content.

Here's an example of the Condition criteria.

:::image type="content" source="media/events-logic-apps/events-logic-condition.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the condition criteria for your workflow." lightbox="media/events-logic-apps/events-logic-condition.png":::

#### Save your workflow

When you've entered the condition criteria, save your workflow.

#### Workflow dashboard

To check the status of your workflow, select **Overview** in the workflow menu. A workflow dashboard appears as follows.

:::image type="content" source="media/events-logic-apps/events-logic-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Logic App workflow dashboard." lightbox="media/events-logic-apps/events-logic-dashboard.png":::

You can do the following operations from your workflow dashboard:

- Run trigger
- Refresh
- Enable
- Disable
- Delete

### Condition testing

Save your workflow by selecting the **Save** button.

To test your new workflow, do the following.

1. Add a new Patient FHIR Resource to your FHIR Service.
2. Allow time for the update to complete, then check the Overview webpage of your Logic App workflow.
3. The event should be shaded in green if the action was successful.
4. If it failed, the event is shaded in red.

Following is an example of a workflow trigger success operation.
