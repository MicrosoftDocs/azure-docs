# What are events?

Events in Azure Health Data Services allow you to subscribe to and receive notifications of changes to health data in the FHIR&reg; service or the DICOM&reg; service. Events also enable you to trigger services based changes or other actions to health data, such as starting workflows, sending email, text messages, or alerts. 

Events are:

- **Scalable**. Events support growth and change in an organization's healthcare data needs by using the [Azure Event Grid service](../../event-grid/overview.md) and creating a [system topic](../../event-grid/system-topics.md) for Azure Health Data Services. For more information, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](../../event-grid/event-schema.md) and [Azure Health Data Services as an Event Grid source](../../event-grid/event-schema-azure-health-data-services.md).

- **Configurable**. Choose which FHIR and DICOM event types trigger event notifications. Use advanced features built into the Azure Event Grid service, such as filters, dead-lettering, and retry policies to tune message delivery options for events. 

- **Extensible**. Use events to send FHIR resource and DICOM image change messages to [Azure Event Hubs](../../event-hubs/event-hubs-about.md) or [Azure Functions](../../azure-functions/functions-overview.md) to trigger downstream automated workflows that enhance operational data, data analysis, and visibility of the incoming data capturing in near real time.
 
- **Secure**. Events are built on a platform that supports protected health information (PHI) compliance with privacy, safety, and security standards. Use [Azure managed identities](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) to provide secure access from the Event Grid system topic to the events message-receiving endpoints of your choice.

## Supported operations

Events support these operations:

| Operation           | Trigger condition                |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| FhirResourceCreated | A FHIR resource was created.      |
| FhirResourceUpdated | A FHIR resource was updated.      |
| FhirResourceDeleted | A FHIR resource was soft deleted. |
| DicomImageCreated   | A DICOM image was created.        |
| DicomImageDeleted   | A DICOM image was deleted.        |
| DicomImageUpdated   | A DICOM image was updated.        |

For more information about delete types in the FHIR service, see [REST API capabilities in the FHIR service in Azure Health Data Services](../fhir/rest-api-capabilities.md).

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Event notifications are sent only when the capability is turned on. The events capability doesn't send messages for past changes or when the capability is turned off.
