# Register a resource application in Microsoft Entra ID for Azure API for FHIR

[!INCLUDE[retirement banner](../includes/healthcare-apis-azure-api-fhir-retirement.md)]

In this article, you learn how to register a resource (or API) application in Microsoft Entra ID. A resource application is a Microsoft Entra representation of the FHIR&reg; server API itself, and client applications can request access to the resource when authenticating. The resource application is also known as the *audience* in OAuth parlance.

## Azure API for FHIR

If you're using the Azure API for FHIR, a resource application is automatically created when you deploy the service. As long as you're using the Azure API for FHIR in the same Microsoft Entra tenant as you're deploying your application, you can skip this how-to-guide and instead deploy your Azure API for FHIR to get started.

If you're using a different Microsoft Entra tenant (not associated with your subscription), you can use PowerShell to import the Azure API for FHIR resource application into your tenant.

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId 4f6778d8-5aef-43dc-a1ff-b073724b9495 -Role Contributor
```

Or you can use Azure CLI.

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp create --id 4f6778d8-5aef-43dc-a1ff-b073724b9495
```

## FHIR Server for Azure

If you're using the open source FHIR Server for Azure, follow the steps on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/blob/master/docs/Register-Resource-Application.md) to register a resource application.
