# Exporting de-identified data for Azure API for FHIR

[!INCLUDE[retirement banner](../includes/healthcare-apis-azure-api-fhir-retirement.md)]

> [!Note] 
> Results when using the de-identified export will vary based on factors such as data inputted, and functions selected by the customer. Microsoft is unable to evaluate the de-identified export outputs or determine the acceptability for customer's use cases and compliance needs. The de-identified export is not guaranteed to meet any specific legal, regulatory, or compliance requirements.

The `$export` command can be used to export de-identified data from the FHIR&reg; server. It uses the anonymization engine from [Tools for Health Data Anonymization](https://github.com/microsoft/Tools-for-Health-Data-Anonymization/blob/master/docs/FHIR-anonymization.md), and takes anonymization config details in query parameters. You can create your own anonymization config file, or use the [sample config file](https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Tools-for-Anonymization#sample-configuration-file-for-hipaa-safe-harbor-method) for HIPAA Safe Harbor method as a starting point. 

 `https://<<FHIR service base URL>>/$export?_container=<<container_name>>&_anonymizationConfig=<<config file name>>&_anonymizationConfigEtag=<<ETag on storage>>`

> [!Note] 
> Currently, Azure API for FHIR only supports de-identified export at the system level (`$export)`.

The following table provides query parameter details for de-identified export.

|Query parameter            | Example |Optionality| Description|
|---------------------------|---------|-----------|------------|
| _\_anonymizationConfig_   |DemoConfig.json|Required for de-identified export |Name of the configuration file. See the configuration file format [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Tools-for-Health-Data-Anonymization/blob/master/docs/FHIR-anonymization.md#configuration-file-format). This file should be kept inside a container named **anonymization** within the same Azure storage account that is configured as the export location. |
| _\_anonymizationConfigEtag_|"0x8D8494A069489EC"|Optional for de-identified export|This is the Etag of the configuration file. You can get the Etag using Azure storage explorer from the blob property|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Both raw export and de-identified export write to the same Azure storage account specified as part of export configuration. It is recommended that you use different containers corresponding to different de-identified configurations, and manage user access at the container level.
