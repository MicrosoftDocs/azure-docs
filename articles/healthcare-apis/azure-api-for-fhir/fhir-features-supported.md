# Features

Azure API for FHIR&reg; provides a fully managed deployment of the Microsoft FHIR Server for Azure. The server is an implementation of the [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir) standard. This document lists the main features of the FHIR Server.

## FHIR version

Latest version supported: `4.0.1`

Previous versions also currently supported include: `3.0.2`

## REST API

Following is a summary of the supported RESTful capabilities. For more information on the implementation of these capabilities, see [FHIR REST API capabilities](fhir-rest-api-capabilities.md).

| intermediaries                 | No        | No        | |

> [!Note] 
> In the Azure API for FHIR and the open-source FHIR server backed by Azure Cosmos DB, the chained search and reverse chained search is an MVP implementation. To accomplish chained search on Azure Cosmos DB, the implementation walks down the search expression and issues sub-queries to resolve the matched resources. This is done for each level of the expression. If any query returns more than 1000 results, an error is thrown.

## Extended Operations

All the operations that are supported that extend the REST API.

## Persistence

The Microsoft FHIR Server has a pluggable persistence module (see [`Microsoft.Health.Fhir.Core.Features.Persistence`](https://github.com/Microsoft/fhir-server/tree/master/src/Microsoft.Health.Fhir.Core/Features/Persistence)).

Currently the FHIR Server open-source code includes an implementation for [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/index-overview) and [SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/).

Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed multi-model (NoSQL, MongoDB, and others) database. It supports different [consistency levels](/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels). The default deployment template configures the FHIR Server with `Strong` consistency, but the consistency policy can be modified (generally relaxed) on a request by request basis using the `x-ms-consistency-level` request header.

## Role-based access control

The FHIR Server uses [Microsoft Entra ID](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) for access control. Specifically, role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced if the `FhirServer:Security:Enabled` configuration parameter is set to `true`, and all requests (except `/metadata`) to the FHIR Server must have `Authorization` request header set to `Bearer <TOKEN>`. The token must contain one or more roles as defined in the `roles` claim. A request is allowed if the token contains a role that allows the specified action on the specified resource.

Currently, the allowed actions for a given role are applied *globally* on the API.

## Service limits

* [**Request Units (RUs)**](/azure/cosmos-db/concepts-limits) - You can configure up to 100,000 RUs in the portal for Azure API for FHIR. You need a minimum of 400 RUs or 40 RUs/GB, whichever is larger. If you need more than 100,000 RUs, you can put in a support ticket to have the RUs increased. The maximum available is 1,000,000. In addition, we support [autoscaling of RUs](autoscale-azure-api-fhir.md).

* **Bundle size** - Each bundle is limited to 500 items.

* **Data size** - Data/Documents must each be less than 2 MB.

* **Subscription limit** - By default, each subscription is limited to a maximum of 10 FHIR server instances. If you need more instances per subscription, open a support ticket and provide details about your needs.

* **Resource size** - Individual resource size, including history, shouldn't exceed 20 GB.
