# Store profiles in Azure API for FHIR

[!INCLUDE[retirement banner](../includes/healthcare-apis-azure-api-fhir-retirement.md)]

HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&reg;) defines a standard and interoperable way to store and exchange healthcare data. Even within the base FHIR specification, it can be helpful to define other rules or extensions based on the context that FHIR is being used. For such context-specific uses of FHIR, **FHIR profiles** are used for the extra layer of specifications. [FHIR profile](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html) allows you to narrow down and customize resource definitions using constraints and extensions.

Azure API for FHIR allows validating resources against profiles to see if the resources conform to the profiles. This article guides you through the basics of FHIR profiles and how to store them. For more information about FHIR profiles outside of this article, visit [HL7.org](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html).

## FHIR profile: the basics

A profile sets additional context on the resource that's represented as a `StructureDefinition` resource. A `StructureDefinition` defines a set of rules on the content of a resource or data type, such as what elements a resource has and what values these elements can take.

Some examples of how profiles can modify the base resource are:

- Restrict cardinality: For example, you can set the maximum cardinality on an element to 0, which means that the element is ruled out in the specific context.
- Restrict the contents of an element to a single fixed value.
- Define required extensions for the resource. 
 

A `StructureDefinition` is identified by its canonical URL: `http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/{profile}`.

Here are some examples.

- `http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-birthPlace` is a base profile that requires information on the registered address of birth of the patient.
- `http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/bmi` is another base profile that defines how to represent Body Mass Index (BMI) observations.
- `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-allergyintolerance` is a US Core profile that sets minimum expectations for `AllergyIntolerance` resource associated with a patient, and it identifies mandatory fields such as extensions and value sets.

When a resource conforms to a profile, the profile is specified inside the `profile` element of the resource. Following is an example of the beginning of a `Patient` resource, which has the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/StructureDefinition/C4BB-Patient.

```json
{
  "resourceType" : "Patient",
  "id" : "ExamplePatient1",
  "meta" : {
    "lastUpdated" : "2020-10-30T09:48:01.8512764-04:00",
    "source" : "Organization/PayerOrganizationExample1",
    "profile" : [
      "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/StructureDefinition/C4BB-Patient"
    ]
  },
```

> [!NOTE]
> Profiles must build on top of the base resource and cannot conflict with the base resource. For example, if an element has a cardinality of 1..1, the profile cannot make it optional.

Profiles are specified by various Implementation Guides (IGs). The following is a list of common IGs. For more information, visit the specific IG site to learn more about the IG and the profiles defined within it.

- [US Core](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/)
- [CARIN Blue Button](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb)
- [Da Vinci Payer Data Exchange](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pdex)
- [Argonaut](https://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/pd/)

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure API for FHIR by default does not store any profiles from implementation guides. You will need to load them into the Azure API for FHIR.

## Accessing profiles and storing profiles

### Storing profiles

To store profiles in Azure API for FHIR, you can `PUT` the `StructureDefinition` with the profile content in the body of the request. An update or a conditional update are both good methods to store profiles on the FHIR service. Use the conditional update if you're unsure which to use.

Standard `PUT`: `PUT http://<your Azure API for FHIR base URL>/StructureDefinition/profile-id`

**or**

Conditional update: `PUT http://<your Azure API for FHIR base URL>/StructureDefinition?url=http://sample-profile-url`

```
{ 
"resourceType" : "StructureDefinition",
"id" : "profile-id",
"url": "http://sample-profile-url"
	…
}
```

For example, if you'd like to store the `us-core-allergyintolerance` profile, you'd use the following rest command with the US Core allergy intolerance profile in the body. We included a snippet of this profile for the example.

```rest
PUT https://myAzureAPIforFHIR.azurehealthcareapis.com/StructureDefinition?url=http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-allergyintolerance
```

```json
{
    "resourceType" : "StructureDefinition",
    "id" : "us-core-allergyintolerance",
    "text" : {
        "status" : "extensions"
    },
    "url" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-allergyintolerance",
    "version" : "3.1.1",
    "name" : "USCoreAllergyIntolerance",
    "title" : "US  Core AllergyIntolerance Profile",
    "status" : "active",
    "experimental" : false,
    "date" : "2020-06-29",
        "publisher" : "HL7 US Realm Steering Committee",
    "contact" : [
    {
      "telecom" : [
        {
          "system" : "url",
          "value" : "http://www.healthit.gov"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
    "description" : "Defines constraints and extensions on the AllergyIntolerance resource for the minimal set of data to query and retrieve allergy information.",
```
For more examples, see the [US Core sample REST file](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/blob/main/docs/rest/PayerDataExchange/USCore.http) on the open-source site that walks through storing US Core profiles. To get the most up-to-date profiles, you should get the profiles directly from HL7 and the implementation guide that defines them.

### Viewing profiles

You can access your existing custom profiles using a `GET` request, ``GET http://<your Azure API for FHIR base URL>/StructureDefinition?url={canonicalUrl}``, where `{canonicalUrl}` is the canonical URL of your profile.

For example, use the following if you want to view a US Core Goal resource profile.

`GET https://myworkspace-myfhirserver.fhir.azurehealthcareapis.com/StructureDefinition?url=http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-goal`

This returns the `StructureDefinition` resource for US Core Goal profile, which starts like the following.

```json
{
  "resourceType" : "StructureDefinition",
  "id" : "us-core-goal",
  "url" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-goal",
  "version" : "3.1.1",
  "name" : "USCoreGoalProfile",
  "title" : "US Core Goal Profile",
  "status" : "active",
  "experimental" : false,
  "date" : "2020-07-21",
  "publisher" : "HL7 US Realm Steering Committee",
  "contact" : [
    {
      "telecom" : [
        {
          "system" : "url",
          "value" : "http://www.healthit.gov"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "description" : "Defines constraints and extensions on the Goal resource for the minimal set of data to query and retrieve a patient's goal(s).",

}
```
> [!NOTE]
> You'll only see the profiles that you've loaded into Azure API for FHIR.


Azure API for FHIR doesn't return `StructureDefinition` instances for the base profiles, but they can be found in the HL7 website.

- `http://hl7.org/fhir/Observation.profile.json.html`
- `http://hl7.org/fhir/Patient.profile.json.html`


### Profiles in the capability statement

The `Capability Statement` lists all possible behaviors of Azure API for FHIR. Azure API for FHIR updates the capability statement with details of the stored profiles in the following forms.

- `CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.profile`
- `CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.supportedProfile`

For example, if you save a US Core Patient profile, which starts like the following.

```json
{
  "resourceType": "StructureDefinition",
  "id": "us-core-patient",
  "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient",
  "version": "3.1.1",
  "name": "USCorePatientProfile",
  "title": "US Core Patient Profile",
  "status": "active",
  "experimental": false,
  "date": "2020-06-27",
  "publisher": "HL7 US Realm Steering Committee",
```

And send a `GET` request for your `metadata`:

`GET http://<your Azure API for FHIR base URL>/metadata`

You're returned a `CapabilityStatement` that includes the following information on the US Core Patient profile you uploaded to Azure API for FHIR.

```json
...
{
    "type": "Patient",
    "profile": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient",
    "supportedProfile":[
        "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient"
    ],
```
### Bindings in Profiles
A terminology service is a set of functions that can perform operations on medical “terminologies" such as validating codes, translating codes, expanding value sets, and other operations.<br>
The Azure API for FHIR service doesn't support terminology service. Information for supported operations (`$`), resource types, and interactions can be found in the service's `CapabilityStatement`. Resource types `ValueSet`, `StructureDefinition` and `CodeSystem` are supported with basic create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations and Search (as defined in the `CapabilityStatement`), as well as being leveraged by the system for use in `$validate`. 

ValueSets can contain a complex set of rules and external references. Today, the service only considers the pre-expanded inline codes. Customers need to upload supported ValueSets to the FHIR server before utilizing the `$validate` operation. The `ValueSet` resources must be uploaded to the FHIR server, using PUT or conditional update, as mentioned in the [storing profiles](#storing-profiles) section.
