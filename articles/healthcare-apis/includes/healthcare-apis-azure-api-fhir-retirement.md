> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Azure API for FHIR will be retired on September 30, 2026.** Follow the [migration strategies](../fhir/migration-strategies.md) to transition to Azure Health Data Services FHIR service by that date. Due to the transition of Azure API for FHIR to Azure Health Data Services, new deployments won't be allowed beginning April 1, 2025. 

[Azure Health Data Services FHIR service](../healthcare-apis-overview.md) is the evolved version of Azure API for FHIR that enables customers to manage [FHIR](../fhir/overview.md), DICOM, and MedTech services with integrations into other Azure services.
