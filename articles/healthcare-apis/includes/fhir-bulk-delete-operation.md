The bulk delete capability allows you to delete resources from FHIR&reg; service asynchronously. Bulk delete capability in FHIR service is supported with operations: `$bulk-delete` and `$bulk-delete-soft-deleted`. `$bulk-delete` operation allows you to delete resources in the FHIR service, except soft deleted resources. To delete soft deleted FHIR resources, you need to use `$bulk-delete-soft-deleted` operation.

FHIR service requires specific headers and roles enabled to use bulk delete capability

## Headers
Bulk delete capability header parameters are:
  
- **Accept**: application/fhir+json

- **Prefer**: respond-async

## Role requirements

- A user or application needs to be assigned to the `FHIR Data Writer` role, to perform the bulk delete capability.
- a user or application needs to be assigned to the `FHIR Data Contributor` role, to perform bulk delete capability with a hard delete query parameter and bulk delete on soft deleted resources.
  
## Bulk delete operation details
### `$bulk-delete` operation
You can execute the `$bulk-delete` operation at the system level or for individual resource types. 

  - **System level**: Execution of the operation at system-level enables deletion of FHIR resources across all the resource types on the FHIR server.
    
    ```http
      DELETE  /$bulk-delete
    ```
  
  - **Individual resource types**: Execution of the operation for individual resource types allows deletion of FHIR resources that map to the resource type in the URL.
    
    ```http
      DELETE /<Resource Type>/$bulk-delete
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Use the `$bulk-delete` operation with caution. Deleted resources can't be restored. We recommend that you first run a FHIR search with the same parameters as the bulk delete job to verify the data that you want to delete.


#### Query parameters

Query parameters allow you to filter the raw resources you plan to delete. To support filtering, the query parameters are: 

|Query parameter        | Default Value   |  Description|
|------------------------|---|------------|
|_hardDelete|False|Allows you to hard delete a resource. If you don't pass this parameter or set hardDelete to false, the historic versions of the resource are still available.|
|_purgeHistory|False|Allows you to delete history versions associated with resource. It doesn't delete the current version of the resource and soft deleted resources. Note: When _purgeHistory used with the _hardDelete parameter set to true, it permanently deletes all versions associated with the resource.|
|FHIR service supported search parameters||Allows you to specify search criteria and resources matching the search criteria are deleted. For example: `address:contains=Meadow subject:Patient.birthdate=1987-02-20`|

All the query parameters are optional.

### `$bulk-delete-soft-deleted` operation
To delete soft deleted resources within a FHIR service -$bulk-delete-soft-deleted operation can be used. This operation can be executed at the system level or for individual resource types. 

## Bulk delete operation response 

After a request is made to bulk delete FHIR resources, in response you receive a Content-Location header with the absolute URL of an endpoint for subsequent status requests, such as a polling endpoint.

### Polling endpoint

Request to the polling endpoint is one of the four outcomes depending on the status of the bulk delete job. The outcome is provided within OperationOutcome of the FHIR response.

1. **Jobs in progress**: This outcome states the job is in progress. Status Code 202.

1. **Completed**: This outcome states the job completed successfully. At completion, the information about the number of resources deleted is provided at individual resource type level. Status code 200.

1. **Canceled**: This outcome states the user canceled the job and provides information on the number of resources deleted at the individual resource level. Status code 200.

1. **Failed**: This outcome states the job failed. Status code depends on the failure type.

Sample request and response for determining the status 
request: 

  ```
  {{fhir_url}}/_operations/bulk-delete/<job id>
  ```
Here's a sample response for a successfully completed delete job:
 
```
{
    "resourceType": "Parameters",
    "parameter": [
        {
            "name": "ResourceDeletedCount",
            "part": [
                {
                    "name": "Practitioner",
                    "valueInteger64": 10.0
                },
                {
                    "name": "Specimen",
                    "valueInteger64": 7.0
                },
                {
                    "name": "Device",
                    "valueInteger64": 3.0
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Error messages

Here's a list of error messages that might occur if the bulk delete operation fails.

|HTTP Status Code | Details | Recommended action |
|-----------------|---------|--------------------|
|500 |Connection to database failed | To resolve the issue, create a Get Support ticket.|
|429 |Throttling errors | For Azure API for FHIR, you can increase RUs and retry the job. For Azure Health Data Services FHIR Server, you can try to delete a smaller amount of data at a time. |

## FAQ

- What are the steps for resolution if my bulk delete job seems to be stuck?<br/><br/>   To check if a bulk delete job is stuck, run a FHIR search with the same parameters as the bulk delete job and _summary=count. If the count of resources is going down, the job is working. You can also cancel the bulk delete job and try again. 

- Do API interactions see any latency when a bulk delete operation job is executed concurrently?<br/><br/>When you run a bulk delete operation, you might see increased latency on concurrent calls to the service. To avoid a latency increase, we recommend that you cancel the bulk delete job, and then rerun it during a period of lower traffic.

> [!NOTE]
> If you cancel and then restart a bulk delete job, the deletion process resumes from where it was stopped.

## Preview capabilities for the bulk delete operation
### `$bulk-delete` with `_include` and `_revinclude`
Note: The `$bulk-delete` operation now supports using `_include` and `_revinclude` in the search criteria for conditional and bulk delete. This new feature doesn't affect current behavior of singular deletes, which doesn't support extra parameters.Â Additionally, when using bulk delete with FHIR search parameters, consider using the same query in a FHIR search first, so that you can verify the data that you want to delete.

Some examples of using `$bulk-delete` with `_include` and `_revinclude`:

The following example using `_revinclude` will bulk delete all Patient resources that were last updated before December 18, 2021, and all resources that reference to those patients:

`DELETE [base]/Patient/$bulk-delete?_lastUpdated=lt2021-12-18&_revinclude=*:*`

The following example using `_include` will bulk delete all DiagnosticReport resources that were last updated before 12/18/2021, as well as all ServiceRequest resources that are referenced by those DiagnosticReport resources (via DiagnosticReport.basedOn relationship), and all Encounter resources that are referenced by those ServiceRequest resources (via ServiceRequest.encounters relationship):

`DELETE [base]/DiagnosticReport/$bulk-delete?_lastUpdated=lt2021-12-12&_include=DiagnosticReport:based-on:ServiceRequest&_include:iterate=ServiceRequest:encounter`

### `$bulk-delete` with `_not-referenced`
>[!Note]
> The `_not-referenced` feature is available in Azure Health Data Services FHIR Server only, and isn't available in Azure API for FHIR.

As mentioned in the "Query parameters" section, the `$bulk-delete` operation uses FHIR service supported search parameters. This includes the new `_not-referenced` parameter, which allows you to search for and delete resources that are not referenced by any other resources. 

The following example will bulk delete all Patient resources that are not referenced by any other resources:  
`DELETE [base]/Patient/$bulk-delete?_not-referenced=*:*`




### `$bulk-delete` with excluded resource types

The `$bulk-delete` operation supports configuring excluded resource types. When you perform a bulk delete operation, these resource types are excluded from deletion. This means that if you include this parameter and specify a comma separated list of resource types in your bulk delete request, those resource types will not be deleted, and the operation will complete successfully deleting everything else in the request, without deleting the specified excluded resource types.

The following example will delete all resources in your FHIR server, except for the `Patient` resource type:  
`DELETE [base]/$bulk-delete?excludedResourceTypes=patient`

The following example will delete all resources in your FHIR server, except for the `Patient` and `Observation` resource types:  
`DELETE [base]/$bulk-delete?excludedResourceTypes=patient,observation`

### `$bulk-delete` and removing references


The `$bulk-delete` operation supports removing references to resources that are being deleted. This means that if you delete a resource that is referenced by another resource, the reference will be removed from the referencing resource. The reference that has been removed with be replaced with the following value:

`"display": "Referenced resource deleted"`

>[!Note]
> This feature only works with hard delete, so you must also set the `_hardDelete` query parameter to `true`.

This is useful for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that resources that are no longer needed are properly cleaned up.

The following example will bulk hard delete all Patient resources, and remove references to those patients from other resources. 

`DELETE [base]/Patient/$bulk-delete?_remove-references=true&_hardDelete=true`

In the example above, if a Patient resource is referenced by a DiagnosticReport resource and an Observation resource, the reference to that Patient will be removed from the DiagnosticReport and Observation resources. 

 For an Observation's subject reference:

Before delete:

`"subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/example-patient-id",
}`
 
After delete:

`"subject": {
    "display": "Referenced resource deleted"
}`
