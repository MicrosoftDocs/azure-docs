# Purge history operation
`$purge-history` is an operation that allows you to delete the history of a single Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;) resource. This operation isn't defined in the FHIR specification, but it's useful for [history management](fhir-versioning-policy-and-history-management.md) in large FHIR service instances.

## Overview of purge history

The `$purge-history` operation was created to help with the management of resource history in FHIR service. It's uncommon to need to purge resource history. However, it's needed in cases when the system level or resource level [versioning policy](fhir-versioning-policy-and-history-management.md) changes, and you want to clean up existing resource history.

Since `$purge-history` is a resource level operation (versus a type level or system level operation) you need to run the operation for every resource from which you want to remove the history.

## Examples of purge history

To use `$purge-history`, you must add `/$purge-history` to the end of a standard delete request. The template of the request is:

```http
DELETE <FHIR-Service-Url>/<Resource-Type>/<Resource-Id>/$purge-history
```

For example:

```http
DELETE https://workspace-fhir.fhir.azurehealthcareapis.com/Observation/123/$purge-history
```
