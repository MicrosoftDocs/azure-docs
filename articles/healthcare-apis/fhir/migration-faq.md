# FAQ about migration from Azure API for FHIR

## When will Azure API for FHIR be retired?

Azure API for FHIR&reg; will be retired on September 30, 2026.

## Are new deployments of Azure API for FHIR allowed?

Due to the retirement of Azure API for FHIR after April 1, 2025 customers won't be able to create new deployments of Azure API of FHIR. Until April 1, 2025 new deployments are allowed.

## Why is Microsoft retiring Azure API for FHIR?

Azure API for FHIR is a service that was purpose built for protected health information (PHI), meeting regional compliance requirements. In March 2022, we announced the general availability of Azure Health Data Services, which enables quick deployment of managed, enterprise-grade FHIR, DICOM, and MedTech services for diverse health data integration. With this new experience, we’re retiring Azure API for FHIR.

Azure Health Data Service FHIR service offers a rich set of capabilities such as:

- Consumption-based pricing model where customers pay only for used storage and throughput.
- Support for transaction bundles.
- Chained search improvements.
- Improved ingress and egress of data with `$import`, and `$export`, including new features such as incremental import.
- Events to trigger new workflows when FHIR resources are created, updated, or deleted.
- Connectors to Azure Synapse Analytics, Power BI and Azure Machine Learning for enhanced analytics.

After September 21, 2026, applications relying on SMART on FHIR proxy will report errors when accessing the FHIR service.

SMART on FHIR (Enhanced) provides more capabilities than SMART on FHIR proxy, and meets requirements in the SMART on FHIR Implementation Guide (v 1.0.0) and §170.315(g)(10) Standardized API for patient and population services criterion.
