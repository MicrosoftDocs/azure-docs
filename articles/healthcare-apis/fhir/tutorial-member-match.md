# $member-match operation in FHIR service

[$member-match](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-hrex/2020Sep/OperationDefinition-member-match.html) is an operation that is defined as part of the Da Vinci Health Record Exchange (HRex). In this guide, we'll walk through what $member-match is and how to use it.

## Overview of $member-match

The $member-match operation was created to help with the payer-to-payer data exchange, by allowing a new payer to get a unique identifier for a patient from the patientâ€™s previous payer. The $member-match operation requires three pieces of information to be passed in the body of the request.

* Patient demographics
* The old coverage information
* The new coverage information (not required based on our implementation)

After the data is passed in, the FHIR&reg; service in Azure Health Data Services validates that it can find a patient that exactly matches the demographics passed in with the old coverage information. If a result is found, the response is a bundle with the original patient data plus a new identifier added in from the old payer, and the old coverage information.

> [!NOTE]
> The specification describes passing in and back the new coverage information. We've decided to omit that data to keep the results smaller.

## Example of $member-match

To use $member-match, use the following call.

`POST {{fhirurl}}/Patient/$member-match`

You need to include a parameters resource in the body that includes the patient, the old coverage, and the new coverage. To see a JSON representation, see [$member-match example request](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-hrex/2020Sep/Parameters-member-match-in.json.html).

If a single match is found, you receive a 200 response with another identifier added.

If the $member-match can't find a unique match, you receive a 422 response with an error code.

## Next steps

In this guide, you've learned about the $member-match operation. Next, you can learn about testing the Da Vinci Payer Data Exchange IG in Touchstone, which requires the $member-match operation.
