## Role-based access control

FHIR service uses [Microsoft Entra ID](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) for access control. 

## Service limits

* **Bundle size** - Each bundle is limited to 500 items.
* **Subscription Limit** - By default, each subscription is limited to a maximum of 10 FHIR services. The limit can be used in one or many workspaces.
* **Storage size** - By default each FHIR instance is limited to storage capacity of 4 TB. To deploy a FHIR instance with storage capacity beyond 4 TB, create support request with Issue type **Service and Subscription limit (quotas)**.
