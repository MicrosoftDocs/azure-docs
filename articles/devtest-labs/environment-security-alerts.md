# Security alerts for environments in Azure DevTest Labs
As a lab user, you can view Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts for your labs. Defender for Cloud automatically collects, analyzes, and integrates log data. Data comes from Azure resources, the network, and connected solutions, like firewall and endpoint protection. Defender for Cloud detects real threats and reduces false positives. Defender for Cloud:

- Lists prioritized security alerts.
- Provides information to quickly investigate problems.
- Recommends how to remediate attacks.

## Prerequisites
Currently, you can view security alerts only for platform as a service (PaaS) environments deployed into your lab. To test or use this feature, [deploy an environment into your lab](devtest-lab-create-environment-from-arm.md). 

## View security alerts for an environment

1. On the home page for your lab, select **Security alerts** on the left menu. You should see the number of security alerts (high, medium, and low). Learn more on [how alerts are classified](../security-center/security-center-alerts-overview.md#how-are-alerts-classified).
