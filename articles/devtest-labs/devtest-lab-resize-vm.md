# Resize a lab VM in Azure DevTest Labs

Azure DevTest Labs supports changing the size of a lab virtual machine (VM), based on changing needs for CPU, network, or disk performance. This article describes how to resize a lab VM.

## Prerequisites

- To resize a VM, you must be a lab administrator or an owner of the VM.
- If the lab sets an [allowed VM sizes](devtest-lab-set-lab-policy.md#set-allowed-virtual-machine-sizes) policy, you can resize the VM only to sizes that the policy permits.

## Stop the VM

To avoid losing work, stop the VM before you resize it. To stop a VM, disconnect from it, and select **Stop** on the top toolbar of the VM's **Overview** page in the [Azure portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=525040).

1. On the VM's **Overview** page, select **Size** under **Settings** in the left navigation menu.

You can check the status of the resize operation in the **Notifications** window.

>[!NOTE]
>If the resize operation fails with an error that **Resizing virtual machines with shared IP configuration is not supported**, you need to add and associate a Public IP address to the VM before you can resize it. For more information, see [Associate a public IP address to a virtual machine](/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/associate-public-ip-address-vm).

When the resize operation finishes, you can start the VM by selecting **Start** from the VM **Overview** page top toolbar, and then connect to the VM by selecting **Connect** in the toolbar.
