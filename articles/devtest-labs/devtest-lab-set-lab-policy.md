# Manage lab policies in Azure DevTest Labs

This article describes how Azure DevTest Labs administrators can manage lab policies to control lab costs, minimize waste, and improve manageability. Lab policies you can set include:

- [Allowed virtual machine (VM) sizes](#allowed-virtual-machine-sizes)
- [Maximum VMs per user](#virtual-machines-per-user)
- [Maximum VMs per lab](#virtual-machines-per-lab)
- [Autoshutdown schedule](#autoshutdown)
- [Autostart schedule](#autostart)
- [Autoshutdown policy](#autoshutdown-policy)

## Prerequisites

**Contributor** or **Owner** level permissions in the lab.

## Set lab policies

To set lab policies:

1. On your lab page in the [Azure portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=525040), select **Configuration and policies** from the left navigation menu.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/devtest-lab-set-lab-policy/configuration-policies-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Configuration and policies menu for a lab.":::

1. On the **Configuration and policies** page, select the policy you want to configure from the **Settings** and **Schedules** sections of the left navigation menu.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/devtest-lab-set-lab-policy/policies-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a lab's Configuration and Policies options.":::

<a name="set-allowed-virtual-machine-sizes"></a>
### Allowed virtual machine sizes

This policy limits the VM sizes that users can create in the lab. The default policy setting is **All sizes**.

1. On the lab's **Configuration and policies** page, select **Allowed virtual machines sizes** from the left navigation menu.
1. On the **Allowed virtual machines sizes** page, select **All sizes** or **Selected sizes**.
1. If you select **Selected sizes**, select the VM sizes to allow users to create in the lab.
1. Select **Save**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/devtest-lab-set-lab-policy/allowed-vm-sizes.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Allowed VM sizes.":::

<a name="set-virtual-machines-per-user"></a>
### Virtual machines per user

These two policies specify the maximum number of VMs and VMs using premium disks that an individual lab user can claim or create. The default setting for both policies is **Off**.

1. On the lab's **Configuration and policies** page, select **Virtual machines per user** from the left navigation menu.
1. On the **Virtual machines per user** page, under **Limit the number of virtual machines**, select **On** or **Off** to enable or disable the policy.
1. If you select **On**, under **What is the limit**, enter the maximum number of VMs that a user can claim or create.
1. Under **Limit the number of virtual machines using premium OS disks**, select **On** or **Off** to enable or disable the policy.
1. If you select **On**, enter the maximum number of VMs using premium solid-state disks (SSDs) that a user can claim or create. This number applies only to Premium SSDs, not Standard SSDs.
1. Select **Save**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/devtest-lab-set-lab-policy/max-vms-per-user.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Virtual machines per user.":::

If a user tries to create or claim a VM after the user limit is met, an error message indicates that the user can't exceed their VM limit.

:::image type="content" source="./media/devtest-lab-set-lab-policy/error.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the error that the user can't exceed their VM limit.":::

### Virtual machines per lab

These two policies specify the maximum number of VMs and VMs using premium disks that all users can create in the current lab. The default setting for both policies is **Off**.

1. On the lab's **Configuration and policies** page, select **Virtual machines per lab** from the left navigation menu.
1. On the **Virtual machines per lab** page, under **Limit the number of virtual machines**, select **On** or **Off** to enable or disable the policy.
1. If you select **On**, under **What is the limit**, enter the maximum number of VMs that can be created in the lab.
1. Under **Limit the number of virtual machines using premium OS disks**, select **On** or **Off** to enable or disable the policy.
1. If you selected **On**, enter the maximum number of VMs in the lab that can use premium SSDs.
1. Select **Save**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/devtest-lab-set-lab-policy/max-vms-per-lab.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing VMs per lab.":::

If a user tries to create a VM after the lab limit is met, an error message indicates that the VM can't be created.

<a name="set-auto-shutdown"></a>
### Autoshutdown

Autoshutdown helps minimize lab waste by shutting down lab VMs at a specific time of day. The default policy setting is **Off**.

1. On the lab's **Configuration and policies** page, select **Auto-shutdown** from the left navigation menu.
1. On the **Auto-shutdown** page, select **On** or **Off** to enable or disable the policy.
1. If you select **On**, for **Scheduled shutdown** and **Time zone**, specify the time and time zone to shut down all lab VMs.
1. For **Send notification before auto-shutdown**, select **Yes** or **No** for the option to send a notification before the specified autoshutdown time.
1. If you choose **Yes**, enter a webhook URL endpoint under **Webhook URL** or semicolon-separated email addresses under **Email address** to post or send the notification.
1. Select **Save**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/devtest-lab-set-lab-policy/auto-shutdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Auto shutdown.":::

By default, the autoshutdown schedule applies to all lab VMs. If allowed by [autoshutdown policy](#autoshutdown-policy), lab users can override lab autoshutdown settings for their own individual VMs. To set a shutdown schedule for an individual VM:

1. Select the VM from **My virtual machines** on the lab **Overview** page.
1. On the home page for the VM, select **Auto-shutdown** from the **Operations** section of the left navigation menu, and configure the autoshutdown settings the same way as for a lab.

For more information about autoshutdown and sending notifications, see [Configure autoshutdown for labs and VMs in DevTest Labs](devtest-lab-auto-shutdown.md).

### Autostart

Autostart policy helps you minimize waste by specifying a specific time of day and days of the week to start up lab VMs. The default policy setting is **No**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This policy isn't automatically applied to lab VMs. To apply this setting to individual VMs, open the VM's page and select **Auto-start** from the left navigation menu. On the **Auto-start** page, select **Yes** for **Allow this virtual machine to be scheduled for automatic start**, and then select **Save**.

1. On the lab's **Configuration and policies** page, select **Auto-start** from the left navigation menu.
1. Select **Yes** or **No** to enable or disable the policy.
1. If you select **Yes**, specify the **Scheduled start**, **Time zone**, and **Days of the week** to start up the lab VMs.
1. Select **Save**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/devtest-lab-set-lab-policy/auto-start.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Autostart selection.":::

For more information and details about autostart policy, see [Start up lab virtual machines automatically](devtest-lab-auto-startup-vm.yml).

<a name="set-auto-shutdown-policy"></a>
### Autoshutdown policy

If you set an autoshutdown schedule for lab VMs, you can also set a policy to let lab users override the lab autoshutdown settings for their own VMs. You can set autoshutdown policy to allow lab users full control, partial control, or no control over their own VMs' autoshutdown activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Autoshutdown policy changes apply only to new lab VMs, not to already-existing VMs.

1. On the lab's **Configuration and policies** page, select **Auto shutdown policy** from the left navigation.
1. Select one of the following options:

   - **User sets a schedule and can opt out**: Lab users can override or opt out of lab autoshutdown. Lab users can override the lab autoshutdown schedule time, or set no autoshutdown for their VMs. This setting is the default.
   - **User sets a schedule and cannot opt out**: Lab users can set the shutdown time for their own VMs, but they can't opt out of autoshutdown entirely. This option ensures that every VM in the lab is on some autoshutdown schedule.
   - **User has no control over the schedule set by lab administrator**: Lab users can't override or opt out of the lab autoshutdown schedule. They can set up autoshutdown notifications for their own VMs.

1. Select **Save**.
