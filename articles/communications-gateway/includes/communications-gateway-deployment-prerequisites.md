You must own globally routable numbers for two types of testing:
- Integration testing by your staff during deployment and integration
- Service verification (continuous call testing) by your chosen communication services

The following table describes how many numbers you need to allocate.

Service | Numbers for integration testing | Service verification numbers |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Operator Connect | 1 (minimum) | - Production deployments: 6<br/> - Lab deployments: 3 |
|Teams Phone Mobile | 1 (minimum) | - Production deployments: 6<br/> - Lab deployments: 3 |
|Microsoft Teams Direct Routing | 1 (minimum) |  None (not applicable) |
|Zoom Phone Cloud Peering | 1 (minimum) | - US and Canada: 6<br/>- Rest of world: 2 |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Service verification numbers must be usable throughout the lifetime of your deployment.
