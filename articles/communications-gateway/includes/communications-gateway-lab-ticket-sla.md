Support tickets for lab deployments have the same acknowledgment SLA targets as tickets for standard deployments. However, we don't guarantee resolving them as quickly as tickets for a standard deployment. You should use Severity 4 for a lab deployment, or in rare cases Severity 3. Don't use Severity 0, 1 or 2 for a lab deployment.
