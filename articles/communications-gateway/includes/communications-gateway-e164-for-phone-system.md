The Microsoft Phone System requires calling (A-) and called (B-)  telephone numbers to be in E.164 format. This requirement applies to both SIP and TEL numbers. We recommend that you configure your network to use the E.164 format for all numbers. If your network can't convert numbers to the E.164 format, contact your onboarding team or raise a support request to discuss your requirements for number conversion.
