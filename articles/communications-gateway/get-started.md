# Get started with Azure Communications Gateway

Setting up Azure Communications Gateway requires planning your deployment, deploying your Azure Communications Gateway resource, and integrating with your chosen communications services.

This article summarizes the steps and documentation that you need.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must fully understand the onboarding process for your chosen communications service and any dependencies introduced by the onboarding process. For advice, ask your onboarding team.
>
> Some steps in the deployment and integration process can require days or weeks to complete. For example, you might need to arrange Microsoft Azure Peering Service Voice (MAPS Voice) connectivity before you can deploy, wait for onboarding, or wait for a specific date to launch your service. We recommend that you read through any documentation from your onboarding team and the procedures in [Deploy Azure Communications Gateway](#deploy-azure-communications-gateway) and [Integrate with your chosen communications services](#integrate-with-your-chosen-communications-services) before you start deploying.

As part of your planning, ensure your network can support the connectivity and interoperability requirements in these articles.

Read through the procedures in [Deploy Azure Communications Gateway](#deploy-azure-communications-gateway) and [Integrate with your chosen communications services](#integrate-with-your-chosen-communications-services). Use those procedures as input into your planning for deployment, testing and going live. You need to work with an onboarding team (from Microsoft or one that you arrange yourself) during these phases, so ensure that you discuss timelines and requirements with this team.

## Deploy Azure Communications Gateway

Use the following procedures to deploy Azure Communications Gateway and connect it to your networks.

1. [Prepare to deploy Azure Communications Gateway](prepare-to-deploy.md) describes the steps you need to take before you can start creating your Azure Communications Gateway resource. You might need to refer to some of the articles listed in [Learn about and plan for Azure Communications Gateway](#learn-about-and-plan-for-azure-communications-gateway).
1. [Deploy Azure Communications Gateway](deploy.md) describes how to create your Azure Communications Gateway resource in the Azure portal and connect it to your networks.
1. [Integrate with Azure Communications Gateway's Provisioning API (preview)](integrate-with-provisioning-api.md) describes how to integrate with the Provisioning API. Integrating with the API is:
    - Required for Microsoft Teams Direct Routing and Zoom Phone Cloud Peering.
    - Recommended for Operator Connect and Teams Phone Mobile because it enables flow-through API-based provisioning of your customers both on Azure Communications Gateway and in the Operator Connect environment. This enables Azure Communications Gateway to provide extra functionality such as injecting custom SIP headers, while also fulfilling the requirement from the Operator Connect and Teams Phone Mobile programs for API-based provisioning of your customers in the Operator Connect environment. For more information, see [Provisioning and Operator Connect APIs](interoperability-operator-connect.md#provisioning-and-operator-connect-apis).

## Integrate with your chosen communications services

1. [Connect Azure Communications Gateway to Microsoft Teams Direct Routing](connect-teams-direct-routing.md) describes how to connect Azure Communications Gateway to the Microsoft Phone System for Microsoft Teams Direct Routing.
1. [Prepare for live traffic with Microsoft Teams Direct Routing and Azure Communications Gateway](prepare-for-live-traffic-teams-direct-routing.md) describes how to test your deployment (including configuring test numbers on Azure Communications Gateway and Microsoft 365) and launch your service.

Use the following procedures to integrate with Zoom Phone Cloud Peering.

1. [Connect Azure Communications Gateway to Zoom Phone Cloud Peering](connect-zoom.md) describes how to connect Azure Communications Gateway to Zoom servers.
1. [Prepare for live traffic with Zoom Phone Cloud Peering and Azure Communications Gateway](prepare-for-live-traffic-zoom.md) describes how to test your deployment and launch your service.
