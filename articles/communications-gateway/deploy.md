# Deploy Azure Communications Gateway

This article guides you through planning for and creating an Azure Communications Gateway resource in Azure.

## Prerequisites

You must have completed [Prepare to deploy Azure Communications Gateway](prepare-to-deploy.md).

[!INCLUDE [communications-gateway-tsp-restriction](includes/communications-gateway-tsp-restriction.md)]

[!INCLUDE [communications-gateway-deployment-prerequisites](includes/communications-gateway-deployment-prerequisites.md)]

## Collect basic information for deploying an Azure Communications Gateway

 Collect all of the values in the following table for the Azure Communications Gateway resource.

|**Value**|**Field name(s) in Azure portal**|
 |---------|---------|
 |The name of the Azure subscription to use to create an Azure Communications Gateway resource. You must use the same subscription for all resources in your Azure Communications Gateway deployment. |**Project details: Subscription**|
 |The Azure resource group in which to create the Azure Communications Gateway resource. |**Project details: Resource group**|
 |The name for the deployment. This name can contain alphanumeric characters and `-`. It must be 3-24 characters long. |**Instance details: Name**|
 |The management Azure region: the region in which your monitoring and billing data is processed. We recommend that you select a region near or colocated with the two regions for handling call traffic. |**Instance details: Region**
 |The voice codecs to use between Azure Communications Gateway and your network. We recommend that you only specify any codecs if you have a strong reason to restrict codecs (for example, licensing of specific codecs) and you can't configure your network or endpoints not to offer specific codecs. Restricting codecs can reduce the overall voice quality due to lower-fidelity codecs being selected. |**Call Handling: Supported codecs**|
 |Whether your Azure Communications Gateway resource should handle emergency calls as standard calls or directly route them to the Emergency Routing Service Provider (US only; only for Operator Connect or Teams Phone Mobile). |**Call Handling: Emergency call handling**|
 |A comma-separated list of dial strings used for emergency calls. For Microsoft Teams, specify dial strings as the standard emergency number (for example `999`). For Zoom, specify dial strings in the format `+<country-code><emergency-number>` (for example `+44999`).|**Call Handling: Emergency dial strings**|
 |Whether to use an autogenerated `*.commsgw.azure.com` domain name or to use a subdomain of your own domain by delegating it to Azure Communications Gateway. Delegated domains are limited to 34 characters. For more information on this choice, see [the guidance on creating a network design](prepare-to-deploy.md#create-a-network-design). | **DNS: Domain name options** |
 |(Required if you choose an autogenerated domain) The scope at which the autogenerated domain name label for Azure Communications Gateway is unique. Communications Gateway resources are assigned an autogenerated domain name label that depends on the name of the resource.  Selecting **Tenant** gives a resource with the same name in the same tenant but a different subscription the same label. Selecting **Subscription** gives a resource with the same name in the same subscription but a different resource group the same label. Selecting **Resource Group** gives a resource with the same name in the same resource group the same label. Selecting **No Re-use** means the label doesn't depend on the name, resource group, subscription or tenant. |**DNS: Auto-generated Domain Name Scope**|
 | (Required if you choose a delegated domain) The domain to delegate to this Azure Communications Gateway deployment | **DNS: DNS domain name** |

## Collect configuration values for service regions

Collect all of the values in the following table for both service regions in which you want to deploy Azure Communications Gateway.

 |**Value**|**Field name(s) in Azure portal**|
 |---------|---------|
 |The Azure regions to use for call traffic. |**Service Region One/Two: Region**|
 |The IPv4 address used by Azure Communications Gateway to contact your network from this region. |**Service Region One/Two: Operator IP address**|
 |The set of IP addresses/ranges that are permitted as sources for signaling traffic from your network. Provide an IPv4 address range using CIDR notation (for example, 192.0.2.0/24) or an IPv4 address (for example, 192.0.2.0). You can also provide a comma-separated list of IPv4 addresses and/or address ranges.|**Service Region One/Two: Allowed Signaling Source IP Addresses/CIDR Ranges**|
 |The set of IP addresses/ranges that are permitted as sources for media traffic from your network. Provide an IPv4 address range using CIDR notation (for example, 192.0.2.0/24) or an IPv4 address (for example, 192.0.2.0). You can also provide a comma-separated list of IPv4 addresses and/or address ranges.|**Service Region One/Two: Allowed Media Source IP Address/CIDR Ranges**|

## Collect configuration values for each communications service

Collect the values for the communications services that you're planning to support.

Microsoft Teams Direct Routing doesn't require service verification numbers.

## Decide if you want tags

Resource naming and tagging is useful for resource management. It enables your organization to locate and keep track of resources associated with specific teams or workloads and also enables you to more accurately track the consumption of cloud resources by business area and team.

If you believe tagging would be useful for your organization, design your naming and tagging conventions following the information in the [Resource naming and tagging decision guide](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/decision-guides/resource-tagging/).

## Start creating an Azure Communications Gateway resource

Use the Azure portal to create an Azure Communications Gateway resource.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/).
1. In the search bar at the top of the page, search for Communications Gateway and select **Communications Gateways**.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy/search.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. It shows the results of a search for Azure Communications Gateway.":::

1. Select the **Create** option.

    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy/create.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. Shows the existing Azure Communications Gateway. A Create button allows you to create more Azure Communications Gateways.":::

1. Use the information you collected in [Collect basic information for deploying an Azure Communications Gateway](#collect-basic-information-for-deploying-an-azure-communications-gateway) to fill out the fields in the **Basics** configuration tab and then select **Next: Service Regions**.
1. Use the information you collected in [Collect configuration values for service regions](#collect-configuration-values-for-service-regions) to fill out the fields in the **Service Regions** tab and then select **Next: Communications Services**.
1. Select the communications services that you want to support in the **Communications Services** configuration tab, use the information that you collected in [Collect configuration values for each communications service](#collect-configuration-values-for-each-communications-service) to fill out the fields, and then select **Next: Test Lines**.
1. Use the information that you collected in [Collect values for service verification numbers](#collect-values-for-service-verification-numbers) to fill out the fields in the **Test Lines** configuration tab and then select **Next: Tags**.
    - Don't configure numbers for integration testing.
    - Microsoft Teams Direct Routing doesn't require service verification numbers.
1. (Optional) Configure tags for your Azure Communications Gateway resource: enter a **Name** and **Value** for each tag you want to create.
1. Select **Review + create**.

If you've entered your configuration correctly, the Azure portal displays a **Validation Passed** message at the top of your screen. Navigate to the **Review + create** section.

If you haven't filled in the configuration correctly, the Azure portal display an error symbol for the section(s) with invalid configuration. Select the section(s) and use the information within the error messages to correct the configuration, and then return to the **Review + create** section.

:::image type="content" source="media/deploy/failed-validation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create an Azure Communications Gateway portal, showing a validation that failed due to missing information in the Contacts section.":::

## Submit your Azure Communications Gateway configuration

Check your configuration and ensure it matches your requirements. If the configuration is correct, select **Create**.

Once your resource has been provisioned, a message appears saying **Your deployment is complete**. Select **Go to resource group**, and then check that your resource group contains the correct Azure Communications Gateway resource.

> [!NOTE]
> You will not be able to make calls immediately. You need to complete the remaining steps in this guide before your resource is ready to handle traffic.

:::image type="content" source="media/deploy/go-to-resource-group.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create an Azure Communications Gateway portal, showing a completed deployment screen.":::

## Wait for provisioning to complete

Wait for your resource to be provisioned. When your resource is ready, the **Provisioning Status** field on the resource overview changes to "Complete." We recommend that you check in periodically to see if the Provisioning Status field is "Complete." This step might take up to two weeks.

## Connect Azure Communications Gateway to your networks

When your resource has been provisioned, you can connect Azure Communications Gateway to your networks.

1. Exchange TLS certificate information with your onboarding team.
    1. Azure Communications Gateway is preconfigured to support the DigiCert Global Root G2 certificate and the Baltimore CyberTrust Root certificate as root certificate authority (CA) certificates. If the certificate that your network presents to Azure Communications Gateway uses a different root CA certificate, provide your onboarding team with this root CA certificate.
    1. The root CA certificate for Azure Communications Gateway's certificate is the DigiCert Global Root G2 certificate. If your network doesn't have this root certificate, download it from https://www.digicert.com/kb/digicert-root-certificates.htm and install it in your network.
1. Configure your infrastructure to meet the call routing requirements described in [Reliability in Azure Communications Gateway](reliability-communications-gateway.md).
    * Depending on your network, you might need to configure SBCs, softswitches and access control lists (ACLs).
    * Your network needs to send SIP traffic to per-region FQDNs for Azure Communications Gateway. To find these FQDNs:
        1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/).
        1. In the search bar at the top of the page, search for your Communications Gateway resource.
        1. Go to the **Overview** page for your Azure Communications Gateway resource.
        1. In each **Service Location** section, find the **Hostname** field. You need to validate TLS connections against this hostname to ensure secure connections.
    * We recommend configuring an SRV lookup for each region, using `_sip._tls.<regional-FQDN-from-portal>`. Replace *`<regional-FQDN-from-portal>`* with the per-region FQDNs that you found in the **Overview** page for your resource.
1. If your Azure Communications Gateway includes integrated MCP, configure the connection to MCP:
    1. Go to the **Overview** page for your Azure Communications Gateway resource.
    1. In each **Service Location** section, find the **MCP hostname** field.
    1. Configure your test numbers with an iFC of the following form, replacing *`<mcp-hostname>`* with the MCP hostname for the preferred region for that subscriber.
       ```xml
        <InitialFilterCriteria>
            <Priority>0</Priority>
            <TriggerPoint>
                <ConditionTypeCNF>0</ConditionTypeCNF>
                <SPT>
                    <ConditionNegated>0</ConditionNegated>
                    <Group>0</Group>
                    <Method>INVITE</Method>
                </SPT>
                <SPT>
                    <ConditionNegated>1</ConditionNegated>
                    <Group>0</Group>
                    <SessionCase>4</SessionCase>
                </SPT>
            </TriggerPoint>
            <ApplicationServer>
                <ServerName>sip:<mcp-hostname>;transport=tcp;service=mcp</ServerName>
                <DefaultHandling>0</DefaultHandling>
            </ApplicationServer>
        </InitialFilterCriteria>
        ```
1. Configure your routers and peering connection to ensure all traffic to Azure Communications Gateway is through Azure Internet Peering for Communications Services (also known as Microsoft Azure Peering Service for Voice and MAPS Voice) or ExpressRoute Microsoft Peering.
1. Enable Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) on your on-premises edge routers to speed up link failure detection.
    - The interval must be 150 ms (or 300 ms if you can't use 150 ms).
    - With MAPS Voice, BFD must bring up the BGP peer for each Private Network Interface (PNI).
1. Meet any other requirements for your communications platform (for example, the *Network Connectivity Specification* for Operator Connect or Teams Phone Mobile). If you need access to Operator Connect or Teams Phone Mobile specifications, contact your onboarding team.

## Configure domain delegation with Azure DNS

> [!NOTE]
> If you decided to use an automatically allocated `*.commsgw.azure.com` domain name for Azure Communications Gateway, skip this step.

If you chose to delegate a subdomain when you created Azure Communications Gateway, you must update the name server (NS) records for this subdomain to point to name servers created for you in your Azure Communications Gateway deployment.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/).
1. In the search bar at the top of the page, search for your Communications Gateway resource.
1. On the **Overview** page for your Azure Communications Gateway resource, find the four name servers that have been created for you.
1. Note down the names of these name servers, including the trailing `.` at the end of the address.
1. Follow [Delegate the domain](../dns/dns-delegate-domain-azure-dns.md#delegate-the-domain) and [Verify the delegation](../dns/dns-delegate-domain-azure-dns.md#verify-the-delegation) to configure all four name servers in your NS records. We recommend configuring a time-to-live (TTL) of two days.
