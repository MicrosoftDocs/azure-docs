# Manage Zoom Phone Cloud Peering customers and numbers with Azure Communications Gateway

Providing Zoom Phone Cloud Peering service with Azure Communications Gateway requires configuration on Azure Communications Gateway. This article provides guidance on how to set up Cloud Peering for a customer, including:

* Setting up a new customer.
* Managing numbers for a customer, including optionally configuring a custom header.

## Prerequisites

[Connect Azure Communications Gateway to Zoom Phone Cloud Peering](connect-zoom.md).

During this procedure, you provision Azure Communications Gateway with the details of the enterprise customer tenant and numbers for the enterprise.
