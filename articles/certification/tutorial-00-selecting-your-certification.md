# Tutorial: Select your certification program

Congratulations on choosing the Azure Certified Device program! We're excited to have you join our ecosystem of certified devices. To begin, you must first determine which of the four certification programs best suit your device capabilities.

In this tutorial, you learn to:

> * Select the best certification program(s) for your device

## Prerequisites

- There are no pre-requisites for this tutorial

## Selecting a certification program for your device

All devices are required to meet the baseline requirements outlined by the **Azure Certified Device** certification. The other three certification badges build on this program and deliver a different customer value. You can select one of the three incremental badges (IoT Plug and Play, Edge Managed, and Edge Secured Core).

1. Review each of the certification programs' primary customer value and promise in the table below. Select on the links provided to view the technical requirements your device must meet to pass our Azure IoT Certification Service testing.

    | Certification program         |  Overview                      |
    ------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
    | [Azure Certified Device](program-requirements-azure-certified-device.md)          | Azure Certified Device certification validates that a device can connect with Azure IoT Hub and securely provision through the Device Provisioning Service (DPS). This certification reflects a device's functionality and interoperability, which are a **required baseline** for all other  certifications.          |
    | [IoT Plug and Play](program-requirements-pnp.md) | IoT Plug and Play certification, an incremental certification beyond the baseline Azure Certified Device certification, validates Digital Twin Definition Language version 2 (DTDL) and interaction based on your device model. It enables a seamless device-to-cloud integration experience and enables hardware partners to build devices that can seamlessly integrate without the need to write custom code.  |
    | [Edge Managed](program-requirements-edge-managed.md) | Edge Managed certification, an incremental certification beyond the baseline Azure Certified Device certification, focuses on device management standards for Azure connected devices. Today, this certification program focuses on Edge runtime compatibility for module deployment and management though will continue to grow in the future with additional customer manageability needs. |
    | [Edge Secured Core](program-requirements-edge-secured-core.md)                             | Edge Secured-core certification, an incremental certification beyond the baseline Azure Certified Device certification, is for IoT devices running a full operating system such as Linux or Windows 10 IoT. It validates devices meet additional security requirements around device identity, secure boot, operating system hardening, device updates, data protection, and vulnerability disclosures. |
1. Once you feel that you understand what is required of your device, select which certification programs you would like to certify your device with. This may be the Azure Certified Device certification, or a combination of this baseline certification with one of the three available badges.
