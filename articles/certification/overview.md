# What is Azure Certified Device?

Thank you for your interest in the Azure Certified Device program! This program is your one stop for easily differentiating, promoting, and finding IoT devices built to run on Azure. From intelligent cameras to connected sensors to edge infrastructure, this enhanced IoT device certification program helps device builders increase their product visibility and saves customers time in building solutions.

## Our certification promise

The Azure Certified Device program ensures customer solutions work great on Azure. It is a program that utilizes tools, services, and a catalog to share industry knowledge with our community of builders within the IoT ecosystem to help builders and customers alike.

The three tenets of this program are:

- **Giving customers confidence:** Customers can confidently purchase Azure certified devices that carry the Microsoft promise.

- **Matchmaking customers with the right devices for them:** Device builders can set themselves apart with certification that highlights their unique capabilities, and customers can easily find the products that fit their needs.

- **Promoting certified devices:** Device builders get increased visibility, contact with customers, and usage of Microsoft’s Azure Certified Device brand.

## User roles

The Azure Certified Device program serves two different audiences.

1. **Device builders**: Easily differentiate your IoT device capabilities and gain access to a worldwide audience looking to reliably purchase devices built to run on Azure. Use the Azure Certified Device Catalog to increase product visibility and connect with customers by certifying your device.
1.  **Solution builders**: Confidently find and purchase IoT devices built to run on Azure, knowing they meet specific capabilities. Easily search and select the right certified device for your IoT solution on the [Azure Certified Device catalog](https://devicecatalog.azure.com/).

## Our certification programs

There are four different certifications available now! Each certification is focused on delivering a different customer value. Depending on the type of device and your target audience, you can choose which certification(s) is most applicable for you to apply for. Select the titles of each program to learn more about the program requirements.

| Certification program         |  Overview                      |
------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [Azure Certified Device](program-requirements-azure-certified-device.md)          | Azure Certified Device certification validates that a device can connect with Azure IoT Hub and securely provision through the Device Provisioning Service (DPS). This certification reflects a device's functionality and interoperability, which are a **required baseline** for all other  certifications.          |
| [IoT Plug and Play](program-requirements-pnp.md) | IoT Plug and Play certification, an incremental certification beyond the baseline Azure Certified Device certification, validates Digital Twin Definition Language version 2 (DTDL) and interaction based on your device model. It enables a seamless device-to-cloud integration experience and enables hardware partners to build devices that can seamlessly integrate without the need to write custom code.  |
| [Edge Managed](program-requirements-edge-managed.md) | Edge Managed certification, an incremental certification beyond the baseline Azure Certified Device certification, focuses on device management standards for Azure connected devices.  |
| [Edge Secured Core](program-requirements-edge-secured-core.md)                             | Edge Secured-core certification, an incremental certification beyond the baseline Azure Certified Device certification, is for IoT devices running a full operating system such as Linux or Windows 10 IoT. It validates devices meet additional security requirements around device identity, secure boot, operating system hardening, device updates, data protection, and vulnerability disclosures. |

## How to certify your device

Certifying a device involves four major steps on the [Azure Certified Device portal](https://certify.azure.com):

1. Creating your project
1. Providing hardware capability information
1. Validating device functionality
1. Submitting and completing the review process

Once you have certified your device, you then can optionally complete two of the following activities: 

1. Publishing to the Azure Certified Device Catalog (optional)
1. Updating your project after it has been approved/published (optional)
