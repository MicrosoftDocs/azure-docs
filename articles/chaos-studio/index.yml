title: Azure Chaos Studio documentation
summary: Azure Chaos Studio is an Azure service that helps you measure, understand, and build application and service resilience to real-world incidents, such as a region going down or an application failure causing 100% CPU usage on a VM. With Chaos Studio, you can run chaos engineering experiments that inject faults against your service and then monitor how the service responds to disruptions. Chaos experiments help you to validate architectural choices and improve service reliability. Chaos experiments can be run ad-hoc for running manual BCDR drills and Game Days, or as part of your CI/CD pipeline to programmatically gate code flow. # < 160 chars
