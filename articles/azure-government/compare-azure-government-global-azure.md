# Compare Azure Government and global Azure

Microsoft Azure Government uses same underlying technologies as global Azure, which includes the core components of [Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-iaas/), [Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-paas/), and [Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-saas/). Both Azure and Azure Government have the same comprehensive security controls in place and the same Microsoft commitment on the safeguarding of customer data. Whereas both cloud environments are assessed and authorized at the FedRAMP High impact level, Azure Government provides an extra layer of protection to customers through contractual commitments regarding storage of customer data in the United States and limiting potential access to systems processing customer data to [screened US persons](./documentation-government-plan-security.md#screening). These commitments may be of interest to customers using the cloud to store or process data subject to US export control regulations.

> [!NOTE]
> These lists and tables do not include feature or bundle availability in the Azure Government Secret or Azure Government Top Secret clouds. 
> For more information about specific availability for air-gapped clouds, please contact your account team.


## Export control implications

You're responsible for designing and deploying your applications to meet [US export control requirements](./documentation-government-overview-itar.md) such as the requirements prescribed in the EAR, ITAR, and DoE 10 CFR Part 810. In doing so, you shouldn't include sensitive or restricted information in Azure resource names, as explained in [Considerations for naming Azure resources](./documentation-government-concept-naming-resources.md).

## Guidance for developers

Most of the currently available technical content assumes that applications are being developed on global Azure rather than on Azure Government. For this reason, itâ€™s important to be aware of two key differences in applications that you develop for hosting in Azure Government.

- Certain services and features that are in specific regions of global Azure might not be available in Azure Government.

- Feature configurations in Azure Government might differ from those in global Azure.

Therefore, it's important to review your sample code and configurations to ensure that you are building within the Azure Government cloud services environment.

For more information, see [Azure Government developer guide](./documentation-government-developer-guide.md). 

> [!NOTE]
> This article has been updated to use the new Azure PowerShell Az module. You can still use the AzureRM module, which will continue to receive bug fixes until at least December 2020. To learn more about the new Az module and AzureRM compatibility, see [**Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module**](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az). For Az module installation instructions, see [**Install the Azure Az PowerShell module**](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).

You can use AzureCLI or PowerShell to obtain Azure Government endpoints for services you provisioned:

- Use **Azure CLI** to run the [az cloud show](/cli/azure/cloud#az-cloud-show) command and provide `AzureUSGovernment` as the name of the target cloud environment. For example,

  ```azurecli
  az cloud show --name AzureUSGovernment
  ```

  should get you different endpoints for Azure Government.

- Use a **PowerShell** cmdlet such as [Get-AzEnvironment](/powershell/module/az.accounts/get-azenvironment) to get endpoints and metadata for an instance of Azure service. For example,

  ```powershell
  Get-AzEnvironment -Name AzureUSGovernment
  ```

  should get you properties for Azure Government. This cmdlet gets environments from your subscription data file.

Table below lists API endpoints in Azure vs. Azure Government for accessing and managing some of the more common services. If you provisioned a service that isn't listed in the table below, see the Azure CLI and PowerShell examples above for suggestions on how to obtain the corresponding Azure Government endpoint.

## Service availability

Microsoft's goal for Azure Government is to match service availability in Azure. For service availability in Azure Government, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=all&regions=usgov-non-regional,us-dod-central,us-dod-east,usgov-arizona,usgov-texas,usgov-virginia&rar=true). Services available in Azure Government are listed by category and whether they're Generally Available or available through Preview. If a service is available in Azure Government, that fact isn't reiterated in the rest of this article. Instead, you're encouraged to review [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=all&regions=usgov-non-regional,us-dod-central,us-dod-east,usgov-arizona,usgov-texas,usgov-virginia&rar=true) for the latest, up-to-date information on service availability.

In general, service availability in Azure Government implies that all corresponding service features are available to you. Variations to this approach and other applicable limitations are tracked and explained in this article based on the main service categories outlined in the [online directory of Azure services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/). Other considerations for service deployment and usage in Azure Government are also provided.

  - No. The portals for Azure and Azure Government are separate and don't share information.

#### [Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview)

Application Insights (part of Azure Monitor) enables the same features in both Azure and Azure Government. This section describes the supplemental configuration that is required to use Application Insights in Azure Government.

**Visual Studio** â€“ In Azure Government, you can enable monitoring on your ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, and Node.js based applications running on Azure App Service. For more information, see [Application monitoring for Azure App Service overview](/azure/azure-monitor/app/azure-web-apps). In Visual Studio, go to Tools|Options|Accounts|Registered Azure Clouds|Add New Azure Cloud and select Azure US Government as the Discovery endpoint. After that, adding an account in File|Account Settings will prompt you for which cloud you want to add from.

**SDK endpoint modifications** â€“ In order to send data from Application Insights to an Azure Government region, you'll need to modify the default endpoint addresses that are used by the Application Insights SDKs. Each SDK requires slightly different modifications, as described in [Application Insights overriding default endpoints](/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/app/create-new-resource#override-default-endpoints).

**Firewall exceptions** â€“ Application Insights uses several IP addresses. You might need to know these addresses if the app that you're monitoring is hosted behind a firewall. For more information, see [IP addresses used by Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/ip-addresses) from where you can download Azure Government IP addresses.

>[!NOTE]
>Although these addresses are static, it's possible that we'll need to change them from time to time. All Application Insights traffic represents outbound traffic except for availability monitoring and webhooks, which require inbound firewall rules.

To allow the Application Insights SDK/agent to send data to the Application Insights resource, you need to allow access to the regional endpoint defined in your connection string and open the **outgoing port 443** in your firewall. To learn more about the endpoint suffix, see [Connection strings in Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/connection-strings#connection-string-with-an-endpoint-suffix).
