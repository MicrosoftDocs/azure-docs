# Azure Government compliance

## Azure Blueprints

[Azure Blueprints](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/blueprints/) can help you automate the process of achieving compliance on Azure Government. FedRAMP and other [standards-based blueprint samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/blueprints/samples/) are available in Azure Blueprints.

## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Data Subject Requests (DSRs) on Azure Government

Azure tenant administrators can use the [User Privacy blade](https://portal.azure.us/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/UserPrivacyMenuBlade/Overview) in the Azure portal to export and/or delete personal data generated during a customer's use of Azure Government services. For more information about Data Subject Requests, see [Data Subject Requests for the GDPR](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/gdpr-dsr-azure).
