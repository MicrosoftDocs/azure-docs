# Department of Defense (DoD) in Azure Government
## Overview
Azure Government is used by Department of Defense (DoD) entities to deploy a broad range of workloads and solutions, including those workloads covered by<a href="http://iasecontent.disa.mil/cloud/SRG/index.html"> The DoD Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide, Version 1, Release 2</a> at Impact Level 4 (L4).

One of the key drivers for the DoD in moving to the cloud is to enable organizations to focus on their missions and minimize the distractions of building and managing in-house IT solutions.

Azure Government-based cloud architectures allow DoD personnel to focus on mission objectives, and managing IT commodity services such as SharePoint and other application workloads.  This allows for the realignment of critical IT resources to focus on application development, analytics, and cyber security.

The elasticity and flexibility delivered by Azure provides enormous benefits to DoD customers. It is simpler, quicker, and more cost-effective to scale-up a workload in the cloud than it is to go through traditional hardware and services procurement processes when working on-premises, or in DoD data centers. For example, to procure new multi-server hardware, even for a test environment, may take many months, and require the approval of significant capital expenditure. By contrast, using Azure, a test migration for an existing workload can be configured in weeks or even days, and in a cost-effective manner (when the test is over, the environment can be torn down with no ongoing costs).

This flexibility is significant. By moving to Azure, DoD customers do not just save money; the cloud delivers new opportunities. For example, it is easy to spin up a test environment to gain insights into new technologies, you can migrate an application and test it in Azure before committing to a production deployment in the cloud. Mission owners can explore more cost effective options easier, and without risk.

Security is another key area, and although any cloud deployment requires proper planning to ensure secure and reliable service delivery, in reality most properly configured cloud-based workloads (up to and including L4 workloads) in Azure Government will be more secure than many traditional deployments in DoD locations and data centers. This is because defense agencies have the experience and expertise to physically secure all assets; however, the IT surface areas present different challenges. Cyber security is a rapidly changing space, requiring specialist skills and the ability to rapidly develop and deploy counter-measures as required. The Azure platform, both commercial and Government, now supports hundreds of thousands of customers, and this scale enables Microsoft to quickly detect evolving attack vectors, and then direct its resources onto rapid development and implementation of the appropriate defenses.
