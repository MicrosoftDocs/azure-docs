# Azure Government CSP application process

Azure Government is available for purchase via different channels, one of them being the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) channel. This article provides an overview of what you need to become a CSP for US Government and be able to resell Azure Government. For more information on the CSP program, see [Cloud Solution Provider program](/partner-center/csp-overview).

## Becoming a government CSP

Before being able to apply for CSP or any other programs that run under the Microsoft Partner Network, you need to obtain a Microsoft Partner Network ID (MPN ID). For more information, visit the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/cloud-solution-provider/get-started) page. After you fulfill the basic requirement of becoming a Microsoft Partner, you're ready to become a Government CSP. To initiate your application, see [Sell cloud services to the US government](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/cloud-solution-provider/cloud-for-government).

[Azure Government](./documentation-government-welcome.md) is a physically isolated instance of Azure that delivers services with world-class security and compliance critical to the US government. These services maintain FedRAMP and DoD authorizations, CJIS state-level agreements, support for IRS 1075, ability to sign a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement, and others. For more information, see [Azure Government compliance](./documentation-government-plan-compliance.md). Azure Government provides an extra layer of protection to customers through contractual commitments regarding storage of customer data in the United States. Moreover, Azure Government limits potential access to systems processing customer data to screened US persons. Most US government agencies and their partners are best aligned with Azure Government.

## Obtaining your government tenant

The process begins with a request for an Azure Government tenant. For more information and to begin the validation, see [Microsoft Azure Government trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/government/request/?ReqType=CSP). Once complete, you should receive a tenant to activate your enrollment in the Cloud Solution Provider program for the US government. The following validation steps are in place:

- Be enrolled in the [Microsoft Cloud Partner Program](/partner-center/mpn-overview) (have an MCPP ID).
- Verification of legitimacy of the Company, Systems Integrator, Distributor, or Independent Software Vendor (ISV) applying for the tenant.
- Verification of business engagements with government customers (for example, proof of services rendered to government agencies, statements of work, evidence of being part of GSA Schedule).
- If you already have an Azure Government tenant, you can use your existing credentials to complete the CSP application.
- Ensure that emails coming from [US Government Cloud Eligibility](mailto:usgcce@microsoft.com) are reaching your Inbox.
- Check your spam or junk email folder as credentials and asks for further info come from this alias.

## Applying for government CSP

Once you have the credentials described previously, navigate to [Partner Center for Microsoft US Government Cloud](https://aka.ms/accounts/rncEnrollment) to apply for the CSP Government reseller program. It takes 5-6 days to process the application, and, once approved, you should receive an email to log in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) to accept the Terms and Conditions. For more information, see [Partner Center documentation](/partner-center/overview).

> [!NOTE]
> Terms and Conditions aren't negotiable for the Cloud Solution Provider program. If you wish to discuss customer terms that you have in place for your Commercial agreement, contact your Microsoft account representative.

The application process includes:

- Credit check
- Estimation of potential revenue
