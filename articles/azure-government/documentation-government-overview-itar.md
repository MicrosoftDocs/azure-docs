# Azure support for export controls

**Disclaimer:** Customers are wholly responsible for ensuring their own compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Information provided in this article does not constitute legal advice, and customers should consult their legal advisors for any questions regarding regulatory compliance.

To help Azure customers navigate export control rules, Microsoft has published the [Microsoft Azure Export Controls](https://aka.ms/Azure-Export-Paper) whitepaper. It describes US export controls particularly as they apply to software and technical data, reviews potential sources of export control risks, and offers specific guidance to help customers assess their obligations under these controls.

## Overview of export control laws

Export related definitions vary somewhat among various export control regulations. In simplified terms, an export often implies a transfer of restricted information, materials, equipment, software, etc., to a foreign person or foreign destination by any means. US export control policy is enforced through export control laws and regulations administered primarily by the Department of Commerce, Department of State, Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and Department of Treasury. Respective agencies within each department are responsible for specific areas of export control based on their historical administration, as shown in Table 1.

**Table 1.**  US export control laws and regulations

This article contains a review of the current US export control regulations, considerations for cloud computing, and Azure features and commitments in support of export control requirements.

## EAR

The US Department of Commerce is responsible for enforcing the [Export Administration Regulations](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/regulations/export-administration-regulations-ear) (EAR) through the [Bureau of Industry and Security](https://www.bis.doc.gov/) (BIS). According to BIS [definitions](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulation-docs/412-part-734-scope-of-the-export-administration-regulations/file), export is the transfer of protected technology or information to a foreign destination or release of protected technology or information to a foreign person in the United States (also known as deemed export). Items subject to the EAR can be found on the [Commerce Control List](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/regulations/commerce-control-list-ccl) (CCL), and each item has a unique [Export Control Classification Number](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/licensing/commerce-control-list-classification/export-control-classification-number-eccn) (ECCN) assigned. Items not listed on the CCL are designated as EAR99 and most EAR99 commercial products do not require a license to be exported.  However, depending on the destination, end user, or end use of the item, even an EAR99 item may require a BIS export license.

The EAR is applicable to dual-use items that have both commercial and military applications and to items with purely commercial application. The BIS has provided guidance that cloud service providers (CSP) are not exporters of customers’ data due to the customers’ use of cloud services. Moreover, in the [final rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/03/2016-12734/revisions-to-definitions-in-the-export-administration-regulations) published on 3 June 2016, BIS clarified that EAR licensing requirements would not apply if the transmission and storage of unclassified technical data and software were encrypted end-to-end using Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 validated cryptographic modules and not intentionally stored in a military-embargoed country (that is, Country Group D:5 as described in [Supplement No. 1 to Part 740](https://ecfr.io/Title-15/pt15.2.740#ap15.2.740_121.1) of the EAR) or in the Russian Federation. The US Department of Commerce has made it clear that, when data or software is uploaded to the cloud, the customer, not the cloud provider, is the “exporter” who has the responsibility to ensure that transfers, storage, and access to that data or software complies with the EAR.

Both Azure and Azure Government can help customers subject to the EAR meet their compliance requirements. Except for the Azure region in Hong Kong SAR, Azure and Azure Government datacenters are not located in proscribed countries or in the Russian Federation. Azure and Azure Government rely on FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules in the underlying operating system, and provide customers with a [wide range of options for encrypting data](../security/fundamentals/encryption-overview.md) in transit and at rest, including encryption key management using [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/general/overview.md), which can store encryption keys in FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security modules (HSMs) under customer control - known as [customer-managed keys (CMK)](../security/fundamentals/encryption-models.md). Keys generated inside the Azure Key Vault HSMs are not exportable – there can be no clear-text version of the key outside the HSMs. This binding is enforced by the underlying HSM. Moreover, Azure Key Vault is designed, deployed, and operated such that Microsoft and its agents do not see or extract customer keys.

Customers are responsible for choosing Azure or Azure Government regions for deploying their applications and data. Moreover, customers are responsible for designing their applications to apply end-to-end data encryption that meets EAR requirements. Microsoft does not inspect or approve customer applications deployed on Azure or Azure Government.

Azure Government provides an extra layer of protection to customers through contractual commitments regarding storage of customer data in the United States and limiting potential access to systems processing customer data to [screened US persons](./documentation-government-plan-security.md#screening).

## ITAR

The US Department of State has export control authority over defense articles, services, and related technologies under the [International Traffic in Arms Regulations](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8870638858a2595a32dedceb661c482c&mc=true&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title22/22CIsubchapM.tpl) (ITAR) managed by the [Directorate of Defense Trade Controls](http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/) (DDTC). Items under ITAR protection are documented on the [United States Munitions List](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=22:1.0.1.13.58) (USML). Customers who are manufacturers, exporters, and brokers of defense articles, services, and related technologies as defined on the USML must be registered with DDTC, must understand and abide by ITAR, and must self-certify that they operate in accordance with ITAR.

DDTC [revised the ITAR rules](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/12/26/2019-27438/international-traffic-in-arms-regulations-creation-of-definition-of-activities-that-are-not-exports) effective 25 March 2020 to align them more closely with the EAR. These ITAR revisions introduced an end-to-end data encryption carve-out that incorporated many of the same terms that the Commerce Department adopted in 2016 for the EAR. Specifically, the revised ITAR rules state that activities that do not constitute exports, re-exports, re-transfers, or temporary imports include (among other activities) the sending, taking, or storing of technical data that is 1) unclassified, 2) secured using end-to-end encryption, 3) secured using FIPS 140-2 compliant cryptographic modules as prescribed in the regulations, 4) not intentionally sent to a person in or stored in a [country proscribed in § 126.1](https://ecfr.io/Title-22/pt22.1.126#se22.1.126_11) or the Russian Federation, and 5) not sent from a country proscribed in § 126.1 or the Russian Federation. Moreover, DDTC clarified that data in-transit via the Internet is not deemed to be stored. End-to-end encryption implies the data is always kept encrypted between the originator and intended recipient, and the means of decryption is not provided to any third party.

There is no ITAR compliance certification; however, both Azure and Azure Government can help customers subject to ITAR meet their compliance obligations. Except for the Azure region in Hong Kong SAR, Azure and Azure Government datacenters are not located in proscribed countries or in the Russian Federation. Azure and Azure Government rely on FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules in the underlying operating system, and provide customers with a [wide range of options for encrypting data](../security/fundamentals/encryption-overview.md) in transit and at rest, including encryption key management using [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/general/overview.md), which can store encryption keys in FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security modules (HSMs) under customer control - known as [customer-managed keys (CMK)](../security/fundamentals/encryption-models.md). Keys generated inside the Azure Key Vault HSMs are not exportable – there can be no clear-text version of the key outside the HSMs. This binding is enforced by the underlying HSM. Moreover, Azure Key Vault is designed, deployed, and operated such that Microsoft and its agents do not see or extract customer keys.

Customers are responsible for choosing Azure or Azure Government regions for deploying their applications and data. Moreover, customers are responsible for designing their applications to apply end-to-end data encryption that meets ITAR requirements. Microsoft does not inspect or approve customer applications deployed on Azure or Azure Government.

Azure Government provides an extra layer of protection to customers through contractual commitments regarding storage of customer data in the United States and limiting potential access to systems processing customer data to [screened US persons](./documentation-government-plan-security.md#screening).

## DoE 10 CFR Part 810

The US Department of Energy (DoE) export control regulation [10 CFR Part 810](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-02-23/pdf/2015-03479.pdf) implements section 57b.(2) of the [Atomic Energy Act of 1954](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1327/ML13274A489.pdf) (AEA), as amended by section 302 of the [Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978](http://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1327/ML13274A492.pdf#page=19) (NNPA). It is administered by the [National Nuclear Security Administration](https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/national-nuclear-security-administration) (NNSA). The revised Part 810 (final rule) became effective on 25 March 2015, and, among other things, it controls the export of unclassified nuclear technology and assistance. It enables peaceful nuclear trade by helping to assure that nuclear technologies exported from the United States will not be used for non-peaceful purposes. Paragraph 810.7 (b) states that specific DoE authorization is required for providing or transferring sensitive nuclear technology to any foreign entity.

**Azure Government can accommodate customers subject to DoE 10 CFR Part 810** export control requirements because it is designed to meet specific controls that restrict access to information and systems to [US persons](./documentation-government-plan-security.md#screening) among Azure operations personnel. Customers deploying data to Azure Government are responsible for their own security classification process. For data subject to DoE export controls, the classification system is augmented by the [Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/hss/Classification/docs/UCNI-Tri-fold.pdf) (UCNI) controls established by Section 148 of the AEA. 

## NRC 10 CFR Part 110

The [Nuclear Regulatory Commission](https://www.nrc.gov/) (NRC) is responsible for the [Export and Import of Nuclear Equipment and Materials](https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/ip/export-import.html) under the [10 CFR Part 110](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-02-23/pdf/2015-03479.pdf) export control regulations. The NRC regulates the export and import of nuclear facilities and related equipment and materials. The NRC does not regulate nuclear technology and assistance related to these items, which are under the DoE jurisdiction. Therefore, the **NRC 10 CFR Part 110 regulations would not be applicable** to Azure or Azure Government.

## OFAC Sanctions Laws

The [Office of Foreign Assets Control](https://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Office-of-Foreign-Assets-Control.aspx) (OFAC) is responsible for administering and enforcing economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, and those entities engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

The OFAC defines prohibited transactions as trade or financial transactions and other dealings in which US persons may not engage unless authorized by OFAC or expressly exempted by statute. For web-based interactions, see [FAQ No. 73](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/faqs/73) for general guidance released by OFAC, which specifies for example that &#8220;Firms that facilitate or engage in e-commerce should do their best to know their customers directly.&#8221;

As stated in the Microsoft Online Services Terms [Data Protection Addendum](https://aka.ms/dpa), &#8220;Microsoft does not control or limit the regions from which customer or customer’s end users may access or move customer data.&#8221; For Microsoft online services, Microsoft conducts due diligence to prevent transactions with entities from OFAC embargoed countries, for example, a sanctions target is not allowed to provision Azure services. OFAC has not issued guidance (similar to the guidance provided by BIS for the Export Administration Regulations) that draws a distinction between cloud service providers and customers when it comes to deemed export. Therefore, it would be the **responsibility of Microsoft customers to exclude sanctions targets from online transactions** involving customer applications (including web sites) deployed on Azure. Azure does not block network traffic to customer sites. Even though OFAC mentions that customers can restrict access based in IP table ranges, they also acknowledge that this approach does not fully address an internet’s firm compliance risks. Therefore, OFAC recommends that e-commerce firms should know their customers directly. Microsoft is not responsible for and does not have the means to know directly the end users that interact with applications deployed by customers on Azure.

OFAC sanctions are in place to prevent &#8220;conducting business with a sanctions target&#8221;, that is, preventing transactions involving trade, payments, financial instruments, etc. OFAC sanctions are not about preventing a resident of a proscribed country from viewing a customer’s public web site.

## Managing export control requirements

Customers should assess carefully how their use of Azure may implicate US export controls and determine whether any of the data they want to store or process in the cloud may be subject to export controls. Microsoft provides customers with contractual commitments, operational processes, and technical features to help them meet their export control obligations when using Azure. The following Azure features are available to customers to manage potential export control risks:

- **Ability to control data location** - Customers have visibility as to where their [data is stored](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/data-residency/), and robust tools to restrict data storage to a single geography, region, or country. For example, a customer may therefore ensure that data is stored in the United States or their country of choice and minimize transfer of controlled technology/technical data outside the target country. Customer data is not *intentionally stored* in a non-conforming location, consistent with the EAR and ITAR rules.
- **End-to-end encryption** - Implies the data is always kept encrypted between the originator and intended recipient, and the means of decryption is not provided to any third party. Azure relies on FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules in the underlying operating system, and provides customers with a [wide range of options for encrypting data](../security/fundamentals/encryption-overview.md) in transit and at rest, including encryption key management using [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/general/overview.md), which can store encryption keys in FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security modules (HSMs) under customer control ([customer-managed keys](../security/fundamentals/encryption-models.md), CMK). Azure Key Vault is designed, deployed, and operated such that Microsoft and its agents do not see or extract customer keys.
- **Control over access to data** - Customers can know and control who can access their data and on what terms. Microsoft technical support personnel do not need and do not have default access to customer data. For those rare instances where resolving customer support requests requires elevated access to customer data, [Customer Lockbox for Azure](../security/fundamentals/customer-lockbox-overview.md) puts customers in charge of approving or denying customer data access requests.
- **Tools and protocols to prevent unauthorized deemed export/re-export** - Apart from the EAR and ITAR *end-to-end encryption* safe harbor for physical storage locations, the use of encryption also helps protect against a potential deemed export (or deemed re-export), because even if a non-US person has access to the encrypted data, nothing is revealed to non-US person who cannot read or understand the data while it is encrypted and thus there is no release of any controlled data. However, ITAR requires some authorization before granting foreign persons with access information that would enable them to decrypt ITAR technical data. Azure offers a wide range of encryption capabilities and solutions, flexibility to choose among encryption options, and robust tools for managing encryption.

## Location of customer data

Microsoft provides [strong customer commitments](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy/data-location) regarding [cloud services data residency and transfer policies](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/data-residency/). Most Azure services are deployed regionally and enable the customer to specify the region into which the service will be deployed, for example, United States. This commitment helps ensure that [customer data](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy/customer-data-definitions) stored in a US region will remain in the United States and will not be moved to another region outside the United States.

## Data encryption

Azure has extensive support to safeguard customer data using [data encryption](../security/fundamentals/encryption-overview.md), including various encryption models:

- Server-side encryption that uses service-managed keys, customer-managed keys (CMK) in Azure, or CMK in customer-controlled hardware.
- Client-side encryption that enables customers to manage and store keys on-premises or in another secure location.

Data encryption provides isolation assurances that are tied directly to encryption key access. Since Azure uses strong ciphers for data encryption, only entities with access to encryption keys can have access to data. Deleting or revoking encryption keys renders the corresponding data inaccessible. 

### FIPS 140-2 validated cryptography

The [Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/140/2/final) is a US government standard that defines minimum security requirements for cryptographic modules in information technology products. The FIPS 140-2 security requirements cover 11 areas related to the design and implementation of a cryptographic module. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Information Technology Laboratory operates a program that validates the FIPS approved cryptographic algorithms in the module.

Microsoft maintains an active commitment to meeting the [FIPS 140-2 requirements](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-fips-140-2), having validated cryptographic modules since the standard’s inception in 2001. Microsoft validates its cryptographic modules under the NIST [Cryptographic Module Validation Program](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program) (CMVP). Multiple Microsoft products, including many cloud services, use these cryptographic modules.

While the current CMVP FIPS 140-2 implementation guidance precludes a FIPS 140-2 validation for a cloud service, cloud service providers can obtain and operate FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules for the computing elements that comprise their cloud services. Azure is built with a combination of hardware, commercially available operating systems (Linux and Windows), and Azure-specific version of Windows. Through the Microsoft [Security Development Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/securityengineering/sdl/) (SDL), all Azure services use FIPS 140-2 approved algorithms for data security because the operating system uses FIPS 140-2 approved algorithms while operating at a hyper scale cloud. The corresponding crypto modules are FIPS 140-2 validated as part of the Microsoft [Windows FIPS validation program](/windows/security/threat-protection/fips-140-validation#modules-used-by-windows-server). Moreover, Azure customers can store their own cryptographic keys and other secrets in FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security modules (HSMs).

### Encryption key management

Proper protection and management of encryption keys is essential for data security. [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/index.yml) is a cloud service for securely storing and managing secrets. Key Vault enables customers to store their encryption keys in hardware security modules (HSMs) that are FIPS 140-2 validated. For more information, see [Data encryption key management](./azure-secure-isolation-guidance.md#data-encryption-key-management).

### Data encryption in transit

Azure provides many options for [encrypting data in transit](../security/fundamentals/encryption-overview.md#encryption-of-data-in-transit). Data encryption in transit isolates customer network traffic from other traffic and helps protect data from interception. For more information, see [Data encryption in transit](./azure-secure-isolation-guidance.md#data-encryption-in-transit).

### Data encryption at rest

Azure provides extensive options for [encrypting data at rest](../security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest.md) to help customers safeguard their data and meet their compliance needs using both Microsoft-managed encryption keys and customer-managed encryption keys. This process relies on multiple encryption keys and services such as Azure Key Vault and Azure Active Directory to ensure secure key access and centralized key management. For more information about Azure Storage encryption and Azure Disk encryption, see [Data encryption at rest](./azure-secure-isolation-guidance.md#data-encryption-at-rest).

Azure SQL Database provides [transparent data encryption](../azure-sql/database/transparent-data-encryption-tde-overview.md) (TDE) at rest by [default](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/newly-created-azure-sql-databases-encrypted-by-default/). TDE performs real-time encryption and decryption operations on the data and log files. Database Encryption Key (DEK) is a symmetric key stored in the database boot record for availability during recovery. It is secured via a certificate stored in the master database of the server or an asymmetric key called TDE Protector stored under customer control in [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/general/security-overview.md), which is Azure’s cloud-based external key management system. Key Vault supports [bring your own key](../azure-sql/database/transparent-data-encryption-byok-overview.md) (BYOK), which enables customers to store TDE Protector in Key Vault and control key management tasks including key rotation, permissions, deleting keys, enabling auditing/reporting on all TDE Protectors, etc. The key can be generated by the Key Vault, imported, or [transferred to the Key Vault from an on-premises HSM device](../key-vault/keys/hsm-protected-keys.md). Customers can also use the [Always Encrypted](../azure-sql/database/always-encrypted-azure-key-vault-configure.md) feature of Azure SQL Database, which is designed specifically to help protect sensitive data by allowing clients to encrypt data inside client applications and [never reveal the encryption keys to the database engine](/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-database-engine). In this manner, Always Encrypted provides separation between those users who own the data (and can view it) and those users who manage the data (but should have no access).

## Restrictions on insider access

All Azure and Azure Government employees in the United States are subject to Microsoft background checks. For more information, see [Screening](./documentation-government-plan-security.md#screening).

Insider threat is characterized as potential for providing back-door connections and cloud service provider (CSP) privileged administrator access to customer’s systems and data. For more information on how Microsoft restricts insider access to customer data, see [Restrictions on insider access](./documentation-government-plan-security.md#restrictions-on-insider-access).

## Customer monitoring of Azure resources

Azure provides essential services that customers can use to gain in-depth insight into their provisioned Azure resources and get alerted about suspicious activity, including outside attacks aimed at their applications and data. For more information about these services, see [Customer monitoring of Azure resources](./documentation-government-plan-security.md#customer-monitoring-of-azure-resources).

## Conclusion

Customers should carefully assess how their use of Azure may implicate US export controls and determine whether any of the data they want to store or process in the cloud may be subject to export controls. Microsoft Azure provides important technical features, operational processes, and contractual commitments to help customers manage export control risks. Where technical data subject to US export controls may be involved, Azure is configured to offer features that help mitigate the potential risk of customers inadvertently violating US export controls when accessing controlled technical data in Azure. With appropriate planning, customers can use Azure features and their own internal procedures to help ensure full compliance with US export controls when using the Azure platform.

## Next steps

To help Azure customers navigate export control rules, Microsoft has published the [Microsoft Azure Export Controls](https://aka.ms/Azure-Export-Paper) whitepaper, which describes US export controls (particularly as they apply to software and technical data), reviews potential sources of export control risks, and offers specific guidance to help customers assess their obligations under these controls.
