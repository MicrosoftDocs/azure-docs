## Prerequisites

- Review [Guidance for developers](./documentation-government-developer-guide.md), which discusses Azure Government's unique URLs and endpoints for managing your environment. You must know about these endpoints in order to connect to Azure Government.
- Review [Compare Azure Government and global Azure](./compare-azure-government-global-azure.md) and click on a service of interest to see variations between Azure Government and global Azure.

## Install PowerShell

Install PowerShell on your local machine. For more information, including how to check your PowerShell version, see [Install the Azure Az PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).

## Specifying Azure Government as the *environment* to connect to

When you start PowerShell, you have to tell Azure PowerShell to connect to Azure Government by specifying an environment parameter. The parameter ensures that PowerShell is connecting to the correct endpoints. The collection of endpoints is determined when you log in to your account. Different APIs require different versions of the environment switch.

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount -Environment AzureUSGovernment
```

When you get prompted to sign in, enter your email address for the Azure Government environment.
