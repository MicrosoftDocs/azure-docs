# What is Azure Government?

US government agencies or their partners interested in cloud services that meet government security and compliance requirements, can be confident that [Microsoft Azure Government](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/government/) provides world-class [security, protection, and compliance services](http://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/Compliance/default.aspx). Azure Government delivers a dedicated cloud enabling government agencies and their partners to transform mission-critical workloads to the cloud. Azure Government services handle data that is subject to certain government regulations and requirements, such as FedRAMP, NIST 800.171 (DIB), ITAR, IRS 1075, DoD L4, and CJIS. In order to provide you with the highest level of security and compliance, Azure Government uses physically isolated datacenters and networks (located in U.S. only).  

Azure Government customers (US federal, state, and local government or their partners) are subject to validation of eligibility. If there is a question about eligibility for Azure Government, you should consult your account team. To sign up for trial, request your [trial subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/government/request/?ReqType=Trial).
