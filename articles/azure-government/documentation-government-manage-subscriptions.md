# Managing and connecting to your subscription in Azure Government
Azure Government has unique URLs and endpoints for managing your environment. It is important to use the right connections to manage your environment through the portal or PowerShell. Once you are connected to the Azure Government environment, the normal operations for managing a service works if the component has been deployed.

## Connecting via the portal
The portal is the primary way that most people connect to Azure Government.  To connect, browse to the portal at [https://portal.azure.us](https://portal.azure.us).  The legacy version of the Azure portal can be accessed via [https://manage.windowsazure.us](https://manage.windowsazure.us).

Subscriptions can be created for your account by connecting to [https://account.windowsazure.us](https://account.windowsazure.us).
