# Create a Relay namespace using the Azure portal

A namespace is a scoping container for all your Azure Relay components. Multiple relays can reside in a single namespace, and namespaces often serve as application containers. There are currently two different ways to create a relay namespace:

1. Azure portal (this article).
2. [Azure Resource Manager](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md) templates.
