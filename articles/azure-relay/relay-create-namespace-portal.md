# Create a Relay namespace using the Azure portal

A namespace is a scoping container for all your Azure Relay components. Multiple relays can reside in a single namespace, and namespaces often serve as application containers. There are currently two different ways to create a relay namespace:

1. Azure portal (this article).
2. [Azure Resource Manager](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md) templates.

## Create a namespace in the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [relay-create-namespace-portal](./includes/relay-create-namespace-portal.md)]

Congratulations! You have now created a relay namespace.
