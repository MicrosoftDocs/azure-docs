# Tutorial: Get started with Relay Hybrid Connections HTTP requests in .NET
[!INCLUDE [relay-selector-hybrid-connections](./includes/relay-selector-hybrid-connections.md)]

In this quickstart, you create .NET sender and receiver applications that send and receive messages by using the HTTP protocol. The applications use Hybrid Connections feature of Azure Relay. To learn about Azure Relay in general, see [Azure Relay](relay-what-is-it.md). 

In this quickstart, you take the following steps:

1. Create a Relay namespace by using the Azure portal.
2. Create a hybrid connection in that namespace by using the Azure portal.
3. Write a server (listener) console application to receive messages.
4. Write a client (sender) console application to send messages.
5. Run applications. 

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following prerequisites:

* [Visual Studio 2019 or later](https://www.visualstudio.com). The examples in this tutorial use Visual Studio 2022.
* An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Create a namespace
[!INCLUDE [relay-create-namespace-portal](./includes/relay-create-namespace-portal.md)]

## Create a hybrid connection
[!INCLUDE [relay-create-hybrid-connection-portal](./includes/relay-create-hybrid-connection-portal.md)]

## Create a server application (listener)
In Visual Studio, write a C# console application to listen for and receive messages from the relay.

[!INCLUDE [relay-hybrid-connections-http-requests-dotnet-get-started-server](./includes/relay-hybrid-connections-http-requests-dotnet-get-started-server.md)]

## Create a client application (sender)
In Visual Studio, write a C# console application to send messages to the relay.

[!INCLUDE [relay-hybrid-connections-http-requests-dotnet-get-started-client](./includes/relay-hybrid-connections-http-requests-dotnet-get-started-client.md)]

## Run the applications
1. Run the server application. You see the following text in the console window:

    ```
    Online
    Server listening
    ```
1. Run the client application. You see `hello!` in the client window. The client sent an HTTP request to the server, and server responded with a `hello!`. 
3. Now, to close the console windows, press **ENTER** in both the console windows.

In this quickstart, you created .NET client and server applications that used HTTP to send and receive messages. The Hybrid Connections feature of Azure Relay also supports using WebSockets to send and receive messages. To learn how to use WebSockets with Azure Relay Hybrid Connections, see the [WebSockets quickstart](relay-hybrid-connections-dotnet-get-started.md).

In this quickstart, you used .NET Framework to create client and server applications. To learn how to write client and server applications using Node.js, see the [Node.js WebSockets quickstart](relay-hybrid-connections-node-get-started.md) or the [Node.js HTTP quickstart](relay-hybrid-connections-http-requests-dotnet-get-started.md).
