# Customer intent: As an Azure Batch user, I want to migrate my low-priority VMs to Spot VMs before the retirement deadline, so that I can continue to benefit from cost-effective compute resources without service disruption.

# Migrate Batch low-priority VMs to Spot VMs

The ability to allocate low-priority compute nodes in Azure Batch pools is being retired on *September 30, 2025*. Learn how to migrate your Batch pools with low-priority compute nodes to compute nodes based on Spot instances.

## About the feature

Currently, as part of a Batch pool configuration, you can specify a target number of low-priority compute nodes for Batch managed pool allocation Batch accounts. In user subscription pool allocation Batch accounts, you can specify a target number of spot compute nodes. In both cases, these compute resources are allocated from spare capacity and offered at a discount compared to dedicated, on-demand VMs.

The amount of unused capacity that's available varies depending on factors such as VM family, VM size, region, and time of day. Unlike dedicated capacity, these low-priority or spot VMs can be reclaimed at any time by Azure. Therefore, low-priority and spot VMs are typically viable for Batch workloads that are amenable to interruption or don't require strict completion timeframes to potentially lower costs.

## Feature end of support

Only low-priority compute nodes in Batch are being retired. Spot compute nodes will continue to be supported, is a GA offering, and not affected by this deprecation. On September 30, 2025, we'll retire low-priority compute nodes. After that date, existing low-priority pools in Batch may no longer be usable, attempts to seek back to target low-priority node counts will fail, and you'll no longer be able to provision new pools with low-priority compute nodes.

## Alternative: Use Azure Spot-based compute nodes in Batch pools

As of December 2021, Azure Batch began offering Spot-based compute nodes in Batch. Like low-priority VMs, you can use spot instances to obtain spare capacity at a discounted price in exchange for the possibility that the VM will be preempted. If a preemption occurs, the spot compute node will be evicted and all work that wasn't appropriately checkpointed will be lost. Checkpointing is optional and is up to the Batch end-user to implement. The running Batch task that was interrupted due to preemption will be automatically requeued for execution by a different compute node. Additionally, Azure Batch will automatically attempt to seek back to the target Spot node count as specified on the pool.

See the [detailed breakdown](batch-spot-vms.md) between the low-priority and spot offering in Batch.

## Migrate a Batch pool with low-priority compute nodes or create a Batch pool with Spot instances

1. Ensure that you're using a [user subscription pool allocation mode Batch account](batch-account-create-portal.md).

1. In the Azure portal, select the Batch account and view an existing pool or create a new pool.

1. Under **Scale**, select either **Target dedicated nodes** or **Target Spot/low-priority nodes**.

1. For an existing pool, select the pool, and then select **Scale** to update the number of spot nodes required based on the job scheduled.

1. Select **Save**.

## To Ensure the Migration is Correctly Applied:
```azurecli-interactive
az batch pool show 

--account-name <your-batch-account-name> 

--account-endpoint "https://<your-batch-account-name>.<region>.batch.azure.com" 

--pool-id <your-pool-id> 

--query "{PoolID:id, VMSize:vmSize, SpotNodes:scaleSettings.targetLowPriorityNodes}"
```

## FAQs

- How do I create a user subscription pool allocation Batch account?

   See the [quickstart](./batch-account-create-portal.md) to create a new Batch account in user subscription pool allocation mode.

- Are Spot VMs available in Batch managed pool allocation accounts?

  No. Spot VMs are available only in user subscription pool allocation Batch accounts.
  
- Are spot instances available for `CloudServiceConfiguration` Pools?

  No. Spot instances are only available for `VirtualMachineConfiguration` pools. `CloudServiceConfiguration` pools will be [retired](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-batch-cloudserviceconfiguration-pools-will-be-retired-on-29-february-2024/) before low-priority pools. We recommend that you migrate to `VirtualMachineConfiguration` pools and user subscription pool allocation Batch accounts before then.

- What is the pricing and eviction policy of spot instances? Can I view pricing history and eviction rates?

   Yes. In the Azure portal, you can see historical pricing and eviction rates per size in a region.

   For more information about using spot VMs, see [Spot Virtual Machines](/azure/virtual-machines/spot-vms).

- Can I transfer my quotas between Batch accounts?

  Currently you can't transfer any quotas between Batch accounts.
