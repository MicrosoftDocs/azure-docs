[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

## Sample script

[!INCLUDE [cli-launch-cloud-shell-sign-in.md](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/cli-launch-cloud-shell-sign-in.md)]

### Create a Batch account in Batch service mode

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azure_cli_scripts/batch/run-job/run-job.sh" id="FullScript":::

### To add many tasks at once

To add many tasks at once, specify the tasks in a JSON file, and pass it to the command. For format, see https://github.com/Azure/azure-docs-cli-python-samples/blob/master/batch/run-job/tasks.json. Provide the absolute path to the JSON file. For an example JSON file, see https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cli-samples/blob/master/batch/run-job/tasks.json.

```azurecli
az batch task create \
    --job-id myjob \
    --json-file tasks.json
```

### To update the job

Update the job so that it is automatically marked as completed once all the tasks are finished.

```azurecli
az batch job set \
--job-id myjob \
--on-all-tasks-complete terminatejob
```

### To monitor the status of the job

```azurecli
az batch job show --job-id myjob
```

### To monitor the status of a task

```azurecli
az batch task show \
    --job-id myjob \
    --task-id task1
```

## Clean up resources

az group delete --name $resourceGroup
