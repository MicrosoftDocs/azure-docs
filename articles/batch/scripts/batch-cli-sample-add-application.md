# CLI example: Add an application to an Azure Batch account

This script demonstrates how to add an application for use with an Azure Batch pool or task. To set up an application to add to your Batch account, package your executable, together with any dependencies, into a zip file.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

## Sample script

[!INCLUDE [cli-launch-cloud-shell-sign-in.md](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/cli-launch-cloud-shell-sign-in.md)]

### Create batch account and new application

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azure_cli_scripts/batch/add-application/add-application.sh" id="FullScript":::

### Create batch application package

An application can reference multiple application executable packages of different versions. The executables and any dependencies need to be zipped up for the package. Once uploaded, the CLI attempts to activate the package so that it's ready for use.

```azurecli
az batch application package create \
    --resource-group $resourceGroup \
    --name $batchAccount \
    --application-name "MyApplication" \
    --package-file my-application-exe.zip \
    --version-name 1.0
```

### Update the application

Update the application to assign the newly added application package as the default version.

```azurecli
az batch application set \
    --resource-group $resourceGroup \
    --name $batchAccount \
    --application-name "MyApplication" \
    --default-version 1.0
```

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [cli-clean-up-resources.md](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/cli-clean-up-resources.md)]

```azurecli
az group delete --name $resourceGroup
```
