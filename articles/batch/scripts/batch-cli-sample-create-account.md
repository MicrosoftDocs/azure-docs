# CLI example: Create a Batch account in Batch service mode

This script creates an Azure Batch account in Batch service mode and shows how to query or update various properties of the account. When you create a Batch account in the default Batch service mode, its compute nodes are assigned internally by the Batch
service. Allocated compute nodes are subject to a separate vCPU (core) quota and the account can be authenticated either via shared key credentials or a Microsoft Entra token.
