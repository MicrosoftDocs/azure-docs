# Customer intent: As a cloud operations engineer, I want to receive notifications for task failure events, so that I can quickly identify issues and take corrective actions to ensure job reliability and efficiency.

# Task fail event

 This event is emitted when a task completes with a failure. Currently all nonzero exit codes are considered failures. This event is emitted *in addition to* a task complete event and can be used to detect when a task fails.


 The following example shows the body of a task fail event.

```
{
    "jobId": "myJob",
    "id": "myTask",
    "taskType": "User",
    "systemTaskVersion": 0,
    "requiredSlots": 1,
    "nodeInfo": {
        "poolId": "pool-001",
        "nodeId": "tvm-257509324_1-20160908t162728z"
    },
    "multiInstanceSettings": {
        "numberOfInstances": 1
    },
    "constraints": {
        "maxTaskRetryCount": 2
    },
    "executionInfo": {
        "startTime": "2016-09-08T16:32:23.799Z",
        "endTime": "2016-09-08T16:34:00.666Z",
        "exitCode": 1,
        "retryCount": 2,
        "requeueCount": 0
    }
}
```

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|`jobId`|String|The ID of the job containing the task.|
|`id`|String|The ID of the task.|
|`taskType`|String|The type of the task. It's either 'JobManager' indicating it's a job manager task or 'User' indicating it's not a job manager task. It's not emitted for job preparation tasks, job release tasks, or start tasks.|
|`systemTaskVersion`|Int32|It's the internal retry counter on a task. Internally the Batch service can retry a task to account for transient issues. These issues can include internal scheduling errors or attempts to recover from compute nodes in a bad state.|
|`requiredSlots`|Int32|The required slots to run the task.|
|[`nodeInfo`](#nodeInfo)|Complex Type|Contains information about the compute node on which the task ran.|
|[`multiInstanceSettings`](#multiInstanceSettings)|Complex Type|Specifies that the task is a Multi-Instance Task requiring multiple compute nodes.  See [`multiInstanceSettings`](/rest/api/batchservice/get-information-about-a-task) for details.|
|[`constraints`](#constraints)|Complex Type|The execution constraints that apply to this task.|
|[`executionInfo`](#executionInfo)|Complex Type|Contains information about the execution of the task.|

|`poolId`|String|The ID of the pool on which the task ran.|
|`nodeId`|String|The ID of the node on which the task ran.|

|`numberOfInstances`|Int32|The number of compute nodes required by the task.|

|------------------|----------|-----------|
|`maxTaskRetryCount`|Int32|The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero.<br /><br /> This value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service tries the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries).<br /><br /> If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service doesn't retry tasks.<br /><br /> If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks without limit.<br /><br /> The default value is 0 (no retries).|


###  <a name="executionInfo"></a> executionInfo

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|`startTime`|DateTime|The time when the task started running. 'Running' corresponds to the **running** state, so if the task specifies resource files or application packages, then the start time reflects the time at which the task started downloading or deploying them. If the task is restarted or retried, it's the most recent time at which the task started running.|
|`endTime`|DateTime|The time when the task completed.|
|`exitCode`|Int32|The exit code of the task.|
|`retryCount`|Int32|The number of times the task is retried by the Batch service. The task is retried if it exits with a nonzero exit code, up to the specified MaxTaskRetryCount.|
|`requeueCount`|Int32|The number of times the task is requeued by the Batch service as a result of user request.<br /><br /> When users remove nodes from a pool (by resizing or shrinking it) or disable a job, they can choose to requeue the running tasks on those nodes for execution. This count tracks how many times the task is requeued for these reasons.|
