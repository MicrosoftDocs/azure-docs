# Customer intent: As a cloud engineer, I want to understand the Azure Batch runtime environment variables so that I can effectively reference them in my task command lines for successful execution within the Batch computing environment.

# Azure Batch runtime environment variables

The [Azure Batch service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/batch/) sets the following environment variables on compute nodes. You can reference these environment variables in task command lines, and in the programs and scripts run by the command lines.

For more information about using environment variables with Batch, see [Environment settings for tasks](jobs-and-tasks.md#environment-settings-for-tasks).

## Environment variable visibility

These environment variables are visible only in the context of the **task user**, which is the user account on the node under which a task is executed. You won't see these variables when [connecting remotely](./error-handling.md#connect-to-compute-nodes) to a compute node via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Secure Shell (SSH) and listing environment variables. This is because the user account that is used for remote connection is not the same as the account that is used by the task.

To get the current value of an environment variable, launch `cmd.exe` on a Windows compute node or `/bin/sh` on a Linux node:

`cmd /c set <ENV_VARIABLE_NAME>`

`/bin/sh -c "printenv <ENV_VARIABLE_NAME>"`

## Command-line expansion of environment variables

The command lines executed by tasks on compute nodes don't run under a shell. This means that these command lines can't natively use shell features such as environment variable expansion (including the `PATH`). To use such features, you must invoke the shell in the command line. For example, launch `cmd.exe` on Windows compute nodes or `/bin/sh` on Linux nodes:

`cmd /c MyTaskApplication.exe %MY_ENV_VAR%`

`/bin/sh -c "MyTaskApplication $MY_ENV_VAR"`

> [!NOTE]
> `AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN` is deprecated and will be retired on September 30, 2024. See the [announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-batch-task-authentication-token-will-be-retired-on-30-september-2024/) for details and alternative implementation.

| Variable name                     | Description                                                              | Availability | Example |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------|
| AZ_BATCH_ACCOUNT_NAME           | The name of the Batch account that the task belongs to.                  | All tasks.   | mybatchaccount |
| AZ_BATCH_ACCOUNT_URL            | The URL of the Batch account. | All tasks. | `https://myaccount.westus.batch.azure.com` |
| AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE            | A prefix of all the app package environment variables. For example, if Application "FOO" version "1" is installed onto a pool, the environment variable is AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE_FOO_1 (on Linux) or AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE_FOO#1 (on Windows). AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE_FOO_1 points to the location that the package was downloaded (a folder). When using the default version of the app package, use the AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE environment variable without the version numbers. If in Linux, and the application package name is "Agent-linux-x64" and the version is "1.1.46.0, the environment name is actually: AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE_agent_linux_x64_1_1_46_0, using underscores and lower case. For more information, see [Execute the installed applications](batch-application-packages.md#execute-the-installed-applications) for more details. | Any task with an associated app package. Also available for all tasks if the node itself has application packages. | AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE_FOO_1 (Linux) or AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE_FOO#1 (Windows) |
| AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN   | An authentication token that grants access to a limited set of Batch service operations. This environment variable is only present if the [authenticationTokenSettings](/rest/api/batchservice/task/add#authenticationtokensettings) are set when the [task is added](/rest/api/batchservice/task/add#request-body). The token value is used in the Batch APIs as credentials to create a Batch client, such as in the [BatchClient.Open() .NET API](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.batch.batchclient.open#Microsoft_Azure_Batch_BatchClient_Open_Microsoft_Azure_Batch_Auth_BatchTokenCredentials_). The token doesn't support private networking. | All tasks. | OAuth2 access token |
| AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR       | A directory within the [task working directory](files-and-directories.md) in which certificates are stored for Linux compute nodes. This environment variable does not apply to Windows compute nodes.                                                  | All tasks.   |  /mnt/batch/tasks/workitems/batchjob001/job-1/task001/certs |
| AZ_BATCH_HOST_LIST              | The list of nodes that are allocated to a [multi-instance task](batch-mpi.md) in the format `nodeIP,nodeIP`. | Multi-instance primary and subtasks. | `10.0.0.4,10.0.0.5` |
| AZ_BATCH_IS_CURRENT_NODE_MASTER | Specifies whether the current node is the master node for a [multi-instance task](batch-mpi.md). Possible values are `true` and `false`.| Multi-instance primary and subtasks. | `true` |

Only available if the job is configured with a job preparation task. | [AZ_BATCH_JOB_PREP_DIR](#task-environment-variables-related-to-directory-location) |
| AZ_BATCH_JOB_PREP_WORKING_DIR   | The full path of the job preparation [task working directory](files-and-directories.md) on the node. | All tasks except start task and job preparation task. Only available if the job is configured with a job preparation task. | [AZ_BATCH_JOB_PREP_WORKING_DIR](#task-environment-variables-related-to-directory-location) |
| AZ_BATCH_MASTER_NODE            | The IP address and port of the compute node on which the primary task of a [multi-instance task](batch-mpi.md) runs. Do not use the port specified here for MPI or NCCL communication - it is reserved for the Azure Batch service.

| AZ_BATCH_TASK_SHARED_DIR | A directory path that is identical for the primary task and every subtask of a [multi-instance task](batch-mpi.md). The path exists on every node on which the multi-instance task runs, and is read/write accessible to the task commands running on that node (both the [coordination command](batch-mpi.md#coordination-command) and the [application command](batch-mpi.md#application-command). Subtasks or a primary task that execute on other nodes do not have remote access to this directory (it is not a "shared" network directory). | Multi-instance primary and subtasks. | [AZ_BATCH_TASK_SHARED_DIR](#task-environment-variables-related-to-directory-location) |

## Environment variables related to directory location

The following table specifies the values of each environment variable value postfix after the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR value, see [AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR](files-and-directories.md#batch-root-directory-location) for more information.

|Environment Variable Name|Environment Variable Value Directory Postfix|
|:---|:---|
|AZ_BATCH_NODE_STARTUP_DIR|`startup`|
|AZ_BATCH_NODE_SHARED_DIR|`shared`|
|AZ_BATCH_NODE_MOUNTS_DIR|`fsmounts`|

## Task environment variables related to directory location

The job directories are different between [single-run job](jobs-and-tasks.md#jobs) and [job schedule](jobs-and-tasks.md#scheduled-jobs). The following table specifies the values of job directory in single-run job and job schedule.

|Job Type|Job Directory Value Postfix after AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR|
|:---|:---|
|Job|`workitems\{job name}\job-1`|
|Job Schedule|`workitems\{job schedule name}\{job name}`|

The following table specifies the values of each environment variable value postfix after the job directory.

|Environment Variable Name|Environment Variable Value Directory Postfix After Job Directory|
|:---|:---|
|AZ_BATCH_TASK_WORKING_DIR|`{task name}\wd`|
|AZ_BATCH_TASK_DIR|`{task name}`|
|AZ_BATCH_TASK_SHARED_DIR|`{task name}`|
