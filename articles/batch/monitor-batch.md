### Access diagnostics logs in storage

If you [archive Batch diagnostic logs in a storage account](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#send-to-azure-storage), a storage container is created in the storage account as soon as a related event occurs. Blobs are created according to the following naming pattern:

```json
insights-{log category name}/resourceId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/{subscription ID}/
RESOURCEGROUPS/{resource group name}/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.BATCH/
BATCHACCOUNTS/{Batch account name}/y={four-digit numeric year}/
m={two-digit numeric month}/d={two-digit numeric day}/
h={two-digit 24-hour clock hour}/m=00/PT1H.json
```

For example:

```json
insights-metrics-pt1m/resourceId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/
RESOURCEGROUPS/MYRESOURCEGROUP/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.BATCH/
BATCHACCOUNTS/MYBATCHACCOUNT/y=2018/m=03/d=05/h=22/m=00/PT1H.json
```

Each *PT1H.json* blob file contains JSON-formatted events that occurred within the hour specified in the blob URL (for example, `h=12`). During the present hour, events are appended to the *PT1H.json* file as they occur. The minute value (`m=00`) is always `00`, since diagnostic log events are broken into individual blobs per hour. All times are in UTC.

The following example shows a `PoolResizeCompleteEvent` entry in a *PT1H.json* log file. The entry includes information about the current and target number of dedicated and low-priority nodes and the start and end time of the operation.

```json
{ "Tenant": "65298bc2729a4c93b11c00ad7e660501", "time": "2019-08-22T20:59:13.5698778Z", "resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/RESOURCEGROUPS/MYRESOURCEGROUP/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.BATCH/BATCHACCOUNTS/MYBATCHACCOUNT/", "category": "ServiceLog", "operationName": "PoolResizeCompleteEvent", "operationVersion": "2017-06-01", "properties": {"id":"MYPOOLID","nodeDeallocationOption":"Requeue","currentDedicatedNodes":10,"targetDedicatedNodes":100,"currentLowPriorityNodes":0,"targetLowPriorityNodes":0,"enableAutoScale":false,"isAutoPool":false,"startTime":"2019-08-22 20:50:59.522","endTime":"2019-08-22 20:59:12.489","resultCode":"Success","resultMessage":"The operation succeeded"}}
```

To access the logs in your storage account programmatically, use the [Storage APIs](/rest/api/storageservices).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-platform-metrics](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-platform-metrics.md)]

Examples of metrics in a Batch account are Pool Create Events, Low-Priority Node Count, and Task Complete Events. These metrics can help identify trends and can be used for data analysis.

> [!NOTE]
> Metrics emitted in the last 3 minutes might still be aggregating, so values might be underreported during this time frame. Metric delivery isn't guaranteed and might be affected by out-of-order delivery, data loss, or duplication.

For a complete list of available metrics for Batch, see [Batch monitoring data reference](monitor-batch-reference.md#metrics).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-resource-logs](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-resource-logs.md)]

For the available resource log categories, their associated Log Analytics tables, and the logs schemas for Batch, see [Batch monitoring data reference](monitor-batch-reference.md#resource-logs).

You must explicitly enable diagnostic settings for each Batch account you want to monitor.

For the Batch service, you can collect the following logs:

- **ServiceLog**: [Events emitted by the Batch service](monitor-batch-reference.md#service-log-events) during the lifetime of an individual resource such as a pool or task.
- **AllMetrics**: Metrics at the Batch account level.

The following screenshot shows an example diagnostic setting that sends **allLogs** and **AllMetrics** to a Log Analytics workspace.

When you create an Azure Batch pool, you can install any of the following monitoring-related extensions on the compute nodes to collect and analyze data:

- [Azure Monitor agent for Linux](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-manage)
- [Azure Monitor agent for Windows](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-manage)
- [Azure Diagnostics extension for Windows VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/extensions-diagnostics)
- [Azure Monitor Logs analytics and monitoring extension for Linux](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/oms-linux)
- [Azure Monitor Logs analytics and monitoring extension for Windows](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/oms-windows)

For a comparison of the different extensions and agents and the data they collect, see [Compare agents](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview#compare-to-legacy-agents).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-activity-log](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-activity-log.md)]

For Batch accounts specifically, the activity log collects events related to account creation and deletion and key management.

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-analyze-data](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-analyze-data.md)]

When you analyze count-based Batch metrics like Dedicated Core Count or Low-Priority Node Count, use the **Avg** aggregation. For event-based metrics like Pool Resize Complete Events, use the **Count** aggregation. Avoid using the **Sum** aggregation, which adds up the values of all data points received over the period of the chart.

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-kusto-queries](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-kusto-queries.md)]

### Sample queries

Here are a few sample log queries for Batch:

Pool resizes: Lists resize times by pool and result code (success or failure):

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where OperationName=="PoolResizeCompleteEvent"
| summarize operationTimes=make_list(startTime_s) by poolName=id_s, resultCode=resultCode_s
```

Task durations: Gives the elapsed time of tasks in seconds, from task start to task complete.

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where OperationName=="TaskCompleteEvent"
| extend taskId=id_s, ElapsedTime=datetime_diff('second', executionInfo_endTime_t, executionInfo_startTime_t) // For longer running tasks, consider changing 'second' to 'minute' or 'hour'
| summarize taskList=make_list(taskId) by ElapsedTime
```

Failed tasks per job: Lists failed tasks by parent job.

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where OperationName=="TaskFailEvent"
| summarize failedTaskList=make_list(id_s) by jobId=jobId_s, ResourceId
```

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-insights-alerts](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-insights-alerts.md)]

### Batch alert rules

Because metric delivery can be subject to inconsistencies such as out-of-order delivery, data loss, or duplication, you should avoid alerts that trigger on a single data point. Instead, use thresholds to account for these inconsistencies over a period of time.

For example, you might want to configure a metric alert when your low priority core count falls to a certain level. You could then use this alert to adjust the composition of your pools. For best results, set a period of 10 or more minutes where the alert triggers if the average low priority core count falls lower than the threshold value for the entire period. This time period allows for metrics to aggregate so that you get more accurate results.

The following table lists some alert rule triggers for Batch. These alert rules are just examples. You can set alerts for any metric, log entry, or activity log entry listed in the [Batch monitoring data reference](monitor-batch-reference.md).

| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Metric | Unusable node count | Whenever the Unusable Node Count is greater than 0 |
| Metric | Task Fail Events | Whenever the total Task Fail Events is greater than dynamic threshold |

## Other Batch monitoring options

[Batch Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/BatchExplorer) is a free, rich-featured, standalone client tool to help create, debug, and monitor Azure Batch applications. You can use [Azure Batch Insights](https://github.com/Azure/batch-insights) with Batch Explorer to get system statistics for your Batch nodes, such as virtual machine (VM) performance counters.

In your Batch applications, you can use the [Batch .NET library](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.batch) to monitor or query the status of your resources including jobs, tasks, nodes, and pools. For example:

- Monitor the [task state](/rest/api/batchservice/task/list#taskstate).
- Monitor the [node state](/rest/api/batchservice/computenode/list#computenodestate).
- Monitor the [pool state](/rest/api/batchservice/pool/get#poolstate).
- Monitor [pool usage in the account](/rest/api/batchservice/pool/listusagemetrics).
- Count [pool nodes by state](/rest/api/batchservice/account/listpoolnodecounts).

You can use the Batch APIs to create list queries for Batch jobs, tasks, compute nodes, and other resources. For more information about how to filter list queries, see [Create queries to list Batch resources efficiently](batch-efficient-list-queries.md).

Or, instead of potentially time-consuming list queries that return detailed information about large collections of tasks or nodes, you can use the [Get Task Counts](/rest/api/batchservice/job/gettaskcounts) and [List Pool Node Counts](/rest/api/batchservice/account/listpoolnodecounts) operations to get counts for Batch tasks and compute nodes. For more information, see [Monitor Batch solutions by counting tasks and nodes by state](batch-get-resource-counts.md).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-insights](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-insights.md)]

### Application Insights

You can integrate Application Insights with your Azure Batch applications to instrument your code with custom metrics and tracing. For a detailed walkthrough of how to add Application Insights to a Batch .NET solution, instrument application code, monitor the application in the Azure portal, and build custom dashboards, see [Monitor and debug an Azure Batch .NET application with Application Insights](monitor-application-insights.md) and accompanying [code sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-batch-samples/tree/master/CSharp/ArticleProjects/ApplicationInsights).
