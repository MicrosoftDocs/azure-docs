# Pool autoscale event

 This event is emitted once a pool automatic scaling is executed. The content of the log will expose autoscale formula and evaluation results for the pool.

 The following example shows the body of a pool autoscale event for a pool automatic scaling which failed due to insufficient sample data.

```
{
    "id": "myPool1",
    "timestamp": "2020-09-21T18:59:56.204Z",
    "formula": "...",
    "results": "...",
    "error": {
        "code": "InsufficientSampleData",
        "message": "Autoscale evaluation failed due to insufficient sample data",
        "values": [{
                "name": "Message",
                "value": "Line 15, Col 44: Insufficient data from data set: $RunningTasks wanted 70%, received 50%"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
