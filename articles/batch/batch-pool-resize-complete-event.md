 This event is emitted when a pool resize is completed or failed.

 The following example shows the body of a pool resize complete event for a pool that increased in size and completed successfully.

```
{
   "id": "myPool",
   "nodeDeallocationOption": "invalid",
   "currentDedicatedNodes": 10,
   "targetDedicatedNodes": 10,
   "currentLowPriorityNodes": 5,
   "targetLowPriorityNodes": 5,
   "enableAutoScale": false,
   "isAutoPool": false,
   "startTime": "2016-09-09T22:13:06.573Z",
   "endTime": "2016-09-09T22:14:01.727Z",

|`id`|String|The ID of the pool.|
|`nodeDeallocationOption`|String|Specifies when nodes may be removed from the pool, if the pool size is decreasing.<br /><br /> Possible values are:<br /><br /> **requeue** – Terminate running tasks and requeue them. The tasks run again when the job is enabled. Remove nodes as soon as tasks are terminated.<br /><br /> **terminate** – Terminate running tasks. The tasks won't run again. Remove nodes as soon as tasks are terminated.<br /><br /> **taskcompletion** – Allow currently running tasks to complete. Schedule no new tasks while waiting. Remove nodes when all tasks are completed.<br /><br /> **Retaineddata** -  Allow currently running tasks to complete, then wait for all task data retention periods to expire. Schedule no new tasks while waiting. Remove nodes when all task retention periods are expired.<br /><br /> The default value is requeue.<br /><br /> If the pool size is increasing, then the value is set to **invalid**.|
|`currentDedicatedNodes`|Int32|The number of dedicated compute nodes currently assigned to the pool.|
|`targetDedicatedNodes`|Int32|The number of dedicated compute nodes that are requested for the pool.|
|`currentLowPriorityNodes`|Int32|The number of [Spot compute nodes](batch-spot-vms.md) currently assigned to the pool.|
|`targetLowPriorityNodes`|Int32|The number of Spot compute nodes that are requested for the pool.|
|`enableAutoScale`|Bool|Specifies whether the pool size automatically adjusts over time.|
|`isAutoPool`|Bool|Specifies whether the pool was created via a job's AutoPool mechanism.|
|`startTime`|DateTime|The time the pool resize started.|
|`endTime`|DateTime|The time the pool resize completed.|
