# Task complete event

 This event is emitted once a task is completed, regardless of the exit code. This event can be used to determine the duration of a task, where the task ran, and whether it was retried.


 The following example shows the body of a task complete event.

```
{
    "jobId": "myJob",
    "id": "myTask",
    "taskType": "User",
    "systemTaskVersion": 0,
    "requiredSlots": 1,
    "nodeInfo": {
        "poolId": "pool-001",
        "nodeId": "tvm-257509324_1-20160908t162728z"
    },
    "multiInstanceSettings": {
        "numberOfInstances": 1
    },
    "constraints": {
        "maxTaskRetryCount": 2
    },
    "executionInfo": {
        "startTime": "2016-09-08T16:32:23.799Z",
        "endTime": "2016-09-08T16:34:00.666Z",
        "exitCode": 0,
        "retryCount": 0,
        "requeueCount": 0
    }
}
```

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|`jobId`|String|The ID of the job containing the task.|
|`id`|String|The ID of the task.|
|`taskType`|String|The type of the task. This can either be 'JobManager' indicating it's a job manager task or 'User' indicating it isn't a job manager task. Note that this event isn't emitted for job preparation tasks, job release tasks, or start tasks.|
|`systemTaskVersion`|Int32|The internal retry counter on a task. Internally the Batch service can retry a task to account for transient issues. These issues can include internal scheduling errors or attempts to recover from compute nodes in a bad state.|
|`requiredSlots`|Int32|The required slots to run the task.|
|[`nodeInfo`](#nodeInfo)|Complex Type|Contains information about the compute node on which the task ran.|
|[`multiInstanceSettings`](#multiInstanceSettings)|Complex Type|Specifies that the task is a Multi-Instance Task requiring multiple compute nodes. See [`multiInstanceSettings`](/rest/api/batchservice/get-information-about-a-task) for details.|
|[`constraints`](#constraints)|Complex Type|The execution constraints that apply to this task.|
|[`executionInfo`](#executionInfo)|Complex Type|Contains information about the execution of the task.|

|`maxTaskRetryCount`|Int32|The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero.<br /><br /> This value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service tries the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries).<br /><br /> If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service doesn't retry tasks.<br /><br /> If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks without limit.<br /><br /> The default value is 0 (no retries).|

|------------------|----------|-----------|
|`startTime`|DateTime|The time when the task started running. 'Running' corresponds to the **running** state, so if the task specifies resource files or application packages, then the start time reflects the time when the task started downloading or deploying these. If the task restarted or retried, this is the most recent time at which the task started running.|
|`endTime`|DateTime|The time when the task completed.|
|`exitCode`|Int32|The exit code of the task.|
|`retryCount`|Int32|The number of times the task is retried by the Batch service. The task is retried if it exits with a nonzero exit code, up to the specified MaxTaskRetryCount.|
|`requeueCount`|Int32|The number of times the task is requeued by the Batch service as the result of a user request.<br /><br /> When you remove nodes from a pool (by resizing or shrinking it) or disable a job, you can choose to requeue the running tasks on those nodes for execution. This count tracks how many times the task requeued for these reasons.|
