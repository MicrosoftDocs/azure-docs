# Batch service quotas and limits

As with other Azure services, there are limits on certain resources associated with the Batch service. Many of these limits are default quotas applied by Azure at the subscription or account level. This article discusses those defaults, and how you can request quota increases.

Keep these quotas in mind as you are designing and scaling up your Batch workloads. For example, if your pool isn't reaching the target number of compute nodes you've specified, you might have reached the core quota limit for your Batch account.

You can run multiple Batch workloads in a single Batch account, or distribute your workloads among Batch accounts that are in the same subscription, but in different Azure regions.

If you plan to run production workloads in Batch, you may need to increase one or more of the quotas above the default. If you want to raise a quota, you can open an online [customer support request](#increase-a-quota) at no charge.

> [!NOTE]
> A quota is a credit limit, not a capacity guarantee. If you have large-scale capacity needs, please contact Azure support.
