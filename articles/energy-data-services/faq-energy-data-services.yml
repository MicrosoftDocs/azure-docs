        - question: What is Azure Data Manager for Energy?
          answer: >
            Azure Data Manager for Energy is a fully managed, cloud-based data platform solution for the energy industry. It's an enterprise-grade service that's based on the OSDU&reg; Data Platform. It brings together the security and trust of the Microsoft Azure cloud platform and the domain expertise of SLB.

    - name: Access
      questions:
        - question: How can I get access to Azure Data Manager for Energy?
          answer: >
            Azure Data Manager for Energy is available to all customers and partners who have a valid Azure subscription. You can create an instance by going to Azure Marketplace and searching for **Azure Data Manager for Energy**.

    - name: Legal Tags
      questions:
        - question: Why cannot the Country Of Origin (COO) specific configuration be updated by the customer? 
          answer: >
            The OSDU&reg; platform does not offer APIs for making country-specific configuration changes. These configuration settings are stored in .json files within the legal service container, and any changes require a service restart to take effect. Additionally, the Azure Data Manager for Energy service architecture does not expose the underlying infrastructure to customers, preventing them from making these changes directly.

    - name: External Data Sources
      questions:
        - question:  What is the impact of data sharing across tenancy boundaries on security, privacy, and compliance?
          answer: >
            Any data transferred across tenancy boundaries by the data provider and data consumer is the responsibility of the data provider and the data consumer. Microsoft will not store or process customer data outside the customer-specified Geo without your authorization. The data provider and consumer can use Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) and Private Links to secure data at rest and during transit.
        - question: How are the network bandwidth/data transfer charges handled with EDS usage?
          answer: >
            The deployment topology decided by the data provider and data consumer will determine the network bandwidth/data transfer costs.
        - question: Would data integrity be maintained when data provider deletes source data?
          answer: > 
            Currently, EDS does not support reconciling deleted data therefore deleting data at the data provider’s level may result in inconsistent records at the data consumer’s level.
        - question: What is the impact of secret key rotation at the data consumer’s end?
          answer: > 
            Key rotation is fully supported therefore it will not have any impact on EDS functionality.
        - question: When will EDS be generally available on Azure Data Manager for Energy?
          answer: >
            EDS is a preview feature in Azure Data Manager for Energy. We wish to learn from customer implementation of the EDS preview feature to ensure the functionality, performance, and scalability needs are met, before we make the feature generally available.


    - name: Data residency
      questions:
        - question: Where does Azure Data Manager for Energy store customer data?
          answer: >
             By default, Azure Data Manager for Energy replicates customer data to [Azure paired regions](/azure/reliability/cross-region-replication-azure#azure-paired-regions) for resiliency. The service doesn't replicate or move data outside the geography in which the customer created the instance. In some regions with requirements for data to remain within the single region, the service always keeps customer data within the same region. These regions are documented at [Data residency in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/data-residency/). For more information on the regions that support disaster recovery and cross-region data replication, see [Reliability in Azure Data Manager for Energy](reliability-energy-data-services.md).
