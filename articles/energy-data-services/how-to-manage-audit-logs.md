#Customer intent: As a developer, I want to use audit logs to check audit trail for data plane APIs for Azure Data Manager for Energy.

# Manage audit logs  
Audit logs provide auditing trails for data plane APIs on Azure Data Manager for Energy. With audit logs, you can tell:
* Who performed an action
* What was the action
* When was the action performed
* Status of the action

For example, when you “Add a new member” to the ```users.datalake.admins``` entitlement group using entitlements API, you're able to see this information in audit logs.

* Select the **Activity log** screen, and then select **Diagnostic settings**.
* Select **+ Add diagnostic setting**.
