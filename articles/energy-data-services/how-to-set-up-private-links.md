# Create a private endpoint for Azure Data Manager for Energy
[Azure Private Link](../private-link/private-link-overview.md) provides private connectivity from a virtual network to Azure platform as a service (PaaS). It simplifies the network architecture and secures the connection between endpoints in Azure by eliminating data exposure to the public internet.

By using Azure Private Link, you can connect to an Azure Data Manager for Energy instance from your virtual network via a private endpoint, which is a set of private IP addresses in a subnet within the virtual network. You can then limit access to your Azure Data Manager for Energy instance over these private IP addresses. 

You can connect to an Azure Data Manager for Energy instance that's configured with Private Link by using an automatic or manual approval method. To learn more, see the [Private Link documentation](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md#access-to-a-private-link-resource-using-approval-workflow).

This article describes how to set up a private endpoint for Azure Data Manager for Energy. 

> [!NOTE]
> To enable private endpoint, public access must be disabled for Azure Data Manager for Energy. If public access is enabled and private endpoint is created, the instance will only be accessed via private endpoint and not by public access.

> [!NOTE]
> Terraform currently does not support private endpoint creation for Azure Data Manager for Energy.

## Prerequisites

[Create a virtual network](../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md) in the same subscription as the Azure Data Manager for Energy instance. This virtual network allows automatic approval of the Private Link endpoint.

## Create a private endpoint during instance provisioning by using the Azure portal 

Use the following steps to create a private endpoint while provisioning Azure Data Manager for Energy resource:

1. During the creation of Azure Data Manager for Energy instance, select the **Networking** tab.

    [![Screenshot of the Networking tab during provisioning.](media/how-to-manage-private-links/private-links-11-networking-tab.png)](media/how-to-manage-private-links/private-links-11-networking-tab.png#lightbox)

1. In the Networking tab, select **Disable public access and use private access** and then choose **Add** under Private endpoint.

## Create a private endpoint post instance provisioning by using the Azure portal 

Use the following steps to create a private endpoint for an existing Azure Data Manager for Energy instance by using the Azure portal:

1. From the **All resources** pane, choose an Azure Data Manager for Energy instance.
1. Select **Networking** from the list of settings.       
1. On the **Public Access** tab, select **Enabled from all networks** to allow traffic from all networks.

## Manage multiple endpoints in the same virtual network
### Access via IP vs DNS
In the same virtual network, you can create multiple endpoints. Each end point will have a different IP. It is not possible to resolve one host name with two difference IPs. 
- If you access the resource via IP: 
   - The resource will be accessible only via the latest private IP address. 
   - All the previous private IPs in the same vnet will become dangling. 
   - Even when you delete the latest IP, all the previous IPs still remain dangling. 
- If you access via DNS name:  You won't see any difference.


### Know which endpoint the resource is connected to
1. Go to any of the private endpoints, to the DNS configuration, and to Private DNS Zone associated with ADME resource.

[![Screenshot that shows DNS Config.](media/how-to-manage-private-links/private-links-17-dns-config.png)](media/how-to-manage-private-links/private-links-17-dns-config.png#lightbox)


2. In the private DNS zone, check the IP associated with the entry for your Azure Data Manager for Energy instance.

[![Screenshot that shows DNS Zone.](media/how-to-manage-private-links/private-links-18-dns-zone.png)](media/how-to-manage-private-links/private-links-18-dns-zone.png#lightbox)


3. This is the IP to which your resource is connected.

## New data partitions with static IP private endpoints
It is preferable to create private endpoints with dynamic IP to enable dynamic data partition creation. If you initiate the creation of new data partitions with static IPs private endpoint, it will fail. Each new data partition requires three additional static IPs which the static IP private endpoint is not able to provide. 


To create new data partitions successfully with static IP private endpoint, follow the below steps:
1. Create a new private endpoint with either dynamic IP or enable public access.
2. Delete existing private endpoint with static IP from Azure Data Manager for Energy instance and delete it from Azure resources also.
3. Create new data partitions successfully.
4. Delete the newly created private endpoint with dynamic IP and/or disable public access.
5. Create a new private endpoint with static IP. This step will now ask to assign additional static IPs needed for new data partition.
