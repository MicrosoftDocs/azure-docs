# How to change the credit card used to pay for an Azure subscription

You may sometimes need to update details of the credit card in your account information, or change the card used to pay your bill.

If your credit card gets renewed and the number remains the same, you can simply update the details of the existing credit card, such as expiration date.

If your credit card number ever changes, due to being lost, stolen, or expired, you need to add the new credit card to your account. This is because the CVV security code on the card is changed when the credit card number changes.
