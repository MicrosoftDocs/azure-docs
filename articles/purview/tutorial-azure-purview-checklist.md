# Microsoft Purview (formerly Azure Purview) deployment checklist

This article lists prerequisites that help you get started quickly on planning and deployment for your Microsoft Purview (formerly Azure Purview) account.

If you are creating a plan to deploy Microsoft Purview, and also want to consider best practices as you develop your deployment strategy, then use [our deployment best practices guide](deployment-best-practices.md) to get started.

If you are looking for a strictly technical deployment guide, this deployment checklist is for you.

|No.  |Prerequisite / Action  |Required permission  |More guidance and recommendations  |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
|1    | Azure Active Directory Tenant        |N/A         |An [Azure Active Directory tenant](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant.md) should be associated with your subscription. <ul><li>*Global Administrator* or *Information Protection Administrator* role is required, if you plan to [extend Microsoft 365 Sensitivity Labels to the Microsoft Purview Data Map for files and db columns](create-sensitivity-label.md)</li><li> *Global Administrator* or *Power BI Administrator* role is required, if you're planning to [scan Power BI tenants](register-scan-power-bi-tenant.md).</li></ul>         |
|2     |An active Azure Subscription          |*Subscription Owner*         |An Azure subscription is needed to deploy Microsoft Purview and its managed resources. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.          |
|3     |Define whether you plan to deploy a Microsoft Purview with a managed event hub      |  N/A | You can choose to deploy configure an existing Event Hubs namespace during Microsoft Purview account creation, see [Microsoft Purview account creation](create-catalog-portal.md). With this managed namespace you can publish messages to the event hub kafka topic ATLAS_HOOK and Microsoft Purview will consume and process it. Microsoft Purview will notify entity changes to the event hub kafka topic ATLAS_ENTITIES and user can consume and process it. You can enable or disable this feature any time after account creation.      |  
|4     |Register the following resource providers: <ul><li>Microsoft.Storage</li><li>Microsoft.EventHub (optional)</li><li>Microsoft.Purview</li></ul>       |*Subscription Owner* or custom role to register Azure resource providers (_/register/action_)         | [Register required Azure Resource Providers](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md) in the Azure Subscription that is designated for Microsoft Purview Account. Review [Azure resource provider operations](../role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations.md).          |
|5     |Update Azure Policy to allow deployment of the following resources in your Azure subscription: <ul><li>Microsoft Purview</li><li>Azure Storage</li></ul>            |*Subscription Owner*          |Use this step if an existing Azure Policy prevents deploying such Azure resources. If a blocking policy exists and needs to remain in place,  follow our [Microsoft Purview exception tag guide](create-azure-purview-portal-faq.md) and follow the steps to create an exception for Microsoft Purview accounts.          |
|6     | Define your network security requirements.     | Network and Security architects.         |<ul><li> Review [Microsoft Purview network architecture and best practices](concept-best-practices-network.md) to define what scenario is more relevant to your network requirements. </li><li>If private network is needed, use [Microsoft Purview Managed IR](catalog-managed-vnet.md) to scan Azure data sources when possible to reduce complexity and administrative overhead. </li></ul>  |
|7     |An Azure Virtual Network and Subnet(s) for Microsoft Purview private endpoints.         | *Network Contributor* to create or update Azure VNet.         |Use this step if you're planning to deploy [private endpoint connectivity with Microsoft Purview](catalog-private-link.md):  <ul><li>Private endpoints for **Ingestion**.</li><li>Private endpoint for Microsoft Purview **Account**.</li><li>Private endpoint for Microsoft Purview **Portal**.</li></ul> <br> Deploy [Azure Virtual Network](../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md) if you need one.      |
|8     |Deploy private endpoint for Azure data sources.      |*Network Contributor* to set up private endpoints for each data source.         |Perform this step, if you're planning to use [Private Endpoint for Ingestion](catalog-private-link-end-to-end.md).          |
|9     |Define whether to deploy new or use existing Azure Private DNS Zones.         |Required [Azure Private DNS Zones](catalog-private-link-name-resolution.md) can be created automatically during Purview Account deployment using Subscription Owner / Contributor role         |Use this step if you're planning to use Private Endpoint connectivity with Microsoft Purview. Required DNS Zones for Private Endpoint: <ul><li>privatelink.purview.azure.com</li><li>privatelink.purviewstudio.azure.com</li><li>privatelink.blob.core.windows.net</li><li>privatelink.queue.core.windows.net</li><li>privatelink.servicebus.windows.net</li></ul>        |
|10     |A management machine in your CorpNet or inside Azure VNet to launch the Microsoft Purview governance portal.         |N/A         |Use this step if you're planning to set **Allow Public Network** to **deny** on your Microsoft Purview Account.         |
|11     |Deploy a Microsoft Purview Account         |Subscription Owner / Contributor         |Purview account is deployed with one Capacity Unit and will scale up based [on demand](concept-elastic-data-map.md).          |
|12     |Deploy a Managed Integration Runtime and Managed private endpoints for Azure data sources.      |*Data source admin* to set up Managed VNet inside Microsoft Purview. <br> *Network Contributor* to approve managed private endpoint for each Azure data source.         |Perform this step if you're planning to use [Managed VNet](catalog-managed-vnet.md). within your Microsoft Purview account for scanning purposes.          |
|13     |Deploy Self-hosted integration runtime VMs inside your network.         |Azure: *Virtual Machine Contributor* <br> On-premises: Application owner         |Use this step if you're planning to perform any scans using [Self-hosted Integration Runtime](manage-integration-runtimes.md).          |
|14     |Create a Self-hosted integration runtime inside Microsoft Purview.          |Data curator <br> VM Administrator or application owner        |Use this step if you're planning to use Self-hosted Integration Runtime instead of Managed Integration Runtime or Azure Integration Runtime. <br><br> <br> [download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39717)         |
