# Manage workflow requests and approvals 

This article outlines how to manage requests and approvals generated by a workflow. 

To view requests and approvals generated by a workflow instance, navigate to management center, and select on ‘Requests and Approvals’. 

You'll be presented with three tabs:
    * [Waiting for a response](#waiting-for-a-response) - This tab shows the requests (tasks) and approvals that are waiting for you to act upon. 
    * [Pending requests](#pending-requests) - You can view all the approval requests and tasks you've submitted in this tab. 
    * [History](#history) -  All the completed approvals and tasks are moved to this tab.

## Waiting for a response

This tab shows the requests (tasks) and approvals that are waiting for you to act upon. 

### Approvals

1. To Approve/Reject a request, select the request and you'll be presented with the following window:

    - Approved – An approver can mark the response as ‘Approved’ indicating their approval for the changes proposed by the requestor. 
    - Rejected - An approver can mark the response as ‘Rejected’ indicating that they don’t approve the changes proposed by the requestor.

1. Choose your response, optionally add comments, and select ‘Confirm’. 

### Tasks

1. To complete a task, select the task request and you'll be presented with the following window: 
1. A task has the following statues:
    - Not started – This is the status of the task when it's initially created by a workflow. 
    - In Progress – A task owner can mark the task as ‘In progress’ to indicate that they're currently working on it.
    - Complete – Once the task is complete, a task owner can change the status as ‘Complete’. This marks the completion of task activity, and the workflow will now move to the next step. 

## Pending requests
