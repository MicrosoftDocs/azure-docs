# How to view self service data access policies

In an Azure Purview catalog, you can now [request access](how-to-request-access.md) to data assets. If policies are currently available for the data source type and the data source has [data use governance enabled](how-to-enable-data-use-governance.md), a self service policy is generated when a data access request is approved.

This article describes how to view self service data access policies that have been auto-generated by approved access requests.

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To view self service policies, make sure that the below prerequisites are completed.

Self service policies must exist for them to be viewed. To enable and create self service policies, follow these articles:

1. [Enable Data Use Governance](how-to-enable-data-use-governance.md) - this will allow Azure Purview to create policies for your sources.
1. [Create a self service data access workflow](./how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid.md) - this will enable [users to request access to data sources from within Azure Purview](how-to-request-access.md).
1. [Approve a self service data access request](how-to-workflow-manage-requests-approvals#approvals) - after approving a request, if your workflow from the previous step includes the ability to create a self-service data policy, your policy will be created and will be viewable.

## Permission

Only the creator of your Azure Purview account, or users with [**Policy Admin**](catalog-permissions.md#roles) permissions can view self-service data access policies.

If you need to add or request permissions, follow the [Azure Purview permissions documentation](catalog-permissions.md#add-users-to-roles).

## Steps to view self service data access policies

1. Open the Azure portal and launch the [Azure Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/). The Azure Purview studio can be launched as shown below or by using the [url directly](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/).
