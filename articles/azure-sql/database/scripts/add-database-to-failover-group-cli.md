# Use the Azure CLI to add a database to a failover group

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb](../../includes/appliesto-sqldb.md)]

This Azure CLI script example creates a database in Azure SQL Database, creates a failover group, adds the database to it, and tests failover.

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Sample script

### Sign in to Azure

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

```azurecli-interactive
$subscription = "<subscriptionId>" # add subscription here

az account set -s $subscription # ...or use 'az login'
```

### Run the script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../../cli_scripts/sql-database/failover-groups/add-single-db-to-failover-group-az-cli.sh "Add Azure SQL Database to failover group")]

### Clean up deployment

Use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resource
```

## Sample reference

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command-specific documentation.

| | |
|---|---|
| [az sql db](/cli/azure/sql/db) | Database commands. |
| [az sql failover-group](/cli/azure/sql/failover-group) | Failover group commands. |
