# SQL vulnerability assessment helps you identify database vulnerabilities
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi-asa](../includes/appliesto-sqldb-sqlmi-asa.md)]

SQL vulnerability assessment is an easy-to-configure service that can discover, track, and help you remediate potential database vulnerabilities. Use it to proactively improve your database security.

Vulnerability assessment is part of the [Azure Defender for SQL](azure-defender-for-sql.md) offering, which is a unified package for advanced SQL security capabilities. Vulnerability assessment can be accessed and managed via the central Azure Defender for SQL portal.

> [!NOTE]
> Vulnerability assessment is supported for Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse Analytics. Databases in Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse Analytics are referred to collectively in the remainder of this article as databases, and the server is referring to the [server](logical-servers.md) that hosts databases for Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse.

## What is SQL vulnerability assessment?

SQL vulnerability assessment is a service that provides visibility into your security state. Vulnerability assessment includes actionable steps to resolve security issues and enhance your database security. It can help you to monitor a dynamic database environment where changes are difficult to track and improve your SQL security posture.

Vulnerability assessment is a scanning service built into Azure SQL Database. The service employs a knowledge base of rules that flag security vulnerabilities. It highlights deviations from best practices, such as misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and unprotected sensitive data.

The rules are based on Microsoft's best practices and focus on the security issues that present the biggest risks to your database and its valuable data. They cover database-level issues and server-level security issues, like server firewall settings and server-level permissions.

Results of the scan include actionable steps to resolve each issue and provide customized remediation scripts where applicable. You can customize an assessment report for your environment by setting an acceptable baseline for:

- Permission configurations
- Feature configurations
- Database settings

## Configure vulnerability assessment

Take the following steps to configure the vulnerability assessment:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the specific resource in Azure SQL Database, SQL Managed Instance Database, or Azure Synapse.

1. Under the **Security** heading, select **Security Center**.

1. Select **Configure** on the link to open the Azure Defender for SQL settings pane for either the entire server or managed instance.

    :::image type="content" source="media/sql-vulnerability-assessment/opening-sql-configuration.png" alt-text="Opening the Defender for SQL configuration":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > SQL vulnerability assessment requires **Azure Defender for SQL** plan to be able to run scans. For more information about how to enable Azure Defender for SQL, see [Azure Defender for SQL](azure-defender-for-sql.md).

1. In the **Server settings** page, define the Azure Defender for SQL settings:

    :::image type="content" source="media/sql-vulnerability-assessment/sql-vulnerability-scan-settings.png" alt-text="Configuring the SQL vulnerability assessment scans":::

    1. Configure a storage account where your scan results for all databases on the server or managed instance will be stored. For information about storage accounts, see [About Azure storage accounts](../../storage/common/storage-account-create.md).

        > [!TIP]
        > For more information about storing vulnerability assessment scans behind firewalls and VNets, see [Store vulnerability assessment scan results in a storage account accessible behind firewalls and VNets](sql-database-vulnerability-assessment-storage.md).

    1. To configure vulnerability assessments to automatically run weekly scans to detect security misconfigurations, set **Periodic recurring scans** to **On**. The results are sent to the email addresses you provide in **Send scan reports to**. You can also send email notification to admins and subscription owners by enabling **Also send email notification to admins and subscription owners**.

1. SQL vulnerability assessment scans can also be run on-demand:

    1. From the resource's **Security Center** page, select **View additional findings in Vulnerability Assessment** to access the scan results from previous scans.

        :::image type="content" source="media/sql-vulnerability-assessment/view-additional-findings-link.png" alt-text="Opening the scan results and manual scan options":::

    1. To run an on-demand scan to scan your database for vulnerabilities, select **Scan** from the toolbar:

        :::image type="content" source="media/sql-vulnerability-assessment/on-demand-vulnerability-scan.png" alt-text="Select scan to run an on-demand vulnerability assessment scan of your SQL resource":::


  > [!NOTE]
  > The scan is lightweight and safe. It takes a few seconds to run and is entirely read-only. It doesn't make any changes to your database.

## Remediate vulnerabilities

1. When your scan is finished, your scan report is automatically displayed in the Azure portal. The report presents an overview of your security state. It lists how many issues were found and their respective severities. Results include warnings on deviations from best practices and a snapshot of your security-related settings, such as database principals and roles, and their associated permissions.

    ![View the report](./media/sql-vulnerability-assessment/pp_main_getstarted.png)

1. Review your results and determine the findings in the report that are true security issues in your environment. Drill down to each failed result to understand the impact of the findings and why each security check failed. Use the actionable remediation information provided by the report to resolve issues.

    ![Analyze the report](./media/sql-vulnerability-assessment/pp_fail_rule_show_remediation.png)

1. As you review your assessment results, you can mark specific results as being an acceptable *baseline* in your environment. The baseline is essentially a customization of how the results are reported. Results that match the baseline are considered as passing in subsequent scans. After you've established your baseline security state, vulnerability assessment only reports on deviations from the baseline. In this way, you can focus your attention on the relevant issues.

    ![Set your baseline](./media/sql-vulnerability-assessment/pp_fail_rule_show_baseline.png)

1. After you finish setting up your **Rule Baselines**, run a new scan to view the customized report. Vulnerability assessment now reports only the security issues that deviate from your approved baseline state.

Vulnerability assessment can now be used to ensure that your database maintains a high level of security, and that your organizational policies are met. 

## Advanced capabilities

### Export an assessment report

Select **Export Scan Results** to create a downloadable Excel report of your scan result. This report contains a summary tab that displays a summary of the assessment. The report includes all failed checks. It also includes a **Results** tab that contains the full set of results from the scan. The results include all checks that were run and the result details for each.

### View scan history

Select **Scan History** in the vulnerability assessment pane to view a history of all scans previously run on this database. Select a particular scan in the list to view the detailed results of that scan.

## Manage vulnerability assessments programmatically

### Using Azure PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The PowerShell Azure Resource Manager module is still supported, but all future development is for the Az.Sql module. For these cmdlets, see [AzureRM.Sql](/powershell/module/AzureRM.Sql/). The arguments for the commands in the Az module and in the AzureRm modules are substantially identical.

You can use Azure PowerShell cmdlets to programmatically manage your vulnerability assessments. The supported cmdlets are:

### Using Resource Manager templates

To configure vulnerability assessment baselines by using Azure Resource Manager templates, use the `Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases/vulnerabilityAssessments/rules/baselines` type.

Ensure that you have enabled `vulnerabilityAssessments` before you add baselines.

Here's an example for defining Baseline Rule VA2065 to `master` database and VA1143 to `user` database as resources in a Resource Manager template:

```json
   "resources": [
      {
         "type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases/vulnerabilityAssessments/rules/baselines",
         "apiVersion": "2018-06-01-preview",
         "name": "[concat(parameters('server_name'),'/', parameters('database_name') , '/default/VA2065/master')]",
         "properties": {
            "baselineResults": [
               {
                  "result": [
                     "FirewallRuleName3",
                     "StartIpAddress",
                     "EndIpAddress"
                  ]
               },
               {
                  "result": [
                     "FirewallRuleName4",
                     "62.92.15.68",
                     "62.92.15.68"
                  ]
               }
            ]
         },
         "type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases/vulnerabilityAssessments/rules/baselines",
         "apiVersion": "2018-06-01-preview",
         "name": "[concat(parameters('server_name'),'/', parameters('database_name'), '/default/VA2130/Default')]",
         "dependsOn": [
            "[resourceId('Microsoft.Sql/servers/vulnerabilityAssessments', parameters('server_name'), 'Default')]"
         ],
         "properties": {
            "baselineResults": [
               {
                  "result": [
                     "dbo"
                  ]
               }
            ]
         }
      }
   ]
```

For `master` database and `user` database, the resource names are defined differently:

- Master database - "name": "[concat(parameters('server_name'),'/', parameters('database_name') , '/default/VA2065/<b>master</b>')]",
- User database - "name": "[concat(parameters('server_name'),'/', parameters('database_name') , '/default/VA2065/<b>default</b>')]",

To handle Boolean types as true/false, set the baseline result with binary input like "1"/"0".

```json
   {
      "type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases/vulnerabilityAssessments/rules/baselines",
      "apiVersion": "2018-06-01-preview",
      "name": "[concat(parameters('server_name'),'/', parameters('database_name'), '/default/VA1143/Default')]",

      "dependsOn": [
         "[resourceId('Microsoft.Sql/servers/vulnerabilityAssessments', parameters('server_name'), 'Default')]"
      ],

      "properties": {
         "baselineResults": [
            {
               "result": [
                  "1"
               ]
            }
         ]
      }

   }
```
