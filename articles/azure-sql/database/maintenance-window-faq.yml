title: Maintenance window FAQ
summary: This article answers frequently asked questions about the maintenance window for [Azure SQL database](sql-database-paas-overview.md) and [SQL managed instance](../managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview.md).
sections:
  - name: General
    questions: 
      - question: What is the maintenance window feature?
        answer: |
         The maintenance window feature provides you with the ability to onboard Azure SQL resource to prescheduled time blocks outside of business hours. See [Maintenance window schedules](maintenance-window.md#gain-more-predictability-with-maintenance-window) for more information.

      - question: What is the default maintenance policy if I do not choose any specific window? 
        answer: |
          Maintenance events will occur during the default window 5PM to 8AM local time, Monday - Sunday. 

      - question: Users work in a different time zone than the Azure data center. Which time zone is local?
        answer: |
          Local time is determined by the location of Azure region that hosts the resource and may observe daylight saving time in accordance with local time zone definition. It is not determined by the time zone configured on SQL database (always UTC) or managed instance.

      - question: Can I choose a specific time/day for the maintenance window?
        answer: |
          No, you can choose between pre-scheduled weekday or weekend windows. The maintenance can happen any time or day within the window.  

      - question: What happens once I choose a maintenance window? 
        answer: | 
          Configuring maintenance window is a long running asynchronous operation, similar to changing the service tier of your Azure SQL resource. The resource is available during the process, except a short failover that happens at the end of the operation and typically lasts up to 8 seconds even in case of interrupted long-running transactions. To minimize the impact of failover you should perform the operation outside of the peak hours. In case of managed instance, IP address of the instance will change.

      - question: What types of updates are typically performed during a maintenance window? 
        answer: |
          The maintenance event may contain updates for hardware, firmware, operating system, satelite software components, and SQL engine. They are typically combined into a single batch to minimize the incidence of maintenance events.

      - question: What can I expect during a maintenance event?
        answer: |
          During a maintenance update, databases are fully available and accessible but some of the maintenance updates require a failover as Azure takes SQL Databases offline for a short time to apply the maintenance updates (generally a few seconds in duration). Planned maintenance updates occur once every 35 days on average, which means customer can expect approximately one planned maintenance event per month per Azure SQL Database and managed instance, and only during the maintenance window slots selected by the customer.

      - question: Are there any prerequisites for configuring maintenance window?
        answer: |
          In case of managed instance [additional IP addresses](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/vnet-subnet-determine-size#address-requirements-for-update-scenarios) are needed temporarily, as in scaling vCores scenario for corresponding service tier.

      - question: In which regions is choosing a maintenance window available?
        answer: | 
          For a list of available regions, see [Maintenance window availability](maintenance-window.md#availability).
      
      - question: I don’t see my region in the available regions list, what can I do? 
        answer: |
          Contact [azsqlcmfeedback@microsoft.com](mailto:azsqlcmfeedback@microsoft.com) to share the feedback and check the plans for your region. 
      
      - question: What is the pricing for maintenance window? 
        answer: |
          Configuring and using maintenance window is free of charge to all eligible Azure subscription types, see [Maintenance window cost](maintenance-window.md#cost-and-eligibility).
        
      - question: Would I receive a notification of the maintenance window?
        answer: |
          You can opt in to receive notification 24 hours prior to the maintenance event, immediately before maintenance starts, and when the maintenance window is completed. The Resource health center can be checked for more information. To receive emails, advance notification must be configured, for more information see [Advance notifications](advance-notifications.md).

      - question: In which service level objectives (SLOs) can I choose a maintenance window? 
        answer: |
          Choosing a maintenance window is available in most SLOs with some exceptions, see [maintenance window supported service level objectives](maintenance-window.md#supported-service-level-objectives).

      - question: If I have selected a maintenance window for a resource, and I downscale to a service level objective (SLO) where choosing a maintenance window is not supported, what happens to my database?
        answer: |
          In this case, the maintenance window would revert to the default option which is 5PM to 8AM local time.
      
      - question: Can I cancel or postpone a planned maintenance event based on the received notification?
        answer: |
          No. Cancelling or postponing an upcoming maintenance event is not supported. Notifications help you to prepare for the event.

      - question: How long does it take to process a maintenance window schedule change?
        answer: |
          You can choose a different maintenance window at any time, but changes may take up to 24 hours to take effect. 

      - question: What happens when a maintenance event fails?
        answer: |
          Although rare, failures or interruptions during a maintenance event can occur.  In the event of a failure, changes are rolled back and the maintenance will be rescheduled to another time.    

      - question: How do I validate that my databases are set up for maintenance window?
        answer: |
          Under settings of the Azure resource, the maintenance tab allows you to review and change the current maintenance plan schedule. You can also review and set the maintenance window schedules for multiple resources via PowerShell, CLI, or Azure API.

      - question: Can I configure a different maintenance window for each Azure SQL database in an elastic pool?
        answer: |
         If the database is part of an elastic pool, the maintenance window configuration of the elastic pool will be applied. Single databases outside of an elastic pool can have their own maintenance window configuration.

      - question: What are supported options to configure a maintenance window for an existing Azure SQL Database or SQL managed instance?
        answer: |
          Azure Portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, and REST API.

      - question: Can I configure a maintenance window during database restore, recovery, copy, import, or GeoDR scenarios?
        answer: |
          Not at this moment. The maintenance window can be configured once database is created.
