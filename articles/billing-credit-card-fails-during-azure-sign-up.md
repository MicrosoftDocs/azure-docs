# Your debit card or credit card is declined at Azure sign up
If your debit card or credit card is declined or not accepted when you sign up for Azure, you might have one of the following issues to fix.

* **The credit card or debit card provider is not accepted for your country.** When you choose a card, you only see the options that are valid in the country that you select. Contact your bank or card issuer to confirm that your credit card is enabled for international transactions. See [supported countries and currencies](billing-countries-and-currencies.md).
* **Your credit or debit card information is inaccurate or incomplete.** The name, address, and CVV code you enter must match exactly what’s printed on the card.
* **You're using a virtual or prepaid card.** Virtual or prepaid credit or debit cards aren't accepted as payment for Azure subscriptions.
* **The card is inactive or blocked.** Contact your bank and make sure that the card is active and not blocked.
* **You're trying to activate a second free trial.** The Azure Free Trial offer is limited to one free trial activation per user. If you already activated a free trial with this credit card or had an Azure subscription that was linked to this credit card, you can’t activate a free trial. Use another Azure plan from [Microsoft Azure Offer Details](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/offer-details/). 

After you update your payment information, try signing up again.

## Business that doesn't want to pay by card? Set up invoicing
If you represent a business, you can pay for your Azure subscription with invoice payment methods like checks, overnight checks, or wire transfers. You can’t change to another payment option after you’re set up to pay by invoice. To pay by invoice, see [Azure Billing - How to invoice](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/invoicing/).

## Update your credit card or debit card information
After you sign up, [manage your payment information](billing-how-to-change-credit-card.md) to change or remove a card. 

## Need help? Contact support.
