# Tutorial: Back up an Azure Extended Zone virtual machine

You can protect your data by taking backups at regular intervals. Azure Backup creates recovery points that can be stored in geo-redundant recovery vaults. In this article, you learn how to back up an existing virtual machine (VM) using the Azure portal.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Create a Recovery Services vault.
> - Apply a backup policy to an Extended Zone VM.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

- An Azure virtual machine (VM) in an Extended Zone. For more information, see [Deploy a virtual machine in an Extended Zone](deploy-vm-portal.md).

## Create a Recovery Services vault

A Recovery Services vault is a management entity that stores recovery points that are created over time, and it provides an interface to perform backup-related operations. These operations include taking on-demand backups, performing restores, and creating backup policies. In this section, you create a Recovery Services vault.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter ***backup***. Select **Backup center** from the search results.

1. On the **Overview** page, select **+ Vault**.

1. On the **Start: Create Vault** page, select **Recovery Services vault** and then select **Continue**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of **Create Recovery Services vault**, enter or select the following information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Project Details** |  |
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **Create new**. </br> Enter *myResourceGroup* in **Name**. </br> Select **OK**. |
    | **Instance Details** |  |
    | Vault name | Enter *myVault*. |
    | Region | Select **West US**. Recovery Services vault can only be created in an Azure region and not in an Azure Extended Zone. |

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. Review the settings, and then select **Create**.

## Apply a backup policy

1. On the **Overview** page of **Backup center**, select **+ Backup**.

1. On **Start: Configure Backup** page, select the following information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Datasource type** |  |
    | Datasource type | Select **Azure virtual machines**. |
    | Vault | Select **myVault**. You'll use this Recovery Services vault to store your VM backups. |

1. Select **Continue**.

1. On **Configure backup** page, select **Enhanced** to choose the Enhanced policy, then select **Add** to add the virtual machines that you want to backup using this policy.

1. Select **Enable backup**.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resource group and the resources it contains:

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter ***myResourceGroup***. Select **myResourceGroup** from the search results.
