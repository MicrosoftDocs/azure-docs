# Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster in an Azure Extended Zone

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that lets you quickly deploy and manage clusters. In this article, you learn how to create an AKS cluster in Los Angeles Extended Zone.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription.

- Access to Los Angeles Extended Zone. For more information, see [Request access to an Azure Extended Zone](request-access.md).

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your Azure account.

## Create an AKS cluster in an Extended Zone

In this section, you create an AKS cluster in Los Angeles.

> [!NOTE]
> To quickly get started with provisioning an AKS cluster in an Extended Zone, this article includes steps to deploy a cluster with default settings for evaluation purposes only. Before deploying a production-ready cluster, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with our [baseline reference architecture](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks/baseline-aks?toc=/azure/extended-zones/toc.json) to consider how it aligns with your business requirements.
