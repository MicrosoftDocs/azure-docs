# What are API Apps?

## Overview

*API Apps* in Azure *App Service* provide the ability to discover, host, manage and monetize API’s and SaaS connectors on a modern, feature rich, scalable, and globally available cloud platform.

Azure *App Service* is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) offering for Enterprise Developers and System Integrators that brings a rich set of capabilities to *web app* development, including:

- Fully managed platform - automatic patching and management.
- Secure cloud platform that is ISO, SOC2, and PIC compliant.
- Ability to provision and deploy web apps in seconds.
- Support for .NET, Java, PHP, Node, and Python.
- Rich integration with Visual Studio, including simple publish and remote debugging.
- Built-in staging, backup, roll-back, and testing-in-production capabilities.
- Built-in autoscale, load balancing, and performance monitoring.
- High availability with geo-distributed deployments.
- Continuous deployment with Git, TFS, and GitHub.
- Access to on premises data with VPN and Hybrid Connections.
- Delegated and role-based administration of cloud apps and their resources.

## Bring your API’s as-is

Use ASP.NET, Java, PHP, Node.js or Python for your APIs. Your APIs can take advantage of the features of Azure App Service with no changes.

## Connect Your apps To popular SaaS platforms

Azure App Service makes it easy to connect your applications to popular SaaS platforms with a continually growing list of connectors, including Salesforce, Office 365, Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, and many more.

## Enterprise grade security

Azure App Service makes it easy to secure your APIs. Secure your API apps with support for Azure Active Directory including Single Sign-On support for many third party services and connectors. Rich support for
social authentication to Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Twitter is also available.

## Simple access control

Azure App Service provides simple access controls for your API apps. APIs can be exposed to just the other apps inside of your Azure App Service or to the public, with no changes to your code.

## Public and organization gallery of APIs

With Azure App Service, teams can easily share API’s with other teams in your organization, by using your own private organizational gallery of APIs. APIs can also be shared publicly for consumption by third party developers.

## Automatic SDK generation

Azure App Service enables you to take your existing APIs and automatically build SDKs for a variety of languages including C#, Java, and Javascript, making your APIs available to many platforms.

## Use the best IDE in the market

[Visual
Studio](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/campaigns/visual-studio-2013/) integration allows for full lifecycle app management in one place. Azure VS integration allows you to create and continuously package and publish your API apps. With VS you can debug in the cloud as well as view live log diagnostic data.

## No ops

Run your API apps in a high-availability environment with automatic patching. API apps deployed with Azure App Service are isolated and are hosted in VMs dedicated to your applications – ensuring predictable performance and security isolation.

## Automatically scale

Azure App Service enables you to quickly scale up or out to handle any incoming customer load. Manually select the number and size of VMs or set up
[auto-scaling](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/videos/auto-scaling-azure-web-sites/)
to scale your servers based on load or schedule.

## Access on-premises data

Azure App Service enables you to build APIs that can consume data from your own data center. With [Hybrid Connections](../integration-hybrid-connection-overview/) and [VNET](../web-sites-integrate-with-vnet/) it's easy to access your data securely from your on-premises data
centers - or anywhere else in the world. [Azure Active Directory](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-whatis/) enables you to limit access to only your employees or partners.
Interested in moving an on-premises website to the cloud? Use the [Migration Assistant](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-migration-from-iis-server/) to analyze and migrate your site with just a few clicks.

## Friction-free deploy

Set up continuous integration and deployment workflows with Visual Studio Online, GitHub, TeamCity, Hudson, or BitBucket – enabling you to automatically build, test and deploy your API app on each successful code check-in or integration tests.
