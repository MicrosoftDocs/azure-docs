# Web Apps Overview #

## Web Apps in Azure App Service ##

Web Apps in Azure App Service is part of a new paradigm which allows you to build a modern application using a suite of tightly integrated components. To make building applications easier, faster, and cheaper, Azure now gives you App Service. 

Web Apps in Azure App Service focuses on building web applications. It is a fully featured managed web applications platform, which can easily be integrated with any other Azure component. 

## Types of web apps ## 

There are three main types of web apps. The easiest way to get started is by using one of the many CMS templates that are found in our application gallery. Therein you will find popular applications, such as, WordPress, Orchard, Joomla, Umbraco, and many more. If you want to bring your coding expertise to Azure, we offer a plethora of development frameworks, including .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, and PHP. Finally, you can use this scalable platform to run background processing without a Web front-end.

## Deployment and management ##

Today’s applications are very complex. To manage this complexity Azure App Service, and specifically Web Apps, offers many options for managing your content. You can deploy your content via Visual Studio integration or FTP, or by all of the most popular versioning tools and services, like Git, GitHub, Mercurial, TFS, and many more. This allows you to quickly and easily deploy your application. 

Versioning and deployment tools are not complete without staging environments, to which you can deploy and test your content updates. Web Apps offers staged deployment and a testing in production platform. These features give you not only the environment to deploy to, but also control of how to ramp up your new content to production and even perform A/B tests.

## Monitoring and troubleshooting ##

Web Apps has the tools you need to monitor and troubleshoot your content. Use Web Tests to externally monitor your apps and get an automated warning when something goes wrong. App Insights, New Relic, process explorer and a few other tools help keep you abreast of how well your app is doing. In case something goes wrong, you have access to runtime logs, diagnostics service, and remote debugging. And if all else fails, you can restore your previously backed-up content with the built-in backup and restore functionality. 

## Scale in every direction ##

You can scale vertically by simply defining how many parallel instances you want of your application. As your business grows, so does your app. And in case you happen to have one of those businesses that explodes in popularity, Web Apps has auto-scaling. 

You can also geo-scale with Azure Traffic Manager. You can integrate with Azure CDN to make sure your content is closest to your customers. 
 
Web Apps can also help scale your on-premises resources by connecting them to an Azure Virtual Network with a VPN gateway to your on-premises network.

## Shape your application ## 

Depending on your need, whether it is a website or generic compute process, Web Apps can make building your application easier and faster. App Service Web Apps brings true enterprise grade services to your fingertips.
