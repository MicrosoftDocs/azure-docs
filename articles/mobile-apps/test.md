# Perform Automated Testing on 1000s of mobile devices simultaneously

It has become much simpler to develop mobile apps but the same is not quite true when it comes to testing these apps. Testing can be challenging and increasingly complex due to a variety of reasons such as device fragmentation, application complexity, fast release cycles, short sessions, and high user expectations. You need to continuously make sure that you are delivering applications that are thoroughly tested to provide great customer experience. But testing is not an easy task and it's not a good use of developer time to manually test with each release. On top of that, Android’s Fragmentation problem causes mobile developers its own issues.

These challenges can be efficiently tackled by testing mobile applications across a wide range of devices, which can be achieved by **automated testing**. You can leverage cloud service to speed up release of mobile apps and overcome testing challenges that add bottlenecks to the development and deployment of apps.

## Why should you run Automated Tests on multiple devices before releasing your application?
- **Increase your test coverage** by targeting different form factors, connectivity types, and OS versions.
- **Save time, money, and resources** by testing on different device and OS coverage.
- **Improve Accuracy** as you don't have to perform repetitive manual tests and have more time to create new automated software tests and deal with complex features.
- **Test continuously**, analyze **app performance**, **find, and fix issues** before your users run into them, and **release fast**.
- **Deliver high-quality applications** by ensuring that your customers on wide range of devices get the best experience.

## Azure Services

1. ### **Visual Studio App Center**

   [App Center Test](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/test-cloud/) is a cloud-based service that lets you run automated UI tests on thousands of real-world devices in the cloud across Android and iOS for native and hybrid mobile apps. With over 2000 devices, you can easily write test scripts that can be executed automatically to make testing easy.
   
   **Key Features**
   - **Run tests on real devices** that are not rooted or jailbroken, providing the best approximation of your users' environment.
   - **Screenshots** are automatically captured and attached to each test step and can be viewed side by side for all targeted devices in a test run.
    - **View the device log** for all target devices in a test run and stack traces for failed test steps.
    - **Concurrent test runs** on multiple devices simultaneously to speed up time to results. 
    - **Popular test framework support** like Appium (Java with JUnit) for Android and iOS, Espresso (Java) for Android, Calabash for Android and iOS, Xamarin.UITest for Android and iOS, and XCUITest for iOS.
    - **Platform Support** - iOS, Android Xamarin, React Native.
