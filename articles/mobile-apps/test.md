# Perform automated testing on thousands of mobile devices simultaneously
Testing can be challenging and increasingly complex because of device fragmentation, application complexity, fast release cycles, short sessions, and high user expectations. You need to regularly make sure that you deliver thoroughly tested applications that provide a great customer experience. Testing isn't an easy task, and it's not a good use of developer time to manually test each release.

Testing challenges can be tackled efficiently. You can test mobile applications across a wide range of devices by using automated testing. You can use cloud services to speed up the release of mobile apps and overcome testing challenges that add bottlenecks to the development and deployment of applications.

## Importance of automated testing
- Increase your test coverage by targeting different form factors, connectivity types, and OS versions.
- Save time, money, and resources by testing on different devices and OS coverage.
- Improve accuracy by avoiding repetitive manual tests and have more time to create new automated software tests and deal with complex features.
- Test continuously, analyze application performance, and find and fix issues before your users run into them and release fast.
- Deliver high-quality applications by ensuring that your customers on a wide range of devices get the best experience.

## Visual Studio App Center
[App Center Test](/appcenter/test-cloud/) is a cloud-based service that you can use to run automated UI tests on thousands of real-world devices in the cloud across Android and iOS for native and hybrid mobile apps. With over 2,000 devices, you can write test scripts that can be executed automatically to make testing easy.

**Key features**
   - Tests that run on real devices that aren't rooted or jailbroken to provide the best approximation of your users' environments.
   - Screenshots are automatically captured and attached to each test step. They can be viewed side by side for all targeted devices in a test run.
   - Device logs for all target devices in a test run and stack traces for failed test steps.
   - Concurrent test runs on multiple devices simultaneously to speed up time to results.
   - Popular test framework support like Appium (Java with JUnit) for Android and iOS, Espresso (Java) for Android, Calabash for Android and iOS, Xamarin.UITest for Android and iOS, and XCUITest for iOS.
