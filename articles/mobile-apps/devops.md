# What is DevOps?
DevOps (a combination of "Development" and "Operations") is a term that emphasizes the importance of communication and collaboration between software developers and production IT professionals while automating the deployment of software and infrastructure changes. It is focused on the adoption of agile and lean methodologies and automating repetitive tasks, with a singular goal of timely, successful application releases.

Microsoft has a comprehensive set of [DevOps solutions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/devops/) through [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) (cloud), [Azure DevOps
Server](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/server/) (on-premises), and [Visual Studio App Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-center/). These products create a working environment in which building, testing, and deploying software can occur rapidly, frequently, and reliably. In turn, this allows for an organization to achieve its goals quicker, allowing for a faster turnaround time in the deployment of new features, security patches, and bug fixes.

## Importance of DevOps
- Makes the entire software lifecycle faster, from code commit to production deployment
- Allows organizations to more rapidly deliver software and security updates internally and to customers
- Aims to reduce conflicts that arise when developers are focused on meeting business demands to add functionality and improve the usability of applications whereas operations teams are traditionally more focused on the stability and security of the computing environments
- Provides greater agility, improves customer responsiveness, and reduces time to market
- Extends agility by bringing together people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to end users
- DevOps practices led to reduced costs and all organizations are better able to achieve their goals, no matter what their mission is
