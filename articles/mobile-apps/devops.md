# What is DevOps?
The word "DevOps" comes from a combination of "Development" and "Operations." DevOps emphasizes the importance of communication and collaboration between software developers and production IT professionals while automating the deployment of software and infrastructure changes. DevOps focuses on the adoption of agile and lean methodologies and automating repetitive tasks. The goal of DevOps is timely, successful application releases.

Microsoft has a comprehensive set of [DevOps solutions](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/devops/) through [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/) (cloud) and [Visual Studio App Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-center/). These products create a working environment in which team members can build, test, and deploy software rapidly, frequently, and reliably. Organizations can achieve their goals quicker because of faster turnaround time in the deployment of new features, security patches, and bug fixes.

**Importance of DevOps**
- Makes the entire software lifecycle faster, from code commit to production deployment.
- Allows organizations to more rapidly deliver software and security updates internally and to customers.
- Aims to reduce conflicts that arise between development and operations teams. Developers typically focus on meeting business demands to add functionality and improve the usability of applications. Operations teams are traditionally more focused on the stability and security of the computing environments.
- Provides greater agility, improves customer responsiveness, and reduces time to market.
- Extends agility by bringing together people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to users.
- Leads to reduced costs when organizations follow DevOps practices. Organizations are better able to achieve their goals no matter what their mission is.
