# Azure Maps

[Azure Maps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-maps/) provides location platform natively in Azure cloud, offers a portfolio of geospatial services that use fresh mapping data to provide accurate geographic context to web and mobile applications. It enables developers, enterprises, and ISVs to create location-aware apps and IoT, mobility, logistics, and asset tracking solutions.

## Azure Maps Features
- **Search** provides details about nearby points of interest (POI), render locations on a map, and geocode (or reverse geocode) addresses to get corresponding latitude/longitude coordinates.
- Improve travel time and avoid gridlock using **Traffic**
- Integrate clear, easy-to-read **Maps** into your solution
- **Routing** to present the shortest or fastest routes available—to multiple destinations at a time—or provide specialized routes and facts for walkers, bicyclists, and commercial vehicles
- **Time zones** makes it easy for users to see what time it is anywhere in the world
- **Spatial operations** to enhance your location intelligence 
- **Geolocation** to look up the country of an IP address
- **Data service** to upload and store geospatial data for use with spatial operations or image composition
- **Mobility** provides real-time location intelligence on nearby public transit services, including stops, route information, and travel time estimations
