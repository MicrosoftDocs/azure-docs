# Geospatial APIs to add maps, spatial analytics, and mobility solutions with Azure Maps

[Azure Maps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-maps/) provides a location platform natively in the cloud and offers a portfolio of geospatial services that use fresh mapping data to provide accurate geographic context to web and mobile applications. Developers, enterprises, and ISVs can use Azure Maps to create location-aware applications and IoT, mobility, logistics, and asset-tracking solutions.

## Azure Maps features
- **Search**: Provides details about nearby points of interest, renders locations on a map, and uses geocode (or reverse geocode) addresses to get corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates.
- **Traffic**: Improves your travel time and helps you to avoid gridlock.
- **Maps**: Provides clear, easy-to-read maps to integrate into your solution.
- **Routing**: Presents the shortest or fastest routes available to multiple destinations at a specific time. Routing also provides specialized routes and facts for walkers, bicyclists, and commercial vehicles.
- **Time zones**: Makes it easy to see what time it is anywhere in the world.
- **Spatial operations**: Enhance your location intelligence.
- **Geolocation**: Finds the country of an IP address.
- **Data service**: Uploads and stores geospatial data for use with spatial operations or image composition.
- **Mobility**: Provides real-time location intelligence on nearby public transit services. Stops, route information, and travel time estimations are included.
