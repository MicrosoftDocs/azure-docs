# Build real-time applications with Azure SignalR Service

With [Azure SignalR Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/signalr-service/), you can easily add real-time functionality to applications. This real-time functionality allows the service to push content updates to connected mobile applications. As a result, apps are updated without the need to poll the server or submit new HTTP requests for updates.

## Azure SignalR Service features
- Has broad client support for a wide range of clients, such as web and mobile browsers, desktop applications, server process, IoT devices, and game consoles.
- Allows multiple instances to work together to scale to millions of mobile application connections. It also supports multiple global regions for sharding, high availability, or disaster recovery purposes.
- Offers rich APIs for different messaging patterns to send messages to a particular connection, all connections, or a subset of connections that belong to a specific user or were placed in an arbitrary group.
