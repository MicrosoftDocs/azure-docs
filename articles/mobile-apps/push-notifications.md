# Engage with your application users by sending Push Notifications 

Whether you are building consumer or enterprise applications, you want users to use your app actively. There are often times when you want to share breaking news, game updates, exciting offers, product update, or any relavant information with your users. In order to increase engagement with your users and keep getting them back to your app, you need a way for you to communicate with your users in real time.

Push notifications provide a fast and efficient way to communicate with your app users. You can reach out to your users at the right time and can notify them of desired information, usually in a pop-up or dialog box on a mobile device, regardless of what they are doing.

## Importance of push notifications in your mobile apps
Push notifications provides value to both end users and the business.

Businesses can:
- **Communicate directly with their users** by sending them messages on supported platform at the right time
- **Boost user engagement** by sending real-time updates anr reminders to your users, encouraging them to engage with your app on a regular basis
- **Retain users** and re-engage with inactive users that have downloaded the app but don't use it to become active again
- **Increase conversion rates** by analyzing end-user behavior, segmenting end users, and leveraging campaigns based on mobile push notifications
- **Promote Products and Services** by sending push messages and timely updates to the users
- **Target the users** by sending them personalized push messages

For application users, push notification:
- **Provides value and information** in real time.
- **Reminds users** to use the application.
