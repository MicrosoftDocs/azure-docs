# Monitor crashes and errors in real time for your mobile application
Once your application is in the wild and in use by thousands of users, it is likely to have bugs, and your users will run into unexpected app crashes. From the user perspective, all they want is a working and reliable app. Applications that are buggy and crash don't provide a good user experience. Disappointed users will uninstall the app, leave a bad review, or publicly criticize and complain about their experience.

Therefore, understanding real-world crash behavior is essential for mobile applications. Your job as a developer is not complete as soon as you release your application testers or to the App Store. It is just as important to continuously monitor and measure the performance in order to ensure app stability and maintain user satisfaction. What you really need is a way to monitor your application and understand what went wrong so you can spend your time prioritizing and fixing issues that are critical for your business needs.
