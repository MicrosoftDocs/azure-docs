# Quickstart: Deploy a private mobile network and site - ARM template

Azure Private 5G Core is an Azure cloud service for deploying and managing 5G core network functions on an Azure Stack Edge device, as part of an on-premises private mobile network for enterprises. This quickstart describes how to use an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) to deploy the following.

- A private mobile network.
- A site.
- The default service and allow-all SIM policy (as described in [Default service and allow-all SIM policy](default-service-sim-policy.md)).
- Optionally, one or more SIMs, and a SIM group.

[!INCLUDE [About Azure Resource Manager](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/resource-manager-quickstart-introduction.md)]

If your environment meets the prerequisites and you're familiar with using ARM templates, select the **Deploy to Azure** button. The template will open in the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

- [Complete the prerequisite tasks for deploying a private mobile network](complete-private-mobile-network-prerequisites.md) and [Commission the AKS cluster](commission-cluster.md).
- Ensure you can sign in to the Azure portal using an account with access to the active subscription you identified in [Complete the prerequisite tasks for deploying a private mobile network](complete-private-mobile-network-prerequisites.md). This account must have the built-in Contributor or Owner role at the subscription scope.
- [Collect the required information to deploy a private mobile network](collect-required-information-for-private-mobile-network.md). If you want to provision SIMs, you'll need to prepare a JSON file containing your SIM information, as described in [JSON file format for provisioning SIMs](collect-required-information-for-private-mobile-network.md#json-file-format-for-provisioning-sims).
- Identify the names of the interfaces corresponding to ports 5 and 6 on the Azure Stack Edge Pro device in the site.
- [Collect the required information for a site](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md).
- Refer to the release notes for the current version of packet core, and whether it's supported by the version your Azure Stack Edge (ASE) is currently running. If your ASE version is incompatible with the latest packet core, [update your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU](../databox-online/azure-stack-edge-gpu-install-update.md).

3. Select **Review + create**.
4. Azure will now validate the configuration values you've entered. You should see a message indicating that your values have passed validation.

     If the validation fails, you'll see an error message and the **Configuration** tab(s) containing the invalid configuration will be flagged. Select the flagged tab(s) and use the error messages to correct invalid configuration before returning to the **Review + create** tab.

5. Once your configuration has been validated, you can select **Create** to deploy the resources. The Azure portal will display a confirmation screen when the deployment is complete.

## Review deployed resources

1. On the confirmation screen, select **Go to resource group**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/template-deployment-confirmation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing a deployment confirmation for the ARM template.":::

1. Confirm that the following resources have been created in the resource group.

    - A **Mobile Network** resource representing the private mobile network as a whole.
    - A **Slice** resource representing a network slice.
    - A **Data Network** resource representing a data network.
    - A **Mobile Network Site** resource representing the site as a whole.
    - A **Packet Core Control Plane** resource representing the control plane function of the packet core instance in the site.
    - A **Packet Core Data Plane** resource representing the data plane function of the packet core instance in the site.
    - An **Attached Data Network** resource representing the site's view of the data network.
    - A **Service** resource representing the default service.
    - A **SIM Policy** resource representing the allow-all SIM policy.
    - A **SIM Group** resource (if you provisioned any SIMs).

## Clean up resources

If you do not want to keep your deployment, [delete the resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/delete-resource-group.md?tabs=azure-portal#delete-resource-group).

## Next steps

If you have kept your deployment, you can either begin designing policy control to determine how your private mobile network will handle traffic, or you can add more sites to your private mobile network.
