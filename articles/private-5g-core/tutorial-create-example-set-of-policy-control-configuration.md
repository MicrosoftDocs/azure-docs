# Tutorial: Create an example policy control configuration set for Azure Private 5G Core

Azure Private 5G Core provides flexible traffic handling. You can customize how your packet core instance applies quality of service (QoS) characteristics to traffic to meet its needs. You can also block or limit certain flows. This tutorial takes you through the steps of creating services and SIM policies for common use cases, and then provisioning SIMs to use the new policy control configuration.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Create a new service that filters packets based on their protocol.
> * Create a new service that blocks traffic labeled with specific remote IP addresses and ports.
> * Create a new service that limits the bandwidth of traffic on matching flows.
> * Create two new SIM policies and assign services to them.
> * Provision two new SIMs and assign them SIM policies.

## Prerequisites

* Read the information in [Policy control](policy-control.md) and familiarize yourself with Azure Private 5G Core policy control configuration.
* Ensure you can sign in to the Azure portal using an account with access to the active subscription you identified in [Complete the prerequisite tasks for deploying a private mobile network](complete-private-mobile-network-prerequisites.md). This account must have the built-in Contributor role at the subscription scope.
* Identify the name of the Mobile Network resource corresponding to your private mobile network.
* Identify the name of the Slice resource corresponding to your network slice.
  * If you want to assign a policy to a 5G SIM, you can choose any slice.
  * If you want to assign a policy to a 4G SIM, you must choose the slice configured with slice/service type (SST) value of 1 and an empty slice differentiator (SD).

## Create a service for protocol filtering

In this step, we'll create a service that filters packets based on their protocol. Specifically, it'll do the following:

* Block ICMP packets flowing away from UEs.
* Block UDP packets flowing away from UEs on port 11.
* Allow all other ICMP and UDP traffic in both directions, but no other IP traffic.

To create the service:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Search for and select the Mobile Network resource representing your private mobile network.

    :::image type="content" source="media/mobile-network-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the results for a search for a Mobile Network resource.":::

1. In the **Resource** menu, select **Services**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-service-azure-portal/services-resource-menu-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Services option in the resource menu of a Mobile Network resource.":::

1. In the **Command** bar, select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-service-azure-portal/create-command-bar-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Create option in the command bar.":::

1. We'll now enter values to define the QoS characteristics that will be applied to service data flows (SDFs) that match this service. On the **Basics** tab, fill out the fields as follows.

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Service name**     |`service_restricted_udp_and_icmp`         |
    |**Service precedence**     | `100`        |
    |**Maximum bit rate (MBR) - Uplink**     | `2 Gbps`        |
    |**Maximum bit rate (MBR) - Downlink**     | `2 Gbps`        |
    |**Allocation and Retention Priority level**     | `2`        |
    |**5QI/QCI**     | `9`        |
    |**Preemption capability**     | Select **May not preempt**.        |
    |**Preemption vulnerability**     | Select **Not preemptible**.        |

1. Under **Data flow policy rules**, select **Add a policy rule**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-create-example-set-of-policy-control-configuration/example-protocol-filtering-service-without-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Create a service screen with protocol filtering configuration. The Add a policy rule button is highlighted.":::

1. We'll now create a data flow policy rule that blocks any packets that match the data flow template we'll configure in the next step. Under **Add a policy rule** on the right, fill out the fields as follows.

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Rule name**     |`rule_block_icmp_and_udp_uplink_traffic`         |
    |**Policy rule precedence**     | Select **10**.        |
    |**Allow traffic**     | Select **Blocked**.        |

1. We'll now create a data flow template that matches on ICMP packets flowing away from UEs, so that they can be blocked by the `rule_block_icmp_uplink_traffic` rule.
    Under **Data flow templates**, select **Add a data flow template**. In the **Add a data flow template** pop-up, fill out the fields as follows.

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Template name**     |`icmp_uplink_traffic`         |
    |**Protocols**     | Select **ICMP**.        |
    |**Direction**     | Select **Uplink**.        |
    |**Remote IPs**     | `any`        |
    |**Ports**     | Leave blank.        |

1. Select **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-create-example-set-of-policy-control-configuration/add-a-data-flow-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. The Add a data flow template pop-up is shown and the Add button is highlighted.":::

1. Let's create another data flow template for the same rule that matches on UDP packets flowing away from UEs on port 11. 

    Under **Data flow templates**, select **Add a data flow template**. In the **Add a data flow template** pop-up, fill out the fields as follows.

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Template name**     |`udp_uplink_traffic_port_11`         |
    |**Protocols**     | Select **UDP**.        |
    |**Direction**     | Select **Uplink**.        |
    |**Remote IPs**     | `any`        |
    |**Ports**     | `11`        |

1. Select **Add**.
1. We can now finalize the rule. Under **Add a policy rule**, select **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-create-example-set-of-policy-control-configuration/protocol-filtering-rule-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. The Add a policy rule screen is shown with protocol filtering configuration and the Add button is highlighted.":::

1. Finally, we'll create a data policy flow rule that allows all other ICMP and UDP traffic.

    Select **Add a policy rule** and then fill out the fields under **Add a policy rule** on the right as follows.

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Rule name**     |`rule_allow_other_icmp_and_udp_traffic`         |
    |**Policy rule precedence**     | Select **15**.        |
    |**Allow traffic**     | Select **Enabled**.        |

1. We're now back at the **Create a service** screen. We'll create a data flow template that matches on all ICMP and UDP in both directions.

    Under **Data flow policy rules**, select **Add a data flow template**. In the **Add a data flow template** pop-up, fill out the fields as follows.

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Template name**     |`icmp_and_udp_traffic`         |
    |**Protocols**     | Select both the **UDP** and **ICMP** checkboxes.        |
    |**Direction**     | Select **Bidirectional**.        |
    |**Remote IPs**     | `any`        |
    |**Ports**     | Leave blank.        |

1. Select **Add**.
1. We can now finalize the rule. Under **Add a policy rule**, select **Add**.
1. We now have two configured data flow policy rules on the service, which are displayed under the **Data flow policy rules** heading. 

    Note that the `rule_block_icmp_and_udp_uplink_traffic` rule has a lower value for the **Policy rule** precedence field than the `rule_allow_other_icmp_and_udp_traffic` rule (10 and 15 respectively). Rules with lower values are given higher priority. This ensures that the `rule_block_icmp_and_udp_uplink_traffic` rule to block packets is applied first, before the wider `rule_allow_other_icmp_and_udp_traffic` is applied to all remaining packets.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-create-example-set-of-policy-control-configuration/example-protocol-filtering-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. It shows the Create a service screen with all fields correctly filled out and two data flow policy rules.":::

1. On the **Basics** configuration tab, select **Review + create**.
1. Select **Create** to create the service.

It shows a Service resource, with configured QoS characteristics and data flow policy rules highlighted." lightbox="media/tutorial-create-example-set-of-policy-control-configuration/example-protocol-filtering-service-complete.png":::

## Create a service for blocking traffic from specific sources

In this step, we'll create a service that blocks traffic from specific sources. Specifically, it'll do the following:

* Block UDP packets labeled with the remote address 10.204.141.200 and port 12 flowing towards UEs.
* Block UDP packets labeled with any remote address in the range 10.204.141.0/24 and port 15 flowing in both directions

To create the service:

1. Search for and select the Mobile Network resource representing your private mobile network.
1. In the **Resource** menu, select **Services**.
1. In the **Command** bar, select **Create**.
1. We'll now enter values to define the QoS characteristics that will be applied to SDFs that match this service. On the **Basics** tab, fill out the fields as follows.

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Service name**     |`service_blocking_udp_from_specific_sources`         |
    |**Service precedence**     | `150`        |
    |**Maximum bit rate (MBR) - Uplink**     | `2 Gbps`        |
    |**Maximum bit rate (MBR) - Downlink**     | `2 Gbps`        |
    |**Allocation and Retention Priority level**     | `2`        |
    |**5QI/QCI**     | `9`        |
    |**Preemption capability**     | Select **May not preempt**.        |
    |**Preemption vulnerability**     | Select **Not preemptible**.        |

1. Under **Data flow policy rules**, select **Add a policy rule**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-create-example-set-of-policy-control-configuration/example-traffic-blocking-service-without-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Create a service screen with traffic blocking configuration. The Add a policy rule button is highlighted.":::

1. We'll now create a data flow policy rule that blocks any packets that match the data flow template we'll configure in the next step. Under **Add a policy rule** on the right, fill out the fields as follows.

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Rule name**     |`rule_block_udp_from_specific_sources`         |
    |**Policy rule precedence**     | Select **11**.        |
    |**Allow traffic**     | Select **Blocked**.        |

1. Next, we'll create a data flow template that matches on UDP packets flowing towards UEs from 10.204.141.200 on port 12, so that they can be blocked by the `rule_block_udp_from_specific_sources` rule.

    Under **Data flow templates**, select **Add a data flow template**. In the **Add a data flow template** pop-up, fill out the fields as follows.

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Template name**     |`udp_downlink_traffic`         |
    |**Protocols**     | Select **UDP**.        |
    |**Direction**     | Select **Downlink**.        |
    |**Remote IPs**     | `10.204.141.200/32`        |
    |**Ports**     | `12`        |

1. Select **Add**.
1. Finally, we'll create another data flow template for the same rule that matches on UDP packets flowing in either direction that are labeled with any remote address in the range 10.204.141.0/24 and port 15.

    Under **Data flow templates**, select **Add a data flow template**. In the **Add a data flow template** pop-up, fill out the fields as follows.

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Template name**     |`udp_bidirectional_traffic`         |
    |**Protocols**     | Select **UDP**.        |
    |**Direction**     | Select **Bidirectional**.        |
    |**Remote IPs**     | `10.204.141.0/24`        |
    |**Ports**     | `15`        |

1. Select **Add**.
1. We can now finalize the rule. Under **Add a policy rule**, select **Add**.


    :::image type="complex" source="media/tutorial-create-example-set-of-policy-control-configuration/example-udp-blocking-rule.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. It shows the Add a policy rule screen with configuration for a rule to block certain UDP traffic.":::

The second matches on UDP packets flowing in either direction that are labeled with any remote address in the range 10.204.141.0/24 and port 15. The Add button is highlighted.
    :::image-end:::

1. We now have a single data flow policy rule on the service for blocking UDP traffic. This is displayed under the **Data flow policy rules** heading.

## Create a service for limiting traffic

In this step, we'll create a service that limits the bandwidth of traffic on matching flows. Specifically, it'll do the following:

* Limit the maximum bit rate (MBR) for packets flowing away from UEs to 10 Mbps.
* Limit the maximum bit rate (MBR) for packets flowing towards UEs to 15 Mbps.

To create the service:

1. Search for and select the Mobile Network resource representing your private mobile network.
1. In the **Resource** menu, select **Services**.
1. In the **Command** bar, select **Create**.
1. We'll now enter values to define the QoS characteristics that will be applied to SDFs that match this service. We'll use the **Maximum bit rate (MBR) - Uplink** and **Maximum bit rate (MBR) - Downlink** fields to set our bandwidth limits. On the **Basics** tab, fill out the fields as follows.

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Service name**     |`service_traffic_limits`         |
    |**Service precedence**     | `250`        |
    |**Maximum bit rate (MBR) - Uplink**     | `10 Mbps`        |
    |**Maximum bit rate (MBR) - Downlink**     | `15 Mbps`        |
    |**Allocation and Retention Priority level**     | `2`        |
    |**5QI/QCI**     | `9`        |
    |**Preemption capability**     | Select **May not preempt**.        |
    |**Preemption vulnerability**     | Select **Preemptible**.        |

1. Under **Data flow policy rules**, select **Add a policy rule**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-create-example-set-of-policy-control-configuration/example-traffic-limiting-service-without-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Create a service screen with traffic limiting configuration.

1. Under **Add a policy rule** on the right, fill out the fields as follows.

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Rule name**     |`rule_bidirectional_limits`         |
    |**Policy rule precedence**     | Select **22**.        |
    |**Allow traffic**     | Select **Enabled**.        |

1. We'll now create a data flow template that matches on all IP traffic in both directions.

    Select **Add a data flow template**. In the **Add a data flow template** pop-up, fill out the fields as follows.

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Template name**     |`ip_traffic`         |
    |**Protocols**     | Select **All**.        |
    |**Direction**     | Select **Bidirectional**.        |
    |**Remote IPs**     | `any`        |
    |**Ports**     | Leave blank        |

1. Select **Add**.
1. We can now finalize the rule. Under **Add a policy rule**, select **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-create-example-set-of-policy-control-configuration/traffic-limiting-rule-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. The Add a policy rule screen is shown with traffic limiting configuration and the Add button is highlighted.":::

1. The Azure portal will display the following confirmation screen when the service has been created. Select **Go to resource** to see the new service resource.

     :::image type="content" source="media/configure-service-azure-portal/service-resource-deployment-confirmation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the successful deployment of a service resource and the Go to resource button.":::

1. Confirm that the data flow policy rules and service data flow templates listed at the bottom of the screen are configured as expected.

QoS characteristics and data flow policy rules are highlighted." lightbox="media/tutorial-create-example-set-of-policy-control-configuration/example-traffic-limiting-service-complete.png":::

## Configure SIM policies

In this step, we'll create two SIM policies. The first SIM policy will use the service we created in [Create a service for protocol filtering](#create-a-service-for-protocol-filtering), and the second will use the service we created in [Create a service for blocking traffic from specific sources](#create-a-service-for-blocking-traffic-from-specific-sources). Both SIM policies will use the third service we created in [Create a service for limiting traffic](#create-a-service-for-limiting-traffic).

> [!NOTE]
> As each SIM policy will have multiple services, there will be packets that match more than one rule across these services. For example, downlink ICMP packets will match on the following rules:
> - The `rule_allow_other_icmp_and_udp_traffic` rule on the `service_restricted_udp_and_icmp` service.
> - The `rule_bidirectional_limits` rule on the `service_traffic_limits` service. 
>
> In this case, the packet core instance will prioritize the service with the lowest value for the **Service precedence** field. It will then apply the QoS characteristics from this service to the packets. In the example above, the `service_restricted_udp_and_icmp` service has a lower value (100) than the `service_traffic_limits` service (250). The packet core instance will therefore apply the QoS characteristics given on the `service_restricted_udp_and_icmp` service to downlink ICMP packets.

Let's create the SIM policies.

## Provision SIMs

In this step, we will provision two SIMs and assign a SIM policy to each one. This will allow the SIMs to connect to the private mobile network and receive the correct QoS policy.

1. Save the following content as a JSON file and make a note of the filepath.
    ```json
    [
     {
      "simName": "SIM1",
      "integratedCircuitCardIdentifier": "8912345678901234566",
      "internationalMobileSubscriberIdentity": "001019990010001",
      "authenticationKey": "00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF",
      "operatorKeyCode": "63bfa50ee6523365ff14c1f45f88737d",
      "deviceType": "Cellphone"
     },
     {
      "simName": "SIM2",
      "integratedCircuitCardIdentifier": "8922345678901234567",
      "internationalMobileSubscriberIdentity": "001019990010002",
      "authenticationKey": "11112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF",
      "operatorKeyCode": "63bfa50ee6523365ff14c1f45f88738d",
