# Region code names

When the **location** parameter is used in a command or request, you need to provide the region code name as the **location** value. To get the code name of the region that your private mobile network is in, run the following command in the Azure CLI.

```cloudshell-bash
az account list-locations -o table
```

The output of this command is a table of the names and locations for all the Azure regions that your subscription supports. Navigate to the Azure region that has the *DisplayName* you are looking for and use its *Name* value for the **location** parameter.

For example, if you're deploying in the East US region, use *eastus* for the **location** parameter.

```json
DisplayName               Name                 RegionalDisplayName
------------------------  -------------------  -------------------------------------
East US                   eastus               (US) East US
West Europe               westeurope           (Europe) West Europe
```
