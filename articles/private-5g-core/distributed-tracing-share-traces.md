# Export and share traces

Azure Private 5G Core offers a distributed tracing web GUI, which you can use to collect detailed traces for signaling flows involving packet core instances. You can export these traces and upload them alongside a support request to help your support representative provide troubleshooting assistance.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you can sign in to the Azure portal using an account with access to the active subscription you identified in [Complete the prerequisite tasks for deploying a private mobile network](complete-private-mobile-network-prerequisites.md). This account must have the built-in Contributor role at the subscription scope.
- Ensure you can sign in to the distributed tracing web GUI as described in [Distributed tracing](distributed-tracing.md).

## Export trace from the distributed tracing web GUI

1. Sign in to the distributed tracing web GUI as described in [Access the distributed tracing web GUI](distributed-tracing.md#access-the-distributed-tracing-web-gui).
1. In the **Search** tab, specify the SUPI and time for the event you're interested in and select **Search**.

1. Find the relevant trace in the **Diagnostics Search Results** tab and select it.

The Export button in the top ribbon is highlighted." lightbox="media\distributed-tracing-share-traces\distributed-tracing-summary-view-export.png":::

Your trace is now ready to share with Azure support. To open a support request and share the trace with Azure support, see [How to open a support request for Azure Private 5G Core](open-support-request.md). To create a diagnostics package, see [Gather diagnostics using the Azure portal](/azure/private-5g-core/gather-diagnostics).
