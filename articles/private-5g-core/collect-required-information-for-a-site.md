# Collect the required information for a site

Azure Private 5G Core private mobile networks include one or more sites. Each site represents a physical enterprise location (for example, Contoso Corporation's Chicago factory) containing an Azure Stack Edge device that hosts a packet core instance. This how-to guide takes you through the process of collecting the information you need to create a new site.

You can use this information to create a site in an existing private mobile network using the [Azure portal](create-a-site.md). You can also use it as part of an ARM template to [deploy a new private mobile network and site](deploy-private-mobile-network-with-site-arm-template.md), or [add a new site to an existing private mobile network](create-site-arm-template.md).

## Prerequisites

- Complete the steps in [Complete the prerequisite tasks for deploying a private mobile network](complete-private-mobile-network-prerequisites.md).
- Make a note of the resource group that contains your private mobile network that was collected in [Collect the required information to deploy a private mobile network](collect-required-information-for-private-mobile-network.md). We recommend that the mobile network site resource you create in this procedure belongs to the same resource group.
- Ensure you have the relevant permissions on your account if you want to give Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to storage accounts.

## Choose a service plan

Choose the service plan that best fits your requirements and verify pricing and charges. See [Azure Private 5G Core pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/private-5g-core/).

You can use a storage account and user assigned managed identity, with write access to the storage account, to gather diagnostics packages for the site.

If you don't want to configure diagnostics package gathering at this stage, you don't need to collect anything. You can configure this after site creation.

If you want to configure diagnostics package gathering during site creation, see [Collect values for diagnostics package gathering](gather-diagnostics.md#set-up-a-storage-account).

## Choose the authentication method for local monitoring tools

Azure Private 5G Core provides dashboards for monitoring your deployment and a web GUI for collecting detailed signal traces. You can access these tools using [Microsoft Entra ID](../active-directory/authentication/overview-authentication.md) or a local username and password. We recommend setting up Microsoft Entra authentication to improve security in your deployment.

If you want to access your local monitoring tools using Microsoft Entra ID, after creating a site follow the steps in [Enable Microsoft Entra ID for local monitoring tools](enable-azure-active-directory.md).

If you want to access your local monitoring tools using local usernames and passwords, you don't need to set any additional configuration. After deploying the site, set up your username and password by following [Access the distributed tracing web GUI](distributed-tracing.md#access-the-distributed-tracing-web-gui) and [Access the packet core dashboards](packet-core-dashboards.md#access-the-packet-core-dashboards).

You'll be able to change the authentication method later by following [Modify the local access configuration in a site](modify-local-access-configuration.md).

> [!NOTE]
> While in [disconnected mode](disconnected-mode.md), you won't be able to change the local monitoring authentication method or sign in using Microsoft Entra ID. If you expect to need access to your local monitoring tools while the ASE is disconnected, consider using the local username and password authentication method instead.

## Collect local monitoring values

You can use a self-signed or a custom certificate to secure access to the [distributed tracing](distributed-tracing.md) and [packet core dashboards](packet-core-dashboards.md) at the edge. We recommend that you provide your own HTTPS certificate signed by a globally known and trusted certificate authority (CA), as this provides additional security to your deployment and allows your browser to recognize the certificate signer.

If you don't want to provide a custom HTTPS certificate at this stage, you don't need to collect anything. You'll be able to change this configuration later by following [Modify the local access configuration in a site](modify-local-access-configuration.md).

If you want to provide a custom HTTPS certificate at site creation:

   1. Either [create an Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal) or choose an existing one to host your certificate. Ensure the key vault is configured with **Azure Virtual Machines for deployment** resource access.
   1. Ensure your certificate is stored in your key vault. You can either [generate a Key Vault certificate](/azure/key-vault/certificates/create-certificate) or [import an existing certificate to your Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/certificates/tutorial-import-certificate?tabs=azure-portal#import-a-certificate-to-your-key-vault). Your certificate must:

      - Be signed by a globally known and trusted CA.
      - Use a private key of type RSA or EC to ensure it's exportable (see [Exportable or non-exportable key](/azure/key-vault/certificates/about-certificates) for more information).

      We also recommend setting a DNS name for your certificate.

   1. If you want to configure your certificate to renew automatically, see [Tutorial: Configure certificate auto-rotation in Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/certificates/tutorial-rotate-certificates) for information on enabling auto-rotation.

      > [!NOTE]
      >
      > - Certificate validation is always performed against the latest version of the local access certificate in the Key Vault.
      > - If you enable auto-rotation, it might take up to four hours for certificate updates in the Key Vault to synchronize with the edge location.

   1. Decide how you want to provide access to your certificate. You can use a Key Vault access policy or Azure role-based access control (RBAC).

      - [Assign a Key Vault access policy](/azure/key-vault/general/assign-access-policy?tabs=azure-portal). Provide **Get** and **List** permissions under **Secret permissions** and **Certificate permissions** to the **Azure Private MEC** service principal.
      - [Provide access to Key Vault keys, certificates, and secrets with an Azure role-based access control (RBAC)](/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide?tabs=azure-cli). Provide **Key Vault Reader** and **Key Vault Secrets User** permissions to the **Azure Private MEC** service principal.
      - If you want to, assign the Key Vault access policy or Azure RBAC to a [user-assigned identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).

          - If you have an existing user-assigned identity configured for diagnostic collection you can modify it.
          - Otherwise, you can create a new user-assigned identity.

   1. Collect the values in the following table.

       |Value  |Field name in Azure portal  |
       |---------|---------|
       |The name of the Azure Key Vault containing the custom HTTPS certificate.|**Key vault**|
       |The name of the CA-signed custom HTTPS certificate within the Azure Key Vault. |**Certificate**|

## Next steps

Use the information you've collected to create the site:

- [Create a site - Azure portal](create-a-site.md)
- [Create a site - ARM template](create-site-arm-template.md)
