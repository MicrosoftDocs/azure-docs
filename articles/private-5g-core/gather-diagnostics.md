# Gather diagnostics using the Azure portal

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Diagnostics packages may contain information from your site which may, depending on use, include data such as personal data, customer data, and system-generated logs. When providing the diagnostics package to Azure support, you are explicitly giving Azure support permission to access the diagnostics package and any information that it contains. You should confirm that this is acceptable under your company's privacy policies and agreements.

In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to gather a remote diagnostics package for an Azure Private 5G Core (AP5GC) site using the Azure portal. The diagnostics package can then be provided to Azure support to assist you with issues.

You should always collect diagnostics as soon as possible after encountering an issue and submit them with your support request. See [How to open a support request for Azure Private 5G Core](open-support-request.md).

## Prerequisites

You must already have an AP5GC site deployed to collect diagnostics.

## Set up a storage account

[!INCLUDE [](includes/include-diagnostics-storage-account-setup.md)]

## Gather diagnostics for a site

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Navigate to the **Packet Core Control Pane** overview page of the site you want to gather diagnostics for.
1. Select **Diagnostics Collection** under the **Help** section on the left side. This will open a **Diagnostics Collection** view.
1. Enter the **Storage account blob URL** that was configured for diagnostics storage and append the file name that you want to give the diagnostics. For example:
    `https://storageaccountname.blob.core.windows.net/diagscontainername/diagsPackageName.zip`
    > [!TIP]
    > The **Storage account blob URL** should have been noted during creation. If it wasn't:
    >
    >    1. Navigate to your **Storage account**.
    >    1. Select the **...** symbol on the right side of the container blob that you want to use for diagnostics collection.
    >    1. Select **Container properties** in the context menu.
    >    1. Copy the contents of the **URL** field in the **Container properties** view.

1. Select **Diagnostics collection**.
1. The AP5GC online service will generate a package at the provided storage account URL. Once the portal reports that this has succeeded, you'll be able to download the diagnostics package ready to share with Azure support.
    1. To download the diagnostics package, navigate to the storage account URL, right-click the file and select **Download**.
    1. To open a support request and share the diagnostics package with Azure support, see [How to open a support request for Azure Private 5G Core](open-support-request.md).

## Troubleshooting

- If diagnostics file collection fails, an activity log will appear in the portal allowing you to troubleshoot via ARM:
  - If an invalid container URL was passed, the request will be rejected and report **400 Bad Request**. Repeat the process with the correct container URL.
  - If the asynchronous part of the operation fails, the asynchronous operation resource is set to **Failed** and reports a failure reason.
- Check that the same user-assigned identity was added to both the site and storage account.
- Check whether the storage container has an immutability policy configured. If so, either remove the policy or ensure that the storage account has version-level immutability support enabled, as described in [Set up a storage account](#set-up-a-storage-account). This is required because the diagnostics file is streamed to the storage account container, so the container must support blob updates. For more information, see [Time-based retention policies for immutable blob data](../storage/blobs/immutable-time-based-retention-policy-overview.md).
- If this does not resolve the issue, share the correlation ID of the failed request with AP5GC support for investigation. See [How to open a support request for Azure Private 5G Core](open-support-request.md).
