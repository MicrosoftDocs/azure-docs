#Azure Mobile Engagement overview

Azure Mobile Engagement is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) user-engagement platform that provides data-driven insights into app usage, real-time user segmentation, and enables contextually-aware push notifications and in-app messaging.

With Azure Mobile Engagement, application publishers and marketing professionals can better understand and interact with the app users.

##Real-time actionable analytics to maximize return on investment

Trigger engagement scenarios according to user behavior and demographics by combining `big data` collection with real-time message processing. Mobile Engagement can answer nearly any question relevant to your particular business needs. For example, you can create custom dashboards to measure key performance indicators (KPIs), rapidly find and fix usage bottlenecks in a user funnel path, track retention and user stickiness, and by that determine what campaigns are driving the highest return on investment. Mobile Engagement’s 360° user path view allows you to easily and continually enhance and optimize the user experience – driving higher retention rates and improve app usage.

##Value-added push and communications platform

Mobile Engagement provides in-app messaging capabilities and works seamlessly with native push notifications gateways such as Google’s GCM, Apple’s APNS and Microsoft MPNS. And it goes beyond to give you the power to create targeted campaigns by analyzing user behaviors to identify unique customer segments.

This benefits app developers by reaching their customers in a highly effective and non-intrusive manner.

##Open APIs and ease of integration

By providing open APIs and SDKs that ease integration, you can leverage data from your existing CRM, CMS or other backend systems. This allows you to further improve your audience targeting and protect your investments.

##Data protection & privacy across the globe

Microsoft has a longstanding commitment to privacy, which is an integral part of our product and services lifecycle. We work to be transparent in our privacy practices, offering customers meaningful privacy choices, and responsibly manage the data we store. As with all Azure services, Mobile Engagement does not share or sell information derived from customers’ property. Mobile Engagement is available globally, allowing for regional or country specific data privacy laws to be upheld.
