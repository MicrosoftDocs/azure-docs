# Mobile Engagement Export API Overview

## Introduction

In this document, you will learn the basics about exporting your raw data generated by your user's devices to leverage it in your own tools.

## Pre-requisites

Exporting the raw data from Mobile Engagement requires:

- API authentication setup to be able to use the APIs (see [authentication manual setup](mobile-engagement-api-authentication-manual.md)),
- Use either the REST APIs or the [.net SDK](mobile-engagement-dotnet-sdk-service-api.md),
- An Azure Storage account.

>[AZURE.NOTE] We also advise the excellent [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/), at least during the development phase as it provides an easy to use UI for interacting with Azure Storage.

## What can be exported?

Mobile Engagement allows its users to collect many types of data and therefore has several types of export suited to these different data types.
There are 2 essential types of export:

- Snapshot: used typically to export data that represents a state and for which Mobile Engagement does not have a history. This includes Tags (app-info), tokens or push campaign feedbacks for example. As a consequence these types of export are not related to a date.
- historical: this export type is used for data that accumulates over time such as Events or Activities for example.

The table below describes exhaustively all the possible exports:

| Export Type | Data Type | Description                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Snapshot    | Push      | Generates an export of Push Campaigns feedbacks on a per deviceid/userid basis                                                              |
| Snapshot    | Tag       | Generates an export of the tags (app-info) associated to each devices                                                                       |
| Snapshot    | Device    | Generates an export of most of the data about devices such as the technicals (model, locale, timezone, ...), the tags, first seen time, ... |
| Snapshot    | Token     | Generates an export of all the valid tokens                                                                                                 |
| Historical  | Activity  | Generates an export of all the activities for each devices on a given time period                                                           |
| Historical  | Event     | Generates an export of all the activities for each devices on a given time period                                                           |
| Historical  | Job       | Generates an export of all the jobs for each devices on a given time period                                                                 |
| Historical  | Error     | Generates an export of all the errors for each devices on a given time period                                                               |

## How does it work?

Exports are long running tasks that may produce large data files. For that reason, they cannot be invoked to return immediately a file to download.
In order to export data from Mobile Engagement, you will have to create an **Export Job** via API where you specify generally:

- The type of export (snapshot or historical),
- The data type,
- The **Azure Storage Container** (including a valid SAS with write access) where the result of the export will be written.

Please note that it may take a few minutes for your job to be started, and then it may run from a few seconds for tiny apps to several hours for apps with a lot of users or activity.

Once the job is created, it is possible to check its status to see if it is still running or if it has completed.

Once the job is SUCCEEDED, the resulting data file is available on the provided storage container.
