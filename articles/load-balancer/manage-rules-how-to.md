# Manage rules for Azure Load Balancer using the Azure portal

Azure Load Balancer supports rules to configure traffic to the backend pool.  In this article, you learn how to manage the rules for an Azure Load Balancer.

There are four types of rules:

- **Load-balancing rules** - A load balancer rule is used to define how incoming traffic is distributed to **all** the instances within the backend pool. A load-balancing rule maps a given frontend IP configuration and port to multiple backend IP addresses and ports. An example would be a rule created on port 80 to load balance web traffic.

- **High availability ports** - A load balancer rule configured with **protocol - all** and **port - 0**. These rules enable a single rule to load-balance all TCP and UDP traffic that arrive on all ports of an internal standard load balancer. The HA ports load-balancing rules help with scenarios, such as high availability and scale for network virtual appliances (NVAs) inside virtual networks. The feature can help when a large number of ports must be load-balanced.

- **Inbound NAT rule** - An inbound NAT rule forwards incoming traffic sent to frontend IP address and port combination. The traffic is sent to a **specific** virtual machine or instance in the backend pool. Port forwarding is done by the same hash-based distribution as load balancing.

- **Outbound rule** - An outbound rule configures outbound Network Address Translation (NAT) for **all** virtual machines or instances identified by the backend pool. This rule enables instances in the backend to communicate (outbound) to the internet or other endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- A standard public load balancer in your subscription. For more information on creating an Azure Load Balancer, see [Quickstart: Create a public load balancer to load balance VMs using the Azure portal](quickstart-load-balancer-standard-public-portal.md). The load balancer name for the examples in this article is **myLoadBalancer**.

- A standard internal load balancer in your subscription. For more information on creating an Azure Load Balancer, see [Quickstart: Create a internal load balancer to load balance VMs using the Azure portal](quickstart-load-balancer-standard-internal-portal.md). The load balancer name for the examples in this article is **myLoadBalancer**.

## Load-balancing rules

In this section, you learn how to add and remove a load-balancing rule. A public load balancer is used in the examples.

### Add a load-balancing rule

In this example, you create a rule to load balance port 80.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Load balancer**. Select **Load balancers** in the search results.

3. Select **myLoadBalancer** or your load balancer.

4. In the load balancer page, select **Load balancing rules** in **Settings**.

5. Select **+ Add** in **Load balancing rules** to add a rule.

6. Enter or select the following information in **Add load balancing rule**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Name | **myHTTPRule** |
    | IP Version | Select **IPv4** or **IPv6**. |
    | Frontend IP address | Select the frontend IP address of the load balancer. <br> In this example, it's **myFrontendIP**. |
    | Protocol | Leave the default of **TCP**. |
    | Port | Enter **80**. |
    | Backend port | Enter **80**. |

    | Floating IP | Leave the default of **Disabled** or enable if your deployment requires floating IP.</br> For information on floating IP, see [Azure Load Balancer Floating IP configuration](load-balancer-floating-ip.md). |
    | Outbound source network address translation (SNAT) | Leave the default of **(Recommended) Use outbound rules to provide backend pool members access to the internet.**</br> For more information on outbound rules and (SNAT), see [Outbound rules Azure Load Balancer](outbound-rules.md) and [Using Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections](load-balancer-outbound-connections.md).|
