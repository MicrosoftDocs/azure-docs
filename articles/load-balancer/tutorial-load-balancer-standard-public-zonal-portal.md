# Tutorial: Load balance VMs within an availability zone by using the Azure portal

This tutorial creates a public [load balancer](https://aka.ms/azureloadbalancerstandard) with a zonal IP. In the tutorial, you specify a zone for your frontend and backend instances.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a virtual network with an Azure Bastion host for management.
> * Create a NAT gateway for outbound internet access of the resources in the virtual network.
> * Create a load balancer with a health probe and traffic rules.
> * Create zonal virtual machines (VMs) and attach them to a load balancer.
> * Create a basic Internet Information Services (IIS) site.
> * Test the load balancer.

For more information about availability zones and a standard load balancer, see [Standard load balancer and availability zones](load-balancer-standard-availability-zones.md).
