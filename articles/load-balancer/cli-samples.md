# Azure CLI Samples for Load Balancer

The following table includes links to bash scripts built using the Azure CLI.

| | |
|-|-|
| [Load balance traffic to VMs for high availability](./scripts/load-balancer-linux-cli-sample-nlb.md) | Creates several virtual machines in a highly available and load balanced configuration. |
| [Load balance traffic to VMs across availability zones](./scripts/load-balancer-linux-cli-sample-zone-redundant-frontend.md) | Creates three VMs in different availability zones within a region and Standard Load Balancer with a zone-redundant frontend IP address. This load balancer configuration helps to protect your apps and data from an unlikely failure or loss of an entire datacenter. |
