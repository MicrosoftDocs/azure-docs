# Azure Load Balancer portal settings

As you create Azure Load Balancer, information in this article helps you learn more about the individual settings and what the right configuration is for you.

## Create load balancer

Azure Load Balancer is a network load balancer that distributes traffic across VM instances in the backend pool. 
To create a load balancer in the portal, at the top of the page select the search box. Enter **Load balancer**. Select **Load balancers** in the search results. Select **+ Create** in the **Load balancers** page.

### Basics

In the **Basics** tab of the create load balancer portal page, you see the following information:

| Setting |  Details |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Subscription  | Select your subscription. This selection is the subscription you want your load balancer to be deployed in. |
| Resource group | Select **Create new** and type in the name for your resource group in the text box. If you have an existing resource group created, select it. |
| Name | This setting is the name for your Azure Load Balancer. |
| Region | Select an Azure region you'd like to deploy your load balancer in. |
| SKU  | Select **Standard**. </br> Load balancer has three SKUs: </br> **Basic** </br>**Standard** </br> **Gateway**. </br> Basic has limited functionality. </br> Standard is recommended for production workloads. </br> Gateway caters to non-Microsoft network virtual appliances (NVAs) </br> Learn more about [SKUs](skus.md). |
| Type | Load balancer has two types: </br> **Internal (Private)** </br> **Public (External)**.</br> An internal load balancer (ILB) routes traffic to backend pool members via a private IP address.</br> A public load balancer directs requests from clients over the internet to the backend pool.</br> Learn more about [load balancer types](components.md#frontend-ip-configuration-).|
| Tier | Load balancer has two tiers: </br> **Regional** </br> **Global** </br> A regional load balancer is constrained to load balancing within a region. Global refers to a cross-region load balancer that load-balances across regions. </br> For more information on the **Global** tier, see [Cross-region load balancer (preview)](cross-region-overview.md)

### Inbound NAT rules

An inbound NAT rule forwards incoming traffic sent to frontend IP address and port combination. 

The traffic is sent to a specific virtual machine or instance in the backend pool. Port forwarding is done by the same hash-based distribution as load balancing.

If your scenario requires Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Secure Shell (SSH) sessions to separate VM instances in a backend pool. Multiple internal endpoints can be mapped to ports on the same frontend IP address. 

The frontend IP addresses can be used to remotely administer your VMs without an extra jump box.

If you want to add an inbound nat rule to your load balancer, go to your load balancer in the Azure portal, select **Inbound NAT rules**, and then select **+Add**.

| Setting | Details |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Name | The name of your inbound NAT rule |
| Frontend IP address | Select the frontend IP address. </br> The frontend IP address of your load balancer you want the inbound NAT rule associated to. |
| IP Version | Your options are **IPv4** and **IPv6**. |
| Service | The type of service you're running on Azure Load Balancer. </br> A selection here updates the port information appropriately. |
| Protocol | Azure Load Balancer is a layer 4 network load balancer. </br> Your options are: TCP or UDP. |
| Idle timeout (minutes) | Keep a TCP or HTTP connection open without relying on clients to send keep-alive messages. |
| TCP Reset | Load Balancer can send TCP resets to help create a more predictable application behavior on when the connection is idle. </br> Learn more about [TCP reset](load-balancer-tcp-reset.md) |
| Port | This setting is the port associated with the frontend IP that you want traffic to be distributed based on this inbound NAT rule. |
| Target virtual machine | The virtual machine part of the backend pool you would like this rule to be associated to. |

| Available Frontend ports | Displayed value of total available frontend ports based on selected port allocation. |
| Maximum number of backend instances | Enter the maximum number of back end instances. This entry is only available when choosing **Maximum number of backend instances** for outbound ports above. </br> You can't scale your backend pool above this number of instances. Increasing the number of instances decreases the number of ports per instance unless you also add more frontend IP addresses. |
