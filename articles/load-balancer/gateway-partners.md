“Protecting enterprise workloads from DDoS attacks has become a must as organizations are migrating to the cloud alongside a rise in complexity, intensity, and frequency of attacks. With Azure Gateway Load Balancer, customers can now inject A10’s Thunder Virtual Appliance, on top of Azure’s DDoS Protection to offer improved L3-7 protection for latency sensitive workloads. Azure Gateway Load Balancer is setting a new precedent by simplifying the injection of L7 DDoS appliances in the path, providing transparent flow (bump in the wire) using an overlay network with low latency, preserving the health of the host as well as the NVAs during the DDoS attacks.”
