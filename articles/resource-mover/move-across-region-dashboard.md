# Move across region dashboard

This article describes how to monitor the resources you are moving across regions via the Move across region dashboard in Azure Resource Mover. 

## Monitor via the dashboard

1. In **Azure Resource Mover**, select **Overview** the left navigation pane. You can toggle between two pages, **Getting started** and **Move across region dashboard**. **Getting started** page provides options to move your resources across subscription, across resource group and across region.
The **Move across region dashboard** page combines all monitoring information of your move across region in a single place.

2. The dashboard lists all the move combinations created by you. The following two sections are used to capture the status of your move across regions.
    In **Resources by move status**, monitor the percentage and number of resources in each state.
    In **Error Summary**, monitor the active errors that need to be resolved before you can successfully move to the destination region.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the source-destination combinations that are already created in your chosen subscription would be listed in the dashboard.

3. Use the filters to choose your preferred **Subscription**, **Source region**, and **Destination region**.
