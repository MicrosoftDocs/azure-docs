# Choose a tool for moving Azure resources

You can move resources within Azure as follows:

- **Move resources across regions**: Move resources from within the Resource Mover hub, or a resource group. 
- **Move resources across resource groups/subscriptions**: Move from within a resource group. 
- **Move resources between Azure clouds**: Use the Azure Site Recovery service to move resources between public and government clouds.
- **Move resources between availability zones in the same region**: Use the Azure Site Recovery service to move resources between availability zones in the same Azure region.
