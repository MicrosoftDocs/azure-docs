# What's new in Resource Mover

[Azure Resource Mover](overview.md) is constantly improving and releasing new features that simplify moving workloads in Azure. These new features expand the current capability of region-to-region migration by supporting more resource types or adding in new move capabilities. 
You can learn more about the new releases by bookmarking this page or by subscribing to updates [here](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR85jvyZFzJ9Fij7HO6nPfn5UNFc3QTJXNFMwNFhKMDUwOEhOTzdFQzFEMi4u). 

## Updates (March 2024)

### Capability to move Azure VMs to another subscription and region

Azure Resource Mover now supports moving resources from one subscription to another, in addition to moving Azure VMs across regions. This feature helps consolidate, organize, manage, and bill resources more effectively. The **Edit target subscription** option is available on the move resources blade, along with options to add or remove resources, prepare, initiate, discard, and commit the move. After adding resources, you can select **Edit target subscription** to move resources to a different subscription than the source. 

For more information, see [Move Azure VMs to another subscription and region](./move-region-within-resource-group.md).


### Updates (September 2020)

Azure Resource Mover is now in public preview.
