# What is the DevTest Lab service?

##Overview

The Azure DevTest Lab service lets teams to quickly create development and testing environments while minimizing waste and controlling costs. 

Developers and testers are looking to the cloud to solve the delays in creating and managing their environments. Azure provides a cost-efficient structure to host virtual machines.  However, developers and testers still need to spend considerable time configuring their self-service environments. Decision makers are uncertain about how to leverage the cloud to maximize their cost savings without adding too much process overhead. DevTest Lab addresses these concerns.

With DevTest Lab, developers and testers can:

- Test the latest version of your application by quickly provisioning Windows and Linux environments using reusable templates and artifacts. 
- Easily integrate your deployment pipeline with DevTest Lab to provision on demand environments. 
- Scale up your load testing by provisioning multiple test agents. 
- Create pre-provisioned environments for training and demos. 

DevTest Lab adminstrators can: 

- Control costs by setting the number and size of the VMs that the lab can contain and that a user can own.
- Control access to the lab from both inside and outside your organization.
- Easily share VM templates and artifacts among labs.
