#What is DevTest Labs?

##Overview
Developers and testers are looking to solve the delays in creating and managing their environments by going to the cloud.  Azure solves the problem of environment delays and allows self-service within a new cost efficient structure.  However, developers and testers still need to spend considerable time configuring their self-served environments. Also, decision makers are uncertain about how to leverage the cloud to maximize their cost savings without adding too much process overhead.

Azure DevTest Labs is a service that helps developers and testers quickly create environments in Azure while minimizing waste and controlling cost. You can test the latest version of your application by quickly provisioning Windows and Linux environments using reusable templates and artifacts. Easily integrate your deployment pipeline with DevTest Labs to provision on-demand environments. Scale up your load testing by provisioning multiple test agents, and create pre-provisioned environments for training and demos.
