# Machine Learning example apps in the Azure Marketplace

Azure Machine Learning allows data scientists a new channel to monetize their know-how and creativity just as smartphone app developers do. By publishing your machine learning services into the Azure Marketplace, you enable anyone in the world to pay and subscribe to your newly published cloud APIs and use them in their apps.

But Azure Marketplace can offer much more than basic analytics APIs. For example, we went and built a set of finished end-to-end Machine Learning applications, all using Azure ML, to solve specific business needs. These ML apps do not require a data scientist or ML expertise to use – the science is already baked into our solution. Users can just bring their own data and start using them. 

These include for example:

* [Recommendations](http://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/amla/recommendations) – a self-service but super powerful recommendation engine that allows you to easily add personalized product recommendations to your website or email campaigns. 
  
* [Frequently bought together](https://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/amla/mba) – an API that helps your customers discover items in your catalog that are frequently purchased together. Use your customer purchase history to add "Frequently Bought Together" recommendations to your website and to improve conversion in your digital store.

* [Anomaly detection](https://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/aml_labs/anomalydetection) - an API that can spot anomalous events in time-series data (e.g. server telemetry, sensor based data).

These APIs allow you to consume powerful machine learning based services built on Azure ML, without needing to be a data scientist or spend a lot of time developing those yourself – just bring your own data and start using them.
