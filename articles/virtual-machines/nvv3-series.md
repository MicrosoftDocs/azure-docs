# NVv3-series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The NVv3-series virtual machines are powered by [NVIDIA Tesla M60](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tesla/pdf/188417-Tesla-M60-DS-A4-fnl-Web.pdf) GPUs and NVIDIA GRID technology with Intel E5-2690 v4 (Broadwell) CPUs and Intel Hyper-Threading Technology. These virtual machines are targeted for GPU accelerated graphics applications and virtual desktops where customers want to visualize their data, simulate results to view, work on CAD, or render and stream content. Additionally, these virtual machines can run single precision workloads such as encoding and rendering. NVv3 virtual machines support Premium Storage and come with twice the system memory (RAM) when compared with its predecessor NV-series.  

Each GPU in NVv3 instances comes with a GRID license. This license gives you the flexibility to use an NV instance as a virtual workstation for a single user, or 25 concurrent users can connect to the VM for a virtual application scenario.

## Supported operating systems and drivers

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of Azure N-series VMs, NVIDIA GPU drivers must be installed.

The [NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension](./extensions/hpccompute-gpu-windows.md) installs appropriate NVIDIA CUDA or GRID drivers on an N-series VM. Install or manage the extension using the Azure portal or tools such as Azure PowerShell or Azure Resource Manager templates. See the [NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension documentation](./extensions/hpccompute-gpu-windows.md) for supported operating systems and deployment steps. For general information about VM extensions, see [Azure virtual machine extensions and features](./extensions/overview.md).

If you choose to install NVIDIA GPU drivers manually, see [N-series GPU driver setup for Windows](./windows/n-series-driver-setup.md) or [N-series GPU driver setup for Linux](./linux/n-series-driver-setup.md) for supported operating systems, drivers, installation, and verification steps.
