# Technical Deep Dive on Platform supported migration from Classic to Azure Resource Manager

In this article, we do a technical deep dive on migration at a resource and feature level to help you understand how the platform migrates the resources from Classic to Resource Manager. Please read through the service announcement article - [Platform supported migration of IaaS resources from Classic to Azure Resource Manager](virtual-machines-windows-migration-asm-arm).

## Detailed guidance on resource and feature level migration

You can find the classic and resource manager representation of the resources below. Features and resources not listed in this table is not supported at this time.

| Classic Representation                                 | Resource Manager Representation                 | Detailed notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |   |   |

| Cloud Service Name                                     | DNS Name                                        | During migration, we will create a new resource group for every cloud service with the naming pattern - `<cloudservicename>-migrated` which will contain all the resources.Cloud Service Name becomes a DNS Name that is associated with the Public IP Address                                                                                                                                                                                                    |   |   |
| Virtual Machine                                        | Virtual Machine                                 | VM specific properties will be migrated over as is. Please note that certain osProfile information like computer name was not stored in classic deployment model and hence will remain empty after migration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |   |   |
| Disk resources attached to VM                          | Implicit disks attached to VM                   | Disks are not modeled as top level resources in the resource manager deployment model. They will be migrated over as implicit disks under the VM. At this time, we only support disks attached to a VM. Migrating unassociated disks will be supported soon.  To enable migration, classic storage accounts now have the ability to be used by resource manager VMs. So this allows the disks to be easily migrated over to the resource manager model with out any updates. |   |   |
| VM Extensions                                          | VM Extensions                                   | All the resource extensions except XML extensions will be migrated from the classic deployment model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |   |   |
| Virtual Machine Certificates                           | Certificates in Azure Key Vault                 | If a cloud service contains service certificates, platform will create a new azure keyvault per cloud service and move the certificates into the keyvault. The VMs will be updated to reference the certificates from the keyvault.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |   |   |
| WinRM configuration                                    | WinRM Configuration under osProfile             | WinRM configuration will be moved over as-is as part of the migration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   |   |
| Availability Set Property                              | Availability Set Resource                       | Availability Set specification was a property on the VM in the classic deployment model. Availability Sets will become a top level resource as part of the migration. Please note that we don't support the following configuration - 'multiple availability sets per cloud service' or '1 or more availability sets along with VMs that are not in any availability set in a cloud service'.                                                                                |   |   |
| Network Configuration on a VM                          | Primary Network Interface                       | Network Configuration on a VM will now be represented as the primary network interface resource after migration. For VMs that are not in a VNET, the internal IP address will change during migration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   |   |
| Multiple Network interfaces on a VM                    | Network Interfaces                              | If a VM had multiple network interfaces associated, then each network interface will become a top level resource as part of the migration in the resource manager deployment model along with all the properties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   |   |

During migration, we will create a new load balancer resource and the load balancing endpoint set will become load balancer rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |   |   |

| Internal DNS Names on the VM                           | Internal DNS Name on the NIC                    | During migration, the internal DNS Suffixes will be updated to match the suffixes of the resource manager deployment model. Please note that name resolution will continue to work after migration. However, the suffixes associated with the VMs will be changed.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |   |   |

## Sample illustration of a simple migration walkthrough

In the sample screenshots shown below, you can see the representation of a Cloud Service with a VM (Not in a VNET) after the Prepare phase.
