# Mainframe workloads supported on Azure

The solutions listed here can help you migrate your mainframe workload to Microsoft Azure. Some workloads can be migrated with relative ease. Other workloads that depend on legacy system software can be rehosted. 

For more help with mainframe emulation and services, refer to the [Azure Mainframe Migration center](https://azure.microsoft.com/migration/mainframe/).
