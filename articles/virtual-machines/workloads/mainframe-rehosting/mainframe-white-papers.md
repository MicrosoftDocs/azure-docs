# Azure white papers about mainframe topics

[Demystifying mainframe to Azure migration](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/demystifying-mainframe-to-azure-migration/)
Azure provides a mainframe alternative capable of delivering equivalent functionality and features. This paper, by Larry Mead of the AzureCAT team, covers the major IBM z/OS mainframe components alongside their Azure equivalents and is designed to help you complete the critical first step of moving to the cloud. It also provides a road map for starting the conversation with IT decision-makers who subscribe to outdated mainframe philosophies.

[Move mainframe compute and storage to Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/move-mainframe-compute-and-storage-to-azure/)
To run mainframe workloads on Microsoft Azure, you need to know how your mainframe’s capabilities compare to Azure. Based on an IBM z14 mainframe, this guide by Larry Mead of AzureCAT explores how to get comparable results on Azure. The massively scalable compute and storage resources on Azure provide immediate benefits to organizations running mainframe workloads.

[Microsoft Azure Government cloud for mainframe applications](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/microsoft-azure-government-cloud-for-mainframe-applications/)
Planning an application migration is the ideal time to add value and agility to even well-established mainframe workloads. In this quick guide, Larry Mead of AzureCAT shows how United States government agencies and their partners can use Azure Government for mainframe applications—and migration may not be as difficult as you think. Azure Government delivers the advantages of a mainframe in a more cost-efficient and agile environment. In addition, Azure Government earned a Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) for FedRAMP High Impact.

[Deploy IBM Db2 pureScale on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/deploy-ibm-db2-purescale-on-azure/)
The AzureCAT and DMJ teams recently worked with an enterprise that rehosted their IBM Db2 environment running on z/OS to IBM Db2 pureScale on Azure. In this guide, Larry Mead, Benjamin Guinebertière, Alessandro Vozza, and Jonathon Frost describe the steps they took during the migration. Their findings were reviewed by members of the IBM Db2 pureScale team. Installation scripts, available on GitHub, are based on the architecture that the team used for a typical medium-sized OLTP workload.

[Install TmaxSoft OpenFrame on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/install-tmaxsoft-openframe-on-azure/)
TmaxSoft OpenFrame makes it easy to lift your existing mainframe assets and shift them to Microsoft Azure. In this paper, Steve Read (AzureCAT) and Manoj Aerroju (TmaxSoft) explain how to set up an OpenFrame environment suitable for development, demos, testing, and production workloads. By moving your mainframe workloads to the cloud, you can modernize your infrastructure, benefit from the scale of Azure, and minimize drawbacks associated with mainframes.
