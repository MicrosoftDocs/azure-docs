# Monitor SAP on Azure (preview)

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. 

This article describes the monitoring data generated by Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions. Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions is an Azure-native monitoring product for anyone running their SAP landscapes on Azure. The product works with both [SAP on Azure Virtual Machines](./hana-get-started.md) and [SAP on Azure Large Instances](./hana-overview-architecture.md).

With Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions, you can collect telemetry data from Azure infrastructure and databases in one central location and visually correlate telemetry data for faster troubleshooting.

## Monitoring overview page in Azure portal

Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions is offered through Azure Marketplace. It provides a simple, intuitive setup experience to deploy the resource for Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions (known as **SAP monitor resource**).

You can monitor different components of an SAP landscape, such as Azure virtual machines (VMs), high-availability cluster, SAP HANA database, SAP NetWeaver, and so on, by adding the corresponding **provider** for that component. For more information, see [Deploy Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions by using the Azure portal](azure-monitor-sap-quickstart.md).

Supported infrastructure:

- Azure virtual machine
- Azure Large Instance

Supported databases:
- SAP HANA Database
- Microsoft SQL server

Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions uses the power of existing [Azure Monitor](../../../azure-monitor/overview.md) capabilities such as Log Analytics and [Workbooks](../../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md) to provide more monitoring capabilities. You can create [custom visualizations](../../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md#getting-started) by editing the default Workbooks provided by Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions. Write [custom queries](../../../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial.md) and create [custom alerts](../../../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-log.md) by using Azure Log Analytics workspace. Take advantage of [flexible retention period](../../../azure-monitor/logs/manage-cost-storage.md#change-the-data-retention-period) and connect monitoring data with your ticketing system.

## Architecture overview

The following diagram shows, at a high level, how Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions collects telemetry from SAP HANA database. The architecture is the same whether SAP HANA is deployed on Azure VMs or Azure Large Instances.

![Azure Monitor for SAP solutions architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75772258/115046700-62ff3280-9ef5-11eb-8d0d-cfcda526aeeb.png)

The key components of the architecture are:
- Azure portal – your starting point. You can navigate to marketplace within Azure portal and discover Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions.
- Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions resource - a landing place for you to view monitoring telemetry.
- Managed resource group – deployed automatically as part of the Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions resource deployment. The resources deployed within managed resource group help in collection of telemetry. Key resources deployed and their purpose are:
   - Azure virtual machine: Also known as *collector VM*, it's a Standard_B2ms VM. The main purpose of this VM is to host the *monitoring payload*. Monitoring payload refers to the logic of collecting telemetry from the source systems and transferring the data to the monitoring framework. In the preceding diagram, the monitoring payload contains the logic to connect to an SAP HANA database over SQL port.
   - [Azure Key Vault](../../../key-vault/general/basic-concepts.md): This resource is deployed to securely hold SAP HANA database credentials and to store information about [providers](./azure-monitor-providers.md).
   - Log Analytics Workspace: the destination where the telemetry data is stored.
      - Visualization is built on top of telemetry in Log Analytics using [Azure Workbooks](../../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md). You can customize visualization. You can also pin your Workbooks or specific visualization within Workbooks to Azure dashboard for autorefresh. The maximum frequency for refresh is every 30 minutes.
      - You can use your existing workspace within the same subscription as SAP monitor resource by choosing this option at deployment.
      - You can use Kusto query language (KQL) to run [queries](../../../azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview.md) against the raw tables inside Log Analytics workspace. Look at *Custom Logs*.

> [!Note]
> You are responsible for patching and maintaining the VM, deployed in the managed resource group.

> [!Tip]
> You can use an existing Log Analytics workspace for telemetry collection if it's deployed within the same Azure subscription as the resource for Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions.

### Architecture highlights

Here are the key highlights of the architecture:
 - **Multi-instance** - You can create monitor for multiple instances of a given component type (for example, HANA database, high availability (HA) cluster, Microsoft SQL server, SAP NetWeaver) across multiple SAP SIDs within a VNET with a single resource of Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions.
 - **Multi-provider** - The preceding architecture diagram shows the SAP HANA provider as an example. Similarly, you can configure more providers for corresponding components to collect data from those components. For example, HANA DB, HA cluster, Microsoft SQL server, and SAP NetWeaver. 
 - **Open source** - The source code of Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/AzureMonitorForSAPSolutions). You can refer to the provider code and learn more about the product, contribute, or share feedback.
 - **Extensible query framework** - SQL queries to collect telemetry data are written in [JSON](https://github.com/Azure/AzureMonitorForSAPSolutions/blob/master/sapmon/content/SapHana.json). More SQL queries to collect more telemetry data can be easily added. You can request specific telemetry data to be added to Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions. Do so by leaving feedback using the link at the end of this article. You can also leave feedback by contacting your account team.

## Monitoring data

Data collection in Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions depends on the providers you configure. During public preview, the following data is collected.

### Data sharing with Microsoft

Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions collects system metadata to provide improved support for SAP on Azure. No PII/EUII is collected.

You can enable data sharing with Microsoft when you create Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions resource by choosing *Share* from the drop-down. We recommend that you enable data sharing. Data sharing gives Microsoft support and engineering teams information about your environment, which helps us provide better support for your mission-critical SAP on Azure solution.

## Analyzing metrics

Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions does not support metrics. See the following section on analyzing logs.

## Analyzing logs

Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions doesn't support resource logs. It does, however, support the activity log. The [Activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-log) is a type of platform log within Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics. 

For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs that can be queried by Log Analytics, see [Monitoring SAP on Azure data reference](monitor-service-reference.md##azure-monitor-logs-tables). 

### Sample Kusto queries

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other accounts or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](../../../azure-monitor/logs/scope.md) for details.

Here are some queries that you can use to help you monitor your Monitor SAP on Azure resources.
