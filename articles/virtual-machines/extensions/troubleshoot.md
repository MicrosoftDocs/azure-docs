# Troubleshooting Azure Windows VM extension failures
[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-extensions-troubleshoot](../../../includes/virtual-machines-common-extensions-troubleshoot.md)]

## Viewing extension status
Azure Resource Manager templates can be executed from Azure PowerShell. Once the template is executed, the extension status can be viewed from Azure Resource Explorer or the command-line tools.

Here is an example:

Azure PowerShell:

```azurepowershell
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $RGName -Name $vmName -Status
```

Here is the sample output:

```output
Extensions:  {
  "ExtensionType": "Microsoft.Compute.CustomScriptExtension",
  "Name": "myCustomScriptExtension",
  "SubStatuses": [
    {
      "Code": "ComponentStatus/StdOut/succeeded",
      "DisplayStatus": "Provisioning succeeded",
      "Level": "Info",
      "Message": "    Directory: C:\\temp\\n\\n\\nMode                LastWriteTime     Length Name
          \\n----                -------------     ------ ----                              \\n-a---          9/1/2015   2:03 AM         11
          test.txt                          \\n\\n",
                  "Time": null
      },
    {
      "Code": "ComponentStatus/StdErr/succeeded",
      "DisplayStatus": "Provisioning succeeded",
      "Level": "Info",
      "Message": "",
      "Time": null
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting extension failures

### Rerun the extension on the VM
If you are running scripts on the VM using Custom Script Extension, you could sometimes run into an error where VM was created successfully but the script has failed. Under these conditions, the recommended way to recover from this error is to remove the extension and rerun the template again.
Note: In future, this functionality would be enhanced to remove the need for uninstalling the extension.

#### Remove the extension from Azure PowerShell
```azurepowershell
Remove-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName $RGName -VMName $vmName -Name "myCustomScriptExtension"
```

Once the extension has been removed, the template can be re-executed to run the scripts on the VM.

### Trigger a new GoalState to the VM
You might notice that an extension hasn't been executed, or is failing to execute because of a missing "Windows Azure CRP Certificate Generator" (that certificate is used to secure the transport of the extension's protected settings).
That certificate will be automatically regenerated by restarting the Windows Guest Agent from inside the Virtual Machine:
- Open the Task Manager
- Go to the Details tab
- Locate the WindowsAzureGuestAgent.exe process
- Right-click, and select "End Task". The process will be automatically restarted


You can also trigger a new GoalState to the VM, by executing a "VM Reapply". VM [Reapply](/rest/api/compute/virtualmachines/reapply) is an API introduced in 2020 to reapply a VM's state. We recommend doing this at a time when you can tolerate a short VM downtime. While Reapply itself does not cause a VM reboot, and the vast majority of times calling Reapply will not reboot the VM, there is a very small risk that some other pending update to the VM model gets applied when Reapply triggers a new goal state, and that other change could require a restart. 

Azure portal:

In the portal, select the VM and in the left pane under the **Support + troubleshooting**, select **Redeploy + reapply**, then select **Reapply**.


Azure PowerShell *(replace the RG Name and VM Name with your values)*:

```azurepowershell
Set-AzVM -ResourceGroupName <RG Name> -Name <VM Name> -Reapply
```

Azure CLI *(replace the RG Name and VM Name with your values)*:

```azurecli
az vm reapply -g <RG Name> -n <VM Name>
```

If a "VM Reapply" didn't work, you can add a new empty Data Disk to the VM from the Azure Management Portal, and then remove it later once the certificate has been added back.
