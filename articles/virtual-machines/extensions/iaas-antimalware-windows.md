# Microsoft Antimalware Extension for Windows

## Overview

The modern threat landscape for cloud environments is extremely dynamic, increasing the pressure on business IT cloud subscribers to maintain effective protection in order to meet compliance and security requirements. Microsoft Antimalware for Azure is free real-time protection capability that helps identify and remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software, with configurable alerts when known malicious or unwanted software attempts to install itself or run on your Azure systems. The solution is built on the same antimalware platform as Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), Microsoft Forefront Endpoint Protection, Microsoft System Center Endpoint Protection, Windows Intune, and Windows Defender for Windows 8.0 and higher.
Microsoft Antimalware for Azure is a single-agent solution for applications and tenant environments, designed to run in the background without human intervention. You can deploy protection based on the needs of your application workloads, with either basic secure-by-default or advanced custom configuration, including antimalware monitoring.

## Prerequisites

### Operating system

The Microsoft Antimalware for Azure solution includes the Microsoft Antimalware Client, and Service, Antimalware classic deployment model, Antimalware PowerShell cmdlets, and Azure Diagnostics Extension. The Microsoft Antimalware solution is supported on Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system families. 
It is not supported on the Windows Server 2008 operating system, and also is not supported in Linux. 

Windows Defender is the built-in Antimalware enabled in Windows Server 2016. The Windows Defender Interface is also enabled by default on some Windows Server 2016 SKU's.
The Azure VM Antimalware extension can still be added to a Windows Server 2016 Azure VM with Windows Defender, but in this scenario the extension will apply any optional configuration policies to be used by Windows Defender, the extension will not deploy any additional antimalware service. 
You can read more about this update [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azuresecurity/2017/03/07/update-to-azure-antimalware-extension-for-cloud-services/).

### Internet connectivity

The Microsoft Antimalware for Windows requires that the target virtual machine is connected to the internet to receive the engine, and signature updates regularly. 

## Template deployment
Azure VM extensions can be deployed with Azure Resource Manager templates. Templates are ideal when deploying one or more virtual machines that require post deployment configuration such as onboarding to Azure Antimalware.

The JSON configuration for a virtual machine extension can be nested inside the virtual machine resource, or placed at the root or top level of a Resource Manager JSON template. 
The placement of the JSON configuration affects the value of the resource name and type. 
For more information, see [Set name and type for child resources](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-templates-resources.md). 

The following example assumes the VM extension is nested inside the virtual machine resource. When nesting the extension resource, the JSON is placed in the `"resources": []` object of the virtual machine.

```json
{
      "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions",
      "name": "[concat(parameters('vmName'),'/', parameters('vmExtensionName'))]",
      "apiVersion": "2017-03-30",
      "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
      "dependsOn": [
        "[concat('Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/', parameters('vmName'))]"
      ],

      "properties": {
        "publisher": "Microsoft.Azure.Security",
        "type": "IaaSAntimalware",
        "typeHandlerVersion": "1.3",
        "settings": {
          "AntimalwareEnabled": "true",
          "Exclusions": {
            "Extensions": ".log;.ldf",
            "Paths": "D:\\IISlogs;D:\\DatabaseLogs",
            "Processes": "mssence.svc"
          },

          "RealtimeProtectionEnabled": "true",
          "ScheduledScanSettings": {
            "isEnabled": "true",
            "scanType": "Quick",
            "day": "7",
            "time": "120"
          }
        },
        "protectedSettings": null
      }
}
```

## PowerShell deployment
Depends on your type of deployment, use the corresponding commands to deploy the Azure Antimalware virtual machine extension to an existing virtual machine.
