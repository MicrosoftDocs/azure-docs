# Enable host-based encryption

When you enable host-based encryption, data stored on the VM host is encrypted at rest and flows encrypted to the Storage service. For conceptual information on host-based encryption, as well as other managed disk encryption types, see [Host-based encryption](disk-encryption.md#host-based-encryption).
