# How to configure an availability set for Linux virtual machines in the classic deployment model
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources: [Resource Manager and Classic](../../../resource-manager-deployment-model.md). This article covers using the Classic deployment model. Microsoft recommends that most new deployments use the Resource Manager model. You can also [configure availability sets](../../azure-cli-arm-commands.md#azure-availset-commands-to-manage-your-availability-sets) in Resource Manager deployments.

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-classic-configure-availability](../../../../includes/virtual-machines-common-classic-configure-availability.md)]

## Next steps
For additional articles about classic deployments, see [Linux and open-source computing on Azure](../opensource-links.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).
