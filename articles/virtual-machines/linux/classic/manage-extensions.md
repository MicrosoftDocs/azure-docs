# Manage virtual machine extensions
Describes how to find, add, modify, or remove VM Extensions with either Windows or Linux Virtual Machines on Azure.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources: [Resource Manager and Classic](../../../resource-manager-deployment-model.md). This article covers using the Classic deployment model. Microsoft recommends that most new deployments use the Resource Manager model. For information about using VM extensions with the Resource Manager model, see [here](../extensions-features.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).
