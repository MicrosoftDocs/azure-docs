# Enable encryption at host

When you enable encryption at host, data stored on the VM host is encrypted at rest and flows encrypted to the Storage service. For conceptual information on encryption at host, as well as other managed disk encryption types, see [Server-side encryption of Azure managed disks](disk-encryption.md#encryption-at-vm-host)
