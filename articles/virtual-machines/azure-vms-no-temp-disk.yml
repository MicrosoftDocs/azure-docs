title: Azure VM sizes with no local temporary disk 
summary: |
  This article provides answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ) about Azure VM sizes that do not have a local temporary disk (i.e. no local temp disk). For more information on these VM sizes, see [Specifications for Dv4 and Dsv4-series (General Purpose Workloads)](dv4-dsv4-series.md) or [Specifications for Ev4 and Esv4-series (Memory Optimized Workloads)](ev4-esv4-series.md).

    questions:
      - question: |
          What does no local temp disk mean? 
        answer: |
          Traditionally, we have had VM sizes (e.g. Standard_D2s_v3, Standard_E48_v3) that include a small local disk (i.e. a D: Drive). Now with these new VM sizes, that small local disk no longer exists; however, you can still attach Standard HDD, Premium SSD or Ultra SSD.
          
      - question: |
          What if I still want a local temp disk?
        answer: |
          If your workload requires a local temporary disk, we also have new [Ddv4 and Ddsv4](ddv4-ddsv4-series.md) or [Edv4 and Edsv4](edv4-edsv4-series.md) VM sizes available. These sizes offer 50% larger temporary disk compared with the previous v3 sizes.
          
          > [!NOTE]
          > Local temporary disk is not persistent; to ensure your data is persistent, please use Standard HDD, Premium SSD or Ultra SSD options. 
          
      - question: |
          What are the differences between these new VM sizes and the General Purpose Dv3/Dsv3 or the Memory Optimized Ev3/Esv3 VM sizes that I am used to? 
        answer: |
          | v3 VM families with local temp disk	| New v4 families with local temp disk | New v4 families with no local temp disk |
          |---|---|---|
          | Dv3	| Ddv4 | Dv4 |
          | Dsv3 | Ddsv4  | Dsv4 |
          | Ev3	| Edv4  | Ev4 |
          | Esv3 | Edsv4 |	Esv4 | 
          
      - question: |
          Can I resize a VM size that has a local temp disk to a VM size with no local temp disk?  
        answer: |
          No. The only combinations allowed for resizing are: 
          
          1. VM (with local temp disk) -> VM (with local temp disk); and 
          2. VM (with no local temp disk) -> VM (with no local temp disk). 
          
          If interested in a work around, please see next question.
          
          > [!NOTE]
          > If an image depends on the resource disk, or a pagefile or swapfile exists on the local temp disk, the diskless images will not work—instead, use the ‘with disk’ alternative. 
          
      - question: |
          How do I migrate from a VM size with local temp disk to a VM size with no local temp disk?  
        answer: |
          You can migrate by following these steps: 
          
          1. Connect to your Virtual Machine that has a local temporary disk (for example, a D: Drive) as a local admin.
          2. Follow the guidelines on the "Temporarily move pagefile.sys to C drive" section of [Use the D: drive as a data drive on a Windows VM](./windows/change-drive-letter.md) to move the page file from the local temporary disk (D: drive) to the C: drive.
          
             > [!NOTE]
             > Follow the guidelines on the "Temporarily move pagefile.sys to C drive" section of Use the D: drive as a data drive on a Windows VM to move page file from the local temporary disk (D: drive) to C: drive. **Deviation from the steps outlined will lead to the error message - "Unable to resize the VM since changing from resource disk to non-resource disk VM size and vice-versa is not allowed.**
          
          3. Take a snapshot of the VM by following the steps outlined in [Create a snapshot using the portal or Azure CLI](./linux/snapshot-copy-managed-disk.md). 
          4. Use snapshot to create a new diskless VM (such as, Dv4, Dsv4, Ev4, Esv4 series) by following the steps outlined in [Create a virtual machine from a snapshot with CLI](/previous-versions/azure/virtual-machines/scripts/virtual-machines-linux-cli-sample-create-vm-from-snapshot). 
          
      - question: |
          Do these VM sizes support both Linux and Windows Operating Systems (OS)?
        answer: |
          Yes.

      - question: |
          Will this break my custom scripts, custom images or OS images that have scratch files or page files on a local temp disk?
        answer: |
          If the custom OS image points to the local temp disk, the image might not work correctly with this diskless size.
