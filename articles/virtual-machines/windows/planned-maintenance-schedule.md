# How to Schedule Planned Maintenance on Azure VMs
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources: [Resource Manager and Classic](../../resource-manager-deployment-model.md). This article covers using the Classic deployment model. Microsoft recommends that most new deployments use the Resource Manager model. For information about planned maintenance in the Resource Manager model, see [here](planned-maintenance.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json).
