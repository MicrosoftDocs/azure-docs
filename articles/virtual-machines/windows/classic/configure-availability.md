# How to configure an availability set for Windows virtual machines in the classic deployment model
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources: [Resource Manager and Classic](../../../resource-manager-deployment-model.md). This article covers using the Classic deployment model. Microsoft recommends that most new deployments use the Resource Manager model. You can also [configure availability sets](../create-availability-set.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json) in Resource Manager deployments.

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-classic-configure-availability](../../../../includes/virtual-machines-common-classic-configure-availability.md)]

## Next steps
For additional articles about classic deployments, see [Technical articles for Windows VMs in the classic deployment model](../../virtual-machines-windows-index.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json).
