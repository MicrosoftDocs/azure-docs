        Connect to the VM.

        Verify the new disk is selected and then select **OK** to initialize it.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If your disk is two tebibytes (TiB) or larger, you must use GPT partitioning. If it's under two TiB, you can use either MBR or GPT.

        Close **Disk Management**.

        A pop-up window appears notifying you that you need to format the new disk before you can use it. Select **Format disk**.
      - |
        In the **Format new disk** window, check the settings, and then select **Start**.
      - |  
        A warning appears notifying you that formatting the disks erases all of the data. Select **OK**.
      - |  
        When the formatting is complete, select **OK**.
