# Server-side encryption of Azure managed disks

Azure managed disks automatically encrypt your data by default when persisting it to the cloud. Server-side encryption (SSE) protects your data and helps you meet your organizational security and compliance commitments.

Data in Azure managed disks is encrypted transparently using 256-bit [AES encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), one of the strongest block ciphers available, and is FIPS 140-2 compliant. For more information about the cryptographic modules underlying Azure managed disks, see [Cryptography API: Next Generation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/seccng/cng-portal)

Encryption does not impact the performance of managed disks and there is no additional cost for the encryption. 

> [!NOTE]
> Temporary disks are not managed disks and are not encrypted by SSE; for more information on temporary disks, see [Managed disks overview: disk roles](managed-disks-overview.md#disk-roles).

## About encryption key management

You can rely on platform-managed keys for the encryption of your managed disk, or you can manage encryption using your own keys. If you choose to manage encryption with your own keys, you can specify a *customer-managed key* to use for encrypting and decrypting all data in managed disks. 

The following sections describe each of the options for key management in greater detail.

## Platform-managed keys

By default, managed disks use platform-managed encryption keys. As of June 10, 2017, all new managed disks, snapshots, images, and new data written to existing managed disks are automatically encrypted-at-rest with platform-managed keys.

## Customer-managed keys

You can choose to manage encryption at the level of each managed disk, with your own keys. Server-side encryption for managed disks with customer-managed keys offers an integrated experience with Azure Key Vault. You can either import [your RSA keys](../../key-vault/keys/hsm-protected-keys.md) to your Key Vault or generate new RSA keys in Azure Key Vault. 

Azure managed disks handles the encryption and decryption in a fully transparent fashion using [envelope encryption](../../storage/common/storage-client-side-encryption.md#encryption-and-decryption-via-the-envelope-technique). It encrypts data using an [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) 256 based data encryption key (DEK), which is, in turn, protected using your keys. The Storage service generates data encryption keys and encrypts them with customer-managed keys using RSA encryption. The envelope encryption allows you to rotate (change) your keys periodically as per your compliance policies without impacting your VMs. When you rotate your keys, the Storage service re-encrypts the data encryption keys with the new customer-managed keys. 

You have to grant access to managed disks in your Key Vault to use your keys for encrypting and decrypting the DEK. This allows you full control of your data and keys. You can disable your keys or revoke access to managed disks at any time. You can also audit the encryption key usage with Azure Key Vault monitoring to ensure that only managed disks or other trusted Azure services are accessing your keys.

For premium SSDs, standard SSDs, and standard HDDs: When you disable or delete your key, any VMs with disks using that key will automatically shut down. After this, the VMs will not be usable unless the key is enabled again or you assign a new key.

For ultra disks, when you disable or delete a key, any VMs with ultra disks using the key won't automatically shut down. Once you deallocate and restart the VMs then the disks will stop using the key and then VMs won't come back online. To bring the VMs back online, you must assign a new key or enable the existing key.

The following diagram shows how managed disks use Azure Active Directory and Azure Key Vault to make requests using the customer-managed key:

![Managed disk and customer-managed keys workflow. An admin creates an Azure Key Vault, then creates a disk encryption set, and sets up the disk encryption set. The Set is associated to a VM, which allows the disk to make use of Azure AD to authenticate](media/disk-storage-encryption/customer-managed-keys-sse-managed-disks-workflow.png)


The following list explains the diagram in more detail:

1. An Azure Key Vault administrator creates key vault resources.
1. The key vault admin either imports their RSA keys to Key Vault or generate new RSA keys in Key Vault.
1. That administrator creates an instance of Disk Encryption Set resource, specifying an Azure Key Vault ID and a key URL. Disk Encryption Set is a new resource introduced for simplifying the key management for managed disks. 
1. When a disk encryption set is created, a [system-assigned managed identity](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md) is created in Azure Active Directory (AD) and associated with the disk encryption set. 
1. The Azure key vault administrator then grants the managed identity permission to perform operations in the key vault.
1. A VM user creates disks by associating them with the disk encryption set. The VM user can also enable server-side encryption with customer-managed keys for existing resources by associating them with the disk encryption set. 
1. Managed disks use the managed identity to send requests to the Azure Key Vault.
1. For reading or writing data, managed disks sends requests to Azure Key Vault to encrypt (wrap) and decrypt (unwrap) the data encryption key in order to perform encryption and decryption of the data. 

To revoke access to customer-managed keys, see [Azure Key Vault PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.keyvault/) and [Azure Key Vault CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/keyvault). Revoking access effectively blocks access to all data in the storage account, as the encryption key is inaccessible by Azure Storage.

### Supported regions

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-disks-encryption-regions](../../../includes/virtual-machines-disks-encryption-regions.md)]

### Restrictions

For now, customer-managed keys have the following restrictions:

- If this feature is enabled for your disk, you cannot disable it.
    If you need to work around this, you must [copy all the data](disks-upload-vhd-to-managed-disk-powershell.md#copy-a-managed-disk) to an entirely different managed disk that isn't using customer-managed keys.
- Only [software and HSM RSA keys](../../key-vault/keys/about-keys.md) of size 2080 are supported, no other keys or sizes.
- Disks created from custom images that are encrypted using server-side encryption and customer-managed keys must be encrypted using the same customer-managed keys and must be in the same subscription.
- Snapshots created from disks that are encrypted with server-side encryption and customer-managed keys must be encrypted with the same customer-managed keys.
- All resources related to your customer-managed keys (Azure Key Vaults, disk encryption sets, VMs, disks, and snapshots) must be in the same subscription and region.
- Disks, snapshots, and images encrypted with customer-managed keys cannot move to another subscription.
- Managed disks encrypted using server-side encryption with customer-managed keys cannot also be encrypted with Azure Disk Encryption and vice versa
- For information about using customer-managed keys with shared image galleries, see [Preview: Use customer-managed keys for encrypting images](../image-version-encryption.md).

### PowerShell

#### Setting up your Azure Key Vault and DiskEncryptionSet

1. Make sure that you have installed latest [Azure PowerShell version](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps), and you are signed in to an Azure account in with Connect-AzAccount

1. Create an instance of Azure Key Vault and encryption key.

    When creating the Key Vault instance, you must enable soft delete and purge protection. Soft delete ensures that the Key Vault holds a deleted key for a given retention period (90 day default). Purge protection ensures that a deleted key cannot be permanently deleted until the retention period lapses. These settings protect you from losing data due to accidental deletion. These settings are mandatory when using a Key Vault for encrypting managed disks.
    
    ```powershell
    $ResourceGroupName="yourResourceGroupName"
    $LocationName="westcentralus"
    $keyVaultName="yourKeyVaultName"
    $keyName="yourKeyName"
    $keyDestination="Software"
    $diskEncryptionSetName="yourDiskEncryptionSetName"

    $keyVault = New-AzKeyVault -Name $keyVaultName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Location $LocationName -EnableSoftDelete -EnablePurgeProtection

    $key = Add-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName $keyVaultName -Name $keyName -Destination $keyDestination  
    ```

1.    Create an instance of a DiskEncryptionSet. 
    
        ```powershell
        $desConfig=New-AzDiskEncryptionSetConfig -Location $LocationName -SourceVaultId $keyVault.ResourceId -KeyUrl $key.Key.Kid -IdentityType SystemAssigned
        
        $des=New-AzDiskEncryptionSet -Name $diskEncryptionSetName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -InputObject $desConfig 
        ```

1.    Grant the DiskEncryptionSet resource access to the key vault.

        > [!NOTE]
        > It may take few minutes for Azure to create the identity of your DiskEncryptionSet in your Azure Active Directory. If you get an error like "Cannot find the Active Directory object" when running the following command, wait a few minutes and try again.
        
        ```powershell  
        Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName $keyVaultName -ObjectId $des.Identity.PrincipalId -PermissionsToKeys wrapkey,unwrapkey,get
        ```

#### Create a VM using a Marketplace image, encrypting the OS and data disks with customer-managed keys

```powershell
$VMLocalAdminUser = "yourVMLocalAdminUserName"
$VMLocalAdminSecurePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString <password> -AsPlainText -Force
$LocationName = "westcentralus"
$ResourceGroupName = "yourResourceGroupName"
$ComputerName = "yourComputerName"
$VMName = "yourVMName"
$VMSize = "Standard_DS3_v2"
$diskEncryptionSetName="yourdiskEncryptionSetName"
    
$NetworkName = "yourNetworkName"
$NICName = "yourNICName"
$SubnetName = "yourSubnetName"
$SubnetAddressPrefix = "10.0.0.0/24"
$VnetAddressPrefix = "10.0.0.0/16"
    
$SingleSubnet = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $SubnetName -AddressPrefix $SubnetAddressPrefix
$Vnet = New-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $NetworkName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Location $LocationName -AddressPrefix $VnetAddressPrefix -Subnet $SingleSubnet
$NIC = New-AzNetworkInterface -Name $NICName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Location $LocationName -SubnetId $Vnet.Subnets[0].Id
    
$Credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($VMLocalAdminUser, $VMLocalAdminSecurePassword);
    
$VirtualMachine = New-AzVMConfig -VMName $VMName -VMSize $VMSize
$VirtualMachine = Set-AzVMOperatingSystem -VM $VirtualMachine -Windows -ComputerName $ComputerName -Credential $Credential -ProvisionVMAgent -EnableAutoUpdate
$VirtualMachine = Add-AzVMNetworkInterface -VM $VirtualMachine -Id $NIC.Id
$VirtualMachine = Set-AzVMSourceImage -VM $VirtualMachine -PublisherName 'MicrosoftWindowsServer' -Offer 'WindowsServer' -Skus '2012-R2-Datacenter' -Version latest

$diskEncryptionSet=Get-AzDiskEncryptionSet -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $diskEncryptionSetName

$VirtualMachine = Set-AzVMOSDisk -VM $VirtualMachine -Name $($VMName +"_OSDisk") -DiskEncryptionSetId $diskEncryptionSet.Id -CreateOption FromImage

$VirtualMachine = Add-AzVMDataDisk -VM $VirtualMachine -Name $($VMName +"DataDisk1") -DiskSizeInGB 128 -StorageAccountType Premium_LRS -CreateOption Empty -Lun 0 -DiskEncryptionSetId $diskEncryptionSet.Id 
    
New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Location $LocationName -VM $VirtualMachine -Verbose
```

#### Create an empty disk encrypted using server-side encryption with customer-managed keys and attach it to a VM

```PowerShell
$vmName = "yourVMName"
$LocationName = "westcentralus"
$ResourceGroupName = "yourResourceGroupName"
$diskName = "yourDiskName"
$diskSKU = "Premium_LRS"
$diskSizeinGiB = 30
$diskLUN = 1
$diskEncryptionSetName="yourDiskEncryptionSetName"


$vm = Get-AzVM -Name $vmName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName 

$diskEncryptionSet=Get-AzDiskEncryptionSet -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $diskEncryptionSetName

$vm = Add-AzVMDataDisk -VM $vm -Name $diskName -CreateOption Empty -DiskSizeInGB $diskSizeinGiB -StorageAccountType $diskSKU -Lun $diskLUN -DiskEncryptionSetId $diskEncryptionSet.Id 

Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -VM $vm

```

#### Encrypt existing managed disks 

Your existing disks must not be attached to a running VM in order for you to encrypt them using the following script:

```PowerShell
$rgName = "yourResourceGroupName"
$diskName = "yourDiskName"
$diskEncryptionSetName = "yourDiskEncryptionSetName"
 
$diskEncryptionSet = Get-AzDiskEncryptionSet -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $diskEncryptionSetName
 
New-AzDiskUpdateConfig -EncryptionType "EncryptionAtRestWithCustomerKey" -DiskEncryptionSetId $diskEncryptionSet.Id | Update-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName $rgName -DiskName $diskName
```

#### Create a virtual machine scale set using a Marketplace image, encrypting the OS and data disks with customer-managed keys

```PowerShell
$VMLocalAdminUser = "yourLocalAdminUser"
$VMLocalAdminSecurePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString Password@123 -AsPlainText -Force
$LocationName = "westcentralus"
$ResourceGroupName = "yourResourceGroupName"
$ComputerNamePrefix = "yourComputerNamePrefix"
$VMScaleSetName = "yourVMSSName"
$VMSize = "Standard_DS3_v2"
$diskEncryptionSetName="yourDiskEncryptionSetName"
    
$NetworkName = "yourVNETName"
$SubnetName = "yourSubnetName"
$SubnetAddressPrefix = "10.0.0.0/24"
$VnetAddressPrefix = "10.0.0.0/16"
    
$SingleSubnet = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $SubnetName -AddressPrefix $SubnetAddressPrefix

$Vnet = New-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $NetworkName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Location $LocationName -AddressPrefix $VnetAddressPrefix -Subnet $SingleSubnet

$ipConfig = New-AzVmssIpConfig -Name "myIPConfig" -SubnetId $Vnet.Subnets[0].Id 

$VMSS = New-AzVmssConfig -Location $LocationName -SkuCapacity 2 -SkuName $VMSize -UpgradePolicyMode 'Automatic'

$VMSS = Add-AzVmssNetworkInterfaceConfiguration -Name "myVMSSNetworkConfig" -VirtualMachineScaleSet $VMSS -Primary $true -IpConfiguration $ipConfig

$diskEncryptionSet=Get-AzDiskEncryptionSet -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $diskEncryptionSetName

# Enable encryption at rest with customer managed keys for OS disk by setting DiskEncryptionSetId property 

$VMSS = Set-AzVmssStorageProfile $VMSS -OsDiskCreateOption "FromImage" -DiskEncryptionSetId $diskEncryptionSet.Id -ImageReferenceOffer 'WindowsServer' -ImageReferenceSku '2012-R2-Datacenter' -ImageReferenceVersion latest -ImageReferencePublisher 'MicrosoftWindowsServer'

$VMSS = Set-AzVmssOsProfile $VMSS -ComputerNamePrefix $ComputerNamePrefix -AdminUsername $VMLocalAdminUser -AdminPassword $VMLocalAdminSecurePassword

# Add a data disk encrypted at rest with customer managed keys by setting DiskEncryptionSetId property 

$VMSS = Add-AzVmssDataDisk -VirtualMachineScaleSet $VMSS -CreateOption Empty -Lun 1 -DiskSizeGB 128 -StorageAccountType Premium_LRS -DiskEncryptionSetId $diskEncryptionSet.Id

$Credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($VMLocalAdminUser, $VMLocalAdminSecurePassword);

New-AzVmss -VirtualMachineScaleSet $VMSS -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -VMScaleSetName $VMScaleSetName
```

#### Change the key of a DiskEncryptionSet to rotate the key for all the resources referencing the DiskEncryptionSet

```PowerShell
$ResourceGroupName="yourResourceGroupName"
$keyVaultName="yourKeyVaultName"
$keyName="yourKeyName"
$diskEncryptionSetName="yourDiskEncryptionSetName"

$keyVault = Get-AzKeyVault -VaultName $keyVaultName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName

$keyVaultKey = Get-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName $keyVaultName -Name $keyName

Update-AzDiskEncryptionSet -Name $diskEncryptionSetName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -SourceVaultId $keyVault.ResourceId -KeyUrl $keyVaultKey.Id
```

#### Find the status of server-side encryption of a disk

```PowerShell
$ResourceGroupName="yourResourceGroupName"
$DiskName="yourDiskName"

$disk=Get-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -DiskName $DiskName
$disk.Encryption.Type

```

When you configure customer-managed keys, a managed identity is automatically assigned to your resources under the covers. If you subsequently move the subscription, resource group, or managed disk from one Azure AD directory to another, the managed identity associated with managed disks is not transferred to the new tenant, so customer-managed keys may no longer work.

## Server-side encryption versus Azure disk encryption

[Azure Disk Encryption](../../security/fundamentals/azure-disk-encryption-vms-vmss.md) leverages the [BitLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview) feature of Windows to encrypt managed disks with customer-managed keys within the guest VM.  Server-side encryption with customer-managed keys improves on ADE by enabling you to use any OS types and images for your VMs by encrypting data in the Storage service.
