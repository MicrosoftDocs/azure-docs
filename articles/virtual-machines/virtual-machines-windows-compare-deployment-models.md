# Azure Compute, Network, and Storage Providers for Windows applications under Azure Resource Manager deployment model

The inclusion of compute, network, and storage capabilities with the Azure Resource Manager deployment model will fundamentally simplify the deployment and management of complex applications running on IaaS. Many applications require a combination of resources, including a Virtual Network, Storage Account, Virtual Machine, and a Network Interface. The Azure Resource Manager deployment model offers the ability to construct a JSON template to deploy and manage all these resources together as a single application.
