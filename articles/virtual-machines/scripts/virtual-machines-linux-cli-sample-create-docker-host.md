# Create a VM with Docker

This script creates a virtual machine with Docker enabled and starts a Docker container running NGINX. After running the script, you can access the NGINX web server through the FQDN of the Azure virtual machine. 

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-docker-host/create-docker-host.sh "Docker Host")]

## Clean up deployment 

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create the deployment. Each item in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az vm create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm#create) | Creates the virtual machine and connects it to the network card, virtual network, subnet, and network security group. This command also specifies the virtual machine image to be used, and administrative credentials.  |
| [az vm open-port](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm#open-port) | Creates a network security group rule to allow inbound traffic. In this sample, port 80 is opened for HTTP traffic. |
| [azure vm extension set](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/extension#set) | Adds and runs a virtual machine extension to a VM. In this sample, the Docker VM extension is used to configure a Docker host.|
| [az group delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/extension#set) | Deletes a resource group, including all nested resources. |

## Next steps
