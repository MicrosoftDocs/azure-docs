# Monitor a VM with Operations Management Suite

This script creates an Azure Virtual Machine, installs the Operations Management Suite (OMS) agent, and enrolls the system with an OMS workspace. Once the script has run, the virtual machine will be visible in the OMS console.

This sample works in a Bash shell. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows client, see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../virtual-machines-windows-cli-options.md).

Before running this script, ensure that a connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command. Also, the OMS workspace ID and workspace key need to be updated in the script.

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-vm-monitor-oms/create-vm-monitor-oms.sh?highlight=4-5 "Quick Create VM")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the Resource Group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az vm create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm#create) | Creates the virtual machine and connects it to the network card, virtual network, subnet, and NSG. This command also specifies the virtual machine image to be used, and administrative credentials.  |
| [azure vm extension set](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/extension#set) | Runs a VM extension against a virtual machine. In this case, the Operations Management Suite agent extension is used to install the OMS agent and enroll the VM in an OMS workspace. |
| [az group delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/extension#set) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |

## Next steps
