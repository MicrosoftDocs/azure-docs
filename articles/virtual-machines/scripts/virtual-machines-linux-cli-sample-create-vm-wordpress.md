# Create a VM with WordPress

This script creates a virtual machine, and then uses the Azure Virtual Machine custom script extension to install WordPress. Once the script has been run, the WordPress site can be accessed through the public IP address of the virtual machine. 

Before running this script, ensure that a connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command. Also, an SSH public key with the name `id_rsa.pub` must be stored in the ~/.ssh directory.

This sample works in a Bash shell. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows client, see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../virtual-machines-windows-cli-options.md).

## Create VM sample

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-wordpress-mysql/create-wordpress-mysql.sh "Quick Create VM")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the Resource Group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az network vnet create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/vnet#create) | Creates an Azure virtual network and subnet. |
| [az network public-ip create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/public-ip#create) | Creates a public IP address with a static IP address and an associated DNS name. |
| [az network nsg create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/nsg#create) | Creates a network security group (NSG), which is a security boundary between the internet and the virtual machine. |
| [az network nsg rule create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/nsg/rule#create) | Creates an NSG rule to allow inbound traffic. In this sample, port 22 is opened for SSH and port 80 for HTTP traffic. |
| [az network nic create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/nic#create) | Creates a virtual network card and attaches it to the virtual network, subnet, and NSG. |
| [az vm create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm#create) | Creates the virtual machine and connects it to the network card, virtual network, subnet, and NSG. This command also specifies the virtual machine image to be used, and administrative credentials.  |
| [az vm extension set](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm#create) | Add the Custom Script Extension to the virtual machine which invokes a script to install WordPress. |
| [az group delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/extension#set) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
