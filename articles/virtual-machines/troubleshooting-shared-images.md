# Troubleshoot images in an Azure Compute Gallery

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

If you have problems performing any operations on Azure Compute Gallery (formerly known as Shared Image Gallery) resources, like galleries, image definitions, and image versions, run the failing command again in debug mode. You activate debug mode by passing the `--debug` switch with the Azure CLI and the `-Debug` switch with PowerShell. After you've located the error, follow this article to troubleshoot it.

## Creating a disk from an image version ##

| Error Message | Cause | Mitigation |
| :-------------| :-----| :----------|
| The value of parameter imageReference is invalid. | You've tried to export from a gallery Image version to a disk but used a LUN position that does not exist on the image. | Check the image version to see what LUN positions are in use |  

## Sharing resources

The sharing of gallery, image definition, and image version resources across subscriptions is enabled using [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles.md). 

## Replication speed

Use the **--expand ReplicationStatus** flag to check if the replication to all the specified target regions has finished. If not, wait for up to six hours for the job to finish. If it fails, trigger the command again to create and replicate the image version. If there are many target regions that the image version is being replicated to, consider doing the replication in phases.

## Azure limits and quotas 

[Azure limits and quotas](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md) apply to all Azure Compute Gallery, image definition, and image version resources. Make sure you're within the limits for your subscriptions.
