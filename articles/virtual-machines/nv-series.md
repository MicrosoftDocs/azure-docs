# NV-series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets


> [!IMPORTANT]
> NV and NV_Promo series Azure virtual machines (VMs) will be retired on September 6, 2023. For more information, see the [NV and NV_Promo retirement information](nv-series-retirement.md). For how to migrate your workloads to other VM sizes, see the [NV and NV_Promo series migration guide](nv-series-migration-guide.md).
>
> This retirement announcement doesn't apply to NVv3 and NVv4 series VMs. 

The NV-series virtual machines are powered by [NVIDIA Tesla M60](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tesla/pdf/188417-Tesla-M60-DS-A4-fnl-Web.pdf) GPUs and NVIDIA GRID technology for desktop accelerated applications and virtual desktops where customers are able to visualize their data or simulations. Users are able to visualize their graphics intensive workflows on the NV instances to get superior graphics capability and additionally run single precision workloads such as encoding and rendering. NV-series VMs are also powered by Intel Xeon E5-2690 v3 (Haswell) CPUs.

Each GPU in NV instances comes with a GRID license. This license gives you the flexibility to use an NV instance as a virtual workstation for a single user, or 25 concurrent users can connect to the VM for a virtual application scenario.

1 GPU = one-half M60 card.


## Supported operating systems and drivers

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of Azure N-series VMs, NVIDIA GPU drivers must be installed.

The [NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension](./extensions/hpccompute-gpu-windows.md) installs appropriate NVIDIA CUDA or GRID drivers on an N-series VM. Install or manage the extension using the Azure portal or tools such as Azure PowerShell or Azure Resource Manager templates. See the [NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension documentation](./extensions/hpccompute-gpu-windows.md) for supported operating systems and deployment steps. For general information about VM extensions, see [Azure virtual machine extensions and features](./extensions/overview.md).

If you choose to install NVIDIA GPU drivers manually, see [N-series GPU driver setup for Windows](./windows/n-series-driver-setup.md) or [N-series GPU driver setup for Linux](./linux/n-series-driver-setup.md) for supported operating systems, drivers, installation, and verification steps.
