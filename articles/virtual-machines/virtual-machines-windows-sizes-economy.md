# Economy

The basic tier sizes are primarily for development workloads and other applications that don't require load balancing, auto-scaling, or memory-intensive virtual machines. For information about VM sizes that are more appropriate for production applications, see (Sizes for virtual machines)[virtual-machines-size-specs.md] and for VM pricing information, see [Virtual Machines Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/).
