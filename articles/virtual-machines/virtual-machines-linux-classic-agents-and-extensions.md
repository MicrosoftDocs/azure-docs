# About the virtual machine agent and extensions
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources: [Resource Manager and Classic](../articles/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model.md). This article covers using the Classic deployment model. Microsoft recommends that most new deployments use the Resource Manager model. For information about VM agents and extensions using Resource Manager, see [here](virtual-machines-linux-extensions-features.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).
