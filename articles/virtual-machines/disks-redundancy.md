# Redundancy options for managed disks

Azure managed disks offer two storage redundancy options, zone-redundant storage (ZRS) as a preview, and locally-redundant storage. ZRS provides higher availability for managed disks than locally-redundant storage (LRS) does. However, the write latency for LRS disks is better than ZRS disks because LRS disks synchronously write data to three copies in a single data center.

## Locally-redundant storage for managed disks

Locally-redundant storage (LRS) replicates your data three times within a single data center in the selected region. LRS protects your data against server rack and drive failures. 

There are a few ways you can protect your application using LRS disks from an entire zone failure that may occur due to natural disasters or hardware issues:
- Use an application like SQL Server AlwaysOn, that can synchronously write data to two zones, and automatically failover to another zone during a disaster.
- Take frequent backups of LRS disks with ZRS snapshots.
- Enable cross-zone disaster recovery for LRS disks via [Azure Site Recovery](../site-recovery/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-zone-to-zone-disaster-recovery.md). However, cross-zone disaster recovery doesn't provide zero Recovery Point Objective (RPO).

If your workflow doesn't support application-level synchronous writes across zones, or your application must meet zero RPO, then ZRS disks would ideal.

## Zone-redundant storage for managed disks (preview)

Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates your Azure managed disk synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the selected region. Each availability zone is a separate physical location with independent power, cooling, and networking. 

ZRS disks allow you to recover from failures in availability zones. If an entire zone went down, a ZRS disk can be attached to a VM in a different zone. You can also use ZRS disks as a shared disk to provide improved availability for clustered or distributed applications like SQL FCI, SAP ASCS/SCS, or GFS2. You can attach a shared ZRS disk to primary and secondary VMs in different zones to take advantage of both ZRS and [Availability Zones](../availability-zones/az-overview.md). If your primary zone fails, you can quickly fail over to the secondary VM using [SCSI persistent reservation](disks-shared-enable.md#supported-scsi-pr-commands).

### Limitations

During the preview, ZRS for managed disks has the following restrictions:

- Only supported with premium solid-state drives (SSD) and standard SSDs.
- Currently available only in the EastUS2EUAP region.
- ZRS disks can only be created with Azure Resource Manager templates using the `2020-12-01` API.

Sign up for the preview [here](https://aka.ms/ZRSDisksPreviewSignUp).

### Billing implications

For details see the [Azure pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).

### Comparison with other disk types

Except for more write latency, disks using ZRS are identical to disks using LRS. They have the same performance targets. We recommend you to conduct [disk-benchmarking](disks-benchmarks.md) to simulate the workload of your application for comparing the latency between the LRS and ZRS disks. 

### Create ZRS managed disks

Use the `2020-12-01` API with your Azure Resource Manager template to create a ZRS disk.

#### Create a VM with ZRS disks

```
$vmName = "yourVMName" 
$adminUsername = "yourAdminUsername"
$adminPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString "yourAdminPassword" -AsPlainText -Force
$osDiskType = "StandardSSD_ZRS"
$dataDiskType = "Premium_ZRS"
$region = "eastus2euap"
$resourceGroupName = "yourResourceGroupName"

New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName -Location $region
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
-TemplateUri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/managed-disks-powershell-getting-started/master/ZRSDisks/CreateVMWithZRSDataDisks.json" `
-resourceName $vmName `
-adminUsername $adminUsername `
-adminPassword $adminPassword `
-region $region `
-osDiskType $osDiskType `
-dataDiskType $dataDiskType
```

#### Create VMs with a shared ZRS disk attached to the VMs in different zones

```
$vmNamePrefix = "yourVMNamePrefix"
$adminUsername = "yourAdminUserName"
$adminPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString "yourAdminPassword" -AsPlainText -Force
$osDiskType = "StandardSSD_LRS"
$sharedDataDiskType = "Premium_ZRS"
$region = "eastus2euap"
$resourceGroupName = "zrstesting1"

New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
-TemplateUri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/managed-disks-powershell-getting-started/master/ZRSDisks/CreateVMsWithASharedDisk.json" `
-vmNamePrefix $vmNamePrefix `
-adminUsername $adminUsername `
-adminPassword $adminPassword `
-region $region `
-osDiskType $osDiskType `
-dataDiskType $sharedDataDiskType
```

#### Create a virtual machine scale set with ZRS Disks

```
$vmssName="yourVMSSName"
$adminUsername="yourAdminName"
$adminPassword=ConvertTo-SecureString "yourAdminPassword" -AsPlainText -Force
$region="eastus2euap"
$osDiskType="StandardSSD_LRS"
$dataDiskType="Premium_ZRS"

New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName zrstesting `
-TemplateUri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/managed-disks-powershell-getting-started/master/ZRSDisks/CreateVMSSWithZRSDisks.json" `
-vmssName "yourVMSSName" `
-adminUsername "yourAdminName" `
-adminPassword $password `
-region "eastus2euap" `
-osDiskType "StandardSSD_LRS" `
-dataDiskType "Premium_ZRS" `
```
