For quick and reliable answers on your technical product questions from Microsoft Engineers, Azure Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs), or our expert community, engage with us on [Microsoft Q&A](/answers/products/azure), Azure’s preferred destination for community support. 

If you can't find an answer to your problem using search, submit a new question to Microsoft Q&A. Use one of the following tags when asking your question:


| Area | Tag |
|-------|----------------------|
| [Azure Virtual Machines](./linux/overview.md) | [azure-virtual-machines](/answers/topics/azure-virtual-machines.html) | 
| [Azure SQL Virtual Machines](/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/index) | [azure-sql-virtual-machines](/answers/topics/azure-sql-virtual-machines.html)| 
| [Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview.md) | [azure-virtual-machine-scale-set](/answers/topics/azure-virtual-machines-scale-set.html) |

Explore the range of [Azure support options and choose the plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans) that best fits, whether you're a developer just starting your cloud journey or a large organization deploying business-critical, strategic applications. Azure customers can create and manage support requests in the Azure portal.

- If you already have an Azure Support Plan, [open a support request here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest).

- To sign up for a new Azure Support Plan, [compare support plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/) and select the plan that works for you. 


## Create a GitHub issue
