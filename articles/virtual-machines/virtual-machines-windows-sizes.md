# Sizes for Windows virtual machines in Azure
This article describes the available sizes and options for the Azure virtual machines you can use to run your Windows apps and workloads. It also provides deployment considerations to be aware of when you're planning to use these resources.  This article is also available for [Linux virtual machines](virtual-machines-linux-sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).

* For information about pricing of the various sizes, see [Virtual Machines Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/#Windows). 
* To see general limits on Azure VMs, see [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](../azure-subscription-service-limits.md).
* Storage costs are calculated separately based on used pages in the storage account. For details, [Azure Storage Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/).
