# Azure Virtual Machines monitoring data reference

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-intro](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-intro.md)]

See [Monitor Azure Virtual Machines](monitor-vm.md) for details on the data you can collect for Azure Virtual Machines and how to use it.

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro.md)]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Metrics for the guest operating system (guest OS) that runs in a virtual machine (VM) aren't listed here. Guest OS metrics must be collected through one or more agents that run on or as part of the guest operating system. Guest OS metrics include performance counters that track guest CPU percentage or memory usage, both of which are frequently used for autoscaling or alerting.
>
>Host OS metrics are available and listed in the following tables. Host OS metrics relate to the Hyper-V session that's hosting your guest OS session. For more information, see [Guest OS and host OS metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/metrics-index#guest-os-and-host-os-metrics).

### Supported metrics for Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines resource type.

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines](~/azure-reference-other-repo/azure-monitor-ref/supported-metrics/includes/microsoft-compute-virtualmachines-metrics-include.md)]

### VM availability metric (preview)
The VM availability metric is currently in public preview. This metric value indicates whether a machine is currently running and available. You can use the metric to trend availability over time and to alert if the machine is stopped. VM availability has the values in the following table.

| Value | Description |
|:---|:---|
| 1 | VM is running and available. | 
| 0 | VM is unavailable. The VM could be stopped or rebooting. If you shut down a VM from within the VM, it emits this value. |
| Null | State of the VM is unknown. If you stop a VM from the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell, it immediately stops emitting the availability metric, and you see null values. |

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions-intro](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-dimensions-intro.md)]

The dimension Logical Unit Number (`LUN`) is associated with some of the preceding metrics.
