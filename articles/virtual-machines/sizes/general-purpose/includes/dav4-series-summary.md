The Dav4-series run on 2nd Generation AMD EPYC™ 7452 (up to 3.35GHz) or 3rd Generation EPYC™ 7763v processors (up to 3.5GHz). The Dav4-series sizes offer a combination of vCPU, memory and temporary storage for most production workloads. Data disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. To use premium SSD, use the Dasv4 sizes. The pricing and billing meters for Dasv4 sizes are the same as the Dav4-series.
