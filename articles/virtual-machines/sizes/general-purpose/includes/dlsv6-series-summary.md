Dlsv6-series virtual machines run on 5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8473C (Emerald Rapids) CPU processor reaching an all- core turbo clock speed of up to 3.0 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 128 vCPU and 256 GiB of RAM. These VM sizes can reduce cost when running non-memory intensive applications.

Dlsv6-series virtual machines do not have any temporary storage thus lowering the price of entry. You can attach Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
