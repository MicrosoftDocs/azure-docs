Dalsv6-series VMs utilize AMD's 4th Generation EPYCTM 9004 processors that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of 3.7GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and 192 GiB of RAM. These VM sizes can reduce cost when running non-memory intensive applications. The new VMs with no local disk provide a better value proposition for workloads that do not require local temporary storage.
