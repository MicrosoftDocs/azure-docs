Ddsv6-series virtual machines run on the 5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8473C (Emerald Rapids) processor reaching an all- core turbo clock speed of 3.0 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 128 vCPU and 512 GiB of RAM. Ddsv6-series virtual machines provide a better performance for most general-purpose workloads compared to the prior generation (for example, increased scalability, upgraded CPU, elevated memory bandwidth, faster NVMe local and remote storage access, larger local storage capacity)

Ddsv6-series virtual machines offer local storage disks. You can attach Standard SSDs, Standard HDDs, Premium SSDs, and Premium SSD V2 disk storage to these virtual machines. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
