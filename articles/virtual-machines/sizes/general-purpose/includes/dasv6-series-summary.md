Dasv6-series VMs utilize AMD's 4th Generation EPYC<sup>TM</sup> 9004 processors that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of 3.7GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and 384 GiB of RAM. The Dasv6-series sizes offer a combination of vCPU and memory for most production workloads. The new VMs with no local disk provide a better value proposition for workloads that do not require local temporary storage.
