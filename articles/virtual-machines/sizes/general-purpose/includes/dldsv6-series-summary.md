Dldsv6-series virtual machines run on the 5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8473C (Emerald Rapids) processor reaching an all- core turbo clock speed of up to 3.0 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 128 vCPU and 256 GiB of RAM as well as fast, local SSD storage up to 4x1760 GiB. These VM sizes can reduce cost when running non-memory intensive applications.

Dldsv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
