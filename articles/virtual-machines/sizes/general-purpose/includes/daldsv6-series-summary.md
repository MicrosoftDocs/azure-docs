Daldsv6-series VMs utilize AMD's 4th Generation EPYCTM  9004 processors that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of 3.7GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPUs, 192 GiB of RAM, and up to 5,280 GiB of fast local NVMe temporary storage. These VM sizes can reduce cost when running non-memory intensive applications.  Daldsv6-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
