# 'DC' sub-family general purpose VM size series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

> [!NOTE]
> 'DC' family VMs are specialized for confidential computing scenarios. If your workload doesn't require confidential compute and you're looking for general purpose VMs with similar specs, consider the [the standard D-family size series](./d-family.md).
