# 'EC' sub-family memory optimized VM size series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

> [!NOTE]
> 'EC' family VMs are specialized for confidential computing scenarios. If your workload doesn't require confidential compute and you're looking for memory-optimized VMs with similar specifications, consider the [standard E-family size series](./e-family.md).
