Epdsv5-series virtual machines feature the Ampere® Altra® Arm-based processor operating at 3.0 GHz, which provides an entire physical core for each virtual machine vCPU. These virtual machines offer up to 32 vCPU, 208 GiB of RAM, and fast local SSD storage up to 1,200 GiB and are ideal for memory-intensive scale-out and most Enterprise workloads. Epdsv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
