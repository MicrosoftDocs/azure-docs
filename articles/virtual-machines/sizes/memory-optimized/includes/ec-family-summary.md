The 'EC' sub-family of VM size series are one of Azure's security focused memory-optimized VM instances. They're designed for [confidential computing](../../../../confidential-computing/overview-azure-products.md) with enhanced data protection and integrity, featuring various hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These instances are ideal for for memory-intensive workloads, such as large databases, big data analytics, and enterprise applications that require significant amounts of RAM to maintain high performance. Equipped with high memory-to-core ratios, EC-series VMs support applications and services that benefit from faster data access and more efficient data processing capabilities. This makes them particularly well-suited for scenarios involving in-memory databases and extensive data processing tasks where ample memory is crucial for optimal performance.
