The Fsv2-series run on the 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake), the Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake) processors, or the Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8168 (Skylake) processors. It features a sustained all core Turbo clock speed of 3.4 GHz and a maximum single-core turbo frequency of 3.7 GHz. Intel® AVX-512 instructions are new on Intel Scalable Processors. These instructions provide up to a 2X performance boost to vector processing workloads on both single and double precision floating point operations. In other words, they're really fast for any computational workload. Fsv2-series VMs feature Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology.
