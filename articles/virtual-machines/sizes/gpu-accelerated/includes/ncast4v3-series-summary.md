The NCasT4_v3-series virtual machines are powered by [Nvidia Tesla T4](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-t4/) GPUs and AMD EPYC 7V12(Rome) CPUs. The VMs feature up to 4 NVIDIA T4 GPUs with 16 GB of memory each, up to 64 non-multithreaded AMD EPYC 7V12 (Rome) processor cores(base frequency of 2.45 GHz, all-cores peak frequency of 3.1 GHz and single-core peak frequency of 3.3 GHz) and 440 GiB of system memory. These virtual machines are ideal for deploying AI services- such as real-time inferencing of user-generated requests, or for interactive graphics and visualization workloads using NVIDIA's GRID driver and virtual GPU technology. Standard GPU compute workloads based around CUDA, TensorRT, Caffe, ONNX and other frameworks, or GPU-accelerated graphical applications based on OpenGL and DirectX can be deployed economically, with close proximity to users, on the NCasT4_v3 series.
