> NC and NC_Promo series Azure virtual machines (VMs) will be retired on September 6, 2023. For more information, see the [NC and NC_Promo retirement information](../../../nc-series-retirement.md). For how to migrate your workloads to other VM sizes, see the [GPU compute migration guide](../../../n-series-migration.md).

> This retirement announcement doesn't apply to NCv3, NCasT4v3 and NC A100 v4 series VMs.  

NC-series VMs are powered by the [NVIDIA Tesla K80](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/Data-Center/tesla-product-literature/Tesla-K80-BoardSpec-07317-001-v05.pdf) card and the Intel Xeon E5-2690 v3 (Haswell) processor. Users can crunch through data faster by using CUDA for energy exploration applications, crash simulations, ray traced rendering, deep learning, and more. The NC24r configuration provides a low latency, high-throughput network interface optimized for tightly coupled parallel computing workloads.
