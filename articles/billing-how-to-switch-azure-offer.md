# Switch your Azure subscription to another offer

You can switch your existing subscription to a more favorable offer without any service downtime. You might consider switching your offer for one of these reasons:

-	If you find that you have a high Azure spend, you might be eligible for a discount by switching to the monetary commitment offer. Click [here](billing-usage-rate-card-overview.md) to see more information about how to gain insights into your Microsoft Azure resource consumption.
-	If you would like to avail of membership benefits such as MSDN or BizSpark, after you’ve already signed up for a Pay-As-You-Go subscription.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

**What offer changes do you support?**

See the list of [available offers you can switch to](#available-offers-you-can-switch-to).

**Does switching offers have any impact to my service?**

There is no service downtime. However, the offer you switch to may have restrictions. For instance, some offers prohibit production use. So you would need to move production resources to another subscription.

**Does switching offers have any impact to service administrators?**

There is no impact to any users associated with the subscription.

**What billing-related changes can I expect upon switching offers?**

On the day you switch, an invoice will be generated for all outstanding charges. Subsequently, your subscription will be billed per the new offer’s pricing terms. Your subscription billing anniversary changes to the date on which you changed offers. Usage and billing data prior to the offer change will not be retained, so we recommend that you download these prior to switching.

**Note** Due to billing-related constraints, the offer cannot be changed within the first billing cycle after creating a subscription.

**Can I use this mechanism to migrate from web direct to [Cloud
 Solution Provider](https://partner.microsoft.com/Solutions/cloud-reseller-overview) (CSP), or an [Enterprise Agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/) (EA) offer?**

This mechanism can be used to switch from - and to - only web direct offers. In order to move your existing subscription into EA, have your enrollment admin add your account into the EA. You will then receive an invitation email. When you follow the instructions to accept the invitation, your subscriptions will automatically be moved under the Enterprise Agreement. There is no option to move an existing web direct subscription into CSP today.
