# Azure Data Manager for Agriculture Preview as Event Grid source 

This article provides the properties and schema for Azure Data Manager for Agriculture events. For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid](/azure/event-grid/event-schema) event schema.

## Prerequisites

It's important that you have the following prerequisites completed before you begin the steps of deploying the Events feature in Azure Data Manager for Agriculture.

* [An active Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/search/?OCID=AID2100131_SEM_c4b0772dc7df1f075552174a854fd4bc:G:s&ef_id=c4b0772dc7df1f075552174a854fd4bc:G:s&msclkid=c4b0772dc7df1f075552174a854fd4bc)
* [Microsoft Azure Event Hubs namespace and an event hub deployed in the Azure portal](../event-hubs/event-hubs-create.md)

## Reacting to Data Manager for Agriculture events

Data Manager for Agriculture events allow applications to react to creation, deletion and updating of resources. Data Manager for Agriculture events are pushed using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-grid/" target="_blank"> Azure Event Grid</a>. 

Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, or even to your own http listener can subscribe to these events. Azure Event Grid provides reliable event delivery to your applications through rich retry policies and dead-lettering.

Here are example scenarios for consuming events in our service:
1. When downloading satellite or weather data or executing jobs, you can use events to respond to changes in job status. You can minimize long polling can and decreasing the number of API calls to the service. You can also get prompt notification of job completion. All our asynchronous ingestion jobs are capable of supporting events. 

> [!NOTE]
> Events related to ISV solutions flow are not currently supported.

2. If there are modifications to data-plane resources such as party, fields, farms and other similar elements, you can react to changes and you can trigger workflows.

## Filtering events
You can filter Data Manager for Agriculture <a href="/cli/azure/eventgrid/event-subscription" target="_blank"> events </a> by event type, subject, or fields in the data object. Filters in Event Grid match the beginning or end of the subject so that events that match can go to the subscriber.

For instance, for the PartyChanged event, to receive notifications for changes for a particular party with ID Party1234, you may use the subject filter "EndsWith" as shown:

EndsWith- /Party1234 
The subject for this event is of the format 
```"/parties/Party1234"```

Subjects in an event schema provide 'starts with' and 'exact match' filters as well.

Similarly, to filter the same event for a group of party IDs, use the Advanced filter on partyId field in the event data object. In a single subscription, you may add five advanced filters with a limit of 25 values for each key filtered.

To learn more about how to apply filters, see <a href = "/azure/event-grid/how-to-filter-events" target = "_blank"> filter events for Event Grid. </a>

## Subscribing to events
You can subscribe to Data Manager for Agriculture events by using Azure portal or Azure Resource Manager client. Each of these provide the user with a set of functionalities. Refer to following resources to know more about each method.

<a href = "/azure/event-grid/subscribe-through-portal" target = "_blank"> Subscribe to events using portal </a>

<a href = "/azure/event-grid/sdk-overview" target = "_blank"> Subscribe to events using the ARM template client </a>

## Practices for consuming events

Applications that handle Data Manager for Agriculture events should follow a few recommended practices:

* Check that the eventType is one you're prepared to process, and don't assume that all events you receive are the types you expect.
* As messages can arrive out of order, use the modifiedTime and etag fields to understand the order of events for any particular object.
* Data Manager for Agriculture events guarantees at-least-once delivery to subscribers, which ensures that all messages are outputted. However due to retries or availability of subscriptions, duplicate messages may occasionally occur. To learn more about message delivery and retry, see <a href = "/azure/event-grid/delivery-and-retry" target = "_blank">Event Grid message delivery and retry </a>
* Ignore fields you don't understand. This practice will help keep you resilient to new features that might be added in the future.
