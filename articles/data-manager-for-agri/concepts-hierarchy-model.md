# Hierarchy model in Azure Data Manager for Agriculture

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-notice.md](includes/public-preview-notice.md)]

To generate actionable insights, data related to growers, farms, and fields should be organized in a well-defined way. Firms that operate in the agriculture industry often perform longitudinal studies and need high-quality data to generate insights. Azure Data Manager for Agriculture  organizes agronomic data in the following hierarchy.

## Farm hierarchy

### Party

A party is the owner and custodian of any data related to a farm. You can think of a party as the legal entity that runs the business.  

The customer who sets up Azure Data Manager for Agriculture defines the party entity.

### Farm

Farms are logical entities. A farm is a collection of fields.

Farms don't have any geometry associated with them. A farm entity helps you organize your growing operations. For example, Contoso Ltd. is the party that has farms in Oregon and Idaho.

### Field

Fields denote a stable geometry that's generally agnostic to seasons and other temporal constructs. For example, a field could be the geometry denoted in government records.

Fields are multipolygons. For example, a road might divide the farm into two or more parts.

### Seasonal field

A seasonal field is the most important construct in the farming world. A seasonal field's definition includes:

* Geometry
* Season
* Crop

A seasonal field is:

* Associated with a field or a farm.
* A monocrop entity in Azure Data Manager for Agriculture. If farmers cultivate multiple crops simultaneously, they have to create one seasonal field per crop.
* Associated with one season. If farmers cultivate across multiple seasons, they have to create one seasonal field per season.
* A multipolygon. The same crop can be planted in various areas within the farm.

### Season

The season represents the temporal aspect of farming. It's a function of local agronomic practices, procedures, and weather.

### Crop

A crop entity provides the phenotypic details of the planted crop.

### Crop product

A crop product is the commercial variety (brand and product) of the planted seeds. A seasonal field can contain information about varieties of seeds planted in the same crop.
