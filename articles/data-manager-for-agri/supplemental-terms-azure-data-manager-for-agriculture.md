Previews are licensed to you as part of  [**your agreement**](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/) governing use of Azure, and subject to terms applicable to "Previews". 

Certain named Previews are subject to additional terms set forth below, if any. These Previews are made available to you pursuant to these additional terms, which supplement your agreement governing use of Azure.

## Azure Data Manager for Agriculture (Preview) 

### Connector to a Provider Service 
A connector to a third party’s (“Provider”) software or service (“Provider Service”) enables the transfer of data between Azure Data Manager for Agriculture (“ADMA”) and the Provider Service, and may facilitate the execution of workloads on or with the Provider Service. By providing Credential Information for the Provider Service to Microsoft, Customer is authorizing Microsoft to transfer data between ADMA and the Provider Service, facilitate the execution of a workload on or with the Provider Service, and receive and return associated results. “Credential Information” means data that enables access to a Provider Service to enable the transfer of data from the Provider Service to a Microsoft Online Service, and may include but isn't limited to, credentials, assess and/or refresh tokens, keys, secrets and any other required data to authenticate, search, scope and retrieve data from the Provider Service. 

#### Access to Provider Service 
Customer acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Customer has an existing agreement with the Provider to use the Provider Service, (ii) Customer is responsible for any associated fees charged by the Provider, (iii) the Provider Service isn't maintained, owned or operated by Microsoft and that Microsoft doesn't control, and isn't responsible for the privacy, security, or compliance practices of the Provider, (vi) once enabled, Microsoft may initiate the continued transfer of such data by using the Credential Information Customer provided, and (v) Microsoft will continue transferring such data from the Provider Service until Customer disables the corresponding connector. 

#### Right to use data from Provider Service  
Customer represents and warrants that Customer has the right to: (i) transfer data stored or managed by Provider to ADMA, and (ii) process such data in ADMA and any other Microsoft Online Service. 

#### Telemetry
While in preview, Microsoft may collect relevant telemetry information such as the API request path in order to assist debugging issues that may come up. Some of this telemetry data may be stored outside the geographic region where ADMA instance has been provisioned.
