# Create a private endpoint for Azure Data Manager for Agriculture

[Azure Private Link](../private-link/private-link-overview.md) provides private connectivity from a virtual network to Azure platform as a service (PaaS). It simplifies the network architecture and secures the connection between endpoints in Azure by eliminating data exposure to the public internet.

By using Azure Private Link, you can connect to an Azure Data Manager for Agriculture service from your virtual network via a private endpoint, which is a set of private IP addresses in a subnet within the virtual network. You can then limit access to your Azure Data Manager for Agriculture Preview instance over these private IP addresses.

This article describes how to create a private endpoint and approval process for Azure Data Manager for Agriculture Preview.

## Prerequisites

[Create a virtual network](../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md) in the same subscription as the Azure Data Manager for Agriculture Preview instance. This virtual network will allow automatic approval of the Private Link endpoint.

## How to set up a private endpoint
Private Endpoints can be created using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI:

*  [Azure portal](../private-link/create-private-endpoint-portal.md)
*  [PowerShell](../private-link/create-private-endpoint-powershell.md)
*  [CLI](../private-link/create-private-endpoint-cli.md)

### Approval process for a private endpoint
Once the network admin creates the private endpoint, the Data Manager for Agriculture admin can manage the private endpoint connection to Data Manager for Agriculture resource.

1. Navigate to the Data Manager for Agriculture resource in Azure portal. Select the Networking tab in the left pane, this will show a list of all Private Endpoint Connections and Corresponding Private Endpoint created.

2. Select an individual private endpoint connection from the list.
