# Add authentication to your Mobile Services app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-get-started-users](../includes/mobile-services-selector-get-started-users.md)]

This topic shows you how to authenticate users in Azure Mobile Services from your app. In this tutorial, you add authentication to the quickstart project using an identity provider that is supported by Mobile Services. After being successfully authenticated and authorized by Mobile Services, the user ID value is displayed.

This tutorial walks you through the basic steps to enable authentication in your app.



This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. You must also first complete the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services]. 

##<a name="register"></a>Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-register-authentication](../includes/mobile-services-register-authentication.md)] 

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-aad-server-extension](../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-aad-server-extension.md)] 

##<a name="permissions"></a>Restrict permissions to authenticated users

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend](../includes/mobile-services-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend.md)] 

3. Open the project that you created when you completed the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services]. 

4. From the **Run** menu, then click **Run app** to start the app; verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts. 

	 This happens because the app attempts to access Mobile Services as an unauthenticated user, but the _TodoItem_ table now requires authentication.

Next, you will update the app to authenticate users before requesting resources from the mobile service.

##<a name="add-authentication"></a>Add authentication to the app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-android-authenticate-app](../includes/mobile-services-android-authenticate-app.md)]

## <a name="cache-tokens"></a>Cache authentication tokens on the client

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-android-authenticate-app-with-token](../includes/mobile-services-android-authenticate-app-with-token.md)] 

## <a name="refresh-tokens"></a>Refresh the token cache

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-android-authenticate-app-refresh-token](../includes/mobile-services-android-authenticate-app-refresh-token.md)] 

##<a name="next-steps"></a>Next steps

In the next tutorial, [Service-side authorization of Mobile Services users][Authorize users with scripts], you will take the user ID value provided by Mobile Services based on an authenticated user and use it to filter the data returned by Mobile Services.
