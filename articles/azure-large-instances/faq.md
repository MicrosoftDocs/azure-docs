# Frequently asked questions about the Epic workload on Azure Large Instances

This article provides answers to frequently asked questions about Azure Large Instances.

## In which regions is this service available?

Azure Large Instances is available in the following regions:

* East US
* US West2
* US South Central  

## Do I need to give permissions to allow the deployment of a managed resource group in my subscription?

No, explicit permissions aren't required but you should register the resource provider with your subscription.

## Why am I not able to see the Azure Large Instances resources in Azure portal?

Check Azure Policy set up if Azure Large Instances managed RGs aren't reflected in the portal.
Azure subscription you use for Azure Large Instances deployments is registered with the Azure Large Instances infrastructure resource provider by the Microsoft Operations team during the provisioning process.
If you don't see your deployed Azure Large Instances under your subscription, register the resource provider with your subscription. 
Ensure that your VNET address space provided in the request is the same as what you configure [Working with Azure large Instances in the Azure portal](work-with-azure-large-instances-in-azure-portal.md)

## Is it possible to have Azure ARC installed on Azure Large Instances?

It’s not mandatory, but it's possible.
If you need guidance, [create a support ticket](work-with-azure-large-instances-in-azure-portal.md#open-a-support-request-for-azure-large-instances) with the Azure Customer Support team to help with your setup.

## How do I monitor Azure Large Instances?

Azure Large Instances is an IaaS offering and Azure teams are actively monitoring Azure Large Instances infrastructure (network devices, storage appliances, server hardware, etc.).
Customer alerts related to infrastructure are provided only via Azure portal’s Service Health.  
Customers are highly recommended to set up Service Health alerts to get notified via their preferred communication channels when service issues, planned maintenance, or other changes happen around Azure Large Instances.

 For more information, see [Configure Azure Service Health Alerts](configure-azure-service-health-alerts.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft is not responsible for integration with any other tooling or 3P agents. 
Customers are responsible for any additional third-party agents that they would like to install for logging and monitoring on Azure Large Instances infrastructure.

It’s also recommended to rerun Azure Large Instances GenIO test post third-party agents are installed to check for any performance variations.

## How does Microsoft communicate unplanned issues?

Microsoft sends service health notification only through the Azure portal.
We always recommend customers to configure alerts for service health notifications.  

This monitoring and alerting mechanism is different than traditional mechanisms.  It's recommended for customers to set up Service Health alerts to their preferred communication channels for service issues, planned maintenance, or other changes that occur around Azure Large Instances. 
Not setting this up could cause issues with your Azure Large Instances that might go undetected for a long time and cause downtime if not addressed at the right time.

## Based on my business priority, can I request a change in the “Planned” maintenance schedule for Azure Large Instances - if I must?

Microsoft sends a health notification service for both planned and unplanned events.
Ensure you configure health alerts for service health notifications.
If due to any business dependency, you need to request a change in the planned maintenance schedule, the preferred way would be to create a service request.
Planned maintenance doesn't include emergency fixes/patches required which can't be rescheduled.

## Where do we create an Azure Large Instances-related Service or Support Request?

You can get Help and support in the Azure portal.
It's available from the Azure portal menu, the global header, or the resource menu for a service and create a Service Request.
In the dropdown menu you can look for the Epic key word and then "Azure Large Instances" and select appropriate service type.
