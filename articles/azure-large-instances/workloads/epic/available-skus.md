## Tenant considerations

A complete Azure Large Instances for Epic stamp isn't exclusively allocated for a single customer's use.
This applies to the racks of compute and storage resources connected through a network fabric deployed in Azure as well.
Azure Large Instances, like Azure, deploys different customer "tenants" that are isolated from one another in the following three levels.

### Network

Isolation through virtual networks within the Azure Large Instances stamp for Epic.

### Storage

Isolation through storage virtual machines that have storage volumes assigned and isolate storage volumes between tenants.

### Compute 

Dedicated assignment of server units to a single tenant.
No hard or soft partitioning of server units.
No sharing of a single server or host unit between tenants.

The deployments of Azure Large Instances units for Epic between different tenants aren't visible to each other.
Azure Large Instances units for Epic deployed in different tenants can't communicate directly with each other on the Azure Large Instances for Epic stamp level. Only Azure Large Instances units for Epic within one tenant can communicate with each other on the Azure Large Instances for Epic stamp level.

A deployed tenant in the Azure Large Instances stamp is assigned to one Azure subscription for billing purposes. For a network, it can be accessed from virtual networks of other Azure subscriptions within the same Azure enrollment.
If you deploy with another Azure subscription in the same Azure region, you also request for a separated Azure Large Instances tenant.

### Operational model
In addition to its BareMetal offering, Azure Large Instances also has an offering where Microsoft deploys a foundational ESXi environment onto the host servers and subsequent configuration of VMware vCenter Server by Microsoft as an ESXi VM in the vSphere cluster. Microsoft owns the ESXi licenses. On the storage configurations, Azure Large Instances comes with highly redundant Fiber Channel storage provisioned. Microsoft retains the root administrator access to ESXi and provides a cloud administrator role for customer’s use. The Cloud Admin role in Azure Large Instances Solution has the following privileges on vCenter Server. 

The following table color-codes areas of management responsibility, where:

* Microsoft = blue
* Customer/tenant = gray
* Not applicable = black
