# High-performance computing (HPC) performance and benchmarking applications

[High-performance computing (HPC)](/azure/architecture/topics/high-performance-computing), also called *big compute*, solves complex mathematical tasks using a large number of CPU or GPU-based computers. Many industries use HPC to solve some of their most difficult problems, including genomics, semiconductor design, and weather modeling.

## Run HPC applications on Azure VMs

The articles listed here describe the steps for running various HPC applications on Azure virtual machines. They also show the performance results achieved when running each application on Azure.
