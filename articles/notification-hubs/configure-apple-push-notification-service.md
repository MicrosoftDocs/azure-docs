# Configure Apple Push Notification Service settings for a notification hub in the Azure portal

This article shows you how to configure Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) settings for an Azure notification hub by using the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't already created a notification hub, create one now. For more information, see [Create an Azure notification hub in the Azure portal](create-notification-hub-portal.md).

## Configure Apple Push Notification Service

The following procedure gives you steps to configure Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) settings for a notification hub:

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Notification Hub** page, select **Apple (APNS)** on the left menu.

1. For **Authentication Mode**, select either **Certificate** or **Token**.

   - If you select **Certificate**:
      - Select the file icon, and then select the *.p12* file you want to upload.
      - Enter a password.
      - Select **Sandbox** mode. Or, to send push notifications to users who purchased your app from the store, select **Production** mode.
