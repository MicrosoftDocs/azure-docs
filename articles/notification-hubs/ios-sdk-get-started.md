# Tutorial: Set up your iOS app to work with Azure Notification Hubs

This tutorial shows you how to set up Azure Notification Hubs and configure credentials to push notifications to an iOS device via the [Apple Push Notification service (APNS)](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH8-SW1). 

Running this tutorial is a prerequisite to the subsequent Objective C and Swift iOS tutorials, and covers the following steps:

- Generate the certificate signing request file.
- Request your app for push notifications.
- Create a provisioning profile for the app.
- Create a notification hub.
- Configure the notification hub with APNS information.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you must have an active Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

You'll also need the following:

- An active [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/) account.
- A Mac running [Xcode](https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=266532), along with a valid developer certificate installed into your Keychain.
- An iPhone or iPad running iOS version 10 or later.
- Your physical device registered in the [Apple Portal](https://developer.apple.com/) and associated with your certificate.

Be sure to read the [Azure Notification Hubs overview](notification-hubs-push-notification-overview.md) if you're not familiar with the service.

> [!NOTE]
> The notification hub will be configured to use the Sandbox authentication mode only. You should not use this authentication mode for production workloads.

## Generate the certificate-signing request file

The Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) uses certificates to authenticate your push notifications. Follow these instructions to create the necessary push certificate to send and receive notifications. For more information on these concepts, see the official [Apple Push Notification Service](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html) documentation.

Generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file, which Apple uses to generate a signed push certificate:

1. On your Mac, run the Keychain Access tool. It can be opened from the **Utilities** folder or the **Other** folder on the Launchpad.

2. Select **Keychain Access**, expand **Certificate Assistant**, and then select **Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > By default, Keychain Access selects the first item in the list. This can be a problem if you're in the **Certificates** category and **Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority** is not the first item in the list. Make sure you have a non-key item, or the **Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority** key is selected, before generating the CSR (Certificate Signing Request).

1. Select your **User Email Address**, enter your **Common Name** value, make sure that you specify **Saved to disk**, and then select **Continue**. Leave **CA Email Address** blank as it isn't required.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image2.png" alt-text="Screen shot of user interface displayed when selecting Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority under Certificate Assistant.":::
   
1. Enter a name for the CSR file in **Save As**, select the location in **Where**, and then select **Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image3.png" alt-text="Screen shot of dialog displayed when Saved to disk option is selected.":::
   
      This action saves the CSR file in the selected location. The default location is **Desktop**. Remember the location chosen for the file.

Next, register your app with Apple, enable push notifications, and upload the exported CSR to create a push certificate.

## Register your app for push notifications

To send push notifications to an iOS app, register your application with
Apple, and also register for push notifications.

1. If you haven't already registered your app, browse to the [iOS Provisioning Portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=272456) at the Apple Developer Center. Sign in to the portal with your Apple ID, and select **Identifiers**. Then select **+** to register a new app.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image4.png" alt-text="App IDs page":::

2. On the **Register a New Identifier** screen, select the **App IDs** radio button. Then select **Continue**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image5.png" alt-text="Register new ID page":::

3. Update the following three values for your new app, and then select **Continue**:

   - **Description**: Type a descriptive name for your app.
   - **Bundle ID**: Enter a Bundle ID of the form **Organization Identifier.Product Name** as mentioned in the [App Distribution Guide](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev91fe7130a). The **Organization Identifier** and **Product Name** values must match the organization identifier and product name you use when you create your Xcode project. In the following screenshot, the **NotificationHubs** value is used as an organization identifier and the **GetStarted** value is used as the product name. Make sure the **Bundle Identifier** value matches the value in your Xcode project, so that Xcode uses the correct publishing profile.

   - **Push Notifications**: Check the **Push Notifications** option in the **Capabilities** section.

      :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image7.png" alt-text="Register new app ID":::

      This action generates your App ID and requests that you confirm the information. Select **Continue**, then select **Register** to confirm the new App ID.

      :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image8.png" alt-text="Confirm new App ID":::

      After you select **Register**, you see the new App ID as a line item on the **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** page.

4. In the **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** page, under **Identifiers**, locate the App ID line item that you just created, and select its row to display the **Edit your App ID Configuration** screen.

## Create a certificate for Notification Hubs

> [!NOTE]
> With the release of iOS 13, you can only receive silent notifications using token based authentication. If you are using certificate-based authentication for your APNS credentials, you must switch to using [token-based authentication](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_token-based_connection_to_apns).

A certificate is required to enable the notification hub to work with **APNS**. This can be done in one of two ways:

- Create a **.p12** file that can be uploaded directly to Notification Hubs.

- Create a **.p8** file that can be used for [token-based authentication](notification-hubs-push-notification-http2-token-authentication.md) (the newer approach).

The second option has a number of benefits compared to using certificates, as documented in [Token-based (HTTP/2) authentication for APNS](notification-hubs-push-notification-http2-token-authentication.md). However, steps are provided for both approaches.

### Option 1: Create a .p12 push certificate that can be uploaded directly to Notification Hubs

1. Scroll down to the checked **Push Notifications** option, and then select **Configure** to create the certificate.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image9.png" alt-text="App ID":::

2. The **Apple Push Notification service SSL Certificates** window appears. Select the **Create Certificate** button in the **Development SSL Certificate** section.

   The **Create a new Certificate** screen is displayed.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This tutorial uses a development certificate. The same process is used when registering a production certificate. Make sure that you use the same certificate type when sending notifications.

3. Select **Choose File**, browse to the location at which you saved the CSR file from the first task, and then double-click the certificate name to load it. Then select **Continue**.

4. After the portal creates the certificate, select the **Download** button. Save the certificate, and remember the location to which it's saved.

   The certificate is downloaded and saved in your **Downloads** folder:

   :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image12.png" alt-text="Locate certificate file":::

   By default, the downloaded development certificate is named **aps_development.cer**.

5. Double-click the downloaded push certificate **aps\_development.cer**. This action installs the new certificate in the Keychain.

6. In Keychain Access, right-click the new push certificate that you created in the **Certificates** category. Select **Export**, name the file, select the **.p12** format, and then select **Save**.

   You can choose to protect the certificate with a password, but this is optional. Click **OK** if you want to bypass password creation. Make a note of the file name and location of the exported .p12 certificate. They are used to enable authentication with APNS.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Your .p12 file name and location might be different than what is pictured in this tutorial.

### Option 2: Create a .p8 certificate that can be used for token-based authentication

1. Make note of the following details:

   - **App ID Prefix** (this is a **Team ID**)
   - **Bundle ID**

2. Back in **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**, click **Keys**. If you already have a key configured for **APNS**, you can re-use the .p8 certificate that you downloaded right after it was created. If so, you can ignore steps 3 through 5.

3. Click the **+** button (or the **Create a key** button) to create a new key.

4. Provide a suitable **Key Name** value, check the **Apple Push Notifications service (APNS)** option, and then click **Continue**, followed by **Register** on the next screen.

5. Click **Download** and then move the **.p8** file (prefixed with `AuthKey_`) to a secure local directory, then click **Done**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Be sure to keep your .p8 file in a secure place (and save a backup). After downloading your key, it cannot be re-downloaded; the server copy is removed.

6. On **Keys**, click on the key that you just created (or an existing key if you have chosen to use that instead).

7. Make note of the **Key ID** value.

8. Open your .p8 certificate in a suitable application of your choice, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), then make note of the key value. This is the value between **-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----** and **-----END PRIVATE KEY-----** .

   ```p8
   -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
   <key_value>
   -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
   ```

   This is the token value that will be used later to configure Notification Hubs.

At the end of these steps you should have the following information for
use later in [Configure your notification hub with APNS information](#configure-the-notification-hub-with-apns-information):

- **Team ID** (see step 1)
- **Bundle ID** (see step 1)
- **Key ID** (see step 7)
- **Token value** (the .p8 key value, see step 8)

## Create a provisioning profile

1. Return to the [iOS Provisioning Portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=272456), select **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**, select **Profiles** from the left menu, and then select **+** to create a new profile. The **Register a New Provisioning Profile** screen appears.

2. Select **iOS App Development** under **Development** as the provisioning profile type, and then select **Continue**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image15.png" alt-text="Provisioning profile list":::

3. Next, select the app ID you created from the **App ID** drop-down list, then select **Continue**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image16.png" alt-text="Select App ID":::

4. In the **Select certificates** window, select the development certificate that you use for code signing, and select **Continue**. This certificate isn't the push certificate you created. If one does not exist, you must create it. If a certificate does exist, skip to the next step. To create a development certificate if one does not exist:

   1. If you see **No Certificates are available**, select **Create Certificate**.
   2. In the **Software** section, select **Apple Development**. Then select **Continue**.
   3. In the **Create a New Certificate** screen, select **Choose File**.
   4. Browse to the **Certificate Signing Request** certificate you created earlier, select it, and then select **Open**.
   5. Select **Continue**.
   6. Download the development certificate, and remember the location in which it's saved.

5. Return to the **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** page, select **Profiles** from the left menu, and then select **+** to create a new profile. The **Register a New Provisioning Profile** screen appears.

6. In the **Select certificates** window, select the development certificate that you just created. Then select **Continue**.

7. Next, select the devices to use for testing, and select **Continue**.

8. Finally, choose a name for the profile in **Provisioning Profile Name**, then select **Generate**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image17.png" alt-text="Choose provisioning profile name":::

9. When the new provisioning profile is created, select **Download**. Remember the location in which it's saved.

10. Browse to the location of the provisioning profile, and then double-click it to install it on your Xcode development machine.

## Create a notification hub

In this section, you create a notification hub and configure authentication with APNS by using either the .p12 push certificate or token-based authentication. If you want to use a notification hub that you've already created, you can skip to step 5.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Select **All services** on the left menu, and then select **Notification Hubs** in the **Mobile** section. Select the star icon next to the service name to add the service to the **FAVORITES** section on the left menu. After you add **Notification Hubs** to **FAVORITES**, select it.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image18.png" alt-text="Azure portal":::

3. On the **Notification Hubs** page, select **Add** on the toolbar.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image19.png" alt-text="Add toolbar button":::

4. On the **Notification Hubs** page, do the following steps:

   1. Enter a name in **Notification Hub**.
   2. Enter a name in **Create a new namespace**. A namespace contains one or more notification hubs.
   3. Select a value from the **Location** drop-down list. This value specifies the location in which you want to create the notification hub.
   4. Select an existing resource group in **Resource Group**, or create a new resource group.
   5. Select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image20.png" alt-text="Set properties":::

5. Select **Notifications** (the bell icon), and then select **Go to resource**. You can also refresh the list on the **Notification Hubs** page and select your hub.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image21.png" alt-text="Portal notifications":::

6. Select **Access Policies** from the list. Note that the two connection strings are available to you. You'll need them later to handle push notifications.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Do not use the **DefaultFullSharedAccessSignature** policy in your application. This is meant to be used in your back end only.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image22.png" alt-text="Connection strings":::

## Configure the notification hub with APNS information

Under **Notification Services**, select **Apple (APNS)**, then follow the appropriate steps based on the approach you chose previously in the [Creating a Certificate for Notification Hubs](#create-a-certificate-for-notification-hubs) section.

> [!NOTE]
> Use **Production** for **Application Mode** only if you want to send push notifications to users who purchased your app from the store.

### Option 1: Use a .p12 push certificate

1. Select **Certificate**.

2. Select the file icon.

3. Select the .p12 file that you exported earlier, and then select **Open**.

4. If required, specify the correct password.

5. Select **Sandbox** mode.

   :::image type="content" source="media/ios-sdk-get-started/image23.png" alt-text="Configure":::

6. Select **Save**.

### Option 2: Use token-based authentication

1. Select **Token**.

2. Enter the following values that you acquired earlier:

   - **Key ID**
   - **Bundle ID**
   - **Team ID**
   - **Token**

3. Choose **Sandbox**

4. Select **Save**.

You've now configured your notification hub with APNS. You also have the connection strings needed to register your app and send push notifications.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created and configured a notification hub in Azure and configured it to allow notifications to be sent to your application through Apple Push Notification Service (APNS). Next, we'll create a sample iOS application and integrate the Azure Notifications Hubs SDK so that it can receive push notifications sent through the Azure portal. Advance to the following tutorial based on your language of choice:
