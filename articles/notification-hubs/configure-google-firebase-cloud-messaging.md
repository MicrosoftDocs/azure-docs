# Configure Google Firebase settings for a notification hub in the Azure portal

This article shows you how to configure Google Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) settings for an Azure notification hub using the Azure portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of June 2024, FCM legacy APIs will no longer be supported and will be retired. To avoid any disruption in your push notification service, you must [migrate to the FCM v1 protocol](notification-hubs-gcm-to-fcm.md) as soon as possible.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't already created a notification hub, create one now. For more information, see [Create an Azure notification hub in the Azure portal](create-notification-hub-portal.md).

## Configure Google Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

The following procedure describes the steps to configure Google Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) settings for a notification hub:

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Notification Hub** page, select **Google (GCM/FCM)** on the left menu.
2. Paste the **API Key** for the FCM project that you saved earlier.
3. Select **Save**.
