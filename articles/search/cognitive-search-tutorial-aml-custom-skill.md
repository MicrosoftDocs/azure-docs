Introductory paragraph.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Prerequisites

- First prerequisite
- Second prerequisite
- Third prerequisite

## Procedure 1

<!---Required:
Tutorials are prescriptive and guide the customer through an end-to-end
procedure. Make sure to use specific naming for setting up accounts and
configuring technology.
Don't link off to other content - include whatever the customer needs to
complete the scenario in the article. For example, if the customer needs
to set permissions, include the permissions they need to set, and the
specific settings in the tutorial procedure. Don't send the customer to
another article to read about it.
In a break from tradition, do not link to reference topics in the
procedural part of the tutorial when using cmdlets or code. Provide customers what they need to know in the tutorial to successfully complete
the tutorial.
For portal-based procedures, minimize bullets and numbering.
For the CLI or PowerShell based procedures, don't use bullets or
numbering.
--->

Include a sentence or two to explain only what is needed to complete the
procedure.

1. Step 1 of the procedure
1. Step 2 of the procedure
1. Step 3 of the procedure
   ![Browser](media/contribute-how-to-mvc-tutorial/browser.png)
   <!---Use screenshots but be judicious to maintain a reasonable length. 
   Make sure screenshots align to the
   [current standards](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/contribute-how-to-create-screenshot?branch=master).
   If users access your product/service via a web browser the first 
   screenshot should always include the full browser window in Chrome or
   Safari. This is to show users that the portal is browser-based - OS 
   and browser agnostic.--->
1. Step 4 of the procedure

## Procedure 2

Include a sentence or two to explain only what is needed to complete the procedure.

1. Step 1 of the procedure
1. Step 2 of the procedure
1. Step 3 of the procedure

## Procedure 3

Include a sentence or two to explain only what is needed to complete the
procedure.
<!---Code requires specific formatting. Here are a few useful examples of
commonly used code blocks. Make sure to use the interactive functionality
where possible.

For the CLI or PowerShell based procedures, don't use bullets or
numbering.
--->

Here is an example of a code block for Java:

```java
cluster = Cluster.build(new File("src/remote.yaml")).create();
...
client = cluster.connect();
```

or a code block for Azure CLI:

```azurecli-interactive 
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --image win2016datacenter --admin-username azureuser --admin-password myPassword12
```

or a code block for Azure PowerShell:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmContainerGroup -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name mycontainer -Image microsoft/iis:nanoserver -OsType Windows -IpAddressType Public
```


## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this application, delete
<resources> with the following steps:

1. From the left-hand menu...
2. ...click Delete, type...and then click Delete

<!---Required:
To avoid any costs associated with following the tutorial procedure, a
Clean up resources (H2) should come just before Next steps (H2)
--->

## Next steps

Advance to the next article to learn how to create...
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Next steps button](contribute-get-started-mvc.md)

<!--- Required:
Tutorials should always have a Next steps H2 that points to the next
logical tutorial in a series, or, if there are no other tutorials, to
some other cool thing the customer can do. A single link in the blue box
format should direct the customer to the next article - and you can
shorten the title in the boxes if the original one doesn’t fit.
Do not use a "More info section" or a "Resources section" or a "See also
section". --->
