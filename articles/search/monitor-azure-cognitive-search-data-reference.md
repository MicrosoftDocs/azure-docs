# Azure AI Search monitoring data reference

This article provides a reference of log and metric data collected to analyze the performance and availability of Azure AI Search. See [Monitoring Azure AI Search](monitor-azure-cognitive-search.md) for an overview.

## Metrics

This section lists the platform metrics collected for Azure AI Search ([Microsoft.Search/searchServices](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md#microsoftsearchsearchservices)).  

| Metric ID | Unit | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| DocumentsProcessedCount | Count | Total of the number of documents successfully processed in an indexing operation (either by an indexer or by pushing documents directly). |
| SearchLatency | Seconds | Average search latency for queries that execute on the search service. |
| SearchQueriesPerSecond | CountPerSecond | Average of the search queries per second (QPS) for the search service. It's common for queries to execute in milliseconds, so only queries that measure as seconds will appear in a metric like QPS. </br>The minimum is the lowest value for search queries per second that was registered during that minute. The same applies to the maximum value. Average is the aggregate across the entire minute. For example, within one minute, you might have a pattern like this: one second of high load that is the maximum for SearchQueriesPerSecond, followed by 58 seconds of average load, and finally one second with only one query, which is the minimum.|
| SkillExecutionCount | Count | Total number of skill executions processed during an indexer operation. |
| ThrottledSearchQueriesPercentage | Percent | Average percentage of the search queries that were throttled from the total number of search queries that executed during a one-minute interval.|

For reference, see a list of [all platform metrics supported in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported).

## Metric dimensions

Dimensions of a metric are name/value pairs that carry additional data to describe the metric value. Azure AI Search has the following dimensions associated with its metrics that capture a count of documents or skills that were executed ("Document processed count" and "Skill execution invocation count").

| Dimension Name | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| **DataSourceName** | A named data source connection used during indexer execution. Valid values are one of the [supported data source types](search-indexer-overview.md#supported-data-sources). |
| **Failed** | Indicates whether the instance failed. |
| **IndexerName** | Name of an indexer.|
| **IndexName** | Name of an index.|
| **SkillsetName** | Name of a skillset used during indexer execution. |
| **SkillName** | Name of a skill within a skillset. |
| **SkillType** | The @odata.type of the skill. |

For more information on what metric dimensions are, see [Multi-dimensional metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-platform-metrics#multi-dimensional-metrics).

## Resource logs

[Resource logs](../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs.md) are platform logs that provide insight into operations that were performed within an Azure resource. Resource logs are generated by the search service automatically, but are not collected by default. You must create a diagnostic setting to send resource logs to a Log Analytics workspace to use with Azure Monitor Logs, Azure Event Hubs to forward outside of Azure, or to Azure Storage for archiving.

This section identifies the type (or category) of resource logs you can collect for Azure AI Search:

+ Resource logs are grouped by type (or category). Azure AI Search generates resource logs under the [**Operations category**](../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-categories.md#microsoftsearchsearchservices).

For reference, see a list of [all resource logs category types supported in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs-schema).

## Azure Monitor Logs tables

[Azure Monitor Logs](../azure-monitor/logs/data-platform-logs.md) is a feature of Azure Monitor that collects and organizes log and performance data from monitored resources. If you configured a diagnostic setting for Log Analytics, you can query the Azure Monitor Logs tables for the resource logs generated by Azure AI Search.

This section refers to all of the Azure Monitor Logs Kusto tables relevant to Azure AI Search and available for query by Log Analytics and Metrics Explorer in the Azure portal.

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [AzureActivity](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azureactivity) | Entries from the Azure Activity log that provide insight into control plane operations. Tasks invoked on the control plane, such as adding or removing replicas and partitions, will be represented through a "Get Admin Key" activity. |
| [AzureDiagnostics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics) | Logged query and indexing operations.|
| [AzureMetrics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azuremetrics) | Metric data emitted by Azure AI Search that measures health and performance. |

For a reference of all Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics tables, see the [Azure Monitor Log Table Reference](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/tables-resourcetype#search-services).

### Diagnostics tables

Azure AI Search uses the [**Azure Diagnostics**](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics) table to collect resource logs related to queries and indexing on your search service.

Queries against this table in Log Analytics can include the common properties, the [search-specific properties](#resource-log-search-props), and the [search-specific operations](#resource-log-search-ops) listed in the schema reference section.

For examples of Kusto queries useful for Azure AI Search, see [Monitoring Azure AI Search](monitor-azure-cognitive-search.md) and [Analyze performance in Azure AI Search](search-performance-analysis.md).

## Activity logs

The following table lists common operations related to Azure AI Search that may be created in the Azure Activity log.

| Operation | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| Get Admin Key | Any operation that requires administrative rights will be logged as a "Get Admin Key" operation.  |
| Get Query Key | Any read-only operation against the documents collection of an index.  |
| Regenerate Admin Key | A request to regenerate either the primary or secondary admin API key. |

Common entries include references to API keys - generic informational notifications like *Get Admin Key* and *Get Query keys*. These activities indicate requests that were made using the admin key (create or delete objects) or query key, but do not show the request itself. For information of this grain, you must configure resource logging. 

Alternatively, you might gain some insight through change history. In Azure portal, select the activity to open the detail page and then select "Change history" for information about the underlying operation.

For more information on the schema of Activity Log entries, see [Activity  Log schema](../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-schema.md).

## Schemas

The following schemas are in use by Azure AI Search. If you are building queries or custom reports, the data structures that contain Azure AI Search resource logs conform to the schema below.

For resource logs sent to blob storage, each blob has one root object called **records** containing an array of log objects. Each blob contains records for all the operations that took place during the same hour.

<a name="resource-log-schema"></a>

### Resource log schema

All resource logs available through Azure Monitor share a [common top-level schema](../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema.md#top-level-common-schema). Azure AI Search supplements with [additional properties](#resource-log-search-props) and [operations](#resource-log-search-ops) that are unique to a search service.

The following example illustrates a resource log that includes common properties (TimeGenerated, Resource, Category, and so forth) and search-specific properties (OperationName and OperationVersion).

| Name | Type | Description and example |
| ---- | ---- | ----------------------- |
| TimeGenerated | Datetime | Timestamp of the operation. For example: `2021-12-07T00:00:43.6872559Z` |
| Resource | String | Resource ID. For example: `/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<your-resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/<your-search-service-name>` |
| Category | String | "OperationLogs". This value is a constant. OperationLogs is the only category used for resource logs. |
| OperationName | String |  The name of the operation (see the [full list of operations](#resource-log-search-ops) below). An example is `Query.Search` |
| OperationVersion | String | The api-version used on the request. For example: `2020-06-30` |
| ResultType | String |"Success". Other possible values: Success or Failure |
| ResultSignature | Int | An HTTP result code. For example: `200` |
| DurationMS | Int | Duration of the operation in milliseconds. |
| Properties |Object | Object containing operation-specific data. See the following properties schema table.|

<a name="resource-log-search-props"></a>
