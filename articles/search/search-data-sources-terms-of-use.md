# Terms of Use: Partner data sources

The use of [partner data source connectors](search-data-sources-gallery.md#data-sources-from-our-partners) may be subject to third-party terms and conditions. Microsoft isn't a party to your agreement(s) with third parties. Any concerns or questions about third-party terms or services should be directed to the third party. You're responsible for the indexing of data into your Azure tenant, as the data controller for your data.

Microsoft makes no representation, warranty, or guarantee in relation to the third-party data prior to indexing into your Azure tenant. Microsoft assumes no liability for errors that may occur during the indexing of third-party data. You agree that any data sourced from a third-party provider is provided "as is," and with respect to the index, is provided subject to your configuration. Indexed data in your Azure tenant will be considered "Customer Data" for purposes of the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=31), [Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement), and Microsoft's other data obligations.

For more information on how we use Customer Data in Azure, see the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=31) and [Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement). You can also find out more about Microsoft's commitments to data protection and privacy by visiting our [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center).
