# Azure Resource Manager resource provider operations

This article lists the operations available for each Azure Resource Manager resource provider. These operations can be used in [Azure custom roles](custom-roles.md) to provide granular access control to resources in Azure. Operation strings have the following format: `{Company}.{ProviderName}/{resourceType}/{action}`. For a list of how resource provider namespaces map to Azure services, see [Match resource provider to service](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers.md).

The resource provider operations are always evolving. To get the latest operations, use [Get-AzProviderOperation](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azprovideroperation) or [az provider operation list](/cli/azure/provider/operation#az-provider-operation-list).
