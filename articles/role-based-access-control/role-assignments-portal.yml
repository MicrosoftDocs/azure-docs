      Step 5: (Optional) Add condition
    summary: |
      If you selected a role that supports conditions, a **Conditions** tab will appear and you have the option to add a condition to your role assignment. A [condition](conditions-overview.md) is an additional check that you can optionally add to your role assignment to provide more fine-grained access control.

      The **Conditions** tab will look different depending on the role you selected.
    
      ### Delegate condition

      If you selected one of the following privileged roles, follow the steps in this section.

      - [Owner](built-in-roles.md#owner)
      - [Role Based Access Control Administrator](built-in-roles.md#role-based-access-control-administrator)
      - [User Access Administrator](built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator)

      1. On the **Conditions** tab under **What user can do**, select the **Allow user to only assign selected roles to selected principals (fewer privileges)** option.

          :::image type="content" source="./media/shared/condition-constrained.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Add role assignment with the Constrained option selected." lightbox="./media/shared/condition-constrained.png":::

      1. Click **Select roles and principals** to add a condition that constrains the roles and principals this user can assign roles to.

      1. Follow the steps in [Delegate Azure role assignment management to others with conditions](delegate-role-assignments-portal.md#step-3-add-a-condition).

      ### Storage condition

      If you selected one of the following storage roles, follow the steps in this section.

      - [Storage Blob Data Contributor](built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-contributor)
      - [Storage Blob Data Owner](built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-owner)
      - [Storage Blob Data Reader](built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-reader)
      - [Storage Queue Data Contributor](built-in-roles.md#storage-queue-data-contributor)
      - [Storage Queue Data Message Processor](built-in-roles.md#storage-queue-data-message-processor)
      - [Storage Queue Data Message Sender](built-in-roles.md#storage-queue-data-message-sender)
      - [Storage Queue Data Reader](built-in-roles.md#storage-queue-data-reader)
    steps: 
      - |
        Click **Add condition** if you want to further refine the role assignments based on storage attributes.

      Step 6: Select assignment type
    summary: |
      If you have a Microsoft Entra ID P2 or Microsoft Entra ID Governance license, an **Assignment type** tab will appear for management group, subscription, and resource group scopes. Use eligible assignments to provide just-in-time access to a role. Users with eligible and/or time-bound assignments must have a valid license.
      
      If you don't want to use the PIM functionality, select the **Active** assignment type and **Permanent** assignment duration options. These settings create a role assignment where the principal always has permissions in the role.

       This capability is being deployed in stages, so it might not be available yet in your tenant or your interface might look different. For more information, see [Eligible and time-bound role assignments in Azure RBAC](././pim-integration.md).
    steps:
      - |
        On the **Assignment type** tab, select the **Assignment type**.

        - **Eligible** - User must perform one or more actions to use the role, such as perform a multifactor authentication check, provide a business justification, or request approval from designated approvers. You can't create eligible role assignments for applications, service principals, or managed identities because they can't perform the activation steps.
        - **Active** -  User doesn't have to perform any action to use the role.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/shared/assignment-type-eligible.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Add role assignment with Assignment type options displayed." lightbox="./media/shared/assignment-type-eligible.png":::

      - |
        Depending on your settings, for **Assignment duration**, select **Permanent** or **Time bound**.

        Select permanent if you want member to always be allowed to activate or use role. Select time bound to specify start and end dates. This option might be disabled if permanent assignments creation is not allowed by PIM policy.

      - |
        If **Time bound** is selected, set **Start date and time** and **Start date and time** to specify when user is allowed to activate or use role.

        It's possible to set the start date in the future. The maximum allowed eligible duration depends on your Privileged Identity Management (PIM) policy.

      - |
        (Optional) Use **Configure PIM Policy** to configure expiration options, role activation requirements (approval, multifactor authentication, or Conditional Access authentication context), and other settings.

        When you select the **Update PIM policy** link, a PIM page is displayed. Select **Settings** to configure PIM policy for for roles. For more information, see [Configure Azure resource role settings in Privileged Identity Management](/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-resource-roles-configure-role-settings).

      - |
        Click **Next**.
