  Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal
introduction: |
  [!INCLUDE [Azure RBAC definition grant access](../../includes/role-based-access-control/definition-grant.md)] This article describes how to assign roles using the Azure portal.

  If you need to assign administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID, see [Assign Microsoft Entra roles to users](../active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal.md).

      Step 1: Identify the needed scope
    summary: |
      [!INCLUDE [Scope for Azure RBAC introduction](../../includes/role-based-access-control/scope-intro.md)] For more information, see [Understand scope](scope-overview.md).

      ![Diagram that shows the scope levels for Azure RBAC.](../../includes/role-based-access-control/media/scope-levels.png)
    steps: 
      - |
        Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
      - |
        In the Search box at the top, search for the scope you want to grant access to. For example, search for **Management groups**, **Subscriptions**, **Resource groups**, or a specific resource.
      - |
        Click the specific resource for that scope.

          The following shows an example resource group.

      Step 2: Open the Add role assignment page
    summary: |
      **Access control (IAM)** is the page that you typically use to assign roles to grant access to Azure resources. It's also known as identity and access management (IAM) and appears in several locations in the Azure portal.
    steps: 
      - |
        Click **Access control (IAM)**.

          The following shows an example of the Access control (IAM) page for a resource group.

        Click the **Role assignments** tab to view the role assignments at this scope.
      - |
        Click **Add** > **Add role assignment**.

        If you want to assign a privileged administrator role, select the **Privileged administrator roles** tab to select the role.

          For best practices when using privileged administrator role assignments, see [Best practices for Azure RBAC](best-practices.md#limit-privileged-administrator-role-assignments).

      - |
        Click **Select members**.
      - |

      Step 5: (Optional) Add condition
    summary: |
      If you selected a role that supports conditions, a **Conditions** tab will appear and you have the option to add a condition to your role assignment. A [condition](conditions-overview.md) is an additional check that you can optionally add to your role assignment to provide more fine-grained access control.

      The **Conditions** tab will look different depending on the role you selected.
    
      ### Delegate condition

      If you selected one of the following privileged roles, follow the steps in this section.

      - [Owner](built-in-roles.md#owner)
      - [Role Based Access Control Administrator](built-in-roles.md#role-based-access-control-administrator)
      - [User Access Administrator](built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator)

      1. On the **Conditions** tab under **What user can do**, select the **Allow user to only assign selected roles to selected principals (fewer privileges)** option.

          :::image type="content" source="./media/shared/condition-constrained.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Add role assignment with the Constrained option selected." lightbox="./media/shared/condition-constrained.png":::

      1. Click **Select roles and principals** to add a condition that constrains the roles and principals this user can assign roles to.

      1. Follow the steps in [Delegate Azure role assignment management to others with conditions](delegate-role-assignments-portal.md#step-3-add-a-condition).

      ### Storage condition

      If you selected one of the following storage roles, follow the steps in this section.

      - [Storage Blob Data Contributor](built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-contributor)
      - [Storage Blob Data Owner](built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-owner)
      - [Storage Blob Data Reader](built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-reader)
      - [Storage Queue Data Contributor](built-in-roles.md#storage-queue-data-contributor)
      - [Storage Queue Data Message Processor](built-in-roles.md#storage-queue-data-message-processor)
      - [Storage Queue Data Message Sender](built-in-roles.md#storage-queue-data-message-sender)
      - [Storage Queue Data Reader](built-in-roles.md#storage-queue-data-reader)
    steps: 
      - |
        Click **Add condition** if you want to further refine the role assignments based on storage attributes.

          ![Screenshot of Add role assignment page with Add condition tab.](./media/shared/condition.png)

      Step 6: Select assignment type (Preview)
    summary: |
      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Azure role assignment integration with Privileged Identity Management is currently in PREVIEW.
      > See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

      If you have a Microsoft Entra ID P2 or Microsoft Entra ID Governance license, an **Assignment type** tab will appear for management group, subscription, and resource group scopes. Use eligible assignments to provide just-in-time access to a role. This capability is being deployed in stages, so it might not be available yet in your tenant or your interface might look different. For more information, see [Integration with Privileged Identity Management (Preview)](./role-assignments.md#integration-with-privileged-identity-management-preview).
    steps:
      - |
        On the **Assignment type** tab, select the **Assignment type**.

        - **Eligible** - User must perform one or more actions to use the role, such as perform a multifactor authentication check, provide a business justification, or request approval from designated approvers. You can't create eligible role assignments for applications, service principals, or managed identities because they can't perform the activation steps.
        - **Active** -  User doesn't have to perform any action to use the role.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/shared/assignment-type-eligible.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Add role assignment with Assignment type options displayed." lightbox="./media/shared/assignment-type-eligible.png":::

      - |
        Depending on your settings, for **Assignment duration**, select **Permanent** or **Time bound**.

        Select permanent if you want member to always be allowed to activate or use role. Select time bound to specify start and end dates. This option might be disabled if permanent assignments creation is not allowed by PIM policy.

      - |
        If **Time bound** is selected, set **Start date and time** and **Start date and time** to specify when user is allowed to activate or use role.

        It's possible to set the start date in the future. The maximum allowed eligible duration depends on your Privileged Identity Management (PIM) policy.

      - |
        (Optional) Use **Configure PIM Policy** to configure expiration options, role activation requirements (approval, multifactor authentication, or Conditional Access authentication context), and other settings.

        When you select the **Update PIM policy** link, a PIM page is displayed. Select **Settings** to configure PIM policy for for roles. For more information, see [Configure Azure resource role settings in Privileged Identity Management](/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-resource-roles-configure-role-settings).

      - |
        Click **Next**.
