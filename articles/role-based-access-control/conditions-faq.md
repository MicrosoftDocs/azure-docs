# FAQ for Azure role assignment conditions

## Frequently asked questions

**Can you pick the storage container names or blob path in the visual ABAC condition builder in the Azure portal?**

You must write the storage container name, blob path, tag name, or values in the condition. There is no picking experience for the attribute values.

**Can you check for the existence of an attribute from a condition?**

You can use the `Exists` operator with any ABAC attribute, but it is only supported in the visual ABAC condition builder for a few of them. You can add the `Exists` operator to any attribute using other tools, such as [PowerShell](conditions-role-assignments-powershell.md), the [Azure CLI](conditions-role-assignments-cli.md), the [REST API](conditions-role-assignments-rest.md), and the condition code editor in the Azure portal. For a list of attributes for which it is supported in the visual condition builder, see [the *Exists* function operator](conditions-format.md#exists). To add the exists operator to an attribute when building an expression in a condition, select the supported source and attribute, then select the box next to **Exists** under it. See [Build expressions in the portal](conditions-role-assignments-portal.md#step-5-build-expressions) for more details.

**Can you group expressions?**

If you add three or more expressions for a targeted action, you must define the logical grouping of those expressions in the code editor, Azure PowerShell, or Azure CLI. A logical grouping of `a AND b OR c` can be either `(a AND b) OR c` or `a AND (b OR c )`.

**Are conditions supported via Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (Microsoft Entra PIM) for Azure resources?**

Yes, for specific roles. For more information, see [Assign Azure resource roles in Privileged Identity Management](../active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles.md).

**Are conditions supported for classic administrators?**

No. 

**Can you add conditions to custom role assignments?**

Yes, as long as the custom role includes [actions that support conditions](conditions-format.md#actions).
 
**Do the conditions increase latency for access to storage blobs?**

No, based on our benchmark tests, conditions are not expected to add any user perceivable latency.

**What new properties have been introduced in the role assignment schema to support conditions?**

Here are the new condition properties:

- `condition`: Condition statement built using one or more actions from role definition and attributes.
- `conditionVersion`: A condition version number. Defaults to 2.0 and is the only publicly supported version.

There is also a new description property for role assignments:

- `description`: The description for the role assignment that can be used to describe the condition.

**Is a condition applied to the entire role assignment or specific actions?**

A condition is only applied to the specific targeted actions.

**What are the limits for a condition?**

A condition can be up to 8 KB long.

**What are the limits for a description?**

A description has a recommended maximum of 512 characters.

**Is it possible to create a role assignment with and without a condition, but using the same tuple of security principal, role definition, and scope?**

No, if you try to create this role assignment, an error is displayed.

**Are conditions in role assignments offering an explicit deny effect?**

No, conditions in role assignments do not have an explicit deny effect. Conditions in role assignments filter down access granted in a role assignment, which can result in access not allowed. Explicit deny effect is part of deny assignments.
