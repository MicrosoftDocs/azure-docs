# Azure built-in roles

[Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) has several Azure built-in roles that you can assign to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities. Role assignments are the way you control access to Azure resources. If the built-in roles don't meet the specific needs of your organization, you can create your own [Azure custom roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles). For information about how to assign roles, see [Steps to assign an Azure role](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps).

This article lists the Azure built-in roles. If you are looking for administrator roles for Microsoft Entra ID, see [Microsoft Entra built-in roles](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference).

The following table provides a brief description of each built-in role. Click the role name to see the list of `Actions`, `NotActions`, `DataActions`, and `NotDataActions` for each role. For information about what these actions mean and how they apply to the control and data planes, see [Understand Azure role definitions](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-definitions).
