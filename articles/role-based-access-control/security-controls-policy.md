# Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance controls for Azure RBAC

[Azure Policy](../governance/policy/index.yml) can enforce rules for your Azure resources so that
your infrastructure is compliant with business standards.
[Regulatory Compliance in Azure Policy](../governance/policy/concepts/regulatory-compliance.md)
provides Microsoft created and managed initiative definitions, known as _built-ins_, for the
**compliance domains** and **security controls** related to different compliance standards. This
page lists the **compliance domains** and **security controls** for Azure role-based access control
(Azure RBAC). You can assign the built-ins for a **security control** individually to help make your
Azure resources compliant with the specific standard.
