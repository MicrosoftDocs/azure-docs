  List Azure role assignments using the Azure portal
introduction: |
  [!INCLUDE [Azure RBAC definition list access](../../includes/role-based-access-control/definition-list.md)] This article describes how to list role assignments using the Azure portal.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If your organization has outsourced management functions to a service provider who uses [Azure Lighthouse](/azure/lighthouse/overview), role assignments authorized by that service provider won't be shown here. Similarly, users in the service provider tenant won't see role assignments for users in a customer's tenant, regardless of the role they've been assigned.

    summary: |
      Follow these steps:
    steps:
      - |
        In the Azure portal, click **All services** and then select the scope. For example, you can select **Management groups**, **Subscriptions**, **Resource groups**, or a resource.
      - |

        If you have a Microsoft Entra ID P2 or Microsoft Entra ID Governance license, your **Role assignments** tab is similar to the following screenshot for management group, subscription, and resource group scopes. This capability is being deployed in stages, so it might not be available yet in your tenant or your interface might look different.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/shared/sub-access-control-role-assignments-eligible.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Access control and Active assignments and Eligible assignments tabs." lightbox="./media/shared/sub-access-control-role-assignments-eligible.png":::

        You see a **State** column with one of the following states:

        | State | Description |
        | --- | --- | 
        | Active permanent | A role assignment where a user can always use the role without performing any actions. |
        | Active time-bound | A role assignment where a user can use the role without performing any actions only within start and end dates. |
        | Eligible permanent | A role assignment where a user is always eligible to activate the role. |
        | Eligible time-bound | A role assignment where a user is eligible to activate the role only within start and end dates. |

        It's possible to set the start date in the future.

        If you want to list the start time and end time for role assignments, click **Edit columns** and then select **Start time** and **End time**.

        Notice that some roles are scoped to **This resource** while others are **(Inherited)** from another scope. Access is either assigned specifically to this resource or inherited from an assignment to the parent scope.

      List role assignments for a managed identity
    summary: |
      You can list role assignments for system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities at a particular scope by using the **Access control (IAM)** blade as described earlier. This section describes how to list role assignments for just the managed identity.

      ### System-assigned managed identity
    steps:
      - |
        In the Azure portal, open a system-assigned managed identity.
      - |
        In the left menu, click **Identity**.

        ![Screenshot of system-assigned managed identity.](./media/shared/identity-system-assigned.png)
      - |
        Under **Permissions**, click **Azure role assignments**.

        You see a list of roles assigned to the selected system-assigned managed identity at various scopes such as management group, subscription, resource group, or resource. This list includes all role assignments you have permission to read.

      - |
        To change the subscription, click the **Subscription** list.

        ### User-assigned managed identity

        1. In the Azure portal, open a user-assigned managed identity.

        1. Click **Azure role assignments**.

            You see a list of roles assigned to the selected user-assigned managed identity at various scopes such as management group, subscription, resource group, or resource. This list includes all role assignments you have permission to read.

            ![Screenshot of role assignments for a user-assigned managed identity.](./media/shared/role-assignments-user-assigned.png)

        1. To change the subscription, click the **Subscription** list.
  - title: | 
      List number of role assignments
    summary: |
        You can have up to **4000** role assignments in each subscription. This limit includes role assignments at the subscription, resource group, and resource scopes. [Eligible role assignments](./role-assignments-portal.yml#step-6-select-assignment-type) and role assignments scheduled in the future do not count towards this limit. To help you keep track of this limit, the **Role assignments** tab includes a chart that lists the number of role assignments for the current subscription.

        ![Screenshot of Access control and number of role assignments chart.](./media/role-assignments-list-portal/access-control-role-assignments-chart.png)

        If you are getting close to the maximum number and you try to add more role assignments, you'll see a warning in the **Add role assignment** pane. For ways that you can reduce the number of role assignments, see [Troubleshoot Azure RBAC limits](troubleshoot-limits.md).

        ## Download role assignments

        You can download role assignments at a scope in CSV or JSON formats. This can be helpful if you need to inspect the list in a spreadsheet or take an inventory when migrating a subscription.

        When you download role assignments, you should keep in mind the following criteria:

        - If you don't have permissions to read the directory, such as the Directory Readers role, the DisplayName, SignInName, and ObjectType columns will be blank.
        - Role assignments whose security principal has been deleted are not included.
        - Access granted to classic administrators are not included.

        Follow these steps to download role assignments at a scope.
    steps:
      - |
        In the Azure portal, click **All services** and then select the scope where you want to download the role assignments. For example, you can select **Management groups**, **Subscriptions**, **Resource groups**, or a resource.
      - |
        Click the specific resource.
      - |
        Click **Access control (IAM)**.
      - |
        Click **Download role assignments** to open the Download role assignments pane.

        ![Screenshot of Access control and Download role assignments.](./media/role-assignments-list-portal/download-role-assignments.png)
      - |
        Use the check boxes to select the role assignments you want to include in the downloaded file.

          - **Inherited** - Include inherited role assignments for the current scope.
          - **At current scope** - Include role assignments for the current scope.
          - **Children** - Include role assignments at levels below the current scope. This check box is disabled for management group scope.
      - |
        Select the file format, which can be comma-separated values (CSV) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
      - |
        Specify the file name.
      - |
        Click **Start** to start the download.

        The following show examples of the output for each file format.
