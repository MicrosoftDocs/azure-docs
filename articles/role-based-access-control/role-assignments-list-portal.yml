  List Azure role assignments using the Azure portal
introduction: |
  [!INCLUDE [Azure RBAC definition list access](../../includes/role-based-access-control/definition-list.md)] This article describes how to list role assignments using the Azure portal.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If your organization has outsourced management functions to a service provider who uses [Azure Lighthouse](../lighthouse/overview.md), role assignments authorized by that service provider won't be shown here. Similarly, users in the service provider tenant won't see role assignments for users in a customer's tenant, regardless of the role they've been assigned.

      List number of role assignments
    summary: |
        You can have up to **4000** role assignments in each subscription. This limit includes role assignments at the subscription, resource group, and resource scopes.

        If you are getting close to the maximum number and you try to add more role assignments, you'll see a warning in the **Add role assignment** pane. For ways that you can reduce the number of role assignments, see [Troubleshoot Azure RBAC limits](troubleshoot-limits.md).

        ## Download role assignments

        You can download role assignments at a scope in CSV or JSON formats. This can be helpful if you need to inspect the list in a spreadsheet or take an inventory when migrating a subscription.

        When you download role assignments, you should keep in mind the following criteria:

        - If you don't have permissions to read the directory, such as the Directory Readers role, the DisplayName, SignInName, and ObjectType columns will be blank.
        - Role assignments whose security principal has been deleted are not included.
        - Access granted to classic administrators are not included.

        Follow these steps to download role assignments at a scope.
    steps:
      - |
        In the Azure portal, click **All services** and then select the scope where you want to download the role assignments. For example, you can select **Management groups**, **Subscriptions**, **Resource groups**, or a resource.
      - |
        Click the specific resource.
      - |
        Click **Access control (IAM)**.
      - |
        Click **Download role assignments** to open the Download role assignments pane.

        ![Screenshot of Access control and Download role assignments.](./media/role-assignments-list-portal/download-role-assignments.png)
      - |
        Use the check boxes to select the role assignments you want to include in the downloaded file.

          - **Inherited** - Include inherited role assignments for the current scope.
          - **At current scope** - Include role assignments for the current scope.
          - **Children** - Include role assignments at levels below the current scope. This check box is disabled for management group scope.
      - |
        Select the file format, which can be comma-separated values (CSV) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
      - |
        Specify the file name.
      - |
        Click **Start** to start the download.

        The following show examples of the output for each file format.
