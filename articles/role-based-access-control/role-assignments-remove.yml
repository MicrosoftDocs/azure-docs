  Remove Azure role assignments
introduction: |
  [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](overview.md) is the authorization system you use to manage access to Azure resources. To remove access from an Azure resource, you remove a role assignment. This article describes how to remove roles assignments using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, and REST API.

prerequisites:
  summary: |
    To remove role assignments, you must have:

    - `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/delete` permissions, such as [Role Based Access Control Administrator](built-in-roles.md#role-based-access-control-administrator)

    For the REST API, you must use the following version:

    - `2015-07-01` or later

    For more information, see [API versions of Azure RBAC REST APIs](/rest/api/authorization/versions).

      Azure portal
    summary: |
      Follow these steps:
    steps: 
      - |
        Open **Access control (IAM)** at a scope, such as management group, subscription, resource group, or resource, where you want to remove access.
      - |
        Click the **Role assignments** tab to view all the role assignments at this scope.
      - |
        In the list of role assignments, add a checkmark next to the security principal with the role assignment you want to remove.

        Click **Remove**.

        In the remove role assignment message that appears, click **Yes**.

        If you see a message that inherited role assignments cannot be removed, you are trying to remove a role assignment at a child scope. You should open Access control (IAM) at the scope where the role was assigned and try again. A quick way to open Access control (IAM) at the correct scope is to look at the **Scope** column and click the link next to **(Inherited)**.

      Azure PowerShell
    summary: |
      In Azure PowerShell, you remove a role assignment by using [Remove-AzRoleAssignment](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azroleassignment).

      The following example removes the [Virtual Machine Contributor](built-in-roles.md#virtual-machine-contributor) role assignment from the *patlong\@contoso.com* user on the *pharma-sales* resource group:
    code: |
      ```azurepowershell
      PS C:\> Remove-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName patlong@contoso.com `
      -RoleDefinitionName "Virtual Machine Contributor" `
      -ResourceGroupName pharma-sales
      ```

      Removes the [Reader](built-in-roles.md#reader) role from the *Ann Mack Team* group with ID 22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222 at a subscription scope.

      ```azurepowershell
      PS C:\> Remove-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId 22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222 `
      -RoleDefinitionName "Reader" `
      -Scope "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
      ```

      Removes the [Billing Reader](built-in-roles.md#billing-reader) role from the *alain\@example.com* user at the management group scope.

      ```azurepowershell
      PS C:\> Remove-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName alain@example.com `
      -RoleDefinitionName "Billing Reader" `
      -Scope "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/marketing-group"
      ```

      Removes the [User Access Administrator](built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) role with ID 18d7d88d-d35e-4fb5-a5c3-7773c20a72d9 from the principal with ID 33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333 at subscription scope with ID 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.

      ```azurepowershell
      PS C:\> Remove-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId 33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333 `
      -RoleDefinitionId 18d7d88d-d35e-4fb5-a5c3-7773c20a72d9 `
      -Scope /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
      ```

      If you get the error message: "The provided information does not map to a role assignment", make sure that you also specify the `-Scope` or `-ResourceGroupName` parameters. For more information, see [Troubleshoot Azure RBAC](troubleshooting.md#symptom---role-assignments-with-identity-not-found).

      Azure CLI
    summary: |
      In Azure CLI, you remove a role assignment by using [az role assignment delete](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-delete).

      The following example removes the [Virtual Machine Contributor](built-in-roles.md#virtual-machine-contributor) role assignment from the *patlong\@contoso.com* user on the *pharma-sales* resource group:
    code: |
      ```azurecli
      az role assignment delete --assignee "patlong@contoso.com" \
      --role "Virtual Machine Contributor" \
      --resource-group "pharma-sales"
      ```

      Removes the [Reader](built-in-roles.md#reader) role from the *Ann Mack Team* group with ID 22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222 at a subscription scope.

      ```azurecli
      az role assignment delete --assignee "22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222" \
      --role "Reader" \
      --scope "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
      ```

      Removes the [Billing Reader](built-in-roles.md#billing-reader) role from the *alain\@example.com* user at the management group scope.

      ```azurecli
      az role assignment delete --assignee "alain@example.com" \
      --role "Billing Reader" \
      --scope "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/marketing-group"
      ```

      REST API
    summary: |
      In the REST API, you remove a role assignment by using [Role Assignments - Delete](/rest/api/authorization/role-assignments/delete).
    steps: 
      - |
        Get the role assignment identifier (GUID). This identifier is returned when you first create the role assignment or you can get it by listing the role assignments.
      - |
        Start with the following request:

          ```http
          DELETE https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/{roleAssignmentId}?api-version=2022-04-01
          ```
      - |
        Within the URI, replace *{scope}* with the scope for removing the role assignment.

          > [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
          > | Scope | Type |
          > | --- | --- |
          > | `providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{groupId1}` | Management group |
          > | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId1}` | Subscription |
          > | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId1}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1` | Resource group |
          > | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId1}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1/providers/microsoft.web/sites/mysite1` | Resource |
      - |
        Replace *{roleAssignmentId}* with the GUID identifier of the role assignment.

        The following request removes the specified role assignment at subscription scope:

        ```http
        DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId1}/providers/microsoft.authorization/roleassignments/{roleAssignmentId1}?api-version=2022-04-01
        ```

        The following shows an example of the output:

        ```json
        {
            "properties": {
                "roleDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId1}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/a795c7a0-d4a2-40c1-ae25-d81f01202912",
                "principalId": "{objectId1}",
                "principalType": "User",
                "scope": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId1}",
                "condition": null,
                "conditionVersion": null,
                "createdOn": "2022-05-06T23:55:24.5379478Z",
                "updatedOn": "2022-05-06T23:55:24.5379478Z",
                "createdBy": "{createdByObjectId1}",
                "updatedBy": "{updatedByObjectId1}",
                "delegatedManagedIdentityResourceId": null,
                "description": null
            },
            "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId1}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/{roleAssignmentId1}",
            "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments",
            "name": "{roleAssignmentId1}"
        }
        ```
  
        ## ARM template
 
        There isn't a way to remove a role assignment using an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template). To remove a role assignment, you must use other tools such as the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API.
