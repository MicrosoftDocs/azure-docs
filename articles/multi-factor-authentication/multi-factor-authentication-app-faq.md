# Microsoft Authenticator application FAQ

The Microsoft Authenticator app replaced the Azure Authenticator app, and is the recommended app when you use Azure Multi-Factor Authentication. This app is available for Windows Phone, Android, and iOS.

## Frequently asked questions

**Q: I'm already using the Microsoft Authenticator application for security codes. How do I switch to one-click push notifications?**

If you use a Microsoft account for your personal account, and want to switch over to push notifications, you need to add your account again. This is because the app uses a one-time password. Re-register the device with your account, and set up push notifications.

If your account does not have two-step verification enabled, see [About two-step verification](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12408/microsoft-account-about-two-step-verification) to decide if it's right for you.

**Q: When will I be able to use one-click push notifications on my iPhone for my Microsoft account?**

This feature is in beta until the end of August, when it becomes broadly available. If you want to join our beta program, send email to andypick@microsoft.com. Include your first name, last name, and Apple ID in your message.

**Q: Do one-click push notifications work for non-Microsoft accounts?**

No, push notifications only work with Microsoft accounts and Azure Active Directory accounts. If your work or school uses Azure AD accounts, they may disable this feature.
