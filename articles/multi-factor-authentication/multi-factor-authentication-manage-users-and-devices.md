# Managing user settings with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication in the cloud

As an administrator, you can manage the following user and device settings.  

- [Require selected users to provide contact methods again](#require-selected-users-to-provide-contact-methods-again)
- [Delete users existing app passwords](#delete-users-existing-app-passwords)
- [Restore MFA on all suspended devices for a user (Public Preview)](#restore-mfa-on-all-suspended-devices-for-a-user)






This is helpful if a computer or device is lost or stolen or you need to remove a users access.


## Require selected users to provide contact methods again

This setting will forces the user to complete the registration process again when he or she signs in. Be aware that non-browser apps will continue to work if the user has app passwords for them.  You can delete the users app passwords by also selecting **Delete all existing app passwords generated by the selected users**.
