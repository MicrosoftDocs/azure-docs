# Managing user settings with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication in the cloud

As an administrator, you can manage the following user and device settings.  

- [Require selected users to provide contact methods again](#require-selected-users-to-provide-contact-methods-again)
- [Delete users existing app passwords](#delete-users-existing-app-passwords)
- [Restore MFA on all suspended devices for a user](#restore-mfa-on-all-suspended-devices-for-a-user)






This is helpful if a computer or device is lost or stolen or you need to remove a users access.


## Require selected users to provide contact methods again

This setting will forces the user to complete the registration process again when he or she signs in. Be aware that non-browser apps will continue to work if the user has app passwords for them.  You can delete the users app passwords by also selecting **Delete all existing app passwords generated by the selected users**.

### How to require users to provide contact methods again




1. Sign-in to the Azure classic portal.
2. On the left, click Active Directory.
3. Under, Directory click on the directory for the user you want to require to provide their contact method again.
4. At the top, click Users.
5. At the bottom of the page, click Manage Multi-Factor Auth. This will open the multi-factor authentication page.
6. Find the user that you wish to manage and place a check in the box located next to the name. You may need to change the view at the top.
7. This will bring up the **Manage user settings** link on the right. Click it.
8. Place a check in **Require selected users to provide contact methods again**.
