# Updates to the sign-in experience for online services

We’re updating our sign-in experience for Microsoft’s online services, such as Office 365 and Azure. While this is only a visual change, you’ll notice that the screens seem less cluttered and more straightforward, making it easier for you to focus on what you need to do — sign-in.

## Current UI versus new UI

Check out the existing UI compared to the new UI. The new UI is more streamlined and focused, with a more updated look and feel.

## When will the new UI appear?

Here’s a timeline of when to expect this change to happen:

| Timeframe | Change |
|-----------|--------|
| Early-May | You’ll start to see a notification banner on your existing sign-in page. From here you can learn about and prepare for the changes. |
| Mid-May   | The notification banner changes to include a link to preview the updated UI. When in the preview, you can still use a link to switch back to the existing experience. |
| Mid-June  | The updated sign-in UI is available, and everyone defaults to the new UI experience. |
