# Identify malware using the Malware Assessment solution in Log Analytics

![Antimalware Assessment symbol](./media/log-analytics-malware/antimalware-assessment-symbol.png)

You can use the Antimalware solution in Log Analytics to report on the status of antimalware protection in your infrastructure. Installing the solution updates the OMS agent and base configuration for OMS. Antimalware protection status and detected threats on the monitored servers are read, and then the data is sent to the Log Analytics service in the cloud for processing. Logic is applied to the received data and the cloud service records the data. Servers with detected threats and servers with insufficient protection are shown in the **Antimalware** dashboard. By using the information on the **Antimalware** dashboard, you can identify a plan to apply protection to the servers that need it.

## Installing and configuring the solution
Use the following information to install and configure the solution.

* In order to use the Malware Assessment solution, you must subscribe to the Security & Compliance solution offering.
* Add the Malware Assessment solution to your OMS workspace from [Azure marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/Microsoft.AntiMalwareOMS?tab=Overview) or by using the process described in [Add Log Analytics solutions from the Solutions Gallery](log-analytics-add-solutions.md).  There is no further configuration required.

## Use Antimalware
Log Analytics reports antimalware status for:

* Computers running Windows Defender on Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Windows Server 2016 TP4 or later
* Windows Security Center (WSC) on Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 TP4 or later
* Servers running System Center Endpoint Protection (v4.5.216 or later), Azure virtual machines with the [antimalware extension](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=398023), and Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT)  
* Servers with Windows Management Framework 3 &#40;or later&#41; [WMF 3.0](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2506143), [WMF 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40855).
* Symantec Endpoint Protection 12.x and 14.x versions
* Trend Micro Deep Security version 9.6 on computers running Windows

In addition to detecting when 3rd party solutions are installed, an additional assessment is also done to determine whether protection by  agents is operational. Specifically, OMS Security tests to see if the antimalware agents from these vendors on the monitored servers are:

- Enabled
- Running scans at regular intervals
- Using signatures no older than seven days

The antimalware solution does not currently report on:

* Servers running Windows Server 2008 and earlier
* Web and Worker roles in Microsoft Azure

## Malware Assessment data collection details
Malware Assessment collects configuration data, metadata, and state data using the agents that you have enabled.

The following table shows data collection methods and other details about how data is collected for Malware Assessment.

| platform | Direct Agent | SCOM agent | Azure Storage | SCOM required? | SCOM agent data sent via management group | collection frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows |![Yes](./media/log-analytics-malware/oms-bullet-green.png) |![Yes](./media/log-analytics-malware/oms-bullet-green.png) |![No](./media/log-analytics-malware/oms-bullet-red.png) |![No](./media/log-analytics-malware/oms-bullet-red.png) |![Yes](./media/log-analytics-malware/oms-bullet-green.png) |hourly |

The following table shows examples of data types collected by Malware Assessment:

| **Data type** | **Fields** |
| --- | --- |
| Configuration |CustomerID, AgentID, EntityID, ManagedTypeID, ManagedTypePropertyID, CurrentValue, ChangeDate |
| Metadata |BaseManagedEntityId, ObjectStatus, OrganizationalUnit, ActiveDirectoryObjectSid, PhysicalProcessors, NetworkName, IPAddress, ForestDNSName, NetbiosComputerName, VirtualMachineName, LastInventoryDate, HostServerNameIsVirtualMachine, IP Address, NetbiosDomainName, LogicalProcessors, DNSName, DisplayName, DomainDnsName, ActiveDirectorySite, PrincipalName, OffsetInMinuteFromGreenwichTime |
| State |StateChangeEventId, StateId, NewHealthState, OldHealthState, Context, TimeGenerated, TimeAdded, StateId2, BaseManagedEntityId, MonitorId, HealthState, LastModified, LastGreenAlertGenerated, DatabaseTimeModified |

## Review threats for servers
When your computers are adequately protected, active threats are quickly quarantined by your antimalware software and should rarely appear as active threats. For that reason, review remediated threats that show the effectiveness of the Antimalware Assessment solution in the following example procedure.

1. On the **Overview** page, click the **Antimalware Assessment** tile.  
    ![Malware Assessment Tile](./media/log-analytics-malware/oms-antimalware01.png)
2. On the **Antimalware** dashboard, review the **Detected Threats** blade and click a server name with remediated threats.  
    ![Antimalware dashboard](./media/log-analytics-malware/oms-antimalware02.png)
3. On the **Search** page you can see detailed information about the quarantined threat. Next to **Threat**, click **View**.  
    ![Search page](./media/log-analytics-malware/oms-antimalware03.png)
4. On the **Search the malware encyclopedia** page, click the malware item to view more details about it.  
    ![Malware Protection Center page](./media/log-analytics-malware/oms-antimalware04.png)
5. On the Microsoft **Malware Protection Center** page for the malware item, review information in the **Summary** section. This section describes how your antimalware software can detect and remove the threat and provides information about what threat the malware might have to your computers.  
    ![summary information about the threat](./media/log-analytics-malware/oms-antimalware05.png)

## Review protection status
1. On the **Antimalware** dashboard, review the **Protection Status** blade and click **No real time protection**.  
    ![Antimalware dashboard](./media/log-analytics-malware/oms-antimalware06.png)
2. Search shows a list of servers without protection.  
    ![Search page showing servers without protection](./media/log-analytics-malware/oms-antimalware07.png)
3. Servers without real time protection are displayed.

Computers that do not have supported antimalware software are reported as **No real time protection**.
