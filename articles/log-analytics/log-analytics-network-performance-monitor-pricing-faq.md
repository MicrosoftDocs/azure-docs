# Pricing changes for Azure Network Performance Monitor 

This document captures the pricing changes related to Azure [Network Performance Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/networking/network-monitoring-overview) (NPM), in any easy to read Question and Answer format.

Network Performance Monitor consists of three components:
* [Performance Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/networking/network-monitoring-overview#performance-monitor)
* [Service Endpoint Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/networking/network-monitoring-overview#service-endpoint-monitor) and
* [ExpressRoute Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/networking/network-monitoring-overview#expressroute-monitor)

The section below explains the pricing related changes for Performance Monitor and ExpressRoute Monitor.

## Performance Monitor (PM)

**How was usage of Performance Monitor billed in the old scheme?**

The billing for NPM was based on the usage/consumption of two components:
a. Nodes: All synthetic transactions originate and terminate at the nodes. Nodes are also referred to as agents or MMA (Microsoft Management Agents).
b. Data: The results of the various network tests are stored in Log Analytics repository.

Under the old model, the bill was computed based on the number of nodes (USD $15/node/month) and the volume of data generated (USD $2.30/GB).

**How is usage of Performance Monitor, charged under the new model?**

The Performance Monitor capability in NPM is now billed on a combination of: 
a. subnet links monitored and
b. data volume

**What is a subnet link?**

Performance Monitor, monitors connectivity between two or more locations on the network.  The connection between a group of nodes/agents on one subnet and a group of nodes on another subnet, is referred to as a subnet link.

**I have two subnets (subnet A and B) and have multiple agents on each subnet.  Performance Monitor monitors connectivity from all agents on subnet A to all agents on subnet B.  Will I be charged based on the number of inter-subnet connections?**

No. For billing purposes, all connections from subnet A to subnet B are grouped together into one subnet link and you are billed for a single connection.  Performance Monitor will continue to monitor connectivity between various agents on each subnet.

**What are the costs for monitoring a subnet link?**

Refer to the section titled [Ping Mesh](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/network-watcher/) for the cost of monitoring a single subnet link for the entire month.

**What are the charges for the data generated by Performance Monitor?**

The charge for ingestion (data upload to Log Analytics, processing and indexing) is available on the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/log-analytics/) for Log Analytics.  (Section: Data Ingestion).

The charge for data retention (that is, data retained at customer's option, beyond the first month) is also available on the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/log-analytics/).  (Section: Data Retention).


## ExpressRoute Monitor (ERM)

**What are the charges for usage of ExpressRoute Monitor?**

Charges for ExpressRoute Monitor are billed based on the volume of data generated during monitoring.   Refer to the question "What are the charges for data generated by Performance Monitor?" for more information.

**I use ERM to monitor multiple ExpressRoute circuits. Am I charged based on the number of circuits being monitored?**

You are not charged based on either the number of circuits or the type of peering (for example, Private peering, Microsoft peering).  You are charged on the volume of data, as explained in the earlier answer.

**What is the volume of data generated, when monitoring a single circuit?**

The volume of data generated per month, when monitoring a private peering connection using one agent on either side of the connection is as follows:

|Percentile      |Data/Month (MB)|
|----------------|           ---:|
|50<sup>th</sup> |            192|
|60<sup>th</sup> |            256|
|70<sup>th</sup> |            360|
|80<sup>th</sup> |            498|
|90<sup>th</sup> |            870|
|95<sup>th</sup> |           1560|


Per the table above, customers at the 50th percentile pay for 192 MB of data. At USD $2.30/GB for the first month, the cost incurred for monitoring a circuit is USD 0.43 (= 192 * 2.30 / 1024) for the first month.
