# Build configuration for Azure Static Web Apps

The Azure Static Web Apps build configuration is powered either by GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines.  Each site has a YAML configuration file that controls how a site is built and deployed. This article explains the file's structure and options.

The following table lists the available configuration settings.

| Property | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `app_location` | This folder contains the source code for your front-end application. The value is relative to the repository root in GitHub and the current working folder in Azure DevOps. When used with `skip_app_build: true`, this value is the app's build output location. | Yes |
| `api_location` | This folder that contains the source code for your API application. The value is relative to the repository root in GitHub and the current working folder in Azure DevOps. When used with `skip_api_build: true`, this value is the API's build output location. | No |
| `output_location` | If your web app runs a build step, the output location is the folder where the public files are generated. For most projects, the `output_location` is relative to the `app_location`. However, for .NET projects, the location is relative to the publish output folder. | No |
| `app_build_command` | For Node.js applications, you can define a custom command to build the static content application.<br><br>For example, to configure a production build for an Angular application create an npm script named `build-prod` to run `ng build --prod` and enter `npm run build-prod` as the custom command. If left blank, the workflow tries to run the `npm run build` or `npm run build:azure` commands. | No |
| `api_build_command` | For Node.js applications, you can define a custom command to build the Azure Functions API application. | No |
| `skip_app_build` | Set the value to `true` to skip building the front-end app. | No |
| `skip_api_build` | Set the value to `true` to skip building the API functions. | No |
| `cwd`<br />(Azure Pipelines only) | Absolute path to the working folder. Defaults to `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)`. | No |
| `build_timeout_in_minutes` | Set this value to customize the build timeout. Defaults to `15`. | No |

With these settings, you can set up GitHub Actions or [Azure Pipelines](get-started-portal.md?pivots=azure-devops) to run continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) for your static web app.

## File name and location

# [GitHub Actions](#tab/github-actions)

The configuration file is generated by GitHub and stored in the *.github/workflows* folder, named using the following format: `azure-static-web-apps-<RANDOM_NAME>.yml`.

# [Azure Pipelines](#tab/azure-devops)

By default, the configuration file is stored at the root of your repository with the name `azure-pipelines.yml`.

---

## Build configuration

The following sample configuration monitors the repository for changes. As commits are pushed to the `main` branch, the application is built from the `app_location` folder and files in the `output_location` are served to the public web. Additionally, the application in the *api* folder is available under the site's `api` path.

# [GitHub Actions](#tab/github-actions)

```yml
name: Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed]
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build_and_deploy_job:
    if: github.event_name == 'push' || (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action != 'closed')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build and Deploy Job
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          submodules: true
      - name: Build And Deploy
        id: builddeploy
        uses: Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN }}
          repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Used for GitHub integrations (i.e. PR comments)
          action: "upload"
          ###### Repository/Build Configurations ######
          app_location: "src" # App source code path relative to repository root
          api_location: "api" # Api source code path relative to repository root - optional
          output_location: "public" # Built app content directory, relative to app_location - optional
          ###### End of Repository/Build Configurations ######

  close_pull_request_job:
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action == 'closed'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Close Pull Request Job
    steps:
      - name: Close Pull Request
        id: closepullrequest
        uses: Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN }}
          action: "close"
```

In this configuration:

- The `main` branch is monitored for commits.
- A GitHub Actions workflow is [triggered](https://help.github.com/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) when a pull request on the `main` branch is: opened, synchronized, reopened, or closed.
- The `build_and_deploy_job` executes when you push commits or open a pull request against the branch listed in the `on` property.
- The `app_location` points to the `src` folder that contains the source files for the web app. To set this value to the repository root, use `/`.
- The `api_location` points to the `api` folder that contains the Azure Functions application for the site's API endpoints. To set this value to the repository root, use `/`.
- The `output_location` points to the `public` folder that contains the final version of the app's source files. It's relative to `app_location`. For .NET projects, the location is relative to the publish output folder.

Don't change the values for `repo_token`, `action`, and `azure_static_web_apps_api_token` as they're set for you by Azure Static Web Apps.

# [Azure Pipelines](#tab/azure-devops)

```yaml
trigger:
  - main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
  - checkout: self
    submodules: true
  - task: AzureStaticWebApp@0
    inputs:
      app_location: 'src' # App source code path relative to cwd
      api_location: 'api' # Api source code path relative to cwd
      output_location: 'public' # Built app content directory relative to app_location - optional
      cwd: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/myapp' # Working directory - optional
      azure_static_web_apps_api_token: $(deployment_token)
```

In this configuration:

- The `main` branch is monitored for commits.
- The `app_location` points to the `src` folder that contains the source files for the web app. This value is relative to the working directory (`cwd`). To set it to the working directory, use `/`.
- The `api_location` points to the `api` folder that contains the Azure Functions application for the site's API endpoints. This value is relative to the working directory (`cwd`). To set it to the working directory, use `/`.
- The `output_location` points to the `public` folder that contains the final version of the app's source files. This value is relative to `app_location`. For .NET projects, the location is relative to the publish output folder.
- The `cwd` is an absolute path pointing to the working directory. It defaults to `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)`.
- The `$(deployment_token)` variable points to the [generated Azure DevOps deployment token](./deployment-token-management.md).

> [!NOTE]
> `app_location` and `api_location` must be relative to the working directory (`cwd`) and they must be subdirectories under `cwd`.

---

## Custom build commands

For Node.js applications, you can take fine-grained control over what commands run during the app or API build process. The following example shows how to define build with values for `app_build_command` and `api_build_command`.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you can only define `app_build_command` and `api_build_command` for Node.js builds.
> To specify the Node.js version, use the [`engines`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#engines) field in the `package.json` file.

# [GitHub Actions](#tab/github-actions)

```yml
...

with:
  azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN }}
  repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  action: 'upload'
  app_location: '/'
  api_location: 'api'
  output_location: 'dist'
  app_build_command: 'npm run build-ui-prod'
  api_build_command: 'npm run build-api-prod'
```
# [Azure Pipelines](#tab/azure-devops)

```yaml
...

inputs:
  app_location: 'src'
  api_location: 'api'
  app_build_command: 'npm run build-ui-prod'
  api_build_command: 'npm run build-api-prod'
  output_location: 'public'
  azure_static_web_apps_api_token: $(deployment_token)
```

---

## Skip building front-end app

If you need full control of the build for your front-end app, you can bypass the automatic build and deploy the app built in a previous step.

To skip building the front-end app:

- Set `app_location` to the location the files you want to deploy.
- Set `skip_app_build` to `true`.
- Set `output_location` to an empty string (`''`).

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have your `staticwebapp.config.json` file copied as well into the *output* directory.

# [GitHub Actions](#tab/github-actions)

```yml
...

with:
  azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN }}
  repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  action: 'upload'
  app_location: 'src/dist'
  api_location: 'api'
  output_location: ''
  skip_app_build: true
```

# [Azure Pipelines](#tab/azure-devops)

```yml
...

inputs:
  app_location: 'src/dist'
  api_location: 'api'
  output_location: '' # Leave this empty
  skip_app_build: true
  azure_static_web_apps_api_token: $(deployment_token)
```

---

## Skip building the API

If you want to skip building the API, you can bypass the automatic build and deploy the API built in a previous step.

Steps to skip building the API:

- In the *staticwebapp.config.json* file, set `apiRuntime` to the correct runtime and version. Refer to [Configure Azure Static Web Apps](configuration.md#select-the-api-language-runtime-version) for the list of supported runtimes and versions.
    ```json
    {
      "platform": {
        "apiRuntime": "node:16"
      }
    }
    ```
- Set `skip_api_build` to `true`.
- Set `api_location` to the folder containing the built API app to deploy. This path is relative to the repository root in GitHub Actions and `cwd` in Azure Pipelines.

# [GitHub Actions](#tab/github-actions)

```yml
...

with:
  azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN }}
  repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  action: 'upload'
  app_location: "src" # App source code path relative to repository root
  api_location: "api" # Api source code path relative to repository root - optional
  output_location: "public" # Built app content directory, relative to app_location - optional
  skip_api_build: true
```

# [Azure Pipelines](#tab/azure-devops)


```yml
...

inputs:
  app_location: 'src'
  api_location: 'api'
  output_location: 'public'
  skip_api_build: true
  azure_static_web_apps_api_token: $(deployment_token)
```

---

## Extend build timeout

By default, the app and API builds are limited to 15 minutes. You can extend the build timeout by setting the `build_timeout_in_minutes` property.

# [GitHub Actions](#tab/github-actions)

```yaml
...

with:
  azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN }}
  repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  action: 'upload'
  app_location: 'src'
  api_location: 'api'
  output_location: 'public'
  build_timeout_in_minutes: 30
```

# [Azure Pipelines](#tab/azure-devops)

```yml
...

inputs:
  app_location: 'src'
  api_location: 'api'
  output_location: 'public'
  build_timeout_in_minutes: 30
  azure_static_web_apps_api_token: $(deployment_token)
```

---

## Run workflow without deployment secrets

Sometimes you need your workflow to continue to process even when some secrets are missing. Set the `SKIP_DEPLOY_ON_MISSING_SECRETS` environment variable to `true` to configure your workflow to proceed without defined secrets.

When enabled, this feature allows the workflow to continue without deploying the site's content.

# [GitHub Actions](#tab/github-actions)

```yaml
...

with:
  azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN }}
  repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  action: 'upload'
  app_location: 'src'
  api_location: 'api'
  output_location: 'public'
env:
  SKIP_DEPLOY_ON_MISSING_SECRETS: true
```

# [Azure Pipelines](#tab/azure-devops)

```yaml
...

inputs:
  app_location: 'src'
  api_location: 'api'
  output_location: 'public'
  azure_static_web_apps_api_token: $(deployment_token)
env:
  SKIP_DEPLOY_ON_MISSING_SECRETS: true
```

---

## Environment variables

You can set environment variables for your build via the `env` section of a job's configuration.

# [GitHub Actions](#tab/github-actions)

```yaml
...

with:
  azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN }}
  repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  action: 'upload'
  app_location: 'src'
  api_location: 'api'
  output_location: 'public'
env: # Add environment variables here
  HUGO_VERSION: 0.58.0
```

# [Azure Pipelines](#tab/azure-devops)

```yml
...

inputs:
  app_location: 'src'
  api_location: 'api'
  output_location: 'public'
  azure_static_web_apps_api_token: $(deployment_token)
env: # Add environment variables here
  HUGO_VERSION: 0.58.0
```

---

## Monorepo support

A monorepo is a repository that contains code for more than one application. By default, the workflow tracks all files in a repository, but you can adjust the configuration to target a single app.

To target a workflow file to a single app, you specify paths in the `push` and `pull_request` sections.

# [GitHub Actions](#tab/github-actions)

When you set up a monorepo, each static app configuration is scoped to only files for a single app. The different workflow files live side by side in the repository's _.github/workflows_ folder.

```files
├── .github
│   └── workflows
│       ├── azure-static-web-apps-purple-pond.yml
│       └── azure-static-web-apps-yellow-shoe.yml
│
├── app1  👉 controlled by: azure-static-web-apps-purple-pond.yml
├── app2  👉 controlled by: azure-static-web-apps-yellow-shoe.yml
│
├── api1  👉 controlled by: azure-static-web-apps-purple-pond.yml
├── api2  👉 controlled by: azure-static-web-apps-yellow-shoe.yml
│
└── README.md
```

The following example demonstrates how to add a `paths` node to the `push` and `pull_request` sections of a file named _azure-static-web-apps-purple-pond.yml_.

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - app1/**
      - api1/**
      - .github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-purple-pond.yml
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed]
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - app1/**
      - api1/**
      - .github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-purple-pond.yml
```

In this example, only changes made to following files trigger a new build:

- Any files inside the _app1_ folder
- Any files inside the _api1_ folder
- Changes to the app's _azure-static-web-apps-purple-pond.yml_ workflow file

# [Azure Pipelines](#tab/azure-devops)

To support more than one application in a single repository, create a separate workflow file and associate it with different Azure Pipelines.
