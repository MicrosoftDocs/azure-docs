# Manage the default domain in Azure Static Web Apps

Your static web app can be accessed using its automatically generated domain and any custom domains that you've configured. Optionally, you can configure your app to redirect all traffic to a default domain.

## Set a default domain

When you designate a custom domain as your app's default domain, requests to other domains are automatically redirected to the default domain. Only one custom domain can be set as the default.

Follow the below steps to set a custom domain as default.

1. With your static web app opened in the Azure portal, select **Custom domains** in the menu.

1. Select the custom domain you want to configure as the default domain.

1. Select **Set default**.

1. With your static web app opened in the Azure portal, select **Custom domains** in the menu.

1. Select the custom domain you configured as the default.

1. Select **Unset default**.
