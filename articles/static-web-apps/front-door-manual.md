# Tutorial: Configure a CDN for Azure Static Web Apps

By adding [Azure Front Door](../frontdoor/front-door-overview.md) as the CDN for your static web app, you benefit from a secure entry point for fast delivery of your web applications. 

With Static Web Apps, you have two options to integrate with Azure Front Door. You can add Azure Front Door to your static web app by enabling enterprise-grade edge, a managed integration of Azure Front Door with Static Web Apps. Alternatively, you can configure an Azure Front Door resource manually in front of your static web app. 

Consider the advantages below to determine which option best suits your needs.

**Enterprise-grade edge provides:**
* Zero configuration changes
* No downtime
* Automatically managed SSL certifications and custom domains

**A manual Azure Front Door setup gives you full control over the CDN configuration including the chance to:**
* Limit traffic origin by origin
* Add a web application firewall (WAF)
* Route across multiple applications
* Use more advanced features of Azure Front Door

In this tutorial, you learn to add Azure Front Door to your static web app.

### Prerequisites

* Registered `Microsoft.Cdn` [resource provider](/articles/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md).
* [Custom domain](./custom-domain.md) configured for your static web app with a time to live (TTL) set to less than 48 hrs.
* An application deployed with [Azure Static Web Apps](./get-started-portal.md) that uses the Standard hosting plan.

### Enable enterprise-grade edge on the Static Web Apps resource

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Go to your static web app in the Azure portal.

1. Select **Enterprise-grade edge** in the left menu.

> The cache expiration, cache key query string and origin group override actions are deprecated. These actions can still work normally, but your rule set can't change. Replace these overrides with new route configuration override actions before changing your rule set.

Add the following settings to disable Front Door's caching policies from trying to cache authentication and authorization-related pages.

#### Add a condition

1. From your Front Door, under *Settings*, select **Rule set**.

2. Select **Add**.

3. In the *Rule set name* textbox, enter **Security**.

4. In the *Rule name* textbox, enter **NoCacheAuthRequests**.

5. Select **Add a condition**.

6. Select **Request path**.

7. Select the *Operator* drop-down, and then **Begins With**.

8. Select the **Edit** link above the *Value* textbox.

9. Enter `/.auth` in the textbox, and then select **Update**.

10. Select no options from the *String transform* dropdown.

#### Add an action

1. Select the **Add an action** dropdown.

2. Select **Route configuration override**.

3. Select **Disabled** in the *Caching* dropdown.

4. Select **Save**.

#### Associate rule to an endpoint

Now that the rule is created, apply the rule to a Front Door endpoint.

1. From your Front Door, select **Rule set**, and then the **Unassociated** link.

   :::image type="content" source="media/front-door-manual/copy-front-door-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing highlighted Overview item and highlighted Front Door ID number.":::

### Update static web app configuration

To complete the integration with Front Door, you need to update the application configuration file to do the following functions:

- Restrict traffic to your site only through Front Door
- Restrict traffic to your site only from your Front Door instance
- Define which domains can access your site
- Disable caching for secured routes

Open the [staticwebapp.config.json](configuration.md) file for your site and make the following changes.

1. Restrict traffic to only use Front Door by adding the following section to the configuration file:

    ```json
    "networking": {
      "allowedIpRanges": ["AzureFrontDoor.Backend"]
    }
    ```

1. To define which Azure Front Door instances and domains can access your site, add the `forwardingGateway` section.

    ```json
    "forwardingGateway": {
      "requiredHeaders": {
        "X-Azure-FDID" : "<YOUR-FRONT-DOOR-ID>"
      },
      "allowedForwardedHosts": [
        "my-sitename.azurefd.net"
      ]
    }
    ```

    First, configure your app to only allow traffic from your Front Door instance. In every backend request, Front Door automatically adds an `X-Azure-FDID` header that contains your Front Door instance ID. By configuring your static web app to require this header, it restricts traffic exclusively to your Front Door instance. In the `forwardingGateway` section in your configuration file, add the `requiredHeaders` section and define the `X-Azure-FDID` header. Replace `<YOUR-FRONT-DOOR-ID>` with the *Front Door ID* you set aside earlier.

    Next, add the Azure Front Door hostname (not the Azure Static Web Apps hostname) into the `allowedForwardedHosts` array. If you have custom domains configured in your Front Door instance, also include them in this list.

    In this example, replace `my-sitename.azurefd.net` with the Azure Front Door hostname for your site.

2. For all secured routes in your app, disable Azure Front Door caching by adding `"Cache-Control": "no-store"` to the route header definition.

    ```json
    {
        ...
        "routes": [
            {
                "route": "/members",
                "allowedRoles": ["authenticated", "members"],
                "headers": {
                    "Cache-Control": "no-store"
                }
            }
        ]
        ...
    }
    ```

With this configuration, your site is no longer available via the generated `*.azurestaticapps.net` hostname, but exclusively through the hostnames configured in your Front Door instance.

### Considerations

- **Custom domains**: Now that Front Door is managing your site, you no longer use the Azure Static Web Apps custom domain feature. Azure Front Door has a separate process for adding a custom domain. Refer to [Add a custom domain to your Front Door](../frontdoor/front-door-custom-domain.md). When you add a custom domain to Front Door, you'll need to update your static web app configuration file to include it in the `allowedForwardedHosts` list.

- **Traffic statistics**: By default, Azure Front Door configures [health probes](../frontdoor/front-door-health-probes.md) that may affect your traffic statistics. You may want to edit the default values for the [health probes](../frontdoor/front-door-health-probes.md).

- **Serving old versions**: When you deploy updates to existing files in your static web app, Azure Front Door may continue to serve older versions of your files until their [time-to-live](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live) expires. [Purge the Azure Front Door cache](../frontdoor/front-door-caching.md#cache-purge) for the affected paths to ensure the latest files are served.
