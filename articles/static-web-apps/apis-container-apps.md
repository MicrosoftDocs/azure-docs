# API support in Azure Static Web Apps with Azure Container Apps

[Azure Container Apps](../container-apps/overview.md) is a managed platform for hosting serverless containers and microservices.

When you link your container app to your static web app, any requests to your static web app with a route that starts with `/api` are proxied to the same route on the container app.

By default, when a container app is linked to a static web app, the container app only accepts requests that are proxied through the linked static web app. A container app can be linked to a single static web app at a time.

> [!NOTE]
> The integration with Azure Container Apps requires the Static Web Apps Standard plan.
>
> Backend integration is not supported on Static Web Apps [pull request environments](review-publish-pull-requests.md).

## Prerequisites

To link a container app to your static web app, you need to have an existing Container Apps resource and a static web app.

| Resource | Description |
|---|---|
| [Azure Container Apps](/azure/container-apps/quickstart-portal) | If you don't already have one, follow the steps in the [Deploy your first container app](/azure/container-apps/quickstart-portal) guide. |
| [Existing static web app](getting-started.md) | If you don't already have one, follow the steps in the [getting started](getting-started.md) guide to create a *No Framework* static web app. |

## Example

Consider an existing Azure Container App instance that exposes an endpoint via the following location.

```url
https://my-container-app.red-river-123.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io/api/getProducts
```

Once linked, you can access that same endpoint through the `api` path from your static web app, as shown in this example URL.

```url
https://red-sea-123.azurestaticapps.net/api/getProducts
```

Both URLs point to the same API endpoint. The endpoint on the container app must have the `/api` prefix, since Static Web Apps matches requests made to `/api` and proxies the entire path to the linked resource.

## Link a container app

To link a container app as the API backend for a static web app, follow these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, go to the static web app.

1. Select **APIs** from the navigation menu.

1. Locate the environment you want to link the API Management instance to. Select **Link**.

1. In *Backend resource type*, select **Container App**.

1. In *Subscription*, select the subscription containing the container app you want to link.

1. In *Resource name*, select the container app.

1. Select **Link**.

When the linking process is complete, requests to routes beginning with `/api` are proxied to the linked container app.

### Manage access to the container app

Your container app is configured with an identity provider named `Azure Static Web Apps (Linked)` that permits only traffic that is proxied through the static web app. To make your container app accessible to other applications, update its authentication configuration to add another identity provider or change the security settings to allow unauthenticated access.

## Unlink a container app

To unlink a container app from a static web app, follow these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, go to the static web app.

1. Select **APIs** from the navigation menu.

1. Locate the environment that you want to unlink and select the container app name.

1. Select **Unlink**.

When the unlinking process is complete, requests to routes beginning with `/api` are no longer proxied to your container app.

> [!NOTE]
> To prevent accidentally exposing your container app to anonymous traffic, the identity provider created by the linking process is not automatically deleted. You can delete the identity provider named *Azure Static Web Apps (Linked)* from the container app's authentication settings.

### Remove authentication from the Container Apps resource

To enable your Container Apps resource to receive anonymous traffic, follow these steps to remove the identity provider:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Container Apps resource.

1. Select **Authentication** from the navigation menu.

1. From the list of **Identity providers**, delete the identity provider related to the Static Web Apps resource.

1. Select **Remove authentication** to remove authentication and allow anonymous traffic to your Container Apps resource.

Your Container Apps resource is now able to receive anonymous traffic.
