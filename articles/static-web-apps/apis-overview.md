# Overview of API support in Azure Static Web Apps

Front end web applications often call back end APIs for data and services. Azure Static Web Apps provides built-in serverless API endpoints via integration with Azure services.

Key features of Azure Static Web Apps APIs include:

- **Integrated security** with direct access to user [authentication and role-based authorization](user-information.md) data.

- **Seamless routing** that makes the back-end `/api` route available to the front-end web app without requiring custom CORS rules.

## API options

The following Azure services can be integrated with Azure Static Web Apps:

| Service | Managed | Bring your own |
| --- | --- |
| [Azure Functions](apis-functions.md) | ✔ | ✔ |
| [Azure API Management](apis-api-management.md) |  | ✔ |
| [Azure App Service](apis-app-service.md) |  | ✔ |
| [Azure Container Apps](apis-container-apps.md) |  | ✔ |

- **Managed APIs**: By default, Azure Static Web Apps automatically integrates with Azure Functions as an API backend. You deploy an API with your static web app without managing a separate Azure Functions resource.
- **Bring your own APIs**: You can integrate your static web app with existing APIs hosted in Azure Functions, API Management, App Service, or Container Apps. You manage and deploy the API resources yourself.

> [!NOTE]
> Bring your own APIs is only available in the Azure Static Web Apps Standard plan. Built-in, managed Azure Functions APIs are available in all Azure Static Web Apps plans.

## <a name="constraints"></a>API constraints

The following constraints apply to all API backends:

- Each static web app environment can only be configured with one type of backend API at a time.
- The API route prefix must be `/api`.
- Route rules for APIs only support [redirects](configuration.md#define-routes) and [securing routes with roles](configuration.md#securing-routes-with-roles).
- Only HTTP requests are supported for APIs. WebSocket, for example, is not supported.
- The maximum duration of each API request 45 seconds.
- Network isolated backends are not supported.

The following constraints apply to Bring your own API backends:
- An application must be deployed to your static web app before requests to the `/api` route can be resolved.
- Bring your own API backends cannot be linked to a Static Web Apps pull request environment.
