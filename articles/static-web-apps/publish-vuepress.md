# Tutorial: Publish a VuePress site to Azure Static Web Apps

This article demonstrates how to create and deploy a [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) web application to [Azure Static Web Apps](overview.md). The final result is a new Azure Static Web Apps application with the associated GitHub Actions that give you control over how the app is built and published.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, you can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- A GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can [create an account for free](https://github.com/join).
- A Git setup installed. If you don't have one, you can [install Git](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads). 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

## Create a VuePress App

Create a VuePress app from the Command Line Interface (CLI):

1. Create a new folder for the VuePress app.

   ```bash
   mkdir static-site
   ```

1. Add a _README.md_ file the folder.

   ```bash
   echo '# Hello From VuePress' > README.md
   ```

1. Initialize the _package.json_ file.

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

1. Add VuePress as a `devDependency`.

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev vuepress
   ```

1. Open the _package.json_ file in a text editor and add a build command to the [`scripts`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli-commands/run-script.html) section.

   ```json
   ...
   "scripts": {
       "build": "vuepress build"
   }
   ...
   ```

1. Create a _.gitignore_ file to exclude the _node\_modules_ folder.

    ```bash
    echo 'node_modules' > .gitignore
    ```

1. Initialize a Git repo.

   ```bash
    git init
    git add -A
    git commit -m "initial commit"
   ```

## Push your application to GitHub

You need a repository on GitHub to connect to Azure Static Web Apps. The following steps show you how to create a repository for your site.

1. Create a blank GitHub repo (don't create a README) from [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new) named **vuepress-static-app**.

1. Add the GitHub repository as a remote to your local repo. Make sure to add your GitHub username in place of the `<YOUR_USER_NAME>` placeholder in the following command.

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/vuepress-static-app
   ```

1. Push your local repo up to GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push --set-upstream origin main
   ```

## Deploy your web app

The following steps show you how to create a new static site app and deploy it to a production environment.

    > Browse to your GitHub repository and go to **Settings > Applications > Authorized OAuth Apps**, select **Azure Static Web Apps**, and then select **Grant**. For organization repositories, you must be an owner of the organization to grant the permissions.

1. In the _Build Details_ section, select **VuePress** from the _Build Presets_ drop-down and keep the default values.
