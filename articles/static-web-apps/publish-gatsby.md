# Deploy a Gatsby site to Azure Static Web Apps

This article demonstrates how to create and deploy a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) web application to [Azure Static Web Apps](overview.md). The final result is a new Static Web Apps site (with the associated GitHub Actions) that give you control over how the app is built and published.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, you can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- A GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can [create an account for free](https://github.com/join).
- A Git setup installed. If you don't have one, you can [install Git](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads). 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

## Create a Gatsby App

Create a Gatsby app using the Gatsby Command Line Interface (CLI):

1. Open a terminal
1. Use the [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) tool to create a new app with the Gatsby CLI. This may take a few minutes.

   ```bash
   npx gatsby new static-web-app
   ```

1. Go to the newly created app

   ```bash
   cd static-web-app
   ```

1. Initialize a Git repo

   ```bash
   git init
   git add -A
   git commit -m "initial commit"
   ```
> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the latest version of Gatsby you may need to modify the package.json to include
> "engines": {
> "node": ">=18.0.0"
> },
## Push your application to GitHub

You need to have a repository on GitHub to create a new Azure Static Web Apps resource.

1. Create a blank GitHub repository (don't create a README) from [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new) named **gatsby-static-web-app**.

1. Next, add the GitHub repository you just created as a remote to your local repo. Make sure to add your GitHub username in place of the `<YOUR_USER_NAME>` placeholder in the following command.

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/gatsby-static-web-app
   ```

1. Push your local repository up to GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push --set-upstream origin main
   ```

## Deploy your web app

The following steps show you how to create a new static site app and deploy it to a production environment.
