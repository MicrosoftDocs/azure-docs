# Deploy your web app to Azure Static Web Apps

In this article, you create a new web app with the framework of your choice, run it locally, then deploy to Azure Static Web Apps.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

| Resource | Description |
|---|---|
| [Azure subscription][1] | If you don't have one, you can [create an account for free][1]. |
| [Node.js][2] | Install version 20.0 or later. |
| [Azure CLI][3] | Install version 2.6x or later. |

You also need a text editor. For work with Azure, [Visual Studio Code][4] is recommended.

You can run the app you create in this article on the platform of your choice including: Linux, macOS, Windows, or Windows Subsystem for Linux.

## Create your web app

1. Open a terminal window.

::: zone pivot="vanilla-js"

2. Select an appropriate directory for your code, then run the following commands.

    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest swa-vanilla-demo -- --template=vanilla
    cd swa-vanilla-demo
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    As you run these commands, the development server prints the URL of your website. Select the link to open it in your default browser.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="angular"

2. Select an appropriate directory for your code, then run the following commands.

    ```bash
    npx --package @angular/cli@latest ng new swa-angular-demo --ssr=false --defaults
    cd swa-angular-demo
    npm start
    ```

    As you run these commands, the development server prints the URL of your website. Select the link to open it in your default browser.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="react"

2. Select an appropriate directory for your code, then run the following commands.

    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest swa-react-demo -- --template react
    cd swa-react-demo
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    As you run these commands, the development server prints the URL of your website. Select the link to open it in your default browser.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="vue"

2. Select an appropriate directory for your code, then run the following commands.

    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest swa-vue-demo -- --template vue
    cd swa-vue-demo
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    As you run these commands, the development server prints the URL of your website. Select the link to open it in your default browser.

::: zone pivot="angular"

> [!WARNING]
> Angular v17 and later place the distributable files in a subdirectory of the output path that you can choose. The SWA CLI doesn't know the specific location of the directory. The following steps show you how to set this path correctly.

Locate the generated *index.html* file in your project in the *dist/swa-angular-demo/browser* folder.

1. Set the `SWA_CLI_OUTPUT_LOCATION` environment variable to the directory containing the *index.html* file:

    # [bash](#tab/bash)

    ```bash
    export SWA_CLI_OUTPUT_LOCATION="dist/swa-angular-demo/browser"
    ```

    # [csh](#tab/csh)

    ```bash
    setenv SWA_CLI_OUTPUT_LOCATION "dist/swa-angular-demo/browser"
    ```

    # [PowerShell](#tab/pwsh)

    ```powershell
    $env:SWA_CLI_OUTPUT_LOCATION="dist/swa-angular-demo/browser"
    ```

    # [CMD](#tab/cmd)

    ```bash
    set SWA_CLI_OUTPUT_LOCATION="dist/swa-angular-demo/browser"
    ```

    ---

::: zone-end

## Deploy your site to Azure

Deploy your code to your static web app:

```bash
npx swa deploy --env production
```

It might take a few minutes to deploy the application. Once complete, the URL of your site is displayed.

On most systems, you can select the URL of the site to open it in your default browser.
