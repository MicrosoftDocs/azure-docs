Select **Review + create**.

:::image type="content" source="media/getting-started-portal/review-create.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the create button.":::

## View the website

There are two aspects to deploying a static app. The first creates the underlying Azure resources that make up your app. The second is a workflow that builds and publishes your application.

Before you can go to your new static site, the deployment build must first finish running.

The Static Web Apps Overview window displays a series of links that help you interact with your web app.

:::image type="content" source="../../articles/static-web-apps/media/getting-started/overview-window.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Static Web Apps overview window.":::

Selecting on the banner that says, Select here to check the status of your GitHub Actions runs takes you to the GitHub Actions running against your repository. Once you verify the deployment job is complete, then you can go to your website via the generated URL.

Once GitHub Actions workflow is complete, you can select the URL link to open the website in new tab.

## Set up your Next.js project locally to make changes

1. Clone the new repo to your machine. Make sure to replace <GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME> with your account name.

    ```bash
    git clone http://github.com/<GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME>/my-first-static-web-app
    ```

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor.

## Set up server side rendering

A managed backend is automatically available for every hybrid Next.js deployment in all plans. However, you can fine-tune performance and take more control of the backend by assigning a custom backend to your site. If you switch between a managed backend to a linked backend, your site experiences no downtime.

### Bring your own backend

You can improve performance and gain more control over the Next.js server side rendering when you bring your backend. Use the following steps to set up a custom backend for your site. 

[!INCLUDE [Server side rendering](../../includes/static-web-apps/static-web-apps-nextjs-backends.md)]

## Add Server-Rendered data with a Server Component

To add server-rendered data in your Next.js project using the App Router, edit a Next.js component to add a server-side operation to render data in the component. By default, Next.js components are [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating) that can be server-rendered.

1. Open the `app/page.tsx` file and add an operation that sets the value of a server-side computed variable. Examples include fetching data or other server operations.

    ```ts
    export default function Home() {
        const timeOnServer = new Date().toLocaleTimeString('en-US');
        return(
            ...
        );
    }
    ```

1. Import `unstable_noStore` from `next/cache` and call it within the `Home` component to ensure the route is dynamically rendered.

    ```ts
    import { unstable_noStore as noStore } from 'next/cache';

    export default function Home() {
        noStore();
    
        const timeOnServer = new Date().toLocaleTimeString('en-US');
        return(
            ...
        );
    }
    ```

    >[!NOTE]
    >This example forces dynamic rendering of this component to demonstrate server-rendering of the server's current time. The App Router model of Next.js recommends caching individual data requests to optimize the performance of your Next.js app. Read more on [data fetching and caching in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating).

1. Update the `Home` component in _app/pages.tsx_ to render the server-side data.

    ```ts
    import { unstable_noStore as noStore } from 'next/cache';

    export default function Home() {
        noStore();
    
        const timeOnServer = new Date().toLocaleTimeString('en-US');
        return(
            <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
                <div>
                    This is a Next.js application hosted on Azure Static Web Apps with hybrid rendering. The time on the server is <strong>{timeOnServer}</strong>.
                </div>
            </main>
        );
    }
    ```

## Adding an API route

In addition to Server Components, Next.js provides [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) you can use to create API routes to your Next.js application. You can fetch these APIs in [Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).

Begin by adding an API route.

1. Create a new file at `app/api/currentTime/route.tsx`. This file holds the Route Handler for the new API endpoint.

1. Add a handler function to return data from the API.

    ```ts
    import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

    export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';

    export async function GET() { 
        const currentTime = new Date().toLocaleTimeString('en-US');

        return NextResponse.json({ 
            message: `Hello from the API! The current time is ${currentTime}.`
        });
    }
    ```

1. Create a new file at `app/components/CurrentTimeFromAPI.tsx`. This component creates a container for the Client Component that fetches the API from the browser.

1. Add a client component that fetches the API in this file.

    ```ts
    'use client';
    
    import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
    
    export function CurrentTimeFromAPI(){
        const [apiResponse, setApiResponse] = useState('');
        const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
    
        useEffect(() => {
            fetch('/api/currentTime')
                .then((res) => res.json())
                .then((data) => {
                setApiResponse(data.message);
                setLoading(false);
                });
            }, 
        []);
    
        return (
            <div className='pt-4'>
                The message from the API is: <strong>{apiResponse}</strong>
            </div>
        )
    }
    ```

This Client Component fetches the API with a `useEffect` React hook to render the component after the load is complete. The `'use client'` directive identifies this element as a Client Component. For more information, see [Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).

1. Edit _app/page.tsx_ to import and render the `CurrentTimeFromAPI` Client Component.

    ```ts
    import { unstable_noStore as noStore } from 'next/cache';
    import { CurrentTimeFromAPI } from './components/CurrentTimeFromAPI';

    export default function Home() {
        noStore();
    
        const timeOnServer = new Date().toLocaleTimeString('en-US');
        return(
            <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
                <div>
                    This is a Next.js application hosted on Azure Static Web Apps with hybrid rendering. The time on the server is <strong>{timeOnServer}</strong>.
                </div>
                <CurrentTimeFromAPI />
            </main>
        );
    }
    ```

1. The result from the API route is displayed on the page.

## Configure the runtime version for Next.js

Certain Next.js versions require specific Node.js versions. To configure a specific Node version, you can set the `engines` property of your `package.json` file to designate a version.

```json
{
  ...
  "engines": {
    "node": "18.17.1"
  }
}
```

## Set environment variables for Next.js

Next.js uses environment variables at build time and at request time, to support both static page generation and dynamic page generation with server-side rendering. Therefore, set environment variables both within the build and deploy task, and in the _Environment variables_ of your Azure Static Web Apps resource.

```yml
...
      - name: Build And Deploy
        id: builddeploy
        uses: Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN }}
          repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Used for GitHub integrations (i.e. PR comments)
          action: "upload"
          app_location: "/" 
          api_location: ""
          output_location: "" 
        env:
          DB_HOST: ${{ secrets.DB_HOST }}
          DB_USER: ${{ secrets.DB_USER }}
          DB_DATABASE: ${{ secrets.DB_DATABASE }}
          DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}
          DB_PORT: ${{ secrets.DB_PORT }}
...
```

## Enable standalone feature

When your application size exceeds 250 MB, the Next.js [Output File Tracing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing) feature helps optimize the app size and enhance performance.

Output File Tracing creates a compressed version of the whole application with necessary package dependencies. This package is built into a folder named _.next/standalone_. With this package, your app can deploy on its own without _node_modules_ dependencies.

In order to enable the `standalone` feature, add the following property to your `next.config.js`:

```js
module.exports ={
    output:"standalone",
}
```

Next, configure the `build` command in the `package.json` file in order to copy static files to your standalone output.

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "build": "next build && cp -r .next/static .next/standalone/.next/ && cp -r public .next/standalone/"
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

## Configure routing and middleware for deployment

You can configure your Next.js project handle of routes with custom redirects, rewrites, and middleware. These handlers are commonly used for authentication, personalization, routing, and internationalization. Custom handling affects the default routing of your Next.js site and the configuration must be compatible with hosting on Static Web Apps.

Static Web Apps validates that your Next.js site is successfully deployed by adding a page to your site at build time. The page is named `public/.swa/health.html`, and Static Web Apps verifies the successful startup and deployment of your site by navigating to `/.swa/health.html` and verifying a successful response. Middleware and custom routing, which includes redirects and rewrites, can affect the access of the `/.swa/health.html` path, which can prevent Static Web Apps' deployment validation. To configure middleware and routing for a successful deployment to Static Web Apps, follow these steps:

1. Exclude routes starting with `.swa` in your `middleware.ts` (or `.js`) file in your middleware configuration.

    ```js
    export const config = {
      matcher: [
        /*
         * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
         * - .swa (Azure Static Web Apps)
         */
        '/((?!.swa).*)',
      ],
    }
    ```

1. Configure your redirects in `next.config.js` to exclude routes starting with `.swa`.

    ```js
    module.exports = {
        async redirects() {
            return [
              {
                source: '/((?!.swa).*)<YOUR MATCHING RULE>',
                destination: '<YOUR REDIRECT RULE>', 
                permanent: false,
              },
            ]
        },
    };
    ```

1. Configure your rewrite rules in `next.config.js` to exclude routes starting with `.swa`.

    ```js
    module.exports = {
        async rewrites() {
            return {
                beforeFiles: [
                    {
                        source: '/((?!.swa).*)<YOUR MATCHING RULE>',
                        destination: '<YOUR REWRITE RULE>', 
                    }
                ]
            }
        },
    };
    ```

These code snippets exclude paths that start with `.swa` to stop your custom routing or middleware from processing these requests. These rules ensure that the paths resolve as expected during deployment validation.

## Enable logging for Next.js

Following best practices for Next.js server API troubleshooting, add logging to the API to catch these errors. Logging on Azure uses **Application Insights**. In order to preload this SDK, you need to create a custom startup script. To learn more:
