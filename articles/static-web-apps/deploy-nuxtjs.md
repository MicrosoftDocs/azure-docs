# Deploy Nuxt 3 sites with universal rendering on Azure Static Web Apps

In this tutorial, you learn to deploy a [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/) application to [Azure Static Web Apps](overview.md). Nuxt 3 supports [universal (client-side and server-side) rendering](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/concepts/rendering/#universal-rendering), including server and API routes. Without extra configuration, you can deploy Nuxt 3 apps with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps. When the app is built in the Static Web Apps GitHub Action or Azure Pipelines task, Nuxt 3 automatically converts it into static assets and an Azure Functions app that are compatible with Azure Static Web Apps.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- A GitHub account. [Create an account for free](https://github.com/join).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 16 or later installed.

## Set up a Nuxt 3 app

You can set up a new Nuxt project using `npx nuxi init nuxt-app`. Instead of using a new project, this tutorial uses an existing repository set up to demonstrate how to deploy a Nuxt 3 site with universal rendering on Azure Static Web Apps.

1. Create a new repository under your GitHub account from a template repository.
1. Go to [http://github.com/staticwebdev/nuxt-3-starter/generate](https://github.com/login?return_to=/staticwebdev/nuxt-3-starter/generate)
1. Name the repository **nuxt-3-starter**.
1. Next, clone the new repo to your machine. Make sure to replace <YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME> with your account name.

    ```bash
    git clone http://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME>/nuxt-3-starter
    ```

1. Go to the newly cloned Nuxt.js app:

   ```bash
   cd nuxt-3-starter
   ```

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1. Start Nuxt.js app in development:

    ```bash
    npm run dev -- -o
    ```

Go to `http://localhost:3000` to open the app, where you should see the following website open in your preferred browser:

:::image type="content" source="media/deploy-nuxtjs/nuxt-3-app.png" alt-text="Start Nuxt.js app":::

When you select a framework/library, you should see a details page about the selected item:

:::image type="content" source="media/deploy-nuxtjs/start-nuxtjs-details.png" alt-text="Details page":::

## Generate a static website from Nuxt.js build

When you build a Nuxt.js site using `npm run build`, the app is built as a traditional web app, not a static site. To generate a static site, use the following application configuration.

1. Update the _package.json_'s build script to only generate a static site using the `nuxt generate` command:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "nuxt dev",
      "build": "nuxt generate"
    },
    ```

    Now with this command in place, Static Web Apps runs the `build` script every time you push a commit.

2. Generate a static site:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    Nuxt.js generates the static site and copy it into a _dist_ folder at the root of your working directory.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This folder is listed in the _.gitignore_ file because it should be generated by CI/CD when you deploy.

## Deploy your static website

The following steps show how to link the app you just pushed to GitHub to Azure Static Web Apps. Once in Azure, you can deploy the application to a production environment.

### Create an Azure Static Web Apps resource

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **Create a Resource**.
1. Search for **Static Web Apps**.
1. Select **Static Web Apps**.
1. Select **Create**.
1. On the _Basics_ tab, enter the following values.

    | Property | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | _Subscription_ | Your Azure subscription name. |
    | _Resource group_ | **my-nuxtjs-group**  |
    | _Name_ | **my-nuxt3-app** |
    | _Plan type_ | **Free** |
    | _Region for Azure Functions API and staging environments_ | Select a region closest to you. |
    | _Source_ | **GitHub** |

1. Select **Sign in with GitHub** and authenticate with GitHub.

1. Enter the following GitHub values.

    | Property | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | _Organization_ | Select your desired GitHub organization. |
    | _Repository_ | Select the repository you created earlier. |
    | _Branch_ | Select **main**. |

1. In the _Build Details_ section, select **Custom** from the _Build Presets_ drop-down and keep the default values.

1. In the _App location_, enter **/** in the box.
1. In the _Api location_, enter **.output/server** in the box.
1. In the _Output location_, enter **.output/public** in the box.

### Review and create

1. Select **Review + Create** to verify the details are all correct.

2. Select **Create** to start the creation of the App Service Static Web App and provision a GitHub Actions for deployment.

3. Once the deployment completes, select **Go to resource**.

4. On the _Overview_ window, select the *URL* link to open your deployed application.

If the website does note immediately load, then the background GitHub Actions workflow is still running. Once the workflow is complete you can then select refresh the browser to view your web app.

You can check the status of the Actions workflows by navigating to the Actions for your repository:

```url
https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/nuxt-3-starter/actions
```

### Synchronize changes

When you created the app, Azure Static Web Apps created a GitHub Actions workflow file in your repository. Return to the terminal and run the following command `git pull origin main` to pull the commit containing the new file.

## Configure dynamic routes

Go to the newly-deployed site and select one of the framework or library logos. Instead of getting a details page, you get a 404 error page.

:::image type="content" source="media/deploy-nuxtjs/404-in-production.png" alt-text="404 on dynamic routes":::

The reason for this is, Nuxt.js generated the static site, it only did so for the home page. Nuxt.js can generate equivalent static `.html` files for every `.vue` pages file, but there's an exception. 

If the page is a dynamic page, for example `_id.vue`, it won't have enough information to generate a static HTML from such dynamic page. You'll have to explicitly provide the possible paths for the dynamic routes.

## Generate static pages from dynamic routes

1. Update the _nuxt.config.js_ file so that Nuxt.js uses a list of all available data to generate static pages for each framework/library:

   ```javascript
     import { projects } from "./utils/projectsData";

     export default {
       mode: "universal",

       //...truncated

       generate: {
         async routes() {
           const paths = [];

           projects.forEach(project => {
             paths.push(`/project/${project.slug}`);
           });

           return paths;
         }
       }
     };
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > `routes` is an async function, so you can make a request to an API in this function and use the returned list to generate the paths.

Make changes to the app by updating the code and pushing it to GitHub. GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys the app.
