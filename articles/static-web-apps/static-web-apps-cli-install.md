# Install the Static Web Apps CLI (SWA CLI)

[!INCLUDE [Required version](includes/static-web-apps-cli-required-version.md)]

You have different options available to install the Azure Static Web Apps CLI. The Azure Static Web Apps CLI requires that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed locally. By default, Node.js comes with the Node Package Manager (npm), though you may opt to use other package managers such as [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

| Resource | Command |
|---|---|
| [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install) | `npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli` |
| [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/install/) | `yarn add @azure/static-web-apps-cli` |
| [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/cli/install) | `pnpm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli` |

> [!NOTE]
> SWA CLI only supports Node versions 16 and below.

## Validate install

Installing the package makes the `swa` command available on your machine. You can verify the installation is successful by requesting the CLI version.

```bash
swa --version
# When installed, the version number is printed out
```

## Usage

To begin using the CLI, you can run the `swa` command alone and follow the interactive prompts.

The SWA CLI interactive prompts help guide you through the different options important as you develop your web app.

Run the `swa` command to begin setting up your application.

```bash
swa
```

The `swa` command generates a configuration file, builds your project, and gives you the option to deploy to Azure.

For details on all the SWA CLI commands, see the [CLI reference](static-web-apps-cli.yml).

## Using npx

You can run any Static Web Apps CLI commands directly using npx. For example:

```bash
npx @azure/static-web-apps-cli --version
```

Alternatively, you can start the emulator via the `start` command:

```bash
npx @azure/static-web-apps-cli start
```
