#  Understand Your Bill for Microsoft Azure

The charges for Microsoft Azure subscriptions vary by rate plan. Some rate plans, such as the Visual Studio Ultimate with MSDN, include monthly credits that you can use on any Azure service based on your needs.

Please note that up to 24 hours of latent usage from your prior billing period can be reported in your current billing period.

For more information about consumption, usage, and rate plans, see the [Microsoft Azure Purchase Options page](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/).
