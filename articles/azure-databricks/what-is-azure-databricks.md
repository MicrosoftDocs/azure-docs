* **Operate at massive scale**. Scale your analytics and data science projects globally, without limits. 
* **Accelerate data processing on fast Spark engine**. With fast analytics engine optimized for Spark, you can target any size data or project using a complete set of analytics technologies. The technologies include SQL, Streaming, MLlib, and Graph

## Features

Azure Databricks incorporates features that handle the operational tasks of your Spark deployments with minimal guidance from data engineers and data scientists. By simplifying the operational management of your Spark clusters, teams can focus on building data products instead of maintaining infrastructure and managing operations.

### Fully managed Apache Spark clusters in the cloud

Azure Databricks offers a highly secure and reliable production environment in the cloud, managed and supported by Spark experts.  

* Powerful cluster management capabilities allow you to create new clusters in seconds. You can dynamically autoscale clusters up and down, including serverless clusters, and share them across teams. 
* Intuitive interfaces enable teams to use Spark with Power BI and other traditional BI tools such as Tableau Software via JDBC/ODBC cluster endpoints. You can also use the clusters programmatically by using the REST APIs. 
* Secure data integration capabilities built on top of Spark. These capabilities enable you to unify your data without centralization. 
* Instant access to the latest Apache Spark features with each release.

### Databricks runtime
The Databricks Runtime is built on top of Apache Spark and is natively built for the cloud. 

With **Serverless** option, Azure Databricks completely abstracts out the infrastructure complexity and the need for specialized expertise to set up and configure your data infrastructure. This is a huge benefit for Data Scientists to iterate quickly as a team.

For Data Engineers, who care deeply about the performance of production jobs, Azure Databricks provides a Spark engine that is faster and performant through various optimizations at the I/O layer and processing layer (Databricks I/O).

## Collaborative workspace

Through a collaborative and integrated environment, Azure Databricks streamlines the process of exploring data, prototyping, and running data-driven applications in Spark.

* Easy data exploration allows teams to determine what the data lets you do.
* Document your progress in notebooks in R, Python, Scala, or SQL.
* Visualize data in just a few clicks, and use familiar tools like matplotlib, ggoplot, or d3.
* Interactive dashboards enable teams to create dynamic reports.
* Entire teams can easily use Spark and interact with the data simultaneously.
