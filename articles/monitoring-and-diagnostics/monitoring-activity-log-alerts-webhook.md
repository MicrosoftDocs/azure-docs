# Webhooks for Azure Activity Log alerts
As part of the definition of an Action Group you are able to configure Webhook endpoints to receive Activity Log Alerts notifications. Webhooks allow you to route these notifications to other systems for post-processing or custom actions. This article shows what the payload for the HTTP POST to a webhook looks like.

For information on the setup and schema for Azure Activity Log alerts, [see this page instead](monitoring-activity-log-alerts.md).

## Authenticating the webhook
The webhook can authenticate using token-based authorization - The webhook URI is saved with a token ID, for example, `https://mysamplealert/webcallback?tokenid=sometokenid&someparameter=somevalue`

## Payload schema
The JSON payload contained in the POST operation differs based on the payload's data.context.activityLog.eventSource field.
