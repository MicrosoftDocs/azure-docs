# Develop secure cloud applications on Azure
## Abstract
This paper is a general guide to the security questions and controls you should consider at each phase of the software development lifecycle when developing applications for the cloud. Implementing these concepts before you release your product can help you build more secure software. The recommendations presented in this paper come from our experience with Azure security and the experiences of our customers.

This paper is intended to be a resource for software designers, developers, and testers at all levels who build and deploy secure Azure solutions.
