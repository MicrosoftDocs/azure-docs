# Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool

The Threat Modeling Tool is a core element of the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL). It allows software architects to identify and mitigate potential security issues early, when they are relatively easy and cost-effective to resolve. As a result, it greatly reduces the total cost of development. Also, we designed the tool with non-security experts in mind, making threat modeling easier for all developers by providing clear guidance on creating and analyzing threat models. 

The tool enables anyone to:

* Communicate about the security design of their systems
* Analyze those designs for potential security issues using a proven methodology
* Suggest and manage mitigations for security issues

Here are some tooling capabilities and innovations, just to name a few:

* **Automation:** Guidance and feedback in drawing a model
* **STRIDE per Element:** Guided analysis of threats and mitigations
* **Reporting:** Security activities and testing in the verification phase
* **Unique Methodology:** Enables users to better visualize and understand threats
* **Designed for Developers and Centered on Software:** many approaches are centered on assets or attackers. We are centered on software. We build on activities that all software developers and architects are familiar with -- such as drawing pictures for their software architecture
* **Focused on Design Analysis:** The term "threat modeling" can refer to either a requirements or a design analysis technique. Sometimes, it refers to a complex blend of the two. The Microsoft SDL approach to threat modeling is a focused design analysis technique
