# Azure Security MVP Program
Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs) are community leaders who’ve demonstrated an exemplary commitment to helping others get the most out of their experience with Microsoft technologies. They share their exceptional passion, real-world knowledge, and technical expertise with the community and with Microsoft.

We are happy to announce that Microsoft Azure now recognizes community experts with special expertise in Azure security. Microsoft MVPs can be awarded the MVP in Microsoft Azure in the Azure Security contribution area.

While there is no benchmark for becoming an MVP, in part because it varies by technology and its life-cycle, some of the criteria we evaluate include the impact of a nominee’s contributions to online forums such as Microsoft Answers, TechNet and MSDN; wikis and online content; conferences and user groups; podcasts, Web sites, blogs and social media; and articles and books.

Are you an expert in Azure security? Do you know someone who is? Then [Nominate yourself or someone else](https://mvp.microsoft.com/Nomination/nominate-an-mvp) to become an Azure security MVP today!
