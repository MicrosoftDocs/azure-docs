If there is a disruption to the primary site, Azure personnel from that site do not have to go to the secondary site, as there are Azure personnel already engaged and operating in the secondary site. An area-wide disruption or disaster at the primary site would not affect the Microsoft Azure secondary storage site since they are located in geographically separated regions for each system. <br /> Microsoft Azure personnel with logical access are located in Puget Sound, working remotely; therefore, there are no accessibility concerns for logical administration of Microsoft Azure. |

|||
|---|---|
| **Customer** | Customers do not control the telecommunications services that provide connectivity for systems in Azure. |
| **Provider (Microsoft Azure)** | Microsoft Azure is located within Microsoft Azure datacenters. Microsoft Azure is responsible for ensuring continuity of its telecommunications services through the process of utilizing diverse fiber routes and redundant hardware to provide maximum availability. Each of the datacenters represented as part of the Microsoft Azure boundary are active, independent from each other, and fully operational with the ability to provide services at any time. In addition to the active datacenter configuration, Microsoft Azure additionally mitigates the risk of single points of failures with telecommunication links by requiring each datacenter to have at least two diverse fiber paths. Microsoft owns and maintains its own fiber network whose purpose is to exclusively support Microsoft properties, acting as a global fiber backbone comparable to multiple ISPs. Microsoft contracts with Level 3 Communications to provide field service maintenance in the event of faults, defects, or failures. The service level objective for on-demand maintenance and critical time to repair is 4 hours. Critical problems are defined as incidents or outages, other than caused by an Excused Outage, which cause a Microsoft Equipment failure, as a result of which Microsoft cannot receive any data. |


 ### NIST 800-53 Control CP-8 (1).a

#### Telecommunications Services | Priority of Service Provisions

**CP-8 (1).a** The organization develops primary and alternate telecommunications service agreements that contain priority-of-service provisions in accordance with organizational availability requirements (including recovery time objectives).

|||
|---|---|
| **Customer** | Customers do not control the telecommunications services that provide connectivity for systems in Azure. |
| **Provider (Microsoft Azure)** | Microsoft Azure is located within Microsoft Azure datacenters. Microsoft Azure controls its own network routing, and therefore, Service Priority setting for emergency purposes is not required. Microsoft Azure is responsible for defining its own routing priority based on property availability requirements and emergency purposes. In the cloud environment, there is no priority order because there are different teams to bring each specific component back online in the RTOs defined for each component. All components are therefore a priority in an outage scenario. |


 ### NIST 800-53 Control CP-8 (1).b

#### Telecommunications Services | Priority of Service Provisions

**CP-8 (1).b** The organization requests Telecommunications Service Priority for all telecommunications services used for national security emergency preparedness in the event that the primary and/or alternate telecommunications services are provided by a common carrier.

**Responsibilities:** `Azure Only`

|||
|---|---|
| **Customer** | Customers do not control the telecommunications services that provide connectivity for systems in Azure. |
| **Provider (Microsoft Azure)** | Microsoft Azure is located within Microsoft Azure datacenters. Microsoft Azure controls its own network routing, and therefore, Service Priority setting for emergency purposes is not required. |


 ### NIST 800-53 Control CP-8 (2)

#### Telecommunications Services | Single Points of Failure

**CP-8 (2)** The organization obtains alternate telecommunications services to reduce the likelihood of sharing a single point of failure with primary telecommunications services.

**Responsibilities:** `Azure Only`

|||
|---|---|
| **Customer** | Customers do not control the telecommunications services that provide connectivity for systems in Azure. |
| **Provider (Microsoft Azure)** | Microsoft Azure mitigates the risk of single points of failures with telecommunication links by requiring each datacenter to have at least two diverse fiber paths. Microsoft owns and maintains its own fiber network whose purpose is to exclusively support Microsoft properties, acting as a global fiber backbone comparable to multiple ISPs. Microsoft Azure contracts with a large provider to provide field service maintenance in the event of faults, defects, or failures.

| **Provider (Microsoft Azure)** | Not Applicable |


 ### NIST 800-53 Control CP-9 (1)

#### Information System Backup | Testing for Reliability / Integrity

**CP-9 (1)** The organization tests backup information [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to verify media reliability and information integrity.

**Responsibilities:** `Azure Only`

|||
|---|---|
| **Customer** | Azure Recovery Services Vaults uses online storage; there is no customer backup media within the scope of systems deployed on Azure. |
| **Provider (Microsoft Azure)** | Microsoft Azure monitors backups on a continuous basis using system generated alerts which notify Microsoft Azure operations team of any failed or incomplete backups. In addition to system-generated alerts, restoration tests are performed for all backups owned by Microsoft Azure at least every 12 months using the BCDR Manager tool. The integrity of data is automatically confirmed upon completion of the backup. <br /> At any one time, Microsoft Azure SQL DB keeps three replicas of data, one primary replica and two secondary replicas. Microsoft Azure SQL DB uses a quorum based commit scheme where data is written to the primary and one secondary replica before the transaction is considered committed. If the hardware fails on the primary replica, Microsoft Azure SQL DB detects the failure and fails over to the secondary replica. In case of a physical loss of a replica, Microsoft Azure SQL DB creates a new replica automatically. Therefore, there are at least two physical transaction consistent copies of customer data in the datacenter. Microsoft Azure SQL DB will not write transactions to the database unless primary and secondary replicas are made. |
