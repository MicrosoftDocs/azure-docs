# Azure infrastructure availability
This article provides information about what Microsoft does to secure the Azure infrastructure and provide maximum availability of customers' data. Azure provides robust availability, based on extensive redundancy achieved with virtualization technology.

## Temporary outages and natural disaster
The Microsoft Cloud Infrastructure and Operations team designs, builds, operates, and improves the security of the cloud infrastructure. This team ensures that the Azure infrastructure is delivering high availability and reliability, high efficiency, and smart scalability. The team provides a more secure, private, and trusted cloud.

Uninterruptible power supplies and vast banks of batteries ensure that electricity remains continuous if a short-term power disruption occurs. Emergency generators provide backup power for extended outages and planned maintenance. If a natural disaster occurs, the datacenter can use onsite fuel reserves.

High-speed and robust fiber optic networks connect datacenters with other major hubs and internet users. Compute nodes host workloads closer to users to reduce latency, provide geo-redundancy, and increase overall service resiliency. A team of engineers works around the clock to ensure services are persistently available.

Microsoft ensures high availability through advanced monitoring and incident response, service support, and backup failover capability. Geographically distributed Microsoft operations centers operate 24/7/365. The Azure network is one of the largest in the world. The fiber optic and content distribution network connects datacenters and edge nodes to ensure high performance and reliability.

## Disaster recovery
Azure keeps your data durable in two locations. You can choose the location of the backup site. In the primary location, Azure constantly maintains three healthy replicas of your data.

## Database availability
Azure ensures that a database is internet accessible through an internet gateway with sustained database availability. Monitoring assesses the health and state of the active databases at five-minute time intervals.

## Storage availability
Azure delivers storage through a highly scalable and durable storage service, which provides connectivity endpoints. This means that an application can access the storage service directly. The storage service processes incoming storage requests efficiently, with transactional integrity.
