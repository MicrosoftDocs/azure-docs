# Security services and technologies available on Azure

In our discussions with current and future Azure customers, we're often asked "do you have a list of all the security-related services and technologies that Azure has to offer?"

When you evaluate cloud service provider options, it's helpful to have this information. So we have provided this list to get you started.

Over time, this list will change and grow, just as Azure does. Make sure to check this page on a regular basis to stay up-to-date on our security-related services and technologies.
