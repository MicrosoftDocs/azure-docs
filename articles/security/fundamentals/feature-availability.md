## Azure Government

Azure Government uses the same underlying technologies as Azure (sometimes referred to as Azure Commercial or Azure Public), which includes the core components of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Both Azure and Azure Government have comprehensive security controls in place, and the Microsoft commitment on the safeguarding of customer data.

Azure Government is a physically isolated cloud environment dedicated to US federal, state, local, and tribal governments, and their partners. Whereas both cloud environments are assessed and authorized at the FedRAMP High impact level, Azure Government provides an extra layer of protection to customers through contractual commitments regarding storage of customer data in the United States and limiting potential access to systems processing customer data to screened US persons. These commitments may be of interest to customers using the cloud to store or process data subject to US export control regulations such as the EAR, ITAR, and DoE 10 CFR Part 810.

For more information about Azure Government, see [What is Azure Government?](../../azure-government/documentation-government-welcome.md)

> [!NOTE]
> These lists and tables do not include feature or bundle availability in the Azure Government Secret or Azure Government Top Secret clouds. 
> For more information about specific availability for air-gapped clouds, please contact your account team.

## Microsoft 365 integration

Integrations between products rely on interoperability between Azure and Office platforms. Offerings hosted in the Azure environment are accessible from the Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Microsoft 365 Government platforms. Office 365 and Office 365 GCC are paired with Microsoft Entra ID in Azure. Office 365 GCC High and Office 365 DoD are paired with Microsoft Entra ID in Azure Government.

The following diagram displays the hierarchy of Microsoft clouds and how they relate to each other.

:::image type="content" source="media/microsoft-365-cloud-integration.png" alt-text="Microsoft 365 cloud integration.":::

The Office 365 GCC environment helps customers comply with US government requirements, including FedRAMP High, CJIS, and IRS 1075. The Office 365 GCC High and DoD environments support customers who need compliance with DoD IL4/5, DFARS 7012, NIST 800-171, and ITAR.

For more information about Office 365 US Government environments, see:

- [Office 365 GCC](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc)
- [Office 365 GCC High and DoD](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc-high-and-dod)

The following sections identify when a service has an integration with Microsoft 365 and the feature availability for Office 365 GCC, Office 365 High, and Office 365 DoD.

## Azure Information Protection

Azure Information Protection (AIP) is a cloud-based solution that enables organizations to discover, classify, and protect documents and emails by applying labels to content.

AIP is part of the Microsoft Purview Information Protection (MIP) solution, and extends the [labeling](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels) and [classification](/microsoft-365/compliance/data-classification-overview) functionality provided by Microsoft 365.

For more information, see the [Azure Information Protection product documentation](/azure/information-protection/).

- Office 365 GCC is paired with Microsoft Entra ID in Azure. Office 365 GCC High and Office 365 DoD are paired with Microsoft Entra ID in Azure Government. Make sure to pay attention to the Azure environment to understand where [interoperability is possible](#microsoft-365-integration). In the following table, interoperability that is *not* possible is marked with a dash (-) to indicate that support is not relevant.

- Extra configurations are required for GCC-High and DoD customers. For more information, see [Azure Information Protection Premium Government Service Description](/enterprise-mobility-security/solutions/ems-aip-premium-govt-service-description).

> [!NOTE]
> More details about support for government customers are listed in footnotes below the table.

> Extra steps are required for configuring Azure Information Protection for GCC High and DoD customers. For more information, see the [Azure Information Protection Premium Government Service Description](/enterprise-mobility-security/solutions/ems-aip-premium-govt-service-description).

## Azure Attestation

Microsoft Azure Attestation is a unified solution for remotely verifying the trustworthiness of a platform and integrity of the binaries running inside it. The service receives evidence from the platform, validates it with security standards, evaluates it against configurable policies, and produces an attestation token for claims-based applications (e.g., relying parties, auditing authorities).

Azure Attestation is currently available in multiple regions across Azure public and Government clouds. In Azure Government, the service is available in preview status across US Gov Virginia and US Gov Arizona. 

For more information, see Azure Attestation [public documentation](/azure/attestation/overview).
