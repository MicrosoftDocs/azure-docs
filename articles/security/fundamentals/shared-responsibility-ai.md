# Artificial intelligence (AI) shared responsibility model

As you consider and evaluate AI enabled integration, it's critical to understand the shared responsibility model and which tasks the AI platform or application provider handle and which tasks you handle. The workload responsibilities vary depending on whether the AI integration is based on Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

## Division of responsibility
As with cloud services, you have options when implementing AI capabilities for your organization. Depending on which option you choose, you take responsibility for different parts of the necessary operations and policies needed to use AI safely.

The following diagram illustrates the areas of responsibility between you and Microsoft according to the type of deployment.

## AI layer overview
An AI enabled application consists of three layers of functionality that group together tasks, which you or an AI provider perform. The security responsibilities generally reside with whoever performs the tasks, but an AI provider might choose to expose security or other controls as a configuration option to you as appropriate. These three layers include:

### AI platform
The AI platform layer provides the AI capabilities to the applications. At the platform layer, there's a need to build and safeguard the infrastructure that runs the AI model, training data, and specific configurations that change the behavior of the model, such as weights and biases. This layer provides access to functionality via APIs, which pass text known as a *Metaprompt* to the AI model for processing, then return the generated outcome, known as a *Prompt-Response*.

**AI platform security considerations** - To protect the AI platform from malicious inputs, a safety system must be built to filter out the potentially harmful instructions sent to the AI model (inputs). As AI models are generative, there's also a potential that some harmful content might be generated and returned to the user (outputs). Any safety system must first protect against potentially harmful inputs and outputs of many classifications including hate, jailbreaks, and others. These classifications will likely evolve over time based on model knowledge, locale, and industry.

Microsoft has built-in safety systems for both PaaS and SaaS offerings:

- PaaS - [Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/ai-services/openai/overview)
- SaaS - [Microsoft Security Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot)

### AI application
The AI application accesses the AI capabilities and provides the service or interface that the user consumes. The components in this layer can vary from relatively simple to highly complex, depending on the application. The simplest standalone AI applications act as an interface to a set of APIs taking a text-based user-prompt and passing that data to the model for a response. More complex AI applications include the ability to ground the user-prompt with extra context, including a persistence layer, semantic index, or via plugins to allow access to more data sources. Advanced AI applications might also interface with existing applications and systems. Existing applications and systems might work across text, audio, and images to generate various types of content.

**AI application security considerations** - An application safety system must be built to protect the AI application from malicious activities. The safety system provides deep inspection of the content being used in the Metaprompt sent to the AI model. The safety system also inspects the interactions with any plugins, data connectors, and other AI applications (known as AI Orchestration). One way you can incorporate this in your own IaaS/PaaS based AI application is to use the [Azure AI Content Safety](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/ai-content-safety/) service. Other capabilities are available depending on your needs.

### AI usage
The AI usage layer describes how the AI capabilities are ultimately used and consumed. Generative AI offers a new type of user/computer interface that is fundamentally different from other computer interfaces, such as API, command-prompt, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The generative AI interface is both interactive and dynamic, allowing the computer capabilities to adjust to the user and their intent. The generative AI interface contrasts with previous interfaces that primarily force users to learn the system design and functionality and adjust to it. This interactivity allows user input, instead of application designers, to have a high level of influence of the output of the system, making safety guardrails critical to protecting people, data, and business assets.

**AI usage security considerations** - Protecting AI usage is similar to any computer system as it relies on security assurances for identity and access controls, device protections and monitoring, data protection and governance, administrative controls, and other controls.

More emphasis is required on user behavior and accountability because of the increased influence users have on the output of the systems. It's critical to update acceptable use policies and educate users on the difference of standard IT applications to AI enabled applications. These should include AI specific considerations related to security, privacy, and ethics. Additionally, users should be educated on AI based attacks that can be used to trick them with convincing fake text, voices, videos, and more.

AI specific attack types are defined in:

- [Microsoft Security Response Center's (MSRC) vulnerability severity classification for AI systems](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/aibugbar)
- [MITRE Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems (ATLAS)](https://atlas.mitre.org/)
- [OWASP top 10 for Large Language Model (LLM) applications](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/)
- [OWASP Machine Learning (ML) security top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10/)
- [NIST AI risk management framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework)

## Security lifecycle
As with security for other types of capability, it's critical to plan for a complete approach. A complete approach includes people, process, and technology across the full security lifecycle: identify, protect, detect, respond, recover, and govern. Any gap or weakness in this lifecycle could have you:

- Fail to secure important assets
- Experience easily preventable attacks
- Unable to handle attacks
- Unable to rapidly restore business critical services
- Apply controls inconsistently

## Configure before customize
Microsoft recommends organizations start with SaaS based approaches  like the Copilot model for their initial adoption of AI and for all subsequent AI workloads. This minimizes the level of responsibility and expertise your organization has to provide to design, operate, and secure these highly complex capabilities.

If the current "off the shelf" capabilities don't meet the specific needs for a workload, you can adopt a PaaS model by using AI services, such as [Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/ai-services/openai/overview), to meet those specific requirements.

Custom model building should only be adopted by organizations with deep expertise in data science and the security, privacy, and ethical considerations of AI.

To help bring AI to the world, Microsoft is developing Copilot solutions for each of the main productivity solutions: from Bing and Windows, to GitHub and Office 365. Microsoft is developing full stack solutions for all types of productivity scenarios. These are offered as SaaS solutions. Built into the user interface of the product, they're tuned to assist the user with specific tasks to increase productivity.

Microsoft ensures that every Copilot solution is engineered following our strong principles for [AI governance](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/05/25/how-do-we-best-govern-ai/).
