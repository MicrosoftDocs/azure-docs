# Azure security best practices and patterns

This article contains security best practices to use when you're designing, deploying, and managing your cloud solutions by using Azure. These best practices come from our experience with Azure security and the experiences of customers like you.

## Best practices

These best practices are intended to be a resource for IT pros. IT pros include designers, architects, developers, and testers who build and deploy secure Azure solutions.

## Next steps

Microsoft finds that using security benchmarks can help you quickly secure cloud deployments. Benchmark recommendations from your cloud service provider give you a starting point for selecting specific security configuration settings in your environment and allow you to quickly reduce risk to your organization. See the [Microsoft cloud security benchmark](/security/benchmark/azure/introduction) for a collection of high-impact security recommendations to help secure the services you use in Azure.
