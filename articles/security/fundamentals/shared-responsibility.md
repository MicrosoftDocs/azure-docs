# Shared responsibility in the cloud

As you consider and evaluate public cloud services, it's critical to understand the shared responsibility model and which security tasks the cloud provider handles and which tasks you handle. The workload responsibilities vary depending on whether the workload is hosted on Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), or in an on-premises datacenter:

- **[IaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-iaas)** (Infrastructure as a Service): You manage virtual machines, operating systems, and applications. Examples include Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Disk Storage, and virtual networks.
- **[PaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-paas)** (Platform as a Service): You deploy applications without managing VMs or operating systems. Examples include Azure App Service, Azure Functions, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Storage.
- **[SaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-saas)** (Software as a Service): You use ready-made applications. Examples include Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and other cloud applications.

Many Azure solutions use a combination of service models. For more detailed guidance on choosing compute services, see [Choose an Azure compute service](/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/compute-decision-tree).

## Division of responsibility

In an on-premises datacenter, you own the whole stack. As you move to the cloud, some responsibilities transfer to Microsoft. The following diagram illustrates the areas of responsibility between you and Microsoft, according to the type of deployment of your stack.

:::image type="content" source="media/shared-responsibility/shared-responsibility.svg" alt-text="Diagram showing responsibility zones." border="false":::

For all cloud deployment types, you own your data and identities. You're responsible for protecting the security of your data and identities, on-premises resources, and the cloud components you control. Cloud components you control vary by service type.

### Responsibility matrix

The following table details the division of responsibility between you and Microsoft for each area of your stack:

| Responsibility area | On-premises | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Customer data | Customer | Customer | Customer | Customer |
| Configurations and settings | Customer | Customer | Customer | Customer |
| Identities and users | Customer | Customer | Customer | Customer |
| Client devices | Customer | Customer | Customer | Shared |
| Applications | Customer | Customer | Shared | Shared |
| Network controls | Customer | Customer | Shared | Microsoft |
| Operating system | Customer | Customer | Microsoft | Microsoft |
| Physical hosts | Customer | Microsoft | Microsoft | Microsoft |
| Physical network | Customer | Microsoft | Microsoft | Microsoft |
| Physical datacenter | Customer | Microsoft | Microsoft | Microsoft |

### Responsibilities you always retain

Regardless of the type of deployment, you always retain the following responsibilities:

- **Data** - You're responsible for your data, including data classification, data protection, encryption decisions, and compliance with data governance requirements.
- **Endpoints** - You're responsible for protecting client devices and endpoints that access your cloud services, including mobile devices, laptops, and desktops.
- **Accounts** - You're responsible for managing user accounts, including creating, managing, and removing user access.
- **Access management** - You're responsible for implementing and managing access controls, including role-based access control (RBAC), multifactor authentication, and conditional access policies.

### Shared responsibilities explained

Some responsibilities are shared between you and Microsoft, with the division varying by service model:

- **Applications** - In IaaS, you're fully responsible for deployed applications. In PaaS and SaaS, Microsoft manages parts of the application stack, but you're responsible for application configuration, code security, and access controls.
- **Network controls** - In IaaS, you configure all network security including firewalls and network segmentation. In PaaS, Microsoft provides baseline network security, but you configure application-level network controls. In SaaS, Microsoft manages network security.
- **Client devices** - In SaaS scenarios, Microsoft may provide some device management capabilities, but you're responsible for endpoint protection and compliance.

### Microsoft responsibilities

Microsoft is responsible for the underlying cloud infrastructure, which includes:

- **Physical security** - Securing datacenters, including facilities, physical access controls, and environmental controls.
- **Physical network** - Managing network infrastructure, including routers, switches, and cables within datacenters.
- **Physical hosts** - Managing and maintaining the physical servers that host cloud services.
- **Hypervisor** - Managing the virtualization layer that enables virtual machines in IaaS and PaaS.
- **Platform services** - In PaaS and SaaS, Microsoft manages operating systems, runtime environments, and middleware.

## AI shared responsibility

When using AI services, the shared responsibility model introduces unique considerations beyond traditional IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Microsoft is responsible for securing the AI infrastructure, model hosting, and platform-level safeguards. Customers, however, remain accountable for how AI is applied within their environment—this includes protecting sensitive data, managing prompt security, mitigating prompt injection risks, and ensuring compliance with organizational and regulatory requirements.

Because responsibilities differ significantly for AI workloads, you should review the [AI Shared Responsibility Model](/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility-ai) for detailed guidance on roles, best practices, and risk management.

## Cloud security advantages
The cloud offers significant advantages for solving long standing information security challenges. In an on-premises environment, organizations likely have unmet responsibilities and limited resources available to invest in security, which creates an environment where attackers are able to exploit vulnerabilities at all layers.

Common examples of unmet responsibilities in traditional on-premises environments include:

- **Delayed patching** - Security updates aren't applied promptly due to limited IT staff or concerns about system downtime, leaving known vulnerabilities exposed.
- **Inadequate physical security** - Server rooms may lack proper access controls, environmental monitoring, or surveillance due to budget constraints.
- **Incomplete network monitoring** - Organizations may not have tools or expertise to detect intrusions, monitor traffic anomalies, or respond to threats in real time.
- **Outdated hardware** - Aging infrastructure may no longer receive security updates from vendors, creating permanent security gaps.
- **Insufficient backup and disaster recovery** - Backups may be infrequent, untested, or stored on-site, leaving data vulnerable to ransomware or physical disasters.

The following diagram shows a traditional approach where many security responsibilities are unmet due to limited resources. In the cloud-enabled approach, you're able to shift day to day security responsibilities to your cloud provider and reallocate your resources.

In the cloud-enabled approach, you're also able to apply cloud-based security capabilities for more effectiveness and use cloud intelligence to improve your threat detection and response time. By shifting responsibilities to the cloud provider, organizations can get more security coverage, which enables them to reallocate security resources and budget to other business priorities.
