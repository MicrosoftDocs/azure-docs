[How to set security in DevTest Labs](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Windows-Azure/How-to-set-security-in-your-DevTest-Lab)

As an owner of your lab, you can secure lab access by via two lab roles: Owner and DevTest Labs User. A person in the Owner role has complete access in the lab whereas a person in the DevTest Labs User role has limited access. In this video, we will show you how to add a person in either of these roles to a lab.

[Managing Secrets for Azure Apps](https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2016/P456)

Every serious app you deploy on Azure has critical secrets – connection strings, certificates, keys. Silly mistakes in managing these lead to fatal consequences – leaks, outages, compliance violations. As multiple recent surveys point out, silly mistakes cause 4 times more data breaches than adversaries. In this session we will go over some best practices to manage your important app secrets. These may seem like common sense, yet a lot of developers neglect them. We will also go over how to leverage Azure Key Vault to implement those best practices. As an added benefit, following these practices will also help you demonstrate compliance with standards such as SOC. The first ten minutes of the session are level 100 and they apply to any cloud app you develop on any platform. The remainder is level 200-300 and focuses on apps you build on the Azure platform.
