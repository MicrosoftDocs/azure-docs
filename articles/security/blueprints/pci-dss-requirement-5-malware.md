# Malware requirements for PCI DSS-compliant environments 
## PCI DSS Requirement 5

**Protect all systems against malware and regularly update anti-virus software or programs**  

> [!NOTE]
> These requirements are defined by the [Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/) as part of the [PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) Version 3.2](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss). Please refer to the PCI DSS for information on testing procedures and guidance for each requirement.

Malicious software, commonly referred to as “malware”—including viruses, worms, and Trojans—enters the network during many business-approved activities including employee e-mail and use of the Internet, mobile computers, and storage devices, resulting in the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. Anti-virus software must be used on all systems commonly affected by malware to protect systems from current and evolving malicious software threats. Additional anti-malware solutions may be considered as a supplement to the anti-virus software; however, such additional solutions do not replace the need for anti-virus software to be in place.

## PCI DSS Requirement 5.1

**5.1** Deploy anti-virus software on all systems commonly affected by malicious software (particularly personal computers and servers).

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Shared`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Microsoft Azure manages anti-malware for PaaS services. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore provides protection against malware. For more information, see [PCI Guidance - Malware Protection](payment-processing-blueprint.md#security-and-malware-protection).<br /><br />|



### PCI DSS Requirement 5.1.1

**5.1.1** Ensure that anti-virus programs are capable of detecting, removing, and protecting against all known types of malicious software.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Shared`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Microsoft Azure manages anti-malware for PaaS services, and offers Azure Antimalware for IaaS instances. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore anti-virus and anti-malware solution is designed to detect and remove malware and protect against malicious software. For more information, see [PCI Guidance - Malware Protection](payment-processing-blueprint.md#security-and-malware-protection).<br /><br />|



### PCI DSS Requirement 5.1.2

**5.1.2** For systems considered to be not commonly affected by malicious software, perform periodic evaluations to identify and evaluate evolving malware threats in order to confirm whether such systems continue to not require anti-virus software.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Shared`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Microsoft Azure manages anti-malware for PaaS services, and offers Azure Antimalware for IaaS instances. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore provides protection against malware. For more information, see [PCI Guidance - Malware Protection](payment-processing-blueprint.md#security-and-malware-protection).<br /><br />|



## PCI DSS Requirement 5.2

**5.2** Ensure that all anti-virus mechanisms are maintained as follows:
- Are kept current.
- Perform periodic scans.
- Generate audit logs which are retained per PCI DSS Requirement 10.7.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Shared`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Microsoft Azure manages anti-malware for PaaS services, and offers Azure Antimalware for IaaS instances. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore is kept current using Azure Security Center. For more information, see [PCI Guidance - Malware Protection](payment-processing-blueprint.md#security-and-malware-protection).<br /><br />|



## PCI DSS Requirement 5.3

**5.3** Ensure that anti-virus mechanisms are actively running and cannot be disabled or altered by users, unless specifically authorized by management on a case-by-case basis for a limited time period. 

> [!NOTE]
> Anti-virus solutions may be temporarily disabled only if there is legitimate technical need, as authorized by management on a case-by-case basis. If anti-virus protection needs to be disabled for a specific purpose, it must be formally authorized. Additional security measures may also need to be implemented for the period of time during which anti-virus protection is not active.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Shared`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Microsoft Azure manages anti-malware for PaaS services, and offers Azure Antimalware for IaaS instances. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore provides protection against malware. For more information, see [PCI Guidance - Malware Protection](payment-processing-blueprint.md#security-and-malware-protection).<br /><br />|



## PCI DSS Requirement 5.4

**5.4** Ensure that security policies and operational procedures for protecting systems against malware are documented, in use, and known to all affected parties.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Shared`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Microsoft Azure manages anti-malware for PaaS services, and offers Azure Antimalware for IaaS instances. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore documentation provides guidance for the deployment of Azure Security Center. For more information, see [PCI Guidance - Malware Protection](payment-processing-blueprint.md#security-and-malware-protection).|
