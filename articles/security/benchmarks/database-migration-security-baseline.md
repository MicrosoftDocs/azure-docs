# Azure security baseline for Azure Database Migration Service

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 2.0](overview.md) to Azure Database Migration Service. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Database Migration Service. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Database Migration Service have been excluded.

To see how Azure Database Migration Service completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Database Migration Service security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-network-security).*

### NS-1: Implement security for internal traffic

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39954).

**Guidance**: When you deploy Azure Database Migration Service resources you must create or use an existing virtual network. Ensure that all Azure virtual networks follow an enterprise segmentation principle that aligns to the business risks. Any system that could incur higher risk for the organization should be isolated within its own virtual network and sufficiently secured with either a network security group (NSG) and/or Azure Firewall.

- [How to create a network security group with security rules](../../virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic.md)

 

- [How to deploy and configure Azure Firewall](../../firewall/tutorial-firewall-deploy-portal.md) 

- [Follow pre-requisite documentation for ports to be open for Azure Database Migration Service here](../../dms/pre-reqs.md#prerequisites-common-across-migration-scenarios)

Use Azure Sentinel to discover the use of legacy insecure protocols such as SSL/TLSv1, SMBv1, LM/NTLMv1, wDigest, Unsigned LDAP Binds, and weak ciphers in Kerberos.

- [Azure Sentinel insecure protocols workbook](../../sentinel/quickstart-get-visibility.md#use-built-in-workbooks) 

Azure Database Migration Service uses TLS 1.2 by default. If needed for backward compatibility for the data source being migrated, support for TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1 can be enabled in the service configuration blade of your Azure Database Migration Service.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### NS-2: Connect private networks together

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39955).

**Guidance**: Use Azure ExpressRoute or Azure virtual private network (VPN) to create private connections between Azure datacenters and on-premises infrastructure in a colocation environment. ExpressRoute connections do not go over the public internet, and they offer more reliability, faster speeds, and lower latencies than typical internet connections. For point-to-site VPN and site-to-site VPN, you can connect on-premises devices or networks to a virtual network using any combination of these VPN options and Azure ExpressRoute. To connect two or more virtual networks in Azure together, use virtual network peering. Network traffic between peered virtual networks is private and is kept on the Azure backbone network.

- [Azure VPN overview](../../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md) 

- [Virtual network peering](../../virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### NS-3: Establish private network access to Azure services

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39956).

**Guidance**: Use Azure Private Link to enable private access to Azure services from your virtual networks, without crossing the internet. In situations where Azure Private Link is not yet available, use Azure Virtual Network service endpoints.  Azure Virtual Network service endpoints provide secure access to services via an optimized route over the Azure backbone network.  

Private access is an additional defense in depth measure in addition to authentication and traffic security offered by Azure services.

Where Private Link is available, use private endpoints to secure any resources being linked to your Azure Database Migration Service, such as Azure SQL Server. With Private Link, traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet.

- [Make sure the prerequisites listed here are fulfilled before provisioning Azure Database Migration Service on your VNET, including the communication ports that need to be allowed](../../dms/pre-reqs.md)

   

- [Understand Azure Private Link](../../private-link/private-link-overview.md)

- [Understand Virtual Network service endpoints](../../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview.md)

Azure Database Migration Service does not not provide the capability to configure Service Endpoints.

Azure Database Migration Service does not allow for its management endpoints to be secure to a private network with the Private Link service.

### NS-4: Protect applications and services from external network attacks

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39957).

**Guidance**: Protect your Azure Database Migration Service resources against attacks from external networks, including distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, application specific attacks, and unsolicited and potentially malicious internet traffic. Use Azure Firewall to protect applications and services against potentially malicious traffic from the internet and other external locations. Protect your assets against DDoS attacks by enabling DDoS standard protection on your Azure virtual networks. Use Azure Security Center to detect misconfiguration risks related to your network related resources.

- [Manage Azure DDoS Protection Standard using the Azure Portal](/azure/virtual-network/manage-ddos-protection) 

- [Azure Security Center recommendations](../../security-center/recommendations-reference.md#recs-network) 

Azure Database Migration Service is not intended to run web applications, and does not require you to configure any additional settings or deploy any extra network services to protect it from external network attacks targeting web applications.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### NS-5: Deploy intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39958).

**Guidance**: Use Azure Firewall with threat intelligence-based filtering to alert on and/or block traffic to and from known

malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat
Intelligence feed. When payload inspection is required, you can deploy a third-party IDS/IPS solution from Azure Marketplace with payload inspection capabilities. Alternately you may choose to use host-based IDS/IPS or a
host-based endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution in conjunction with or instead of network-based
IDS/IPS.

Note: If you have a regulatory or other requirement for IDS/IPS use, ensure that it is always tuned to provide
high quality alerts to your SIEM solution.

## Identity Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity Management](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-identity-management).*

### IM-1: Standardize Azure Active Directory as the central identity and authentication system

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39940).

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration Service uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the default identity and access management service. You should standardize Azure AD to govern your organization’s identity and access management in:
Microsoft Cloud resources, such as the Azure portal, Azure Storage, Azure Virtual Machine (Linux and Windows), Azure Key Vault, PaaS, and SaaS applications.

Your organization's resources, such as applications on Azure or your corporate network resources.

Securing Azure AD should be a high priority in your organization’s cloud security practice. Azure AD provides an identity secure score to help you assess identity security posture relative to Microsoft’s best practice recommendations. Use the score to gauge how closely your configuration matches best practice recommendations, and to make improvements in your security posture.

Note: Azure AD supports external identity that allow users without a Microsoft account to sign-in to their applications and resources with their external identity.

>[!NOTE]
>Because the Responsibility field is set to "Not applicable", this section will be omitted from the published baseline.

**Guidance**: Not applicable; Azure Database Migration Service doesn't use any identities or manage any secrets for identities.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Not applicable

### IM-3: Use Azure AD single sign-on (SSO) for application access

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39942).

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration Service: Use Azure Active Directory to provide identity and access management to Azure resources, cloud applications, and on-premises applications. This includes enterprise identities such as employees, as well as external identities such as partners, vendors, and suppliers. This enables single sign-on (SSO) to manage and secure access to your organization’s data and resources on-premises and in the cloud. Connect all your users, applications, and devices to the Azure AD for seamless, secure access and greater visibility and control.

- [Understand Application SSO with Azure AD](../../active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-4: Use strong authentication controls for all Azure Active Directory based access

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39943).

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration Service uses Azure Active Directory that supports strong authentication controls through multi-factor authentication (MFA), and strong passwordless methods.
Multi-factor authentication - Enable Azure AD MFA and follow Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management recommendations for some best practices in your MFA setup. MFA can be enforced on all, select users or at the per-user level based on sign-in conditions and risk factors.

Passwordless authentication – Three passwordless authentication options are available: Windows Hello for Business, Microsoft Authenticator app, and on-premises authentication methods such as smart cards.

For administrator and privileged users, ensure the highest level of the strong authentication method are used, followed by rolling out the appropriate strong authentication policy to other users.

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39944).

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration Service  is integrated with Azure Active Directory in which provides the following data sources:
Sign-ins - The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.

Audit logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.

Risky sign-ins - A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.

Users flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

These data sources can be integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or third party SIEM systems.

Azure Security Center can also alert on certain suspicious activities such as excessive number of failed authentication attempts, deprecated accounts in the subscription.

Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a security solution that can use Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions.

### PA-3: Review and reconcile user access regularly

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39949).

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration Service uses Azure Active Directory (AAD) accounts to manage its resources, review user accounts and access assignment regularly to ensure the accounts and their access are valid. You can use Azure AD access reviews to review group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. Azure AD reporting can provide logs to help discover stale accounts. You can also use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management to create access review report workflow to facilitate the review process.

In addition, Azure Privileged Identity Management can also be configured to alert when an excessive number of administrator accounts are created, and to identify administrator accounts that are stale or improperly configured.

Note: Some Azure services support local users and roles which not managed through Azure AD. You will need to manage these users separately.

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39950).

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration Service uses Azure Active Directory to manage its resources. To prevent being accidentally locked out of your Azure AD organization, set up an emergency access account for access when normal administrative accounts cannot be used. Emergency access accounts are usually highly privileged, and they should not be assigned to specific individuals. Emergency access accounts are limited to emergency or "break glass"' scenarios where normal administrative accounts can't be used.

You should ensure that the credentials (such as password, certificate, or smart card) for emergency access accounts are kept secure and known only to individuals who are authorized to use them only in an emergency.

### PA-6: Use privileged access workstations

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39952).

**Guidance**: Secured, isolated workstations are critically important for the security of sensitive roles like administrators, developers, and critical service operators. Use highly secured user workstations and/or Azure Bastion for administrative tasks. Use Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), and/or Microsoft Intune to deploy a secure and managed user workstation for administrative tasks. The secured workstations can be centrally managed to enforce secured configuration including strong authentication, software and hardware baselines, restricted logical and network access.

### PA-7: Follow just enough administration (least privilege principle) 

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39953).

**Guidance**: Azure Database Migration Service is integrated with Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to manage its resources. Azure RBAC allows you to manage Azure resource access through role assignments. You can assign these roles to users, groups service principals and managed identities. There are pre-defined built-in roles for certain resources, and these roles can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell or the Azure portal. The privileges you assign to resources through the Azure RBAC should be always limited to what is required by the roles. This complements the just in time (JIT) approach of Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and should be reviewed periodically.

Use built-in roles to allocate permission and only create custom role when required.

### DP-4: Encrypt sensitive information in transit

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39964).

**Guidance**: Encryption is critical for traffic on external and public networks.
Use access controls,

data in transit should be protected against ‘out of band’ attacks (e.g. traffic capture) using encryption to ensure that attackers cannot easily read or modify the data.

Ensure for HTTP traffic, that any clients connecting to your Azure resources can negotiate TLS v1.2 or greater.

For remote management, use SSH (for Linux) or RDP/TLS (for Windows) instead of unencrypted protocol. Obsoleted SSL/TLS/SSH versions, protocols, and weak ciphers should be disabled.

At the underlying infrastructure, Azure provides data in transit encryption by default for data traffic between Azure data centers.

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39983).

**Guidance**: Ensure security teams are granted Security Reader permissions in your Azure tenant and subscriptions so they can monitor for security risks using Azure Security Center. 

Depending on how security team responsibilities are structured, monitoring for security risks could  be the responsibility of a central security team or a local team. That said, security insights and risks must always be aggregated centrally within an organization. 

Security Reader permissions can be applied broadly to an entire tenant (Root Management Group) or scoped to management groups or specific subscriptions. 

Note: Additional permissions might be required to get visibility into workloads and services.

**Guidance**: Azure AD provides the following user logs that can be viewed in Azure AD reporting or integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or other SIEM/monitoring tools for more sophisticated monitoring and analytics use cases:

Sign-ins – The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.

Audit logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.

Risky sign-ins - A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.

Users flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

Azure Security Center can also alert on certain suspicious activities such as excessive number of failed authentication attempts, deprecated accounts in the subscription. In addition to the basic security hygiene monitoring, Azure Security Center’s Threat Protection module can also collect more in-depth security alerts from individual Azure compute resources (virtual machines, containers, app service), data resources (SQL DB and storage), and Azure service layers. This capability allows you have visibility on account anomalies inside the individual resources.

### IR-3: Detection and analysis – create incidents based on high quality alerts

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39975).

**Guidance**: Ensure you have a process to create high quality alerts and measure the quality of alerts. This allows you to learn lessons from past incidents and prioritize alerts for analysts, so they don’t waste time on false positives. 

High quality alerts can be built based on experience from past incidents, validated community sources, and tools designed to generate and clean up alerts by fusing and correlating diverse signal sources. 

Azure Security Center provides high quality alerts across many Azure assets. You can use the ASC data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel. Azure Sentinel lets you create advanced alert rules to generate incidents automatically for an investigation. 

Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion.

### IR-4: Detection and analysis – investigate an incident

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39976).

**Guidance**: Ensure analysts can query and use diverse data sources as they investigate potential incidents, to build a full view of what happened. Diverse logs should be collected to track the activities of a potential attacker across the kill chain to avoid blind spots.  You should also ensure insights and learnings are captured for other analysts and for future historical reference.  

The data sources for investigation include the centralized logging sources that are already being collected from the in-scope services and running systems, but can also include:

- Network data – use network security groups' flow logs, Azure Network Watcher, and Azure Monitor to capture network flow logs and other analytics information. 

- Snapshots of running systems: 

    - Use Azure virtual machine's snapshot capability to create a snapshot of the running system's disk. 

    - Use the operating system's native memory dump capability to create a snapshot of the running system's memory.

    - Use the snapshot feature of the Azure services or your software's own capability to create snapshots of the running systems.

Azure Sentinel provides extensive data analytics across virtually any log source and a case management portal to manage the full lifecycle of incidents. Intelligence information during an investigation can be associated with an incident for tracking and reporting purposes.

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39977).

**Guidance**: Provide context to analysts on which incidents to focus on first based on alert severity and asset sensitivity. 

Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert, as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark resources using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

### IR-6: Containment, eradication and recovery – automate the incident handling

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39978).

**Guidance**: Automate manual repetitive tasks to speed up response time and reduce the burden on analysts. Manual tasks take longer to execute, slowing each incident and reducing how many incidents an analyst can handle. Manual tasks also increase analyst fatigue, which increases the risk of human error that causes delays, and degrades the ability of analysts to focus effectively on complex tasks. 
Use workflow automation features in Azure Security Center and Azure Sentinel to automatically trigger actions or run a playbook to respond to incoming security alerts. The playbook takes actions, such as sending notifications, disabling accounts, and isolating problematic networks.

### GS-6: Define identity and privileged access strategy

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40005).

**Guidance**: Establish an Azure identity and privileged access approaches as part of your organization’s overall security access control strategy.  

This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following elements: 

-	A centralized identity and authentication system and its interconnectivity with other internal and external identity systems

-	Strong authentication methods in different use cases and conditions

-	Protection of highly privileged users

-	Anomaly user activities monitoring and handling  

-	User identity and access review and reconciliation process

### GS-7: Define logging and threat response strategy

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40006).

**Guidance**: Establish a logging and threat response strategy to rapidly detect and remediate threats while meeting compliance requirements. Prioritize providing analysts with high quality alerts and seamless experiences so that they can focus on threats rather than integration and manual steps. 

This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following elements: 

-	The security operations (SecOps) organization’s role and responsibilities 

-	A well-defined incident response process aligning with NIST or another industry framework 

-	Log capture and retention to support threat detection, incident response, and compliance needs

-	Centralized visibility of and correlation information about threats, using SIEM, native Azure capabilities, and other sources 

-	Communication and notification plan with your customers, suppliers, and public parties of interest

-	Use of Azure native and third-party platforms for incident handling, such as logging and threat detection, forensics, and attack remediation and eradication

-	Processes for handling incidents and post-incident activities, such as lessons learned and evidence retention
