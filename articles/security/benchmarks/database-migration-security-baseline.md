# Azure security baseline for Azure Database Migration Service

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 2.0](overview.md) to Azure Database Migration Service. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Database Migration Service. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Database Migration Service have been excluded.

To see how Azure Database Migration Service completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Database Migration Service security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

### GS-2: Define enterprise segmentation strategy 

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40008.).

**Guidance**: 

Establish an enterprise-wide strategy to segmenting access to assets using a combination of identity, network, application, subscription, management group, and other controls.

Carefully balance the need for security separation with the need to enable daily operation of the systems that need to communicate with each other and access data.

Ensure that the segmentation strategy is implemented consistently across control types including network security, identity and access models, and application permission/access models, and human process controls.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40004.).

**Guidance**: 

Establish an Azure network security approach as part of your organization’s overall security access control strategy.  

This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following elements: 

-	Centralized network management and security responsibility

-	Virtual network segmentation model aligned with the enterprise segmentation strategy

-	Remediation strategy in different threat and attack scenarios

-	Internet edge and ingress and egress strategy

-	Hybrid cloud and on-premises interconnectivity strategy

-	Up-to-date network security artifacts (e.g. network diagrams, reference network architecture)

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/40005.).

**Guidance**: 

Establish an Azure identity and privileged access approaches as part of your organization’s overall security access control strategy.  

This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following elements:
