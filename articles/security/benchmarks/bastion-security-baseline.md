# Azure security baseline for Azure Bastion

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 2.0](overview.md) to Azure Bastion. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Bastion. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Bastion have been excluded.

To see how Azure Bastion completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Bastion security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-network-security).*

### NS-1: Implement security for internal traffic

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39744.).

**Guidance**: For the network security groups (NSGs) associated with your Azure Bastion subnets, you must allow

Ingress Traffic : 

a) Ingress Traffic from public internet: The Azure Bastion will create a public IP that needs port 443 enabled on the public IP for ingress traffic. Port 3389/22 are NOT required to be opened on the AzureBastionSubnet. 

b) Ingress Traffic from Azure Bastion control plane: For control plane connectivity, enable port 443 inbound from GatewayManager service tag. This enables the control plane, that is, Gateway Manager to be able to communicate with Azure Bastion.

Egress Traffic:

a) Egress Traffic to target VMs: Azure Bastion will reach the target VMs over private IP. The NSGs need to allow egress traffic to other target VM subnets for port 3389 and 22.

b) Egress Traffic to other public endpoints in Azure: Azure Bastion needs to be able to connect to various public endpoints within Azure (for example, for storing diagnostics logs and metering logs). For this reason, Azure Bastion needs outbound to 443 to AzureCloud service tag.

Connectivity to Gateway Manager and Azure service tag is protected (locked down) by Azure certificates. External entities, including the consumers of those resources, can't communicate on these endpoints. You can learn more about Bastion NSG requirement here 

../../bastion/bastion-nsg.md

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39756.).

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39757.).

**Guidance**: Azure Bastion service is accessed over Azure portal. User can enable logs related to identity and access management when Azure Bastion is accessed.

Azure AD provides the following user logs that can be viewed in Azure AD reporting or integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or other SIEM/monitoring tools for more sophisticated monitoring and analytics use cases:

Sign-ins – The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.

Audit logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.

Risky sign-ins - A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.

Users flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

Azure Security Center can also alert on certain suspicious activities such as excessive number of failed authentication attempts, deprecated accounts in the subscription. In addition to the basic security hygiene monitoring, Azure Security Center’s Threat Protection module can also collect more in-depth security alerts from individual Azure compute resources (virtual machines, containers, app service), data resources (SQL DB and storage), and Azure service layers. This capability allows you have visibility on account anomalies inside the individual resources.
