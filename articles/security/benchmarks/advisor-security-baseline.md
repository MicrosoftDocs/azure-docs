# Azure security baseline for Azure Advisor

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 2.0](overview.md) to Azure Advisor. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Advisor. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Advisor have been excluded.

To see how Azure Advisor completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Advisor security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

-	Data classification standard in accordance with the business risks

-	Security organization visibility into risks and asset inventory 

-	Security organization approval of Azure services for use 

-	Security of assets through their lifecycle

-	Required access control strategy in accordance with organizational data classification

-	Use of Azure native and third party data protection capabilities

-	Data encryption requirements for in-transit and at-rest use cases

-	Appropriate cryptographic standards

### GS-2: Define enterprise segmentation strategy 

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39588.).

**Guidance**: 

Establish an enterprise-wide strategy to segmenting access to assets using a combination of identity, network, application, subscription, management group, and other controls.

Carefully balance the need for security separation with the need to enable daily operation of the systems that need to communicate with each other and access data.

Ensure that the segmentation strategy is implemented consistently across control types including network security, identity and access models, and application permission/access models, and human process controls.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39583.).

**Guidance**: 

Ensure you document and communicate a clear strategy for roles and responsibilities in your security organization. Prioritize providing clear accountability for security decisions, educating everyone on the shared responsibility model, and educate technical teams on technology to secure the cloud.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39584.).

**Guidance**: 

Establish an Azure network security approach as part of your organization’s overall security access control strategy.  

This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following elements: 

-	Centralized network management and security responsibility

-	Virtual network segmentation model aligned with the enterprise segmentation strategy

-	Remediation strategy in different threat and attack scenarios

-	Internet edge and ingress and egress strategy

-	Hybrid cloud and on-premises interconnectivity strategy

-	Up-to-date network security artifacts (e.g. network diagrams, reference network architecture)

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/39585.).

**Guidance**: 

Establish an Azure identity and privileged access approaches as part of your organization’s overall security access control strategy.  

This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following elements: 

-	A centralized identity and authentication system and its interconnectivity with other internal and external identity systems

-	Strong authentication methods in different use cases and conditions

-	Protection of highly privileged users

This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following elements: 

-	The security operations (SecOps) organization’s role and responsibilities 

-	A well-defined incident response process aligning with NIST or another industry framework 

-	Log capture and retention to support threat detection, incident response, and compliance needs
