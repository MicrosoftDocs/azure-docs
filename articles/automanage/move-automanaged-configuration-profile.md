# Move an Azure Automanage configuration profile to a different region

> [!CAUTION]
> On September 30, 2027, the Azure Automanage Best Practices service will be retired. As a result, attempting to create a new configuration profile or onboarding a new subscription to the service will result in an error. Learn more [here](https://aka.ms/automanagemigration/) about how to migrate to Azure Policy before that date. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Starting February 1st 2025, Azure Automanage will begin rolling out changes to halt support and enforcement for all services dependent on the deprecated Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA). To continue using Change Tracking and Management, VM Insights, Update Management, and Azure Automation, [migrate to the new Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)](https://aka.ms/mma-to-ama/).

This article describes how to migrate an Automanage Configuration Profile to a different region. You might want to move your Configuration Profiles to another region for many reasons. For example, to take advantage of a new Azure region, to meet internal policy and governance requirements, or in response to capacity planning requirements. You may want to deploy Azure Automanage to some VMs that are in a new region.  Some regions may require that you use Automanage Configuration Profiles  that are local to that region.

## Prerequisites
* Ensure that your target region is [supported by Automanage](./overview-about.md#prerequisites).
* Ensure that your Log Analytics workspace region, Automation account region, and your target region are all regions supported by the region mappings [here](../automation/how-to/region-mappings.md).

## Download your desired Automanage configuration profile

We'll begin by downloading our previous Configuration Profile using PowerShell.  First, perform a `GET` using `Invoke-RestMethod` against the Automanage Resource Provider, substituting the values for your subscription.

```url
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<yourSubscription>/providers/Microsoft.Automanage/configurationProfiles?api-version=2022-05-04
```

The GET command will display a list of Automanage Configuration Profile information, including the settings and the ConfigurationProfile ID
```azurepowershell-interactive
$listConfigurationProfilesURI = "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<yourSubscription>/providers/Microsoft.Automanage/configurationProfiles?api-version=2022-05-04"

Invoke-RestMethod `
    -URI $listConfigurationProfilesURI
```

Here are the results, edited for brevity.

```json
    {
        "id": "/subscriptions/yourSubscription/resourceGroups/yourResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Automanage/configurationProfiles/testProfile1",
        "name": "testProfile1",
        "type": "Microsoft.Automanage/configurationProfiles",
        "location": "westus",
        "properties": {
            "configuration": {
                "Antimalware/Enable": false,
                "Backup/Enable": true,
                "Backup/PolicyName": "dailyBackupPolicy",
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "id": "/subscriptions/yourSubscription/resourceGroups/yourResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Automanage/configurationProfiles/testProfile2",
        "name": "testProfile2",
        "type": "Microsoft.Automanage/configurationProfiles",
        "location": "eastus2euap",
        "properties": {
            "configuration": {
                "Antimalware/Enable": false,
                "Backup/Enable": true,
                "Backup/PolicyName": "dailyBackupPolicy",
            }
        }
    }
```

The next step is to do another `GET`, this time to retrieve the specific profile we would like to create in a new region.  For this example, we'll retrieve 'testProfile1'.  We'll perform a `GET` against the `id` value for the desired profile.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$profileId = "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/yourSubscription/resourceGroups/yourResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Automanage/configurationProfiles/testProfile1?api-version=2022-05-04"

$profile = Invoke-RestMethod `
    -URI $listConfigurationProfilesURI
```

## Adjusting the location

Creating the profile in a new location is as simple as changing the `Location` property to our desired Azure Region.

We also will need to create a new name for this profile.  Let's change the name of the Configuration Profile `profileUk`.  We should update the `Name` property within the profile, and also in the URL.  We can use the `-replace` format operator to make this simple.

```powershell
$profile.Location = "westeurope"
$profile.Name -replace "testProfile1", "profileUk"
$profileId -replace "testProfile1", "profileUk"
```

Now that we have changed the Location value, this updated Configuration Profile will be created in Western Europe when we submit it. 

## Creating the new profile in the desired location

All that remains now is to `PUT` this new profile, using `Invoke-RestMethod` once more.

```powershell
$profile = Invoke-RestMethod `
    -Method PUT `
    -URI $profileId
```

## Enable Automanage on your VMs
For details on how to move your VMs, see this [article](../resource-mover/tutorial-move-region-virtual-machines.md).

Once you've moved your profile to a new region, you may use it as a custom profile for any VM.  Details are available [here](./quick-create-virtual-machines-portal.md).
