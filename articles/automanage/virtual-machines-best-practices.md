# Azure Automanage for virtual machines best practices

> [!CAUTION]
> On September 30, 2027, the Azure Automanage Best Practices service will be retired. As a result, attempting to create a new configuration profile or onboarding a new subscription to the service will result in an error. Learn more [here](https://aka.ms/automanagemigration/) about how to migrate to Azure Policy before that date. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Starting February 1st 2025, Azure Automanage will begin rolling out changes to halt support and enforcement for all services dependent on the deprecated Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA). To continue using Change Tracking and Management, VM Insights, Update Management, and Azure Automation, [migrate to the new Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)](https://aka.ms/mma-to-ama/).

These Azure services are automatically onboarded for you when you use Automanage. They are essential to our best practices white paper, which you can find in our [Cloud Adoption Framework](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/azure-server-management).

For all of these services, we will auto-onboard, auto-configure, monitor for drift, and mediate if drift is detected. To learn more about this process, see [Azure Automanage for virtual machines](overview-about.md).
