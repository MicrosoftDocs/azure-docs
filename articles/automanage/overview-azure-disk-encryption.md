# Automanage and Azure Disk Encryption

> [!CAUTION]
> On September 30, 2027, the Azure Automanage Best Practices service will be retired. As a result, attempting to create a new configuration profile or onboarding a new subscription to the service will result in an error. Learn more [here](https://aka.ms/automanagemigration/) about how to migrate to Azure Policy before that date. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Starting February 1st 2025, Azure Automanage will begin rolling out changes to halt support and enforcement for all services dependent on the deprecated Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA). To continue using Change Tracking and Management, VM Insights, Update Management, and Azure Automation, [migrate to the new Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)](https://aka.ms/mma-to-ama/).

Automanage is compatible with VMs that have Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) enabled.

## Azure Backup

If you are using the Production environment, you will also be onboarded to Azure Backup. There is one prerequisite to successfully using ADE and Azure Backup:
* Before you onboard your ADE-enabled VM to Automanage's Production environment, ensure that you have followed the steps located in the **Before you start** section of [this document](../backup/backup-azure-vms-encryption.md#before-you-start).

## Next steps

In this article, you learned that Automanage for machines provides a means for which you can eliminate the need for you to know of, onboard to, and configure best practices Azure services. In addition, if a machine you onboarded to Automanage for virtual machines drifts from the configuration profile, we will automatically bring it back into compliance.

Try enabling Automanage for Azure virtual machines or Arc-enabled servers in the Azure portal.
