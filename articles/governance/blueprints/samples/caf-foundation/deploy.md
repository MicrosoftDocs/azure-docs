# Deploy the CAF Foundation blueprint sample

[!INCLUDE [Blueprints deprecation note](../../../../../includes/blueprints-deprecation-note.md)]

To deploy the CAF Foundation blueprint sample (provided by the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure), the
following steps must be taken:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Create a new blueprint from the sample
> - Mark your copy of the sample as **Published**
> - Assign your copy of the blueprint to an existing subscription

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
before you begin.

## Create blueprint from sample

First, implement the blueprint sample by creating a new blueprint in your environment using the
sample as a starter.

1. Select **All services** in the left pane. Search for and select **Blueprints**.

1. From the **Getting started** page on the left, select the **Create** button under _Create a
   blueprint_.

1. Find the **CAF Foundation** blueprint sample under _Other Samples_ and select **Use this
   sample**.

1. Enter the _Basics_ of the blueprint sample:

   - **Blueprint name**: Provide a name for your copy of the CAF Foundation blueprint sample.
   - **Definition location**: Use the ellipsis and select the management group to save your copy of
     the sample to.

1. Select the _Artifacts_ tab at the top of the page or **Next: Artifacts** at the bottom of the
   page.

1. Review the list of artifacts that make up the blueprint sample. Many of the artifacts have
   parameters that we'll define later. Select **Save Draft** when you've finished reviewing the
   blueprint sample.

## Publish the sample copy

Your copy of the blueprint sample has now been created in your environment. It's created in
**Draft** mode and must be **Published** before it can be assigned and deployed. The copy of the
blueprint sample can be customized to your environment and needs, but that modification may move it
away from the CAF Foundation blueprint.

1. Select **All services** in the left pane. Search for and select **Blueprints**.

1. Select the **Blueprint definitions** page on the left. Use the filters to find your copy of the
   blueprint sample and then select it.

1. Select **Publish blueprint** at the top of the page. In the new page on the right, provide a
   **Version** for your copy of the blueprint sample. This property is useful for if you make a
   modification later. Provide **Change notes** such as "First version published from the CAF
   Foundation blueprint sample." Then select **Publish** at the bottom of the page.

## Assign the sample copy

Once the copy of the blueprint sample has been successfully **Published**, it can be assigned to a
subscription within the management group it was saved to. This step is where parameters are provided
to make each deployment of the copy of the blueprint sample unique.

1. Select **All services** in the left pane. Search for and select **Blueprints**.

1. Select the **Blueprint definitions** page on the left. Use the filters to find your copy of the
   blueprint sample and then select it.

1. Select **Assign blueprint** at the top of the blueprint definition page.

1. Provide the parameter values for the blueprint assignment:

   - Basics
       - **Subscriptions**: Select one or more of the subscriptions that are in the management group
       you saved your copy of the blueprint sample to. If you select more than one subscription, an
       assignment will be created for each using the parameters entered.
     - **Assignment name**: The name is pre-populated for you based on the name of the blueprint.
       Change as needed or leave as is.
     - **Location**: Select a region for the managed identity to be created in.
     - Azure Blueprints uses this managed identity to deploy all artifacts in the assigned blueprint.
       To learn more, see
       [managed identities for Azure resources](../../../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).
     - **Blueprint definition version**: Pick a **Published** version of your copy of the blueprint
       sample.

   - Lock Assignment

     Select the blueprint lock setting for your environment. For more information, see
     [blueprints resource locking](../../concepts/resource-locking.md).

   - Managed Identity

     Choose either the default _system assigned_ managed identity option or the _user assigned_
     identity option.

   - Blueprint parameters

     The parameters defined in this section are used by many of the artifacts in the blueprint
     definition to provide consistency.

     - **Organization**: Enter your organization name, such as Contoso, must be unique.
     - **Azure Region**: Select the Azure Region for Deployment.
     - **Allowed locations**: Which Azure Regions will you allow resources to be built in?

   - Artifact parameters

     The parameters defined in this section apply to the artifact under which it's defined. These
     parameters are [dynamic parameters](../../concepts/parameters.md#dynamic-parameters) since
     they're defined during the assignment of the blueprint. For a full list or artifact parameters
     and their descriptions, see [Artifact parameters table](#artifact-parameters-table).

1. Once all parameters have been entered, select **Assign** at the bottom of the page. The blueprint
   assignment is created and artifact deployment begins. Deployment takes roughly an hour. To check
   on the status of deployment, open the blueprint assignment.

## Artifact parameters table

The following table provides a list of the blueprint artifact parameters:

|Artifact name|Artifact type|Parameter name|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|Allowed storage account SKUs|Policy assignment|Policy_Allowed-StorageAccount-SKUs|SKU used in Diagnostic Log storage accounts|
|Allowed virtual machine SKUs|Policy assignment|Policy_Allowed-VM-SKUs|Allowed virtual machine SKUs|
|Append CostCenter TAG to Resource Groups|Policy assignment|Policy_CostCenter_Tag|Append CostCenter TAG and its value from the Resource Group|
|Resource Types that you do not want to allow in your environment|Policy assignment|Policy _Allowed-Resource-Types|Which Azure Resources you want to allow in your environment|
|Deploy Key Vault|Resource Manager template|KV-AccessPolicy|**Locked** - Azure AD Group or User \<Object ID\> to grant permissions to in Key Vault|
|Deploy Log Analytics|Resource Manager template|LogAnalytics_DataRetention|**Locked** - Number of days data will be retained in Log Analytics|
|Deploy Log Analytics|Resource Manager template|LogAnalytics_Location|**Locked** - Region used when establishing the workspace|
