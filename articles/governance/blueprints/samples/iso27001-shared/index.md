# Overview of the ISO 27001 Shared Services blueprint sample

[!INCLUDE [Blueprints deprecation note](../../../../../includes/blueprints-deprecation-note.md)]

The ISO 27001 Shared Services blueprint sample provides a set of compliant infrastructure patterns
and policy guardrails that help toward ISO 27001 attestation. This blueprint helps customers deploy
cloud-based architectures that offer solutions to scenarios that have accreditation or compliance
requirements.

The [ISO 27001 App Service Environment/SQL Database workload](../iso27001-ase-sql-workload/index.md) blueprint sample extends this sample.

## Architecture

The ISO 27001 Shared Services blueprint sample deploys a foundation infrastructure in Azure that can
be used by organizations to host multiple workloads based on the Virtual Datacenter (VDC) approach.
VDC is a proven set of reference architectures, automation tooling, and engagement model used by
Microsoft with its largest enterprise customers. The Shared Services blueprint sample is based on a
fully native Azure VDC environment shown below.

This environment is composed of several Azure services used to provide a secure, fully monitored,
enterprise-ready shared services infrastructure based on ISO 27001 standards. This environment is
composed of:

- [Azure roles](../../../../role-based-access-control/overview.md) used
  for segregation of duties from a control plane perspective. Three roles are defined before
  deployment of any infrastructure:
  - NetOps role has the rights to manage the network environment, including firewall settings, NSG
    settings, routing, and other networking functionality
  - SecOps role has the necessary rights to deploy and manage
    [Azure Security Center](../../../../security-center/security-center-introduction.md), define
    [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) definitions, and other security-related rights
  - SysOps role has the necessary rights to define [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
    definitions within the subscription, manage
    [Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/overview) for the entire environment, among other
    operational rights
- [Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/overview) is deployed as the first Azure service to
  ensure all actions and services log to a central location from the moment you start your secure
  deployment
- A virtual network supporting subnets for connectivity back to an on-premises datacenter, an
  ingress and egress stack for Internet connectivity, and a shared service subnet using NSGs and
  ASGs for full micro-segmentation containing:
  - A jumpbox or bastion host used for management purposes, which can only be accessed over an
    [Azure Firewall](../../../../firewall/overview.md) deployed in the ingress stack subnet
  - Two virtual machines running Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) and DNS only
    accessible through the jumpbox, and can be configured only to replicate AD over a VPN or
    [ExpressRoute](../../../../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md) connection (not deployed
    by the blueprint)
  - Use of [Azure Net Watcher](../../../../network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview.md)
    and standard DDoS protection
- An [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview) instance used to host secrets used
  for the VMs deployed in the shared services environment

All these elements abide to the proven practices published in the
[Azure Architecture Center - Reference Architectures](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/).

> [!NOTE]
> The ISO 27001 Shared Services infrastructure lays out a foundational architecture for workloads.
> You still need to deploy workloads behind this foundational architecture.

For more information, see the [Virtual Datacenter documentation](/azure/architecture/vdc/).
