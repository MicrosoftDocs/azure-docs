# Overview of the DoD Impact Level 4 blueprint sample

The Department of Defense Impact Level 4 (DoD IL4) blueprint sample provides governance guard-rails using [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) that help you assess specific DoD Impact Level 4 controls. This blueprint helps customers deploy a core set of policies for any Azure-deployed architecture that must implement DoD Impact Level 4 controls. For latest information on which Azure Clouds and Services meet DoD Impact Level 4 authorization, see [Azure services by FedRAMP and DoD CC SRG audit scope](../../../../azure-government/compliance/azure-services-in-fedramp-auditscope.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This blueprint sample is available in Azure Government.

## Control mapping

The control mapping section provides details on policies included within this blueprint and how
these policies address various controls in DoD Impact Level 4. When assigned to an architecture,
resources are evaluated by Azure Policy for non-compliance with assigned policies. For more
information, see [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md).
