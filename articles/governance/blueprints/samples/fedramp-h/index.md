# Overview of the FedRAMP High blueprint sample

The FedRAMP High blueprint sample provides governance guard-rails using [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)

set of policies for any Azure-deployed architecture that must implement FedRAMP High controls.

## Control mapping

The control mapping section provides details on policies included within this blueprint and how
