# Overview of the ISO 27001 blueprint sample

The ISO 27001 blueprint sample provides governance guard-rails using [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
that help you assess specific ISO 27001 controls. This blueprint helps customers deploy a core set 
of policies for any Azure-deployed architecture that must implement ISO 27001 controls. Two 
additional ISO 27001 blueprint samples are available that can help you deploy a [foundational architecture](../iso27001-shared/index.md)
and an [ASE/SQL workload](../iso27001-ase-sql-workload/index.md).

## Control mapping

The control mapping section provides details on policies included within this blueprint and how 
these policies address various controls in ISO 27001. When assigned to an architecture, 
resources are evaluated by Azure Policy for non-compliance with assigned policies. For more 
information, see [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md).
