# Control mapping of the Australian Government ISM PROTECTED blueprint sample

[!INCLUDE [Blueprints deprecation note](../../../../../includes/blueprints-deprecation-note.md)]

The following article details how the Azure Blueprints Australian Government ISM PROTECTED blueprint
sample maps to the ISM PROTECTED controls. For more information about the controls, see
[ISM PROTECTED](https://www.cyber.gov.au/ism).

The following mappings are to the **ISM PROTECTED** controls. Use the navigation on the right to
jump directly to a specific control mapping. Many of the mapped controls are implemented with an
[Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) initiative. To review the complete initiative, open
**Policy** in the Azure portal and select the **Definitions** page. Then, find and select the
**\[Preview\]: Audit Australian Government ISM PROTECTED controls and deploy specific VM Extensions
to support audit requirements** built-in policy initiative.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each control below is associated with one or more [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md)
> definitions. These policies may help you
> [assess compliance](../../../policy/how-to/get-compliance-data.md) with the control; however,
> there often is not a one-to-one or complete match between a control and one or more policies. As
> such, **Compliant** in Azure Policy refers only to the policies themselves; this doesn't ensure
> you're fully compliant with all requirements of a control. In addition, the compliance standard
> includes controls that aren't addressed by any Azure Policy definitions at this time. Therefore,
> compliance in Azure Policy is only a partial view of your overall compliance status. The
> associations between controls and Azure Policy definitions for this compliance blueprint sample
> may change over time. To view the change history, see the
> [GitHub Commit History](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/governance/blueprints/samples/ism-protected/control-mapping.md).

## Location Constraints

This blueprint helps you restrict the location for the deployment of all resources and resource
groups to "Australia Central", "Australia Central2", "Australia East" and "Australia Southeast" by
assigning following Azure Policy definitions:

- Allowed locations (has been hard coded to "Australia Central", "Australia Central2", "Australia
  East" and "Australia Southeast")
- Allowed locations for resource groups (has been hard coded to "Australia Central", "Australia
  Central2", "Australia East" and "Australia Southeast")
