# Overview of the Australian Government ISM PROTECTED blueprint sample

[!INCLUDE [Blueprints deprecation note](../../../../../includes/blueprints-deprecation-note.md)]

ISM Governance blueprint sample provides a set of governance guardrails using
[Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md) which help toward ISM PROTECTED attestation (Feb 2020
version). This Blueprint helps customers deploy a core set of policies for any Azure-deployed
architecture requiring accreditation or compliance with the ISM framework.

## Control mapping

The control mapping section provides details on policies included within this blueprint and how
these policies address various controls in ISM PROTECTED. When assigned to an architecture,
resources are evaluated by Azure Policy for non-compliance with assigned policies. For more
information, see [Azure Policy](../../../policy/overview.md).
