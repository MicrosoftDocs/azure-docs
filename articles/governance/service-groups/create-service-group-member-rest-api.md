# Quickstart: Connect resources or resource containers to service groups with Service Group Member Relationships 
 
To connect resources, resource groups, or subscriptions to a Service Group (preview), you need to create a new Service Group Member Relationship. For more information on service groups, see [Getting started with Service Groups](overview.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Service Groups is currently in PREVIEW. 
> For more information about participating in the preview, see [Azure Service Groups Preview](https://aka.ms/ServiceGroups/PreviewSignup).
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
  account before you begin.

- If you haven't already, install [ARMClient](https://github.com/projectkudu/ARMClient). It's a tool
  that sends HTTP requests to Azure Resource Manager-based REST APIs.

## Create in REST API

For REST API, use the
[Service Groups Member- Create or Update]() endpoint to create a new service group member.

In this example, we're connecting a Virtual Machine [VM1] to a service group [Contoso].

1. Service Group: **groupId** is _Contoso_
1. Virtual Machine: The **resourceID** is _VM1_
1. Service Group Member: The **relationshipID** is _SGM1_

When you're adding a resource to a service group, you create service group member by extending the resource.  

- REST API URI

  ```http
  PUT https://management.azure.com/[scope]/providers/Microsoft.Relationships/serviceGroupMember/SGM1?api-version=2023-09-01-preview
  ```


In the preceding example, the new service group member is created extending the Virtual Machine. To
specify the service group as the parent, use the **TargetID** property.

- REST API URI

  ```http
  PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/[SUBID]/resourceGroups/[RGID]/providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachine/[VMID]/providers/Microsoft.Relationships/serviceGroupMember/SGM1?api-version=2024-02-01-preview
  ```

- Request Body

  ```json
    {
      "properties": {
       "targetId": "providers/microsoft.management/servicegroups/Contoso"
      }
    }
  ```

## Clean up resources

To remove the service group created in this document, use the
[Service Group Member Delete]() endpoint:

- REST API URI

  ```http
  DELETE https://management.azure.com/[scope]/providers/Microsoft.Relationships/serviceGroupMember/SGM1?api-version=2023-09-01-preview
  ```

- No Request Body


## Next step

In this quickstart, you created a service group to help create different views in Azure. The
service group can have member subscriptions, resource groups, resources, or other service groups.
