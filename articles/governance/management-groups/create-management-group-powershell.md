# Quickstart: Create a management group with Azure PowerShell

Management groups are containers that help you manage access, policy, and compliance across multiple
subscriptions. Create these containers to build an effective and efficient hierarchy that can be
used with [Azure Policy](../policy/overview.md) and [Azure Role Based Access
Controls](../../role-based-access-control/overview.md). For more information on management groups,
see [Organize your resources with Azure management groups](overview.md).

The first management group created in the directory could take up to 15 minutes to complete. There
are processes that run the first time to set up the management groups service within Azure for your
directory. You receive a notification when the process is complete. For more information, see
[initial setup of management groups](./overview.md#initial-setup-of-management-groups).

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
  account before you begin.

- Before you start, make sure that the latest version of Azure PowerShell is installed. See
  [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) for detailed information.

- Any Microsoft Entra ID user in the tenant can create a management group without the management group write
  permission assigned to that user if
  [hierarchy protection](./how-to/protect-resource-hierarchy.md#setting-require-authorization)
  isn't enabled. This new management group becomes a child of the Root Management Group or the
  [default management group](./how-to/protect-resource-hierarchy.md#setting-define-the-default-management-group)
  and the creator is given an Owner role assignment. Management group service allows this ability
  so that role assignments aren't needed at the root level. When the Root
    Management Group is created, users don't have access to it. To start using management groups, the service allows the creation of the initial management groups at the root level. For more information, see [Root management group for each directory](./overview.md#root-management-group-for-each-directory).

### Create in Azure PowerShell

For PowerShell, use the
[New-AzManagementGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azmanagementgroup) cmdlet to create a
new management group. In this example, the management group **GroupName** is _Contoso_.

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzManagementGroup -GroupName 'Contoso'
```

The **GroupName** is a unique identifier being created. This ID is used by other commands to
reference this group and it can't be changed later.

If you want the management group to show a different name within the Azure portal, add the
**DisplayName** parameter. For example, to create a management group with the GroupName of Contoso
and the display name of "Contoso Group", use the following cmdlet:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzManagementGroup -GroupName 'Contoso' -DisplayName 'Contoso Group'
```

In the preceding examples, the new management group is created under the root management group. To
specify a different management group as the parent, use the **ParentId** parameter.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$parentGroup = Get-AzManagementGroup -GroupName Contoso
New-AzManagementGroup -GroupName 'ContosoSubGroup' -ParentId $parentGroup.id
```

## Clean up resources

To remove the management group created above, use the
[Remove-AzManagementGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azmanagementgroup)
cmdlet:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzManagementGroup -GroupName 'Contoso'
```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a management group to organize your resource hierarchy. The
management group can hold subscriptions or other management groups.
