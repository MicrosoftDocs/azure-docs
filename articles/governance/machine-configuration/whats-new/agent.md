### Version 1.26.48 - January 2023

#### New Features

- Added support for Linux distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9, Mariner 1 and 2,
  Alma 9, and Rocky 9.

#### Fixed

- Improved reliability for the guest configuration policy engine.

### Version 1.26.38

In this release, various improvements were made.

- You can now restrict which URLs can be used to download machine configuration packages by setting
  the `allowedGuestConfigPkgUrls` tag on the server resource and providing a comma-separated list of
  URL patterns to allow. If the tag exists, the agent only allows custom packages to be
  downloaded from the specified URLs. Built-in packages are unaffected by this feature.

#### Fixed

- Resolves local elevation of privilege vulnerability [CVE-2022-38007][03].
- If you're currently running an older version of the AzurePolicyforLinux extension, use the
  PowerShell or Azure CLI commands in the following examples to update your extension to the latest
  version.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$params = @{
    Publisher              = 'Microsoft.GuestConfiguration'
    Type                   = 'ConfigurationforLinux'
    Name                   = 'AzurePolicyforLinux'
    TypeHandlerVersion     = '1.26.38'
    ResourceGroupName      = '<resource-group>'
    Location               = '<location>'
    VMName                 = '<vm-name>'
    EnableAutomaticUpgrade = $true
}
Set-AzVMExtension @params
```

```azurecli
az vm extension set \
    --publisher Microsoft.GuestConfiguration \
    --name ConfigurationforLinux \
    --extension-instance-name AzurePolicyforLinux \
    --resource-group <resource-group> \
    --vm-name <vm-name> \
    --version 1.26.38 \
    --enable-auto-upgrade true
```
