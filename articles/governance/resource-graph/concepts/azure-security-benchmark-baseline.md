# Azure security baseline for Azure Resource Graph

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../../../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Resource Graph. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Resource Graph. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Resource Graph have been excluded.

 
To see how Azure Resource Graph completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Resource Graph security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

>[!NOTE]
>Because the Responsibility field is set to "Not applicable", this section will be omitted from the published baseline.

**Guidance**: Use Azure Policy aliases to create custom policies to audit or enforce the configuration of your Azure resources. You may also use built-in Azure Policy definitions that are readily available for usage. The Azure Resource Graph resources currently do not have any aliases exposed in its namespace 'Microsoft.ResourceGraph" to be used with policy as the only child resource type "queries" is still in preview.

Also, Azure Resource Manager has the ability to export the template in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), which should be reviewed to ensure that the configurations meet / exceed the security requirements for your organization.

You may also use recommendations from Azure Security Center as a secure configuration baseline for your Azure resources.

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytics used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.
