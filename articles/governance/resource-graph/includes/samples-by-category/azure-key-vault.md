### Count key vault resources

This query uses `count` instead of `summarize` to count the number of records returned. Only key vaults are included in the count.

```kusto
Resources
| where type =~ 'microsoft.keyvault/vaults'
| count
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli-interactive
az graph query -q "Resources | where type =~ 'microsoft.keyvault/vaults' | count"
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
Search-AzGraph -Query "Resources | where type =~ 'microsoft.keyvault/vaults' | count"
```

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

### Key vaults with subscription name

The following query shows a complex use of `join` with **kind** as _leftouter_. The query limits the joined table to subscriptions resources and with `project` to include only the original field _subscriptionId_ and the _name_ field renamed to _SubName_. The field rename avoids `join` adding it as _name1_ since the field already exists in _resources_. The original table is filtered with `where` and the following `project` includes columns from both tables. The query result is all key vaults displaying type, the name of the key vault, and the name of the subscription it's in.

```kusto
Resources
| join kind=leftouter (ResourceContainers | where type=='microsoft.resources/subscriptions' | project SubName=name, subscriptionId) on subscriptionId
| where type == 'microsoft.keyvault/vaults'
| project type, name, SubName
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli-interactive
az graph query -q "Resources | join kind=leftouter (ResourceContainers | where type=='microsoft.resources/subscriptions' | project SubName=name, subscriptionId) on subscriptionId | where type == 'microsoft.keyvault/vaults' | project type, name, SubName"
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
Search-AzGraph -Query "Resources | join kind=leftouter (ResourceContainers | where type=='microsoft.resources/subscriptions' | project SubName=name, subscriptionId) on subscriptionId | where type == 'microsoft.keyvault/vaults' | project type, name, SubName"
```
