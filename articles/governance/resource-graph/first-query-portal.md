# Quickstart: Run Resource Graph query using Azure portal

This quickstart describes how to run an Azure Resource Graph query in the Azure portal using Azure Resource Graph Explorer. Resource Graph Explorer allows you to query information about the Azure Resource Manager resource types and properties. Resource Graph Explorer also provides an interface for working with multiple queries, evaluating the results, and even converting the results of some queries into a chart that can be pinned to an Azure dashboard.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure account, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Run a query

Run a query from the Azure portal using Azure Resource Graph Explorer.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for _resource graph_ and select **Resource Graph Explorer**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/first-query-portal/search-resource-graph.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal to search for resource graph." lightbox="./media/first-query-portal/search-resource-graph.png":::

1. If you need to change the scope, select **Directory**. Then select the directory, management group, or subscription for the resources you want to query.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/first-query-portal/query-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Resource Graph Explorer to change the scope for directory, management group, or subscription." lightbox="./media/first-query-portal/query-scope.png":::

1. In the **Query 1** portion of the window, copy and paste the following query. Then select **Run query**.

   ```kusto
   resources
   | project name, type
   | limit 5
   ```

   :::image type="content" source="./media/first-query-portal/run-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Resource Graph Explorer that highlights run query, results, and messages." lightbox="./media/first-query-portal/run-query.png":::

   This query example doesn't provide a sort modifier like `order by`. If you run the query multiple times, it might yield a different set of resources for each request.

1. Review the query response in the **Results** tab and select the **Messages** tab to see details about the query, including the count of results and duration of the query. Errors, if any, are displayed in **Messages**.

1. Update the query to `order by` the `name` property. Then, select **Run query**

   ```kusto
   resources
   | project name, type
   | limit 5
   | order by name asc
   ```

   Like the previous query, running this query multiple times might yield a different set of resources for each request. The order of the query commands is important. In this example, the `order by` comes after the `limit`. The query limits the results to five resources and then orders those results by name.

1. Update the query to `order by` the `name` property and then `limit` to the top five results. Then, select **Run query**.

   ```kusto
   resources
   | project name, type
   | order by name asc
   | limit 5
   ```

   If this query is run several times with no changes to your environment, the results are consistent and ordered by the `name` property, but still limited to five results. The query orders the results by name and then limits the output to five resources.

### Schema browser

The schema browser is located in the left pane of Resource Graph Explorer. This list of resources shows all the _resource types_ of Azure resources supported by Azure Resource Graph and that exist in your tenant. Select a resource type or property to show child properties that can be used to create a Resource Graph query.

Select a table name from the schema browser and it gets added to the query. When you select a resource type it gets added to the query, like `where type =="<resource type>"`. If you select a property it gets added to the next line in the query, like `where <propertyName> == "INSERT_VALUE_HERE"`. You can use the schema browser to find properties that you can use in queries. Be sure to replace `INSERT_VALUE_HERE` with your own value, and adjust the query with conditions, operators, and functions.

This example shows a query that was built from the schema browser by selecting the table `authorizationresources` with resource type `microsoft.authorization/roledefinitions` and the property `roleName`.

```kusto
authorizationresources
| where type == "microsoft.authorization/roledefinitions"
| where properties['roleName'] == "INSERT_VALUE_HERE"
```

## Download query results as a CSV file

To download comma-separated values (CSV) results from the Azure portal, browse to the Azure Resource Graph Explorer and run a query. On the toolbar, select **Download as CSV** as shown in the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="./media/first-query-portal/download-csv.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Resource Graph Explorer with Download as CSV highlighted." lightbox="./media/first-query-portal/download-csv.png":::

When you use the **Download as CSV** export functionality of Azure Resource Graph Explorer, the result set is limited to 55,000 records. This limitation is a platform limit that can't be overridden by filing an Azure support ticket.

## Create a chart from query results

You can create charts from queries that output a count for the number of resources. Queries that output lists can't be made into a chart. If you try to create a chart from a list, a message like _the result set isn't compatible with a donut chart visualization_ is displayed in the **Charts** tab.

To create a chart from query results, do the following steps:

1. In the **Query 1** portion of the window, enter the following query and select **Run query**.

   ```kusto
   resources
   | where type == "microsoft.compute/virtualmachines"
   | summarize count() by tostring(properties.storageProfile.osDisk.osType)
   ```

1. Select the **Results** tab and note that the response for this query provides counts.

1. Select the **Charts** tab. Change the type from _Select chart type..._ to either _Bar chart_ or _Donut chart_.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/first-query-portal/query-chart.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Resource Graph Explorer with charts drop-down menu highlighted." lightbox="./media/first-query-portal/query-chart.png":::

## Pin query visualization to dashboard

When you have results from a query that can be visualized, that data visualization can be pinned to your Azure portal dashboard. After running the previous query, follow these steps:

1. Select **Save** and use the name _Virtual machine by OS type_ and type as _Private queries_. Then select **Save** at the bottom of the right pane.
1. Select **Run query** to rerun the query you saved.
1. On the **Charts** tab, select a data visualization. Then select **Pin to dashboard**.
1. From **Pin to Dashboard** select the existing dashboard where you want the chart to appear.
1. Select **Dashboard** from the _hamburger menu_ (three horizontal lines) on the top, left side of any portal page.

The query is now available on your dashboard with the title **Virtual machine by OS type**. If the query wasn't saved before it was pinned, the name is _Query 1_ instead.

The query and resulting data visualization run and update each time the dashboard loads, providing real time and dynamic insights to your Azure environment directly in your workflow.

Queries that result in a list can also be pinned to the dashboard. The feature isn't limited to data visualizations of queries.

When a query is run from the portal, you can select **Directory** to change the query's scope for the directory, management group, or subscription of the resources you want to query. When **Pin to dashboard** is selected, the results are added to your Azure dashboard with the scope used when the query was run.

For more information about working with dashboards, see [Create a dashboard in the Azure portal](/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards).

## Clean up resources

If you want to remove the sample Resource Graph dashboards from your Azure portal environment, do the following steps:

1. Select **Dashboard** from the _hamburger menu_ (three horizontal lines) on the top, left side of any portal page.
1. On your dashboard, find the **Virtual machine by OS type** chart and select the ellipsis (`...`) to display the menu.
1. Select **Remove from dashboard** select **Save** to confirm.

If you want to delete saved queries, like _Virtual machine by OS type_, do the following steps:

1. Go to Azure Resource Graph Explorer.
1. Select **Open a query**.
1. Select **Type** _Private queries_.
1. From **Query name** select the rubbish bin icon to **Delete this query**.
1. Select **Yes** to confirm the deletion.
