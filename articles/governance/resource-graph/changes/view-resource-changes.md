# View resource changes in the Azure portal (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview](../../includes/resource-graph/preview/change-analysis.md)]

Change Analysis provides data for various management and troubleshooting scenarios, helping you understand which changes to your application caused which breaking issues. In addition to [querying Resource Graph for resource changes](./get-resource-changes.md), you can also view all changes to your applications via the Azure portal.

In this guide, you learn where to find Change Analysis in the portal and how to view, filter, and query changes.

## Access Change Analysis screens

Change Analysis automatically collects snapshots of change data for all Azure resources, without  needing to limit to a specific subscription or service. To view change data, navigate to **All Resources** from the main menu on the portal dashboard.

:::image type="content" source="./media/view-resource-changes/all-resources-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of finding All Resources in the portal menu.":::

Select **Changed resources**. In this example, all Azure resources are returned with no specific subscription selected.

:::image type="content" source="./media/view-resource-changes/change-analysis-card.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the All Resources page and highlighting the Changed resources.":::

Review the results in **Changed resources**.

## Filter and sort Change Analysis results

Realistically, you only want to see the change history results for the resources you work with. You can use the filters and sorting categories in the Azure portal to weed out results unnecessary to your project.

### Filter

Use any of the filters available at the top of **Change Analysis** to narrow down the change history results to your specific needs.

:::image type="content" source="./media/view-resource-changes/changes-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the filters available for Change Analysis that help narrow down the Change Analysis results.":::

You might need to reset filters set on **All resources** in order to use the resource changes filters.

:::image type="content" source="./media/view-resource-changes/reset-filters.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the banner that indicates you might need to reset filters from All Resources.":::

| Filter | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
