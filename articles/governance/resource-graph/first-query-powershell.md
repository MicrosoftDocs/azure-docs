# Quickstart: Run Resource Graph query using Azure PowerShell

This quickstart describes how to run an Azure Resource Graph query using the `Az.ResourceGraph` module for Azure PowerShell. The module is included with the latest version of Azure PowerShell and adds [cmdlets](/powershell/module/az.resourcegraph) for Resource Graph.

The article also shows how to order (sort) and limit the query's results. You can run a query for resources in your tenant, management groups, or subscriptions. 

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure account, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
- Latest versions of [PowerShell](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) and [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Install the module

If you installed the latest versions of PowerShell and Azure PowerShell, you already have the `Az.ResourceGraph` module and required version of PowerShellGet. 

### Optional module installation

Use the following steps to install the `Az.ResourceGraph` module so that you can use Azure PowerShell to run Azure Resource Graph queries. The Azure Resource Graph module requires PowerShellGet version 2.0.1 or higher. 

1. Verify your PowerShellGet version:

    ```azurepowershell
    Get-Module -Name PowerShellGet
    ```

   If you need to update, go to [PowerShellGet](/powershell/gallery/powershellget/install-powershellget).

1. Install the module:

   ```azurepowershell
   Install-Module -Name Az.ResourceGraph -Repository PSGallery -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

    The command installs the module in the `CurrentUser` scope. If you need to install in the `AllUsers` scope, run the installation from an administrative PowerShell session.

1. Verify the module was installed:

   ```azurepowershell
   Get-Command -Module Az.ResourceGraph -CommandType Cmdlet
   ```

   The command displays the `Search-AzGraph` cmdlet version and loads the module into your PowerShell session.

## Connect to Azure

From a Visual Studio Code terminal session, connect to Azure. If you have more than one subscription, run the commands to set context to your subscription. Replace `<subscriptionID>` with your Azure subscription ID.

```azurepowershell
Connect-AzAccount

# Run these commands if you have multiple subscriptions
Get-AzSubScription
Set-AzContext -Subscription <subscriptionID>
```

## Run a query

After the module is added to your environment, you can run a tenant-based query. The query in this example returns five Azure resources with the `name` and `type` of each resource. To query by [management group](../management-groups/overview.md) or subscription, use the `-ManagementGroup` or `-Subscription` parameters.

1. Run an Azure Resource Graph query using the `Search-AzGraph` cmdlet:

   ```azurepowershell
   Search-AzGraph -Query 'Resources | project name, type | limit 5'
   ```

   This query example doesn't use a sort modifier like `order by`. If you run the query multiple times, it might yield a different set of resources for each request.

1. Update the query to `order by` the `name` property:

   ```azurepowershell
   Search-AzGraph -Query 'Resources | project name, type | limit 5 | order by name asc'
   ```

   Like the previous query, if you run this query multiple times might yield a different set of resources for each request. The order of the query commands is important. In this example, the `order by` comes after the `limit`. The query limits the results to five resources and then orders those results by name.

1. Update the query to `order by` the `name` property and then `limit` the output to five results:

   ```azurepowershell
   Search-AzGraph -Query 'Resources | project name, type | order by name asc | limit 5'
   ```

   If this query is run several times with no changes to your environment, the results are consistent and ordered by the `name` property, but still limited to five results. The query orders the results by name and then limits the output to five resources.

If a query doesn't return results from a subscription you already have access to, then note that `Search-AzGraph` cmdlet defaults to subscriptions in the default context. To see the list of subscription IDs that are part of the default context, run this `(Get-AzContext).Account.ExtendedProperties.Subscriptions` If you wish to search across all the subscriptions you have access to, set the `PSDefaultParameterValues` for `Search-AzGraph` cmdlet by running `$PSDefaultParameterValues=@{"Search-AzGraph:Subscription"= $(Get-AzSubscription).ID}`

## Clean up resources

To sign out of your Azure PowerShell session:

```azurepowershell
Disconnect-AzAccount
```

### Optional clean up steps

If you installed the latest version of Azure PowerShell, the `Az.ResourceGraph` module is included and shouldn't be removed. The following steps are optional if you did a manual install of the `Az.ResourceGraph` module and want to remove the module. 

To remove the `Az.ResourceGraph` module from your PowerShell session, run the following command:

```azurepowershell
Remove-Module -Name Az.ResourceGraph
```

To uninstall the `Az.ResourceGraph` module from your computer, run the following command:

```azurepowershell
Uninstall-Module -Name Az.ResourceGraph
```

A message might be displayed that _module Az.ResourceGraph is currently in use_. If so, you need to shut down your PowerShell session and start a new session. Then run the command to uninstall the module from your computer.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you added the Resource Graph module to your Azure PowerShell environment and ran a query. To learn more, go to the query language details page.
