# Quickstart: Create alerts with Azure Resource Graph and Log Analytics

In this quickstart, you learn how you can use Azure Log Analytics to create alerts on Azure Resource Graph queries. You can create alerts with Azure Resource Graph query, Log Analytics workspace, and managed identities. The alert's conditions send notifications at a specified interval.

You can use queries to set up alerts for your deployed Azure resources. You can create queries using Azure Resource Graph tables, or you can combine Azure Resource Graph tables and Log Analytics data from Azure Monitor Logs.

In this article's examples, create resources in the same resource group and use the same region, like _West US 3_. The examples in this article run queries and create alerts for Azure resources in a single Azure tenant. Azure Data Explorer clusters are out of this article's scope.

This article includes two examples of alerts:

- **Azure Resource Graph**: Uses the Azure Resource Graph `Resources` table to create a query that gets data for your deployed Azure resources and create an alert.
- **Azure Resource Graph and Log Analytics**: Uses the Azure Resource Graph `Resources` table and Log Analytics data from the from Azure Monitor Logs `Heartbeat` table. This example uses a virtual machine to show how to set up the query and alert.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Resource Graph alerts integration with Log Analytics is in public preview.

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure account, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
- Resources deployed in Azure like virtual machines or storage accounts.
- To use the example for the Azure Resource Graph and Log Analytics query, you need at least one Azure virtual machine with the Azure Monitor Agent.

## Create workspace

Create a Log Analytics Workspace in the subscription that's being monitored.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In the search field, type _log analytics workspaces_ and select **Log Analytics workspaces**.

   If you used Log Analytics workspaces, you can select it from **Azure services**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/alerts-query-quickstart/search-log-analytics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure home page that highlights search field and Log Analytics workspaces.":::

1. Select **Create**:
   - **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription
   - **Resource group**: _demo-arg-alert-rg_
   - **Name**: _demo-arg-alert-workspace_
   - **Region**: _West US 3_
     - You can select a different region, but use the same region for other resources.

1. Select **Review + create** and wait for **Validation passed** to be displayed.
1. Select **Create** to begin the deployment.
1. Select **Go to resource** when the deployment is completed.

## Create virtual machine

# [Azure Resource Graph](#tab/azure-resource-graph)

You don't need to create a virtual machine for the example that uses the Azure Resource Graph table.

# [Azure Resource Graph and Log Analytics](#tab/arg-log-analytics)

> [!NOTE]
> This section is optional if you have existing virtual machines or know how to create a virtual machine. This example uses a virtual machine to show how to create a query using an Azure Resource Graph table and Log Analytics data.

To get log information, when you connect your virtual machine to the Log Analytics workspace, the Azure Monitor Agent is installed on the virtual machine. If you don't have a virtual machine, you can create one for this example. To avoid unnecessary costs, delete the virtual machine when you're finished with the example.

The following instructions are basic settings for a Linux virtual machine. Detailed steps about how to create a virtual machine are outside the scope of this article. Your organization might require different security or networking settings for virtual machines.

1. In Azure, create an [Ubuntu Linux virtual machine](https://portal.azure.com/#create/canonical.0001-com-ubuntu-server-jammy22_04-lts-gen2).
1. Select **Create**.
1. From **Create a virtual machine** you can accept default settings with the following exceptions:

   **Basics**
   - **Resource group**: _demo-arg-alert-rg_
   - **virtual machine name**: Enter a virtual machine name like _demovm01_.
   - **Availability options**: _No infrastructure redundancy required_
   - **Size**: _Standard\_B1s_
   - **Administrator account**: You must create credentials, but for this example, you don't need to sign in:
      - **Authentication type**: _SSH public key_
      - **Username**: Create a username
      - **SSH public key source**: _Generate new key pair_
      - **Key pair name**: Accept default name
   - **Public inbound ports**: _None_

   **Disks**
   - Verify **Delete with VM** is selected.

   **Networking**
   - **Public IP**: _None_
   - Select **Delete NIC when VM is deleted**.

   **Management**

   - Select **Enable auto-shutdown**.
   - Select a shutdown time in your time zone.
   - Add your email address if you want a shutdown notification.

   **Monitoring**, **Advanced**, and **Tags**
   - No changes needed for this example.

1. Select **Review + create** and then **Create**.

   You're prompted to **Generate new key pair**. Select **Download private key and create resource**. When you're finished with the virtual machine, delete the private key file from your computer.

1. Select **Go to resource** after the virtual machine is deployed.

> [!NOTE]
> This section is optional if you know how to connect a virtual machine to a Log Analytics workspace and Azure Monitor Agent.

Set up a data collection rule for monitoring the virtual machine.

1. From the Azure search field, enter _data collection rules_ and select **Data collection rules**.
1. Select **Create**:
   - **Rule name**: Enter a name like _demo-data-collection-rule_.
   - **Subscription**: Select your subscription.
   - **Resource Group**: Select _demo-arg-alert-rg_.
   - **Region**: _West US 3_.
   - **Platform type**: Select _All_.
1. Select **Next: Resources**:
   - Select **Add resources**.
   - **Subscription**: Select your subscription.
   - **Scope**: Select your resource group and the virtual machine's name.
   - Select **Apply**.
1. Select **Next: Collect and deliver**:
   - Select **Add data source**.
   - **Data source type**: Select _Performance Counters_.
   - Select **Next: Destination** and **Add destination**:
    - **Destination type**: _Azure Monitor Logs_.
    - **Subscription**: Select your subscription.
    - **Account or namespace**: Select your Log Analytics workspace, _demo-arg-alert-workspace_.
   - Select **Add data  source**.
   - Select **Review + create**, then **Create**.
   - Select **Go to resource** when the deployment is finished.

Verify monitoring is configured for the virtual machine:

1. Go to your data collection rule and review the **Configuration**:
   - **Data Sources**: Shows the data source Performance Counters and destination Azure Monitor Logs.
   - **Resources**: Shows the virtual machine, resource group, and subscription.
1. Go to your Log Analytics workspace _demo-arg-alert-workspace_. Select **Settings** > **Agents** > **Linux servers** and your Linux computer is connected to the **Azure Monitor Linux agent**. It can take a few minutes for the agent to be displayed.
1. Go to your virtual machine and select **Settings** > **Extensions + applications** and verify that the `AzureMonitorLinuxAgent`shows provisioning succeeded.

## Create query

# [Azure Resource Graph](#tab/azure-resource-graph)

From the Log Analytics workspace, create an Azure Resource Graph query to get a count of your Azure resources. This example uses the Azure Resource Graph `Resources` table.

1. Select **Logs** from the left side of the **Log Analytics workspace** page. Close the **Queries** window if displayed.
1. Use the following code in the **New Query**:

   ```kusto
   arg("").Resources
   | count
   ```

   Table names in Log Analytics need to be camel case with the first letter of each word capitalized, like `Resources` or `ResourceContainers`. You can also use lowercase like `resources` or `resourcecontainers`.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/alerts-query-quickstart/log-analytics-workspace-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Log Analytics workspace with a query of the Resources table that highlights logs and run button.":::

1. Select **Run**.

   The **Results** displays the **Count** of resources in your Azure subscription. Make a note of that number because you need it for the alert rule's condition. When you manually run the query the count is based on user identity, and a fired alert uses a managed identity. It's possible that the count might vary between a manual run or fired alert.

1. Remove the count from your query.

   ```kusto
   arg("").Resources
   ```

# [Azure Resource Graph and Log Analytics](#tab/arg-log-analytics)

From the Log Analytics workspace, create an Azure Resource Graph query to get the last heartbeat information from your virtual machine. This example uses the Azure Resource Graph `Resources` table and Log Analytics data from the from Azure Monitor Logs `Heartbeat` table.

1. Go to your _demo-arg-alert-workspace_ Log Analytics workspace.
1. Select **Logs** from the left side of the **Log Analytics workspace** page. Close the **Queries** window if displayed.
1. Use the following code in the **New Query**:

   ```kusto
   arg("").Resources
   | where type == 'microsoft.compute/virtualmachines'
   | project ResourceId = id, name, PowerState = tostring(properties.extended.instanceView.powerState.code)
   | join (Heartbeat
     | where TimeGenerated > ago(15m)
     | summarize lastHeartBeat = max(TimeGenerated) by ResourceId)
     on ResourceId
   | project lastHeartBeat, PowerState, name, ResourceId
   ```

   Table names in Log Analytics need to be camel case with the first letter of each word capitalized, like `Resources` or `ResourceContainers`. You can also use lowercase like `resources` or `resourcecontainers`.

   You can use other timeframes for the `TimeGenerated`. For example, rather than minutes like `15m` use hours like `12h`, `24h`, `48h`.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/alerts-query-quickstart/log-analytics-cross-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Log Analytics workspace with a cross query of the Resources and Heartbeat tables that highlights logs and run button.":::

1. Select **Run**.

   The query should return the virtual machine's last heartbeat, power state, name, and resource ID. If no **Results** are displayed, continue to the next steps. New configurations can take 30 minutes for monitoring data to become available for the query and alerts.

## Verify alerts

# [Azure Resource Graph](#tab/azure-resource-graph)

After the role is assigned to your alert rule, you begin to receive email for alert messages. The rule was created to send alerts every five minutes and it takes a few minutes to get the first alert.

You can also view the alerts in the Azure portal:

1. Go to the resource group _demo-arg-alert-rg_.
1. Select _demo-arg-alert-workspace_ in your list of resources.
1. Select **Monitoring** > **Alerts**.
1. A list of alerts is displayed.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/alerts-query-quickstart/alert-fired.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Log Analytics workspace that shows list of alerts that fired.":::

After the role is assigned to your alert rule, you begin to receive email for alert messages. The rule was created to send alerts every five minutes and it takes a few minutes to get the first alert.

You can also view the alerts in the Azure portal:

1. Go to the resource group _demo-arg-alert-rg_.
1. Select your virtual machine.
1. Select **Monitoring** > **Alerts**.
1. A list of alerts is displayed.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/alerts-query-quickstart/vm-alert-fired.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the virtual machine monitoring alerts that shows list of alerts that fired.":::

For a new configuration, it might take 30 minutes for log information to become available and create alerts. During that time, you might notice the virtual machine's alert rule displays alerts in the workspace's monitoring alerts. When the virtual machine's log information becomes available, the alerts are displayed in the virtual machine's monitoring alerts.

---

## Clean up resources

If you want to keep the alert configuration but stop the alert from firing and sending email notifications, you can disable it. Go to your alert rule _demo-arg-alert-rule_ or _demo-arg-la-alert-rule_ and select **Disable**.

If you don't need this alert or the resources you created in this example, delete the resource group with the following steps:

1. Go to your resource group _demo-arg-alert-rg_.
1. Select **Delete resource group**.
1. Type the resource group name to confirm.
1. Select **Delete**.

If you created a virtual machine, delete the private key you downloaded to your computer during the deployment. The filename has a `.pem` extension.
