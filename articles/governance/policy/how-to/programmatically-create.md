# Programmatically create policies

This article walks you through programmatically creating and managing policies. Azure Policy definitions enforce different rules and effects over your resources. Enforcement makes sure that resources stay compliant with your corporate standards and service-level agreements.

For information about compliance, see [getting compliance data](get-compliance-data.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. If you haven't already, install the [ARMClient](https://github.com/projectkudu/ARMClient). It's a tool that sends HTTP requests to Azure Resource Manager-based APIs.

1. Update your Azure PowerShell module to the latest version. See [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) for detailed information. For more information about the latest version, see [Azure PowerShell](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/releases).

1. Register the Azure Policy Insights resource provider using Azure PowerShell to validate that your subscription works with the resource provider. To register a resource provider, you must have permission to run the register action operation for the resource provider. This operation is included in the Contributor and Owner roles. Run the following command to register the resource provider:

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace 'Microsoft.PolicyInsights'
   ```

   For more information about registering and viewing resource providers, see [Resource Providers and Types](../../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md).

1. If you haven't already, install Azure CLI. You can get the latest version at [Install Azure CLI on Windows](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows).

## Create and assign a policy definition

The first step toward better visibility of your resources is to create and assign policies over your resources. The next step is to learn how to programmatically create and assign a policy. The example policy audits storage accounts that are open to all public networks using PowerShell, Azure CLI, and HTTP requests.

### Create and assign a policy definition with PowerShell

1. Use the following JSON snippet to create a JSON file with the name AuditStorageAccounts.json.

   ```json
   {
     "if": {
       "allOf": [
         {
           "field": "type",
           "equals": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
         },
         {
           "field": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/networkAcls.defaultAction",
           "equals": "Allow"
         }
       ]
     },
     "then": {
       "effect": "audit"
     }
   }
   ```

   For more information about authoring a policy definition, see [Azure Policy Definition Structure](../concepts/definition-structure-basics.md).

1. Run the following command to create a policy definition using the _AuditStorageAccounts.json_ file.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   New-AzPolicyDefinition -Name 'AuditStorageAccounts' -DisplayName 'Audit Storage Accounts Open to Public Networks' -Policy 'AuditStorageAccounts.json'
   ```

   The command creates a policy definition named _Audit Storage Accounts Open to Public Networks_. For more information about other parameters that you can use, see [New-AzPolicyDefinition](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azpolicydefinition).

   When called without location parameters, `New-AzPolicyDefinition` defaults to saving the policy definition in the selected subscription of the sessions context. To save the definition to a different location, use the following parameters:

   - **SubscriptionId** - Save to a different subscription. Requires a _GUID_ value.
   - **ManagementGroupName** - Save to a management group. Requires a _string_ value.

1. After you create your policy definition, you can create a policy assignment by running the following commands:

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $rg = Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'ContosoRG'
   $Policy = Get-AzPolicyDefinition -Name 'AuditStorageAccounts'
   New-AzPolicyAssignment -Name 'AuditStorageAccounts' -PolicyDefinition $Policy -Scope $rg.ResourceId
   ```

   Replace _ContosoRG_ with the name of your intended resource group.

   The `Scope` parameter on `New-AzPolicyAssignment` works with management group, subscription, resource group, or a single resource. The parameter uses a full resource path, which the `ResourceId` property on `Get-AzResourceGroup` returns. The pattern for `Scope` for each container is as follows. Replace `{rName}`, `{rgName}`, `{subId}`, and `{mgName}` with your resource name, resource group name, subscription ID, and management group name, respectively. `{rType}` would be replaced with the _resource type_ of the resource, such as `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines` for a virtual machine.

   - Resource - `/subscriptions/{subID}/resourceGroups/{rgName}/providers/{rType}/{rName}`
   - Resource group - `/subscriptions/{subId}/resourceGroups/{rgName}`
   - Subscription - `/subscriptions/{subId}`
   - Management group - `/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{mgName}`

For more information about managing resource policies using the Resource Manager PowerShell module, see [Az.Resources](/powershell/module/az.resources/#policy).

### Create and assign a policy definition using ARMClient

Use the following procedure to create a policy definition.

1. Copy the following JSON snippet to create a JSON file. You'll call the file in the next step.

   ```json
   "properties": {
     "displayName": "Audit Storage Accounts Open to Public Networks",
     "policyType": "Custom",
     "mode": "Indexed",
     "description": "This policy ensures that storage accounts with exposure to Public Networks are audited.",
     "parameters": {},
     "policyRule": {
       "if": {
         "allOf": [
           {
             "field": "type",
             "equals": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
           },
           {
             "field": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/networkAcls.defaultAction",
             "equals": "Allow"
           }
         ]
       },
       "then": {
         "effect": "audit"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

1. Create the policy definition using one of the following calls:

   ```console
   # For defining a policy in a subscription
   armclient PUT "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/AuditStorageAccounts?api-version=2021-09-01" @<path to policy definition JSON file>

   # For defining a policy in a management group
   armclient PUT "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementgroups/{managementGroupId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/AuditStorageAccounts?api-version=2021-09-01" @<path to policy definition JSON file>
   ```

   Replace the preceding `{subscriptionId}` with the ID of your subscription or `{managementGroupId}` with the ID of your [management group](../../management-groups/overview.md).

   For more information about the structure of the query, see [Azure Policy Definitions - Create or Update](/rest/api/policy/policy-definitions/create-or-update) and [Policy Definitions - Create or Update At Management Group](/rest/api/policy/policy-definitions/create-or-update-at-management-group).

Use the following procedure to create a policy assignment and assign the policy definition at the resource group level.

1. Copy the following JSON snippet to create a JSON policy assignment file. Replace example information in &lt;&gt; symbols with your own values.

   ```json
   {
     "properties": {
       "description": "This policy assignment makes sure that storage accounts with exposure to Public Networks are audited.",
       "displayName": "Audit Storage Accounts Open to Public Networks Assignment",
       "parameters": {},
       "policyDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/Audit Storage Accounts Open to Public Networks",
       "scope": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>"
     }
   }
   ```

1. Create the policy assignment using the following call:

   ```console
   armclient PUT "/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/Audit Storage Accounts Open to Public Networks?api-version=2021-09-01" @<path to Assignment JSON file>
   ```

   Replace example information in &lt;&gt; symbols with your own values.

   For more information about making HTTP calls to the REST API, see [Azure REST API Resources](/rest/api/resources/).

### Create and assign a policy definition with Azure CLI

To create a policy definition, use the following procedure:

1. Copy the following JSON snippet to create a JSON policy assignment file.

   ```json
   {
     "if": {
       "allOf": [
         {
           "field": "type",
           "equals": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
         },
         {
           "field": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/networkAcls.defaultAction",
           "equals": "Allow"
         }
       ]
     },
     "then": {
       "effect": "audit"
     }
   }
   ```

   For more information about authoring a policy definition, see [Azure Policy Definition Structure](../concepts/definition-structure-basics.md).

1. Run the following command to create a policy definition:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az policy definition create --name 'audit-storage-accounts-open-to-public-networks' --display-name 'Audit Storage Accounts Open to Public Networks' --description 'This policy ensures that storage accounts with exposures to public networks are audited.' --rules '<path to json file>' --mode All
   ```

   The command creates a policy definition named _Audit Storage Accounts Open to Public Networks_. For more information about other parameters that you can use, see [az policy definition create](/cli/azure/policy/definition#az-policy-definition-create).

   When called without location parameters, `az policy definition creation` defaults to saving the policy definition in the selected subscription of the sessions context. To save the definition to a different location, use the following parameters:

   - **subscription** - Save to a different subscription. Requires a _GUID_ value for the subscription ID or a _string_ value for the subscription name.
   - **management-group** - Save to a management group. Requires a _string_ value.

1. Use the following command to create a policy assignment. Replace example information in angle brackets `< >` symbols with your own values.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az policy assignment create --name '<name>' --scope '<scope>' --policy '<policy definition ID>'
   ```

   The `scope` parameter on `az policy assignment create` works with management group, subscription, resource group, or a single resource. The parameter uses a full resource path. The pattern for `scope` for each container is as follows. Replace `{rName}`, `{rgName}`, `{subId}`, and `{mgName}` with your resource name, resource group name, subscription ID, and management group name, respectively. `{rType}` would be replaced with the _resource type_ of the resource, such as `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines` for a virtual machine.

   - Resource - `/subscriptions/{subID}/resourceGroups/{rgName}/providers/{rType}/{rName}`
   - Resource group - `/subscriptions/{subID}/resourceGroups/{rgName}`
   - Subscription - `/subscriptions/{subID}`
   - Management group - `/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{mgName}`

You can get the Azure Policy Definition ID by using PowerShell with the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az policy definition show --name 'Audit Storage Accounts with Open Public Networks'
```

The policy definition ID for the policy definition that you created should resemble the following example:

```output
"/subscription/<subscriptionId>/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/Audit Storage Accounts Open to Public Networks"
```
