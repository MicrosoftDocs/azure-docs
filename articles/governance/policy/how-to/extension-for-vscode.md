# Use Azure Policy extension for Visual Studio Code

> Applies to Azure Policy extension version **0.1.2** and newer

Learn how to use the Azure Policy extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to look up
[aliases](../concepts/definition-structure-alias.md), review resources and policy definitions,
export objects, and evaluate policy definitions. First, we'll describe how to install the Azure
Policy extension in Visual Studio Code. Then we'll walk through how to look up aliases.

The Azure Policy extension for Visual Studio Code can be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Prerequisites

The following items are required for completing the steps in this article:

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a
  [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## Install and configure the Azure Policy extension

After you meet the prerequisites, you can install the [Azure Policy extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AzurePolicy.azurepolicyextension) by
following these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
1. From the menu bar, go to **View** > **Extensions**.
1. In the search box, enter **Azure Policy**.
1. Select **Azure Policy** from the search results, and then select **Install**.
1. Select **Reload** when necessary.

For a national cloud user, follow these steps to set the Azure environment first:

1. Select **File** > **Preferences** > **Settings**.
1. Search on the following string: _Azure: Cloud_
1. Select the nation cloud from the list:

## Using the Policy extension

> [!NOTE]
> Changes made locally to policy definitions viewed in the Azure Policy extension for Visual Studio
> Code aren't synced to Azure.

### Connect to an Azure account

To evaluate resources and lookup aliases, you must connect to your Azure account. Follow these steps
to connect to Azure from Visual Studio Code:

1. Sign in to Azure from the Azure Policy extension or the Command Palette.

   - Azure Policy extension

     From the Azure Policy extension, select **Sign in to Azure**.

     :::image type="content" source="../media/extension-for-vscode/azure-cloud-sign-in-policy-extension.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code and the icon for the Azure Policy extension." border="false":::

   - Command Palette

     From the menu bar, go to **View** > **Command Palette**, and enter **Azure: Sign In**.

     :::image type="content" source="../media/extension-for-vscode/azure-cloud-sign-in-command-palette.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure cloud sign in options for Visual Studio Code from the Command Palette." border="false":::

1. Follow the sign in instructions to sign in to Azure. After you're connected, your Azure account
   name is shown on the status bar at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code window.

### Select subscriptions

When you first sign in, only the default subscription resources and policy definitions are loaded by
the Azure Policy extension. To add or remove subscriptions from displaying resources and policy
definitions, follow these steps:

1. Start the subscription command from the Command Palette or the window footer.

   - Command Palette

     From the menu bar, go to **View** > **Command Palette**, and enter **Azure: Select
     Subscriptions**.

   - Window footer

     In the window footer at the bottom of the screen, select the segment that matches **Azure:
     \<your account\>**.

1. Use the filter box to quickly find subscriptions by name. Then, check or remove the check from
   each subscription to set the subscriptions shown by the Azure Policy extension. When done adding
   or removing subscriptions to display, select **OK**.

### Search for and view resources

The Azure Policy extension lists resources in the selected subscriptions by Resource Provider and by
resource group in the **Resources** pane. The tree view includes the following groupings of resources
within the selected subscription or at the subscription level:

- **Resource Providers**
  - Each registered Resource Provider with resources and related child resources that have policy
    aliases
- **Resource Groups**
  - All resources by the resource group they're in

By default, the extension filters the 'Resource Provider' portion by existing resources and
resources that have policy aliases. Change this behavior in **Settings** > **Extensions** > **Azure
Policy** to see all Resource Providers without filtering.

Customers with hundreds or thousands of resources in a single subscription may prefer a searchable
way to locate their resources. The Azure Policy extension makes it possible to search for a specific
resource with the following steps:

1. Start the search interface from the Azure Policy extension or the Command Palette.

   - Azure Policy extension

     From the Azure Policy extension, hover over the **Resources** panel and select the ellipsis,
     then select **Search Resources**.

   - Command Palette

     From the menu bar, go to **View** > **Command Palette**, and enter **Azure Policy: Search
     Resources**.

1. If more than one subscription is selected for display, use the filter to select which
   subscription to search.

1. Use the filter to select which resource group to search that is part of the previously chosen
   subscription.

1. Use the filter to select which resource to display. The filter works for both the resource name
   and the resource type.

### Discover aliases for resource properties

When a resource is selected, whether through the search interface or by selecting it in the
tree view, the Azure Policy extension opens the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file representing that resource and all its
Azure Resource Manager property values.

Once a resource is open, hovering over the Resource Manager property name or value displays the
Azure Policy alias if one exists. In this example, the resource is a
`Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines` resource type and the
**properties.storageProfile.imageReference.offer** property is hovered over. Hovering shows the
matching aliases.

> [!NOTE]
> The VS Code extension only supports evaluation of Resource Manager mode properties. For more
> information about the modes, see the [mode definitions](../concepts/definition-structure-basics.md#mode).

### Search for and view policy definitions and assignments

The Azure Policy extension lists policy types and policy assignments as a tree view for the
subscriptions selected to be displayed in the **Policies** pane. Customers with hundreds or
thousands of policy definitions or assignments in a single subscription may prefer a searchable way
to locate their policy definitions or assignments. The Azure Policy extension makes it possible to
search for a specific policy or assignment with the following steps:

1. Start the search interface from the Azure Policy extension or the Command Palette.

   - Azure Policy extension

     From the Azure Policy extension, hover over the **Policies** panel and select the ellipsis,
     then select **Search Policies**.

   - Command Palette

     From the menu bar, go to **View** > **Command Palette**, and enter **Azure Policy: Search
     Policies**.

1. If more than one subscription is selected for display, use the filter to select which
   subscription to search.

1. Use the filter to select which policy type or assignment to search that is part of the previously
   chosen subscription.

1. Use the filter to select which policy or to display. The filter works for _displayName_ for the
   policy definition or policy assignment.

When selecting a policy or assignment, whether through the search interface or by selecting it in
the tree view, the Azure Policy extension opens the JSON that represents the policy or assignment and
all its Resource Manager property values. The extension can validate the opened Azure Policy JSON
schema.

> [!NOTE]
> The VS Code extension will only show the latest version of the policy definition. For more
> information about the versions of definitions, see the [definitions](../concepts/definition-structure-basics.md#version-preview).

### Export objects

Objects from your subscriptions can be exported to a local JSON file. In either the **Resources** or
**Policies** pane, hover over or select an exportable object. At the end of the highlighted row,
select the save icon and select a folder to save that resources JSON.

The following objects can be exported locally:

- Resources pane
  - Resource groups
  - Individual resources (either in a resource group or under a Resource Provider)
- Policies pane
  - Policy assignments
  - Built-in policy definitions
  - Custom policy definitions
  - Initiatives

### On-demand evaluation scan

An evaluation scan can be started with the Azure Policy extension for Visual Studio Code. To start
an evaluation, select and pin each of the following objects: a resource, a policy definition, and a
policy assignment.

1. To pin each object, find it in either the **Resources** pane or the **Policies** pane and select
   the pin to an edit tab icon. Pinning an object adds it to the **Evaluation** pane of the
   extension.
1. In the **Evaluation** pane, select one of each object and use the select for evaluation icon to
   mark it as included in the evaluation.
1. At the top of the **Evaluation** pane, select the run evaluation icon. A new pane in Visual
   Studio Code opens with the resulting evaluation details in JSON form.

> [!NOTE]
> For [AuditIfNotExists](../concepts/effect-audit-if-not-exists.md) or
> [DeployIfNotExists](../concepts/effect-deploy-if-not-exists.md) policy definitions, use the plus
> icon in the **Evaluation** pane or **Azure Policy: Select a resource for existence check (only
> used for if-not-exists policies)** from the Command Palette to select a _related_ resource for the
> existence check.

The evaluation results provide information about the policy definition and policy assignment along
with the **policyEvaluations.evaluationResult** property. The output looks similar to the following
example:

```json
{
    "policyEvaluations": [
        {
            "policyInfo": {
                ...
            },
            "evaluationResult": "Compliant",
            "effectDetails": {
                "policyEffect": "Audit",
                "existenceScope": "None"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The VS Code extension only supports evaluation of Resource Manager mode properties. For more
> information about the modes, see the [mode definitions](../concepts/definition-structure-basics.md#mode).
>
> The evaluation feature does not work on macOS and Linux installations of the extension.

### Create policy definition from a constraint template or mutation template

The VS Code extension can create a policy definition from an existing
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA) GateKeeper v3
[constraint template](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/howto/#constraint-templates) or an existing [mutation template](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/mutation/). The YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML)
file must be open in VS Code for the Command Palette to be an option.

1. Open a valid OPA GateKeeper v3 constraint template YAML file.

1. From the menu bar, go to **View** > **Command Palette**, and enter **Azure Policy for Kubernetes:
   Create Policy Definition from Constraint Template Or Mutation**.

1. Select the appropriate _sourceType_ value.

1. Fill in the `/* EDIT HERE */` portions of the policy definition JSON.

While the extension generates the JSON of a policy definition, it doesn't create the definition in
Azure. Once you've filled in the appropriate "edit here" fields, use the completed policy definition
JSON and the Azure portal or supported SDK to create the policy definition within your Azure
environment.

### Sign out

From the menu bar, go to **View** > **Command Palette**, and then enter **Azure: Sign Out**.
