# Disabled

The `disabled` effect is useful for testing situations or for when the policy definition has parameterized the effect. This flexibility makes it possible to disable a single assignment instead of disabling all of that policy's assignments.

> [!NOTE]
> Policy definitions that use the `disabled` effect have the default compliance state **Compliant** after assignment.

An alternative to the `disabled` effect is `enforcementMode`, which is set on the policy assignment. When `enforcementMode` is `disabled`, resources are still evaluated. Logging, such as Activity logs, and the policy effect don't occur. For more information, see [policy assignment - enforcement mode](./assignment-structure.md#enforcement-mode).
