# Azure Policy definitions mutate (preview) effect

Mutation is used in Azure Policy for Kubernetes to remediate Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster components, like pods. This effect is specific to _Microsoft.Kubernetes.Data_ [policy mode](./definition-structure-basics.md#resource-provider-modes) definitions only.

To learn more, go to [Understand Azure Policy for Kubernetes clusters](./policy-for-kubernetes.md).

## Mutate properties

- `mutationInfo` (optional)
  - Can't be used with `constraint`, `constraintTemplate`, `apiGroups`, or `kinds`.
  - Can't be parameterized.
  - `sourceType` (required)
    - Defines the type of source for the constraint. Allowed values: `PublicURL` or `Base64Encoded`.
    - If `PublicURL`, paired with property `url` to provide location of the mutation template. The location must be publicly accessible.
      > [!WARNING]
      > Don't use SAS URIs or tokens in `url` or anything else that could expose a secret.
