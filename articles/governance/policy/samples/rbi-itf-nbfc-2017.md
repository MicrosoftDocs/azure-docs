# Details of the Reserve Bank of India - IT Framework for NBFC Regulatory Compliance built-in initiative

The following article details how the Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance built-in initiative
definition maps to **compliance domains** and **controls** in Reserve Bank of India - IT Framework for NBFC.
For more information about this compliance standard, see
[Reserve Bank of India - IT Framework for NBFC](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10999&Mode=0#C1). To understand
_Ownership_, review the [policy type](../concepts/definition-structure-basics.md#policy-type) and
[Shared responsibility in the cloud](/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility).

The following mappings are to the **Reserve Bank of India - IT Framework for NBFC** controls. Many of the controls
are implemented with an [Azure Policy](../overview.md) initiative definition. To review the complete
initiative definition, open **Policy** in the Azure portal and select the **Definitions** page.
Then, find and select the **[Preview]: Reserve Bank of India - IT Framework for NBFC** Regulatory Compliance built-in
initiative definition.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each control below is associated with one or more [Azure Policy](../overview.md) definitions.
> These policies may help you [assess compliance](../how-to/get-compliance-data.md) with the
> control; however, there often is not a one-to-one or complete match between a control and one or
> more policies. As such, **Compliant** in Azure Policy refers only to the policy definitions
> themselves; this doesn't ensure you're fully compliant with all requirements of a control. In
> addition, the compliance standard includes controls that aren't addressed by any Azure Policy
> definitions at this time. Therefore, compliance in Azure Policy is only a partial view of your
> overall compliance status. The associations between compliance domains, controls, and Azure Policy
> definitions for this compliance standard may change over time. To view the change history, see the
> [GitHub Commit History](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/commits/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Regulatory%20Compliance/RBI_ITF_NBFC_v2017.json).
