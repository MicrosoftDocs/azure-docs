# Linux security baseline

> [!CAUTION]
> This article references CentOS, a Linux distribution that is End Of Life (EOL) status. Please consider your use and planning accordingly. For more information, see the [CentOS End Of Life guidance](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/centos/centos-end-of-life).

This article details the configuration settings for Linux guests as applicable in the following
implementations:

- **Linux machines should meet requirements for the Azure compute security baseline**
  Azure Policy guest configuration definition
- **Vulnerabilities in security configuration on your machines should be remediated** in Microsoft Defender for Cloud

For the remediation checks and suggestions we took a best practices approach - however please always ensure that the commands will be tested and not applied blindly in any production environment. For automatic remediations, we've release in Limited Public Preview our new auto-remediation capability so you can test this policy with "DeployIfNotExist" action as well.

The new release of the policy for both audit and remediation is powered by [azure-osconfig](https://github.com/Azure/azure-osconfig)  our open-source engine - you can read more about the [replatforming announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/linuxandopensourceblog/from-compliance-to-auto-remediation-azures-latest-linux-security-innovations/4297553).

For more information, see [Azure Policy guest configuration](../concepts/guest-configuration.md) and
[Overview of the Azure Security Benchmark (V2)](/azure/security/benchmarks/overview).

The [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/) mappings are based on the Distro Independent Benchmark v2.0.0 version.

|Ensure password creation requirements are configured.<br /><sub>(5.3.1)</sub> |Ensure password creation requirements are configured (CIS: L1 - Server - 5.3.1) |Description: Strong passwords protect systems from being hacked through brute force methods. |Configure PAM password complexity in `/etc/pam.d/common-password` or `/etc/pam.d/system-auth`: `password requisite pam_pwquality.so minlen=14 minclass=4 dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 ocredit=-1 lcredit=-1` |
|Ensure lockout for failed password attempts is configured.<br /><sub>(5.3.2)</sub> |Ensure lockout for failed password attempts is configured (CIS: L1 - Server - 5.3.2) |Description: Locking out user IDs after `n` unsuccessful consecutive login attempts mitigates brute force password attacks against your systems. |for Ubuntu and Debian, add the pam_tally and pam_deny modules as appropriate. For all other distros, refer to your distro's documentation |
|Disable the installation and use of file systems that aren't required (cramfs)<br /><sub>(6.1)</sub> |Ensure the cramfs file system is disabled (CIS: L1 - Server - 1.1.1.1) |Description: An attacker could use a vulnerability in cramfs to elevate privileges |Add `install cramfs /bin/true` to a file in `/etc/modprobe.d/` ending in .conf, then run `modprobe -r cramfs` |
|Disable the installation and use of file systems that aren't required (freevxfs)<br /><sub>(6.2)</sub> |Ensure the freevxfs file system is disabled (CIS: L1 - Server - 1.1.1.2) |Description: An attacker could use a vulnerability in freevxfs to elevate privileges |Add `install freevxfs /bin/true` to a file in `/etc/modprobe.d/` ending in .conf, then run `modprobe -r freevxfs` |
|Ensure all users' home directories exist<br /><sub>(6.2.7)</sub> |Ensure all users' home directories exist (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.7) |Description: If the user's home directory does not exist or is unassigned, the user will be placed in the volume root. Moreover, the user will be unable either to write any files or set environment variables. |If any users' home directories don't exist, create them and make sure the respective user owns the directory. Users without an assigned home directory should be removed or assigned a home directory as appropriate. |
|Ensure users own their home directories<br /><sub>(6.2.9)</sub> |Ensure users own their home directories (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.9) |Description: Since the user is accountable for files stored in the user home directory, the user must be the owner of the directory. |Change the ownership of any home directories that aren't owned by the defined user to the correct user. |
|Ensure users' dot files aren't group or world writable.<br /><sub>(6.2.10)</sub> |Ensure users' dot files aren't group or world writable (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.10) |Description: Group or world-writable user configuration files may enable malicious users to steal or modify other users' data or to gain another user's system privileges. |Making global modifications to users' files without alerting the user community can result in unexpected outages and unhappy users. Therefore, we recommended you establish a monitoring policy to report user dot file permissions and determine site policy remediation actions. |
|Ensure no users have .forward files<br /><sub>(6.2.11)</sub> |Ensure no users have .forward files (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.11) |Description: Use of the `.forward` file poses a security risk in that sensitive data may be inadvertently transferred outside the organization. The `.forward` file also poses a risk as it can be used to execute commands that may perform unintended actions. |Making global modifications to users' files without alerting the user community can result in unexpected outages and unhappy users. Therefore, it's recommended that a monitoring policy be established to report user `.forward` files and determine the action to be taken in accordance with site policy. |
|Ensure no users have .netrc files<br /><sub>(6.2.12)</sub> |Ensure no users have .netrc files (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.12) |Description: The `.netrc` file presents a significant security risk since it stores passwords in unencrypted form. Even if FTP is disabled, user accounts may have brought over `.netrc` files from other systems that could pose a risk to those systems |Making global modifications to users' files without alerting the user community can result in unexpected outages and unhappy users. Therefore, it's recommended that a monitoring policy be established to report user `.netrc` files and determine the action to be taken in accordance with site policy. |
|Ensure no users have .rhosts files<br /><sub>(6.2.14)</sub> |Ensure no users have .rhosts files (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.14) |Description: This action is only meaningful if `.rhosts` support is permitted in the file `/etc/pam.conf` . Even though the `.rhosts` files are ineffective if support is disabled in `/etc/pam.conf` , they may have been brought over from other systems and could contain information useful to an attacker for those other systems. |Making global modifications to users' files without alerting the user community can result in unexpected outages and unhappy users. Therefore, it's recommended that a monitoring policy be established to report user `.rhosts` files and determine the action to be taken in accordance with site policy. |
|Ensure all groups in /etc/passwd exist in /etc/group<br /><sub>(6.2.15)</sub> |Ensure all groups in /etc/passwd exist in /etc/group (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.15) |Description: Groups which are defined in the /etc/passwd file but not in the /etc/group file poses a threat to system security since group permissions aren't properly managed. |For each group defined in /etc/passwd, ensure there is a corresponding group in /etc/group |
|Ensure no duplicate UIDs exist<br /><sub>(6.2.16)</sub> |Ensure no duplicate UIDs exist (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.16) |Description: Users must be assigned unique UIDs for accountability and to ensure appropriate access protections. |Establish unique UIDs and review all files owned by the shared UIDs to determine which UID they are supposed to belong to. |
|Ensure no duplicate GIDs exist<br /><sub>(6.2.17)</sub> |Ensure no duplicate GIDs exist (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.17) |Description: Groups must be assigned unique GIDs for accountability and to ensure appropriate access protections. |Establish unique GIDs and review all files owned by the shared GIDs to determine which GID they are supposed to belong to. |
|Ensure no duplicate user names exist<br /><sub>(6.2.18)</sub> |Ensure no duplicate user names exist (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.18) |Description: If a user is assigned a duplicate user name, it will create and have access to files with the first UID for that username in `/etc/passwd` . For example, if 'test4' has a UID of 1000 and a subsequent 'test4' entry has a UID of 2000, logging in as 'test4' will use UID 1000. Effectively, the UID is shared, which is a security problem. |Establish unique user names for all users. File ownerships will automatically reflect the change as long as the users have unique UIDs. |
|Ensure no duplicate groups exist<br /><sub>(6.2.19)</sub> |Ensure no duplicate groups exist (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.19) |Description: If a group is assigned a duplicate group name, it will create and have access to files with the first GID for that group in `/etc/group` . Effectively, the GID is shared, which is a security problem. |Establish unique names for all user groups. File group ownerships will automatically reflect the change as long as the groups have unique GIDs. |
|Ensure shadow group is empty<br /><sub>(6.2.20)</sub> |Ensure shadow group is empty (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.20) |Description: Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the /etc/shadow file. If attackers can gain read access to the `/etc/shadow` file, they can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed passwords to break them. Other security information that is stored in the `/etc/shadow` file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert other user accounts. |Remove all users form the shadow group |
|Disable the installation and use of file systems that aren't required (hfs)<br /><sub>(6.3)</sub> |Ensure the hfs file system is disabled (CIS: L1 - Server - 1.1.1.4) |Description: An attacker could use a vulnerability in hfs to elevate privileges |Add `install hfs /bin/true` to a file in `/etc/modprobe.d/` ending in .conf, then run `modprobe -r hfs` |
|Disable the installation and use of file systems that aren't required (hfsplus)<br /><sub>(6.4)</sub> |Ensure the hfsplus file systems is disabled (CIS: L1 - Server - 1.1.1.5) |Description: An attacker could use a vulnerability in hfsplus to elevate privileges |Add `install hfsplus /bin/true` to a file in `/etc/modprobe.d/` ending in .conf, then run `modprobe -r hfsplus` |
|Disable the installation and use of file systems that aren't required (jffs2)<br /><sub>(6.5)</sub> |Ensure the jffs2 file systems is disabled (CIS: L1 - Server - 1.1.1.3) |Description: An attacker could use a vulnerability in jffs2 to elevate privileges |Add `install jffs2 /bin/true` to a file in `/etc/modprobe.d/` ending in .conf, then run `modprobe -r jffs2` |
|Kernels should only be compiled from approved sources.<br /><sub>(10)</sub> |Ensure the kernel is compiled from approved sources |Description: A kernel from an unapproved source could contain vulnerabilities or backdoors to grant access to an attacker. |Install the kernel that is provided by your distro vendor. |

|Accounts other than root must have unique UIDs greater than zero(0)<br /><sub>(24)</sub> |Ensure that all user accounts other than root have unique UIDs greater than zero (0) |Description: If an account other than root has uid zero, an attacker could compromise the account and gain root privileges. |Assign unique, non-zero uids to all non-root accounts using 'usermod -u' |
|Randomized placement of virtual memory regions should be enabled<br /><sub>(25)</sub> |Ensure that randomized placement (ASLR) of virtual memory regions is enabled (CIS: L1 - Server - 1.5.3) |Description: An attacker could write executable code to known regions in memory resulting in elevation of privilege |Add the value '1' or '2' to the file '/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space' |
|Kernel support for the XD/NX processor feature should be enabled<br /><sub>(26)</sub> |Ensure that kernel support for the XD/NX processor feature is enabled (CIS: L1 - Server - 1.5.2) |Description: An attacker could cause a system to execute code from data regions in memory resulting in elevation of privilege. |Confirm the file '/proc/cpuinfo' contains the flag 'nx' |
|The '.' shouldn't appear in root's $PATH<br /><sub>(27.1)</sub> |Ensure '.' does not appear in root's $PATH (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.6) |Description: An attacker could elevate privileges by placing a malicious file in root's $PATH |Modify the 'export PATH=' line in /root/.profile |
|User home directories should be mode 750 or more restrictive<br /><sub>(28)</sub> |Ensure access to user home directories is restricted |Description: An attacker could retrieve sensitive information from the home folders of other users. |Set home directory permissions to 750 or more restrictive: `chmod 750 /home/*` |
|The default umask for all users should be set to 077 in login.defs<br /><sub>(29)</sub> |Ensure the default umask for all users is configured |Description: An attacker could retrieve sensitive information from files owned by other users. |Add `UMASK 077` to `/etc/login.defs` and add `umask 077` to `/etc/profile` and `/etc/bashrc` |
|All bootloaders should have password protection enabled.<br /><sub>(31)</sub> |Ensure all bootloaders have password protection enabled (CIS: L1 - Server - 1.4.2) |Description: An attacker with physical access could modify bootloader options, yielding unrestricted system access |Add a boot loader password to the file '/boot/grub/grub.cfg' |
|Ensure permissions on bootloader config are configured<br /><sub>(31.1)</sub> |Ensure permissions on bootloader config are configured (CIS: L1 - Server - 1.4.1) |Description: Setting the permissions to read and write for root only prevents non-root users from seeing the boot parameters or changing them. Non-root users who read the boot parameters may be able to identify weaknesses in security upon boot and be able to exploit them. |Set bootloader config permissions: `chown root:root /boot/grub*/grub.cfg && chmod 400 /boot/grub*/grub.cfg` (adjust path for your bootloader) |
|Ensure authentication required for single user mode.<br /><sub>(33)</sub> |Ensure authentication is required for single user mode (CIS: L1 - Server - 1.4.3) |Description: Requiring authentication in single user mode prevents an unauthorized user from rebooting the system into single user to gain root privileges without credentials. |run the following command to set a password for the root user: `passwd root` |
|Ensure packet redirect sending is disabled.<br /><sub>(38.3)</sub> |Ensure packet redirect sending is disabled (CIS: L1 - Server - 3.1.2) |Description: An attacker could use a compromised host to send invalid ICMP redirects to other router devices in an attempt to corrupt routing and have users access a system set up by the attacker as opposed to a valid system. |Add to `/etc/sysctl.conf`: `net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0` and `net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0`, then run `sysctl -p` |
|Sending ICMP redirects should be disabled for all interfaces.

|Ensure SSH LogLevel is set to INFO<br /><sub>(106.5)</sub> |Ensure that the SSH LogLevel is configured (CIS: L1 - Server - 5.2.5) |Description: SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. `DEBUG` is specifically _not_ recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides so much data that it's difficult to identify important security information. `INFO` level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident Response, it's important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field. |Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file to set the parameter as follows:         ```         LogLevel INFO         ``` |
|Ensure SSH MaxAuthTries is set to 6 or less<br /><sub>(106.7)</sub> |Ensure that the SSH MaxAuthTries is configured (CIS: L1 - Server - 5.2.7) |Description: Setting the `MaxAuthTries` parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful brute force attacks to the SSH server.

|Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured.<br /><sub>(110.1)</sub> |Ensure that the SSH ClientAliveCountMax is configured |Description: Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session. Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening. While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on site policy. The recommended setting for `ClientAliveCountMax` is 0. In this case, the client session will be terminated after 5 minutes of idle time and no keepalive messages will be sent. |Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameters according to the policy |
|Ensure SSH LoginGraceTime is set to one minute or less.<br /><sub>(110.2)</sub> |Ensure that the SSH LoginGraceTime is configured (CIS: L1 - Server - 5.2.17) |Description: Setting the `LoginGraceTime` parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful brute force attacks to the SSH server.

|Ensure only approved MAC algorithms are used<br /><sub>(110.3)</sub> |Ensure that only approved MAC algorithms are used (CIS: L1 - Server - 5.2.14) |Description: MD5 and 96-bit MAC algorithms are considered weak and have been shown to increase exploitability in SSH downgrade attacks. Weak algorithms continue to have a great deal of attention as a weak spot that can be exploited with expanded computing power. An attacker that breaks the algorithm could take advantage of a MiTM position to decrypt the SSH tunnel and capture credentials and information |Add approved MACs to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`: `MACs hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256` and restart sshd service |
|Ensure remote login warning banner is configured properly.<br /><sub>(111)</sub> |Ensure the remote login warning banner is properly configured (CIS: L1 - Server - 1.7.1.3) |Description: Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns the system and any monitoring policies that are in place. Displaying OS and patch level information in login banners also has the side effect of providing detailed system information to attackers attempting to target specific exploits of a system. Authorized users can easily get this information by running the `uname -a`command once they have logged in. |Remove system information escape sequences (`\m`, `\r`, `\s`, `\v`) from `/etc/issue.net` and replace with appropriate warning text |
|Ensure local login warning banner is configured properly.<br /><sub>(111.1)</sub> |Ensure the local login warning banner is properly configured (CIS: L1 - Server - 1.7.1.2) |Description: Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns the system and any monitoring policies that are in place.

|Ensure no legacy `+` entries exist in /etc/passwd<br /><sub>(156.1)</sub> |Ensure no legacy + entries exist in /etc/passwd (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.2) |Description: An attacker could gain access by using the username '+' with no password |Remove any entries in /etc/passwd that begin with '+:' |
|Ensure no legacy `+` entries exist in /etc/shadow<br /><sub>(156.2)</sub> |Ensure no legacy + entries exist in /etc/shadow (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.3) |Description: An attacker could gain access by using the username '+' with no password |Remove any entries in /etc/shadow that begin with '+:' |
|Ensure no legacy `+` entries exist in /etc/group<br /><sub>(156.3)</sub> |Ensure no legacy + entries exist in /etc/group (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.4) |Description: An attacker could gain access by using the username '+' with no password |Remove any entries in /etc/group that begin with '+:' |
|Ensure password expiration is 365 days or less.<br /><sub>(157.1)</sub> |Ensure password expiration is configured (CIS: L1 - Server - 5.4.1.1) |Description: Reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an attacker's window of opportunity to leverage compromised credentials or successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack. |Set `PASS_MAX_DAYS 365` in `/etc/login.defs` |
|Ensure password expiration warning days is 7 or more.<br /><sub>(157.2)</sub> |Ensure password expiration warning days is configured (CIS: L1 - Server - 5.4.1.3) |Description: Providing an advance warning that a password will be expiring gives users time to think of a secure password. Users caught unaware may choose a simple password or write it down where it may be discovered. |Set `PASS_WARN_AGE 7` in `/etc/login.defs` |
|Ensure password reuse is limited.<br /><sub>(157.5)</sub> |Ensure password reuse is limited (CIS: L1 - Server - 5.3.3) |Description: Forcing users not to reuse their past five passwords makes it less likely that an attacker will be able to guess the password. |Add `remember=5` to PAM password module in `/etc/pam.d/common-password` |
|Ensure password hashing algorithm is SHA-512<br /><sub>(157.11)</sub> |Ensure the password hashing algorithm is SHA-512 (CIS: L1 - Server - 5.3.4) |Description: The SHA-512 algorithm provides much stronger hashing than MD5, thus providing additional protection to the system by increasing the level of effort for an attacker to successfully determine passwords. Note: These changes only apply to accounts configured on the local system. |Set password hashing algorithm to sha512. Many distributions provide tools for updating PAM configuration, consult your documentation for details. If no tooling is provided edit the appropriate `/etc/pam.d/` configuration file and add or modify the `pam_unix.so` lines to include the sha512 option: ``` password sufficient pam_unix.so sha512 ``` |
|Ensure minimum days between password changes is 7 or more.<br /><sub>(157.12)</sub> |Ensure the minimum days between password changes is configured (CIS: L1 - Server - 5.4.1.2) |Description: By restricting the frequency of password changes, an administrator can prevent users from repeatedly changing their password in an attempt to circumvent password reuse controls. |Set `PASS_MIN_DAYS 7` in `/etc/login.defs` and run `chage --mindays 7 <username>` for existing users |
|Ensure all users last password change date is in the past<br /><sub>(157.14)</sub> |Ensure the inactive password lock period is configured (CIS: L1 - Server - 5.4.1.4) |Description: If a users recorded password change date is in the future, then they could bypass any set password expiration. |Ensure inactive password lock is 30 days or less Run the following command to set the default password inactivity period to 30 days: ``` # useradd -D -f 30 ``` Modify user parameters for all users with a password set to match: ``` # chage --inactive 30  ``` |
|Ensure system accounts are non-login<br /><sub>(157.15)</sub> |Ensure all system accounts are non-login (CIS: L1 - Server - 5.4.2) |Description: It's important to make sure that accounts that aren't being used by regular users are prevented from being used to provide an interactive shell. By default, Ubuntu sets the password field for these accounts to an invalid string, but it's also recommended that the shell field in the password file be set to `/usr/sbin/nologin`. This prevents the account from potentially being used to run any commands. |Set the shell for any accounts returned by the audit script to `/sbin/nologin` |
|Ensure default group for the root account is GID 0<br /><sub>(157.16)</sub> |Ensure default group for the root account is GID 0 (CIS: L1 - Server - 5.4.3) |Description: Using GID 0 for the `root` account helps prevent `root`-owned files from accidentally becoming accessible to non-privileged users. |Run the following command to set the `root` user default group to GID `0` : ``` # usermod -g 0 root ``` |
|Ensure root is the only UID 0 account<br /><sub>(157.18)</sub> |Ensure root is the only UID 0 account (CIS: L1 - Server - 6.2.5) |Description: This access must be limited to only the default `root` account and only from the system console. Administrative access must be through an unprivileged account using an approved mechanism. |Remove any users other than `root` with UID `0` or assign them a new UID if appropriate. |
|Remove unnecessary accounts<br /><sub>(159)</sub> |Ensure unnecessary accounts are removed |Description: For compliance |Remove the unnecessary accounts |
|Ensure auditd service is enabled<br /><sub>(162)</sub> |Ensure the auditd package is installed |Description: The capturing of system events provides system administrators with information to allow them to determine if unauthorized access to their system is occurring. |Install audit package (systemctl enable auditd) |
|Run AuditD service<br /><sub>(163)</sub> |Ensure the auditd service is running |Description: The capturing of system events provides system administrators with information to allow them to determine if unauthorized access to their system is occurring. |Run AuditD service (systemctl start auditd) |
|Ensure SNMP Server is not enabled<br /><sub>(179)</sub> |Ensure the SNMP Server is not enabled (CIS: L1 - Server - 2.2.14) |Description: The SNMP server can communicate using SNMP v1, which transmits data in the clear and does not require authentication to execute commands. Unless absolutely necessary, it's recommended that the SNMP service not be used. If SNMP is required the server should be configured to disallow SNMP v1. |Run one of the following commands to disable `snmpd`: ``` # chkconfig snmpd off ``` ``` # systemctl disable snmpd ``` ``` # update-rc.d snmpd disable ``` |
|Ensure rsync service is not enabled<br /><sub>(181)</sub> |Ensure the rsync service is not enabled (CIS: L1 - Server - 2.2.16) |Description: The `rsyncd` service presents a security risk as it uses unencrypted protocols for communication. |Disable the rsync service: `systemctl disable rsyncd` (systemd) or `chkconfig rsyncd off` (sysv) |
|Ensure NIS server is not enabled<br /><sub>(182)</sub> |Ensure the NIS server is not enabled (CIS: L1 - Server - 2.2.17) |Description: The NIS service is an inherently insecure system that has been vulnerable to DOS attacks, buffer overflows and has poor authentication for querying NIS maps. NIS is generally replaced by protocols like Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It's recommended that the service be disabled and more secure services be used |Run one of the following commands to disable `ypserv` : ``` # chkconfig ypserv off ``` ``` # systemctl disable ypserv ``` ``` # update-rc.d ypserv disable ``` |
|Ensure rsh client is not installed<br /><sub>(183)</sub> |Ensure the rsh client is not installed (CIS: L1 - Server - 2.3.2) |Description: These legacy clients contain numerous security exposures and have been replaced with the more secure SSH package. Even if the server is removed, it's best to ensure the clients are also removed to prevent users from inadvertently attempting to use these commands and therefore exposing their credentials. Note that removing the `rsh` package removes the clients for `rsh`, `rcp` and `rlogin`. |Uninstall rsh using the appropriate package manager: `yum remove rsh` (RHEL/CentOS), `apt remove rsh` (Debian/Ubuntu), or `zypper remove rsh` (SUSE) |
|Disable SMB V1 with Samba<br /><sub>(185)</sub> |Ensure SMB V1 with Samba is disabled (CIS: L1 - Server - 2.2.12) |Description: SMB v1 has well-known, serious vulnerabilities and does not encrypt data in transit. If it must be used for business reasons, it's strongly recommended that additional steps be taken to mitigate the risks inherent to this protocol. |Add `min protocol = SMB2` to `[global]` section in `/etc/samba/smb.conf` and restart smbd service |
