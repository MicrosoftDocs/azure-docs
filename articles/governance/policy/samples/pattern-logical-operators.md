# Azure Policy pattern: logical operators

A policy definition can contain several conditional statements. You might need each statement to be
true or only need some of them to be true. To support these needs, the language has
[logical operators](../concepts/definition-structure-policy-rule.md#logical-operators) for **not**, **allOf**,
and **anyOf**. They're optional and can be nested to create complex scenarios.

## Sample 1: One logical operator

This policy definition evaluates [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) accounts to
see whether automatic failovers and multiple write locations are configured. When they aren't, the
[audit](../concepts/effect-audit.md) triggers and creates a log entry when the non-compliant
resource is created or updated.

:::code language="json" source="~/policy-templates/patterns/pattern-logical-operators-1.json":::

### Sample 1: Explanation

:::code language="json" source="~/policy-templates/patterns/pattern-logical-operators-1.json" range="6-22" highlight="3":::

The **policyRule.if** block uses a single **allOf** to ensure that all three conditions are true.
Only when all of these conditions evaluate to true does the **audit** effect trigger.

## Sample 2: Multiple logical operators

This policy definition evaluates resources for a naming pattern. If a resource doesn't match, it's
[denied](../concepts/effect-deny.md).

:::code language="json" source="~/policy-templates/patterns/pattern-logical-operators-2.json":::

### Sample 2: Explanation

:::code language="json" source="~/policy-templates/patterns/pattern-logical-operators-2.json" range="7-21" highlight="2,3,9":::

This **policyRule.if** block also includes a single **allOf**, but each condition is wrapped with
the **not** logical operator. The conditional inside the **not** logical operator evaluates first
and then evaluates the **not** to determine whether the entire clause is true or false. If both
**not** logical operators evaluate to true, the policy effect triggers.

## Sample 3: Combining logical operators

This policy definition evaluates [Spring on Azure](/azure/developer/java/spring-framework) accounts
to see whether either trace isn't enabled or if trace isn't in a successful state.

:::code language="json" source="~/policy-templates/patterns/pattern-logical-operators-3.json":::

### Sample 3: Explanation

:::code language="json" source="~/policy-templates/patterns/pattern-logical-operators-3.json" range="6-28" highlight="3,8":::

This **policyRule.if** block includes both the **allOf** and **anyOf** logical operators. The
**anyOf** logical operator evaluates true as long as one included condition is true. As the _type_
is at the core of the **allOf**, it must always evaluate true. If the _type_ and one of the
conditions in the **anyOf** are true, the policy effect triggers.
