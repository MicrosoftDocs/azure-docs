# Azure Policy pattern: parameters

A policy definition can be made dynamic to reduce the number of policy definitions that are needed
by using [parameters](../concepts/definition-structure-parameters.md). The parameter is defined
during policy assignment. Parameters have a set of pre-defined properties that describe the
parameter and how it's used.

## Sample 1: String parameters

This policy definition uses two parameters, **tagName** and **tagValue**, to set what the policy
assignment is looking for on resources. This format allows the policy definition to be used for any
number of tag name and tag value combinations, but only maintain a single policy definition.

> [!NOTE]
> For a tag sample that uses **mode** _All_ and works with a resource group, see
> [Pattern: Tags - Sample #1](./pattern-tags.md#sample-1-parameterize-tags).

:::code language="json" source="~/policy-templates/patterns/pattern-parameters-1.json":::

### Sample 1: Explanation

:::code language="json" source="~/policy-templates/patterns/pattern-parameters-1.json" range="8-13":::

In this portion of the policy definition, the **tagName** parameter is defined as a _string_ and a
description is provided for its use.

The parameter is then used in the **policyRule.if** block to make the policy dynamic. Here, it's
used to define the field that is evaluated, which is a tag with the value of **tagName**.

:::code language="json" source="~/policy-templates/patterns/pattern-parameters-1.json" range="22-27" highlight="3":::

## Sample 2: Array parameters

This policy definition uses a single parameter, **listOfBandwidthinMbps**, to check if the Express
Route Circuit resource has configured the bandwidth setting to one of the approved values. If it
doesn't match, the creation or update to the resource is [denied](../concepts/effect-deny.md).

:::code language="json" source="~/policy-templates/patterns/pattern-parameters-2.json":::

### Sample 2: Explanation

:::code language="json" source="~/policy-templates/patterns/pattern-parameters-2.json" range="6-12":::

In this portion of the policy definition, the **listOfBandwidthinMbps** parameter is defined as an
_array_ and a description is provided for its use. As an _array_, it has multiple values to match.

The parameter is then used in the **policyRule.if** block. As an _array_ parameter, an _array_
[condition](../concepts/definition-structure-policy-rule.md#conditions)'s **in** or **notIn** must be used.
Here, it's used against the **serviceProvider.bandwidthInMbps** alias as one of the defined values.

:::code language="json" source="~/policy-templates/patterns/pattern-parameters-2.json" range="21-24" highlight="3":::

## Sample 3: Parameterized effect

A common way to make policy definitions reusable is to parameterize the effect itself. This example
uses a single parameter, **effect**. Parameterizing the effect makes it possible to assign the same
definition to different scopes with different effects.

:::code language="json" source="~/policy-templates/patterns/pattern-parameters-3.json":::

### Sample 3: Explanation

:::code language="json" source="~/policy-templates/patterns/pattern-parameters-3.json" range="11-25":::

In this portion of the policy definition, the **effect** parameter is defined as _string_. The
policy definition sets the default value for an assignment to _audit_ and limits the other options
to _disabled_ and _deny_.

The parameter is then used in the **policyRule.then** block for the _effect_.
