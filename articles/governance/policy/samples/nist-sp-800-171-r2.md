# Details of the NIST SP 800-171 R2 Regulatory Compliance built-in initiative

The following article details how the Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance built-in initiative
definition maps to **compliance domains** and **controls** to NIST SP 800-171 R2.
For more information about this compliance standard, see
[NIST SP 800-171 R2](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-171/rev-2/final). To understand
_Ownership_, see [Azure Policy policy definition](../concepts/definition-structure.md#type) and
[Shared responsibility in the cloud](../../../security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility.md).

The following mappings are to the **NIST SP 800-171 R2** controls. Use the
navigation on the right to jump directly to a specific **compliance domain**. Many of the controls
are implemented with an [Azure Policy](../overview.md) initiative definition. To review the complete
initiative definition, open **Policy** in the Azure portal and select the **Definitions** page.
Then, find and select the **NIST SP 800-171 R2** Regulatory Compliance built-in
initiative definition.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each control below is associated with one or more [Azure Policy](../overview.md) definitions.
> These policies may help you [assess compliance](../how-to/get-compliance-data.md) with the
> control; however, there often is not a 1:1 or complete match between a control and one or more
> policies. As such, **Compliant** in Azure Policy refers only to the policy definitions themselves;
> this doesn't ensure you're fully compliant with all requirements of a control. In addition, the
> compliance standard includes controls that aren't addressed by any Azure Policy definitions at
> this time. Therefore, compliance in Azure Policy is only a partial view of your overall compliance
> status. The associations between compliance domains, controls, and Azure Policy definitions for
> this compliance standard may change over time. To view the change history, see the
> [GitHub Commit History](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/commits/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Regulatory%20Compliance/NIST800-171_audit.json).
