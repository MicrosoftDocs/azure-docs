1. Once the data validation is complete, follow these steps to unplug the disks and remove the connecting cables:
    - For Windows systems, safely remove the disks prior to unplugging them.
    - For Linux systems, use the following command to safely remove the disks prior to unplugging them: 

        `sudo DataBoxDiskUnlock /Unmount`.

2. Wrap all the disks and the connecting cables with a bubble wrap and place them into the shipping box. Charges may apply if the accessories are missing.
    - Reuse the packaging from the initial shipment.  
    - We recommend that you pack disks using a well-secured bubbled wrap.
    - Make sure the fit is snug to reduce any movements within the box.

The next steps are determined by where you are returning the device. In many countries/regions, you can use Microsoft managed shipping or [self-managed shipping](#self-managed-shipping).
