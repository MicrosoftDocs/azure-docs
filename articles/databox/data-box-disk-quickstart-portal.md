## Order

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

This step takes approximately 5 minutes.

1. Create a new **Azure Data Box** resource in the Azure portal.
2. Select a subscription enabled for this service and choose transfer type as **Import**. Provide the **Source country** where the data resides and **Azure destination region** for the data transfer.
3. Select **Data Box Disk**. The maximum solution capacity is 35 TB and you can create multiple disk orders for larger data sizes.  
4. Enter the order details and shipping information. Select either **Hardware encryption** (new) or **Software encryption** from the **Disk encryption type** drop-down list. If the service is available in your region, provide notification email addresses, review the summary, and then create the order.

Once the order is created, the disks are prepared for shipment.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Use these Azure CLI commands to create a Data Box Disk job.

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-h3.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-h3.md)]

1. Run the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command to create a resource group or use an existing resource group:

   ```azurecli
   az group create --name databox-rg --location westus
   ```

1. Use the [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-create) command to create a storage account or use an existing storage account:

   ```azurecli
   az storage account create --resource-group databox-rg --name databoxtestsa
   ```

1. Run the [az databox job create](/cli/azure/databox/job#az-databox-job-create) command to create a Data Box job with the SKU DataBoxDisk:

   ```azurecli
   az databox job create --resource-group databox-rg --name databoxdisk-job \
       --location westus --sku DataBoxDisk --contact-name "Jim Gan" --phone=4085555555 \
       –-city Sunnyvale --email-list JimGan@contoso.com --street-address1 "1020 Enterprise Way" \
       --postal-code 94089 --country US --state-or-province CA \
       --storage-account databoxtestsa --expected-data-size 1
   ```

1. Run the [az databox job update](/cli/azure/databox/job#az-databox-job-update) to update a job, as in this example, where you change the contact name and email:

   ```azurecli
   az databox job update -g databox-rg --name databox-job --contact-name "Robert Anic" --email-list RobertAnic@contoso.com
   ```

   Run the [az databox job show](/cli/azure/databox/job#az-databox-job-show) command to get information about the job:

   ```azurecli
   az databox job show --resource-group databox-rg --name databox-job
   ```

   Use the [az databox job list]( /cli/azure/databox/job#az-databox-job-list) command to see all the Data Box jobs for a resource group:

   ```azurecli
   az databox job list --resource-group databox-rg
   ```

   Run the [az databox job cancel](/cli/azure/databox/job#az-databox-job-cancel) command to cancel a job:

   ```azurecli
   az databox job cancel –resource-group databox-rg --name databox-job --reason "Cancel job."
   ```

   Run the [az databox job delete](/cli/azure/databox/job#az-databox-job-delete) command to delete a job:

   ```azurecli
   az databox job delete –resource-group databox-rg --name databox-job
   ```

1. Use the [az databox job list-credentials]( /cli/azure/databox/job#az-databox-job-list-credentials) command to list credentials for a Data Box job:

   ```azurecli
   az databox job list-credentials --resource-group "databox-rg" --name "databoxdisk-job"
   ```

Once the order is created, the device is prepared for shipment.

## Unpack

Unpacking your disks should take approximately 5 minutes.

Data Box Disks are mailed in a UPS Express Box. Inspect the box for any evidence of tampering or obvious damage.

After opening, check that the box contains 1 to 5 bubble-wrapped disks. Because hardware encrypted disks can be connected directly to your host's SATA port, orders containing these disks might not contain connecting cables. Orders containing software encrypted disks have one connecting cable for each disk.

Finally, verify that the box contains a shipping label for returning your order.

## Connect and unlock

This step takes roughly 5 minutes.

1. Use the included cable to connect the disk to a Windows/Linux machine running a supported version. For more information on supported OS versions, go to [Azure Data Box Disk system requirements](data-box-disk-system-requirements.md). 
2. To unlock the disk:

    1. In the Azure portal, go to **General > Device Details** and get the passkey.
    2. Download and extract operating system-specific Data Box Disk unlock tool on the computer used to copy the data to disks. 
    3. Run the Data Box Disk Unlock tool and supply the passkey. For any disk reinserts, run the unlock tool again and provide the passkey. **Do not use the BitLocker dialog or the BitLocker key to unlock the disk when using Windows-based hosts.** For more information on how to unlock disks, go to [Unlock disks](data-box-disk-deploy-set-up.md#unlock-disks).
    4. The drive letter assigned to the disk is displayed by the tool. Make a note of the disk drive letter. This is used in the subsequent steps.

## Copy data and validate

The time to complete this operation depends upon your data size.

1. The drive contains *PageBlob*, *BlockBlob*, *AzureFile*, *ManagedDisk*, and *DataBoxDiskImport* folders. Within the *BlockBlob* root folder, you'll find a sub-folder corresponding to each of the available access tiers.

    Drag and drop data such as VHD/VHDX to *PageBlob* folder, and appropriate data to *AzureFile*. Copy any VHDs that you want to upload as managed disks to a folder under *ManagedDisk*.

    To copy your blob data, you must first select the sub-folder within the *BlockBlob* share which corresponds to one of the access tiers. Next, create a sub-folder within that tier's folder to store your data. Finally, copy your data to the newly created sub-folder. Your new sub-folder represents a container created within the storage account during ingestion. Your data is uploaded to this container as blobs.

    To copy files to the *AzureFile* share, first create a folder to contain your files, then copy your data to the newly created folder. A file share is created for a sub-folder under *AzureFile*. Any files copied directly to the *AzureFile* folder fail and are uploaded as block blobs with the storage account's default access tier.

    All files under *PageBlob* folders are copied into a default container `$root` under the Azure Storage account. Just as with the *AzureFile* share, a container is created in the Azure storage account for each sub-folder within the *PageBlob* folder.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > - All the containers, blobs, and files should conform to [Azure naming conventions](data-box-disk-limits.md#azure-block-blob-page-blob-and-file-naming-conventions). If these rules are not followed, the data upload to Azure will fail.
    > - Ensure that files do not exceed ~4.75 TiB for block blobs, ~8 TiB for page blobs, and ~4 TiB for Azure Files.

2. **(Optional but recommended)** After the copy is complete, we strongly recommend that at a minimum you run the `DataBoxDiskValidation.cmd` provided in the *DataBoxDiskImport* folder and select option 1 to validate the files. We also recommend that time permitting, you use option 2 to also generate checksums for validation (may take time depending upon the data size). These steps minimize the chances of any failures when uploading the data to Azure.
3. Safely remove the drive.

## Ship to Azure

This step takes about 5-7 minutes to complete.

1. Place all the disks together in the original package. Use the included shipping label. If the label is damaged or lost, download it from the portal. Go to **Overview** and click **Download shipping label** from the command bar.
2. Drop off the sealed package at the shipping location.  

Data Box Disk service sends an email notification and updates the order status on the Azure portal.

## Verify your data

The time to complete this operation depends upon your data size.

1. When the Data Box disk is connected to the Azure datacenter network, the data upload to Azure starts automatically.
2. Azure Data Box service notifies you that the data copy is complete via the Azure portal.
    
    1. Check error logs for any failures and take appropriate actions.
    2. Verify that your data is in the storage account(s) before you delete it from the source.

## Clean up resources

This step takes 2-3 minutes to complete.

To clean up, you can cancel the Data Box order and then delete it.

- You can cancel the Data Box order in the Azure portal before the order is processed. Once the order is processed, the order cannot be canceled. The order progresses until it reaches the completed stage.

    To cancel the order, go to **Overview** and click **Cancel** from the command bar.  

- You can delete the order once the status shows as **Completed** or **Canceled** in the Azure portal.

    To delete the order, go to **Overview** and click **Delete** from the command bar.
