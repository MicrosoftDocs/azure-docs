## Handling precautions

![Warning Icon](./media/data-box-safety/warning_icon.png) ![Electrical Shock Icon](./media/data-box-safety/electrical_shock_hazard_icon.png)![No User Serviceable Parts Icon](./media/data-box-safety/no_user_serviceable_parts_icon.png) **CAUTION** 

* Inspect the *as-received* device for damages. If the device enclosure is damaged, [contact Microsoft Support](data-box-disk-contact-microsoft-support.md) to obtain a replacement. Don't attempt to operate the device. 
* The device is equipped with tamper-proof screws. If you suspect the device is malfunctioning, [contact Microsoft Support](data-box-disk-contact-microsoft-support.md) to obtain a replacement. Don't attempt to service the device. 
* The device contains no user-serviceable parts. Hazardous voltage, current, and energy levels are present inside. Don't open. Return the device to Microsoft for servicing.

![Warning Icon](./media/data-box-safety/warning_icon.png) ![Heavy Weight Icon](./media/data-box-safety/heavy_weight_hazard_icon.png) **WARNING!** 

* A fully configured enclosure can weigh up to 22.7 kg (50 lbs); don't try to lift it by yourself.
* Before moving the enclosure, always ensure that two people are available to handle the weight. Be aware that one person attempting to lift this weight can sustain injuries.


![Warning Icon](./media/data-box-safety/warning_icon.png) ![Tip Hazard Icon](./media/data-box-safety/tip_hazard_icon.png) **WARNING!**
* Place the device on a flat, hard, and stable surface to avoid a potential tip hazard.
* Rack-mounted equipment isn't to be used as shelves or work spaces. Don't place the Data Box on top of rack-mounted equipment. Adding any type of load to an extended rack-mounted unit can create a potential tip hazard that could lead to injury, death, or product damage.

![Warning Icon](./media/data-box-safety/warning_icon.png) **WARNING!**

* Set up the device in a work area allowing for adequate air circulation around the device.
* Install the device in a temperature-controlled indoor area free of conductive contaminants and allow for adequate air circulation around the device.
* Keep the device away from sources of liquid and excessively humid environments.


## Electrical precautions

![Warning Icon](./media/data-box-safety/warning_icon.png) ![Electrical Shock Icon](./media/data-box-safety/electrical_shock_hazard_icon.png) **WARNING!**

* Provide a safe electrical earth connection to the power supply cord. The AC cord has a three-wire grounding plug (a plug that has a grounding pin). This plug fits only a grounded AC outlet. Don't defeat the purpose of the grounding pin.
* Given that the plug on the power supply cord is the main disconnect device, ensure that the socket outlets are located near the device and are easily accessible.
* Unplug the power cord (by pulling the plug, not the cord) and disconnect all cables if any of the following conditions exist:

    - The power cord or plug becomes frayed or otherwise damaged.
    - You spill something into the device casing.
    - The device is exposed to rain or excess moisture.
    - The device was dropped and the device casing is damaged.
    - You suspect the device needs service or repair.
* Permanently unplug the unit before you move it or if you think it is damaged in any way.
* Provide a suitable power source with electrical overload protection to meet the following power specifications:

    - Voltage: 100 V AC to 240 V AC
    - Current: 6 A, maximum
    - Frequency: 50 Hz to 60 Hz

![Warning Icon](./media/data-box-safety/warning_icon.png) **CAUTION:**

* This device contains coin cell batteries. Don't attempt to service the device. Batteries in this device aren't user serviceable. 
* **For service personnel only**: Risk of Explosion if battery is replaced by an incorrect type. Dispose of the used batteries according to instructions.

![Notice Icon](./media/data-box-safety/notice_icon.png) **NOTICE:**
