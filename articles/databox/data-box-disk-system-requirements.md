# Azure Data Box Disk system requirements

> [!CAUTION]
> This article references CentOS, a Linux distribution that is End Of Life (EOL) status. Please consider your use and planning accordingly. For more information, see the [CentOS End Of Life guidance](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/centos/centos-end-of-life).

This article describes the important system requirements for your Microsoft Azure Data Box Disk solution and for the clients connecting to the Data Box Disk. We recommend that you review the information carefully before you deploy your Data Box Disk, and then refer back to it as necessary during the deployment and subsequent operation.

The system requirements include the supported platforms for clients connecting to disks, supported storage accounts, and storage types.

## Review prerequisites

1. You must have ordered your Data Box Disk using the [Tutorial: Order your Azure Data Box Disk](data-box-disk-deploy-ordered.md). You have received your disks and one connecting cable per disk.
2. You have a client computer available from which you can copy the data. Your client computer must:

    - Run a supported operating system.
    - Have any additional required software installed.
