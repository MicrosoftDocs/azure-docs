## Handling precautions

![Warning Icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/warning-icon.png) **WARNING!**

* Proper equipment (for example, pallet jack) and Personal Protective Equipment (for example, gloves) must be used when moving and handling the crate.
* Ramp must be secured to the crate with provided bolts before you remove the device to avoid injuries or property damage.

![Warning Icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/warning-icon.png) ![Tip Hazard Icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/tip-hazard-icon.png) **Tip hazard**

* Place the equipment on a flat, hard and stable surface to avoid a potential tip or crushing hazard.
* Verify the casters are locked before you inspect, turn on, and operate the equipment.

![Warning icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/warning-icon.png) ![Electrical shock icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/electrical-shock-hazard-icon.png)![No user serviceable parts icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/no-user-serviceable-parts-icon.png) **CAUTION!** 

* Inspect the *as-received* device for damages. If the device enclosure is damaged, contact [Microsoft Support](data-box-disk-contact-microsoft-support.md) to obtain a replacement. Do not attempt to operate the device. 
* The device is equipped with tamper-proof screws. If you suspect the device is malfunctioning, [Microsoft Support](data-box-disk-contact-microsoft-support.md) to obtain a replacement. Do not attempt to service the device. 
* The device contains no user-serviceable parts. Hazardous voltage, current, and energy levels are present inside. Do not open. Return the device to Microsoft for servicing.

![Warning icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/warning-icon.png) ![Heavy weight icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/heavy-weight-hazard-icon.png) **WARNING!** 

* A fully configured enclosure can weigh up to 326 kg (719 lbs); do not try to lift it by yourself.
* Do not attempt to lift the equipment without proper mechanical aid. Be aware that any attempts to lift this weight can cause severe injuries.
* Conform to local occupational health and safety requirements when moving and lifting this equipment.
* Use mechanical assistance or other suitable assistance when moving and lifting equipment.


![Warning icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/warning-icon.png) ![Overload tip hazard icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/overload-tip-hazard-icon.png) ![Tip hazard icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/tip-hazard-icon.png)![Heavy weight icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/heavy-weight-hazard-icon.png) **WARNING!**
* Data Box Heavy is not to be used as a table or workspace. Adding any type of load can create a potential hazard which could lead to injury or property damage.
* Rack-mounted equipment is not to be used as shelves or work spaces. Do not place the Data Box Heavy on top of rack-mounted equipment. Adding any type of load to an extended rack-mounted unit can create a potential tip hazard that could lead to injury, death, or product damage.

![Warning icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/warning-icon.png) **WARNING!**

* The system is designed to operate in a typical office environment. Choose a site that is:

    - Well-ventilated and away from sources of heat including direct sunlight and radiators.
    - Away from sources of vibration or physical shock.
    - Isolated from strong electromagnetic fields produced by electrical devices.
    - Provided with properly grounded wall outlets.
    - Provided with sufficient space to access the power supply cord(s), because they serve as the product's main power disconnect.

* Set up the device in a work area allowing for adequate air circulation around the device.
* Install the device in a temperature-controlled indoor area free of conductive contaminants and allow for adequate air circulation around the device.
* Keep the device away from sources of liquid and excessively humid environments.


## Electrical precautions

![Warning icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/warning-icon.png) ![Electrical shock icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/electrical-shock-hazard-icon.png) **WARNING!**

* Provide a safe electrical earth connection to the power supply cord. The AC cord has a three-wire grounding plug (a plug that has a grounding pin). This plug fits only a grounded AC outlet. Do not defeat the purpose of the grounding pin.
* Given that the plug on the power supply cord is the main disconnect device, ensure that the socket outlets are located near the device and are easily accessible.
* Unplug the power cord (by pulling the plug, not the cord) and disconnect all cables if any of the following conditions exist:

    - The power cord or plug becomes frayed or otherwise damaged.
    - You spill something into the device casing.
    - The device is exposed to rain or excess moisture.
    - The device was dropped and the device casing is damaged.
    - You suspect the device needs service or repair.
* Permanently unplug the unit before you move it or if you think it has become damaged in any way.
* Provide a suitable power source with electrical overload protection to meet the following power specifications:

    - Voltage: 100 V AC to 240 V AC
    - Current: 6 A to 10 A, maximum per power cord. Four power cords are provided.
    - Frequency: 50 Hz to 60 Hz
* Do not attempt to modify or use AC power cord(s) other than the ones provided with the equipment. The power cord(s) must meet the following criteria:
    - The power cord must have an electrical rating that is greater than that of the electrical current rating marked on the product.
    - The power cord must have safety ground pin or contact that is suitable for the electrical outlet.

![Warning icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/warning-icon.png)  ![Electrical shock icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/electrical-shock-hazard-icon.png) ![Multiple power sources icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/multiple-power-sources-icon.png) **WARNING!**

* Unplug all AC power cord(s) to completely remove the AC power from the equipment.

![Warning icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/warning-icon.png) **CAUTION!**

* This device contains coin cell batteries. Do not attempt to service the device. Batteries in this device are not user serviceable. 
* **For service personnel only**: Risk of explosion if battery is replaced by an incorrect type. Dispose of the used batteries according to instructions.
* Laser peripherals or devices are present. To avoid risk or radiation exposure and/or personal injury, do not open the enclosure of any laser peripheral or device. Laser peripherals or devices are not serviceable. Only use certified and rated Laser Class I for optical transceiver product.

![Notice icon](./media/data-box-heavy-safety/notice-icon.png) **NOTICE:**

For the proper operation of your device and to prevent product damage:

* Ensure that the front and back doors are fully open while the device is running.
