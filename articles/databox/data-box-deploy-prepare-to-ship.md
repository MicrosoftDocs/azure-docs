After the data copy is complete, you prepare and ship the device. When the device reaches Azure datacenter, data is automatically uploaded to Azure.

## Prepare to ship

Before you prepare to ship, make sure that copy jobs are complete.

1. Go to **Prepare to ship** page in the local web UI and start the ship preparation.
2. Turn off the device from the local web UI. Remove the cables from the device.

The next steps are determined by where you're returning the device.
