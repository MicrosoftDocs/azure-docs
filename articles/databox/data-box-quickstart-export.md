# Quickstart: Get started with Azure Data Box to export data from Azure

This quickstart describes how to export data out of Azure into your location using the Azure portal. The steps include how to cable, configure, and copy data from Azure. The quickstart is performed in the Azure portal and on the local web UI of the device.

For detailed step-by-step deployment and tracking instructions, go to [Tutorial: Create export order for Azure Data Box](data-box-deploy-export-ordered.md)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

:::zone pivot="dbx-ng"
* Make sure that the subscription you use for Data Box service is one of the following types:
  * Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA). Read more about [EA subscriptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/).
  * Cloud Solution Provider (CSP). Learn more about [Azure CSP program](/azure/cloud-solution-provider/overview/azure-csp-overview).
  * Microsoft Azure Sponsorship. Learn more about [Azure sponsorship program](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0036p/).

* Ensure that you have owner or contributor access to the subscription to create a Data Box order.
* You have [registered the Microsoft.DataBox resource provider](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md#register-resource-provider) against this subscription in the Azure portal. 
* Review the [safety guidelines for your Data Box](data-box-safety.md).
* You have an Azure Data Box device to move data to your location. Your host computer must
  * Run a [Supported operating system](data-box-system-requirements.md).
  * Be connected to high-speed network. We recommend that you have at least one 100-GbE connection. If a 100-GbE connection isn't available,  10-GbE or 1-GbE data link can be used but the copy speeds are impacted.   
* You must have access to a flat surface where you can place the Data Box. If you want to place the device on a standard rack shelf, you need a 7U slot in your datacenter rack. You can place the device flat or upright in the rack.
* You've procured the following cables to connect your Data Box to the host computer. These are recommended, however, the next generation devices will work with 10G cables too.
  * 2 x 10G-BaseT RJ-45 cables (CAT-5e or CAT6)
  * 2 x 100-GbE QSFP28 passive direct attached cable (use with DATA 1, DATA 2 network interfaces)
  [!INCLUDE [data-box-cable-adapter](../../includes/data-box-cable-adapter.md)]

## Connect

This step takes about 5-7 minutes to complete.

:::zone pivot="dbx-ng"
1. To get the device password, go to **General** > **Device details** in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Assign a static IP address of 192.168.100.5 and subnet 255.255.255.0 to the Ethernet adapter on the computer you're using to connect to Data Box. Access the local web UI of the device at `https://192.168.100.10`. The connection could take up to 5 minutes after you turned on the device.
3. Sign in using the password from the Azure portal. You see an error indicating a problem with the website's security certificate. Follow the browser-specific instructions to proceed to the web page.
4. By default, the network settings for the 100-Gbps data interface (or 1 Gbps) are configured as DHCP. If needed, you can configure this interface as static and provide an IP address.

:::zone-end



## Copy data

The time to complete this operation depends upon your data size and network speed.

1. If using a Windows client, use an SMB compatible file copy tool such as Robocopy. For NFS host, use `cp` command or `rsync` to copy the data. For more information on how to use Robocopy to copy data, go to [Robocopy](/previous-versions/technet-magazine/ee851678(v=msdn.10)).
2. Connect to the device shares and begin copying data to the host computer.
<!-- 1. Connect to the device shares using the path:`\\<IP address of your device>\ShareName`. To get the share access credentials, go to the **Connect & copy** page in the local web UI of the Data Box. --> 

## Ship to Azure

This operation takes about 10-15 minutes to complete.

:::zone pivot="dbx-ng"
1. Go to **Prepare to ship** page in the local web UI and start the ship preparation.
2. Download and print the return shipping label when preparation is complete.
3. Turn off the device from the local web UI. Remove the cables from the device.
4. Spool and securely place the power cord that was provided with device in the back of the device.
5. Pack the device in the original box and secure firmly. Paste the return shipping label on the box and remove any previous labels and barcode stickers from the external packaging.
6. Follow local return shipping instructions and ship the device back to Microsoft. 
7. Once the Data Box is picked up and scanned by your carrier, the order status in the portal updates to **Picked up**. A tracking ID is also displayed.

4. The return shipping label should be visible on the E-ink display. If the E-ink display isn't displaying the label, go to **Overview** > **Download shipping label** in the Azure portal. Download the shipping label and affix on the device.
5. Schedule a pickup with your regional carrier if returning the device.
6. Once the Data Box is picked up and scanned by your carrier, the order status in the portal updates to **Picked up**. A tracking ID is also displayed.
:::zone-end

## Clean up resources

This step takes 2-3 minutes to complete.

* You can cancel the Data Box order in the Azure portal before the order is processed. Once the order is processed, the order can't be canceled. The order progresses until it reaches the completed stage. To cancel the order, go to **Overview** and select **Cancel** from the command bar.

* You can delete the order once the status shows as **Completed** or **Canceled** in the Azure portal. To delete the order, go to **Overview** and select **Delete** from the command bar.
