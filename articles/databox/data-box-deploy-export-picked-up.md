```
Subject: Request Azure Data Box Disk drop-off for order: <ordername>

- Order name
- Contact name of the person who will drop off the Data Box Disk (A government-issued photo ID will be required to validate the contactâ€™s identity upon arrival.) 
- Inbound Nota Fiscal (A copy of the inbound Nota Fiscal will be required at drop-off.)

## Erasure of data from Data Box

Once the device reaches Azure datacenter, the Data Box erases the data on its disks as per the [NIST SP 800-88 Revision 1 guidelines](https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2014/Released-SP-800-88-Revision-1,-Guidelines-for-Medi).
