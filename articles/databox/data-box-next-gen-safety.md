To remove all input power, the equipment power cable must be disconnected from the AC electrical mains supply. Donât remove cover or barrier on any component that contains this label: :::image type="icon" source="media/data-box-next-gen-safety/icon-safety-electric-shock-tiny.png"::: Servicing should only be performed by qualified trained technicians.

:::image type="icon" source="media/data-box-next-gen-safety/icon-hazard-lrg.png" border="false"::::::image type="icon" source="media/data-box-next-gen-safety/icon-safety-electric-shock.png" border="false":::**WARNING:**
* Donât install equipment into a rack or on a wall while theyâre energized with external cables.
* Ensure power cords arenât crushed or damaged during installation.
* Provide a safe electrical earth connection to the power supply cord. The AC cord has a three-wire grounding plug (a plug that has a grounding contact). This plug fits only a grounded AC outlet. Donât defeat the purpose of the grounding contact.
* Given that the plug on the power supply cord is the main disconnect device, ensure that the socket outlets are located near the equipment and are easily accessible.
* Unplug the power cord (by pulling the plug, not the cord) and disconnect all cables if any of the following conditions exist: 
    * The power cord or plug becomes frayed or otherwise damaged 
    * You spill something into the device casing
    * The device is exposed to rain, excess moisture, or other liquids. The device has been dropped and the device casing is damaged
    * You suspect the device needs service or repair
* Permanently unplug the unit before you move it or if you think it has become damaged in any way.
* Provide a suitable power source with electrical overload protection to meet the power specifications shown on the equipment rating label provided with the equipment.
* Donât attempt to modify or use AC power cord(s) other than the ones provided with the equipment.

* Conform to local occupational health and safety requirements when moving and lifting this equipment. Use mechanical assistance or other suitable assistance when moving and lifting equipment.

## Electrostatic precautions

:::image type="icon" source="media/data-box-next-gen-safety/icon-notice-sml.png" border="false":::**NOTICE:**
* Electrostatic discharge (ESD) and ESD protection: ESD can damage drives, boards, and other parts. We recommend that you perform all procedures in this chapter only at an ESD work- station. If one isnât available, provide some ESD protection by wearing an antistatic wrist strap attached to chassis ground any unpainted metal surface on the equipment when handling parts.
* ESD and handling boards: Always handle boards carefully. They can be extremely sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD). Hold boards only by their edges. After removing a board from its protective wrapper or from the equipment, place the board component side up on a grounded, static-free surface. Use a conductive foam pad if available but not the board wrapper. Donât slide board over any surface.
* Wear a grounded wrist strap. If none is available, discharge any personal static electricity by touching the bare metal chassis of the server, or the bare metal body of any other grounded device.
* Humid environments tend to have less static electricity than dry environments. A grounding strap is warranted whenever danger of static electricity exists.

:::image type="icon" source="media/data-box-next-gen-safety/icon-notice-sml.png" border="false":::**NOTICE:**
* Leave all replacement components inside their static-proof packaging until youâre ready to use them.
