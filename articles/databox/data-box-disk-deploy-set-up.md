## Unpack, connect, and unlock Azure Data Box Disk

::: zone-end

::: zone target="docs"

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that:

1. You have completed the [Tutorial: Order Azure Data Box Disk](data-box-disk-deploy-ordered.md).
2. You have received your disks and the job status in the portal is updated to **Delivered**.
3. You have a client computer on which you can install the Data Box Disk unlock tool. Your client computer must:
    - Run a [Supported operating system](data-box-disk-system-requirements.md#supported-operating-systems-for-clients).
    - Have other [required software](data-box-disk-system-requirements.md#other-required-software-for-windows-clients) installed if it is a Windows client.

## Unpack disks

 Perform the following steps to unpack your disks.

1. The Data Box Disks are mailed in a small shipping Box. Open the box and remove its contents. Check that the box has 1 to 5 solid-state disks (SSDs) and a USB connecting cable per disk. Inspect the box for any evidence of tampering, or any other obvious damage.

    ![Data Box Disk shipping package](media/data-box-disk-deploy-set-up/data-box-disk-ship-package1.png)

2. If the shipping box is tampered or severely damaged, do not open the box. Contact Microsoft Support to help you assess whether the disks are in good working order and if they need to ship you a replacement.
3. Verify that the box has a clear sleeve containing a shipping label (under the current label) for return shipment. If this label is lost or damaged, you can always download and print a new one from the Azure portal.

    ![Data Box Disk shipping label](media/data-box-disk-deploy-set-up/data-box-disk-package-ship-label.png)

4. Save the box and packaging foam for return shipment of the disks.

## Connect disks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Data Box disk with hardware encryption is only supported and tested for Linux-based operating systems. To access disks using a Windows OS-based device, download the [Data Box Disk toolset](https://aka.ms/databoxdisktoolswin) and run the **Data Box Disk SED Unlock tool**.

### [Software encryption](#tab/bitlocker)

If you run into any issues while unlocking the disks, see how to [troubleshoot unlock issues](data-box-disk-troubleshoot-unlock.md).

### [Linux - hardware encryption](#tab/linux-hardware)

Perform the following steps to connect and unlock hardware encrypted Data Box disks on a Linux-based machine.

1.	The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) must be enabled on Linux systems for SATA-based drives. To enable TPM, set `libata.allow_tpm` to `1` by editing the GRUB config as shown in the following distro-specific examples. More details can be found on the Drive-Trust-Alliance public Wiki located at [https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki](https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki).

    > [!WARNING]
    > Enabling the TPM on a device might require a reboot.
    >
    > The following example contains the `reboot` command. Ensure that no data will be lost before running the script.

    ### [CentOS](#tab/centos)

    Use the following commands to enable the TPM for CentOS.

    `sudo nano /etc/default/grub`

    Next. manually add "libata.allow_tpm=1" to the grub command line argument.

    `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash libata.allow_tpm=1"` 

    For BIOS-based systems: 
    `grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg`

    For UEFI-based systems: 
    `grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/centos/grub.cfg`

    `reboot`

    Finally, validate that the TPM setting is set properly by checking the boot image.
    `cat /proc/cmdline`

    ### [Ubuntu/Debian](#tab/debian)

    Use the following commands to enable the TPM for Ubuntu/Debian.

    `sudo nano /etc/default/grub`

    Next, manually add "libata.allow_tpm=1" to the grub command line argument.

    `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash libata.allow_tpm=1"`

    Update GRUB and reboot.

    `sudo update-grub`
    `reboot`

    Finally, validate that the TPM setting is properly configured by checking the boot image.

    `cat /proc/cmdline`

    ```

1.  Download the [Data Box Disk toolset](https://aka.ms/databoxdisktoolslinux). Extract and copy the **Data Box Disk Unlock Utility** to a local path on your machine. 
1.	Download the [SEDUtil](https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki/Executable-Distributions). For more information, visit the [Drive-Trust-Alliance public Wiki](https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > SEDUtil is an external utility for Self-Encrypting Drives. This is not managed by Microsoft. More information, including license information for this utility, can be found at [https://sedutil.com/](https://sedutil.com/).

1.	Extract `SEDUtil` to a local path on the machine and create a symbolic link to the utility path using the following example. Alternatively, you can add the utility path to the `PATH` environment variable.

    ```bash
    chmod +x /path/to/sedutil-cli

    #add a symbolic link to the extracted sedutil tool
    sudo ln -s /path/to/sedutil-cli /usr/bin/sedutil-cli
    ```

1. The `sedutil-cli –scan` command lists all the drives connected to the server. The command is distro agnostic.

    ```bash
    sudo sedutil-cli --scan
    ```

    The following example output confirms that the validation completed successfully.
   
    :::image type="content" source="media/data-box-disk-deploy-set-up/scan-results.png" alt-text="Screen capture showing the successful results when scanning a system for Data Box Disks." lightbox="media/data-box-disk-deploy-set-up/scan-results-lrg.png":::

1.  Azure disks can be identified using the following command. Disk serial numbers can be verified for a volume using the following command.

     ```bash
     sedutil-cli --query <volume> 
     ```

    :::image type="content" source="media/data-box-disk-deploy-set-up/disk-serial.png" alt-text="Screen capture of example output of the sedutil tool showing identified volumes." lightbox="media/data-box-disk-deploy-set-up/disk-serial-lrg.png":::
   
1.	Run the **Data Box Disk Unlock Utility** from the Linux toolset extracted in a previous step. Supply the passkey from the Azure portal you obtained from the **Connect to disks** section. Optionally, you can specify a list of BitLocker encrypted volumes to unlock. The passkey and volume list should be specified within single quotes as shown in the following example.

    ```bash
    chmod +x DataBoxDiskUnlock

    #add a symbolic link to the downloaded DataBoxDiskUnlock tool
    sudo ln -s /path/to/DataBoxDiskUnlock /usr/bin/DataBoxDiskUnlock

    sudo ./DataBoxDiskUnlock /Passkey:<'passkey'> /SerialNumbers:<'serialNumber1,serialNumber2'> /SED
    ```
   
    The following example output indicates that the volume was successfully unlocked. The mount point is also displayed for the volume in which your data can be copied.

    :::image type="content" source="media/data-box-disk-deploy-set-up/disk-unlocked.png" alt-text="Screen capture showing a successfully unlocked data box disk.":::

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Repeat the steps to unlock the disk for any future disk reinserts.

    You can use the help switch if you need additional assistance with the Data Box Disk Unlock Utility as shown in the following example.

    ```bash
    sudo ./DataBoxDiskUnlock /Help

1. After the disk is unlocked, you can go to the mount point and view the contents of the disk. You are now ready to copy the data to folders based on the desired destination data type.
1. After you've finished copying your data to the disk, make sure to unmount and remove the disk safely using the following command.

    ```bash
    sudo ./DataBoxDiskUnlock /SerialNumbers:<'serialNumber1,serialNumber2'> 
          /Unmount  /SED
    ```

    The following example output confirms that the volume unmounted successfully.

    :::image type="content" source="media/data-box-disk-deploy-set-up/disk-unmount.png" alt-text="Screen capture displaying sample output showing the Data Box Disk successfully unmounted." lightbox="media/data-box-disk-deploy-set-up/disk-unmount-lrg.png":::

1. You can validate the data on your disk by connecting to a Windows-based machine with a supported operating system. Be sure to review the [OS requirements](data-box-disk-system-requirements.md#supported-operating-systems-for-clients) for Windows-based operating systems before connecting disks to your local machine.

    Perform the following steps to unlock self-encrypting disks using Windows-based machines.

    - Download the [Data Box Disk toolset](https://aka.ms/databoxdisktoolswin) for Windows clients and extract it to the same computer. Although the toolset contains four tools, only the **Data Box SED Unlock tool** is used for hardware-encrypted disks.
    - Connect your Data Box Disk to an available SATA 3 connection on your Windows-based machine.
    - Using a command prompt or PowerShell, run the following command to unlock self-encrypting disks.
    
        ```powershell
        DataBoxDiskUnlock /Passkey:<> /SerialNumbers:<listOfSerialNumbers>
        ```
        
        The following example output confirms that the disk was successfully unlocked.
