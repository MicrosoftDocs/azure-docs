# Customer intent: As a data engineer, I want to understand the transition from Azure Data Box Heavy to the next-gen data box options, so that I can effectively plan for my offline data transfer needs before the retirement date.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Data Box Heavy has been retired and is no longer available to order. As we expand the availability of next-generation devices across more regions, the Azure Data Box 80 TB device will be retired in those areas. Post-retirement, new orders for the 80 TB device will no longer be accepted, though existing orders will remain supported.
