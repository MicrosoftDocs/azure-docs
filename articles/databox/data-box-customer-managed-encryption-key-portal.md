# Use customer-managed keys in Azure Key Vault for Azure Data Box

Azure Data Box protects the device unlock key (also known as the device password), which is used to lock a device, via an encryption key. By default, this encryption key is a Microsoft managed key. For more control, you can use a customer-managed key. 

Using a customer-managed key doesn't affect how data on the device is encrypted. It only affects how the device unlock key is encrypted.

To keep this level of control throughout the order process, use a customer-managed key when you create your order. For more information, see [Tutorial: Order Azure Data Box](data-box-deploy-ordered.md).

This article shows how to enable a customer-managed key for your existing Data Box order in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). You'll find out how to change the key vault, key, version, or identity for your current customer-managed key, or switch back to using a Microsoft managed key.

This article applies to Azure Data Box and Azure Data Box Heavy devices.

## Requirements

The customer-managed key for a Data Box order must meet the following requirements:

- The key must be created and stored in an Azure Key Vault that has **Soft delete** and **Do not purge** enabled. For more information, see [What is Azure Key Vault?](/azure/key-vault/general/overview). You can create a key vault and key while creating or updating your order.
- The key must be an RSA key of 2048 size or larger.
- You must enable the `Get`, `UnwrapKey`, and `WrapKey` permissions for the key in Azure Key Vault. The permissions must remain in place for the lifetime of the order. Otherwise, the customer-managed key can't be accessed at the start of the Data Copy phase.

## Enable key

To enable a customer-managed key for your existing Data Box order in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Overview** screen for your Data Box order.

    ![Overview screen of a Data Box order - 1](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-1.png)

2. Go to **Settings > Encryption**, and select **Customer managed key**. Then select **Select a key and key vault**.

    ![Select the customer-managed key encryption option](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-3.png)

   On the **Select key from Azure Key Vault** screen, your subscription is automatically populated.

 3. For **Key vault**, you can select an existing key vault from the dropdown list or select **Create new** and create a new key vault.

     ![Key vault options when selecting a customer-managed key](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-3-a.png)

     To create a new key vault, enter the subscription, resource group, key vault name, and other info on the **Create new key vault** screen. In **Recovery options**, ensure that **Soft delete** and **Purge protection** are enabled. Then select **Review + Create**.

      ![Review and create Azure Key Vault](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-4.png)

7. Select the type of identity to use to manage the customer-managed key for this resource. You can use the **system assigned** identity that was generated during order creation or choose a user-assigned identity.

    A user-assigned identity is an independent resource that you can use to manage access to resources. For more information, see [Managed identity types](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).

    ![Select the identity type](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-13.png)

    To assign a user identity, select **User assigned**. Then select **Select a user identity**, and select the managed identity that you want to use.

    ![Select an identity to use](./media/data-box-customer-managed-encryption-key-portal/customer-managed-key-14.png)

    You can't create a new user identity here. To find out how to create one, see [Create, list, delete, or assign a role to a user-assigned managed identity using the Azure portal](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal.md).

    The selected user identity is shown in the **Encryption type** settings.
