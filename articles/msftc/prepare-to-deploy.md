This template provides the basic structure of an install, set up, or deploy pattern.
See the [Install, set up, deploy pattern](article-install-setup-deploy.md) in the pattern
library.
Install, set up, deploy articles are how-to articles for customer tasks.

-->

<!-- 1. H1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Start with an action verb, such as "install," "set up," or "deploy".
Write an H1 that clearly conveys the task the user will complete.

-->

# Prepare to deploy @@SERVICE@@

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required: Lead with a light intro that describes, in customer-friendly language, what
the customer will do. 
Answer the fundamental question, "Why would I want to do this?" Keep it short.
Readers should have a clear idea of what they will do in this article after reading
the introduction.

Include a sentence that says, "In this article, you X..."
-->
[Your introductory paragraph]

TODO: Add your introductory paragraph.

<!-- If you're writing a deployment guide, consider providing guidance for the process
of rolling out the service, solution, or product.
For example, include information or links to information about how to:

- Onboard users to a pilot.
- Monitor the pilot and gather feedback.
- Roll out the service, solution, or product to more users.

Avoid notes, tips, and important boxes. Readers tend to skip over them.
It is better to put that info directly into the article text.--->

<!-- 3. Prerequisites -------------------------------------------------------------------

Optional: If there are prerequisites for the task, make **Prerequisites** your first H2
in the guide.
The prerequisites H2 is never numbered.

(for example: Visual Studio 2019 or later).
