# Choose the Automation services in Azure

This article explains various Automation services offered in the Azure environment. These services can automate business and operational processes and solve integration problems among multiple services, systems, and processes. Automation services can define input, action, activity to be performed, conditions, error handling, and output generation. Using these services, you can run various activities on a schedule or do a manual demand-based execution. Each service has its unique advantages and target audience.
Using these services, you can shift effort from manually performing operational tasks towards building automation for these tasks, including:

- Reduce time to perform an action
- Reduce risk in performing the action
- Increase human capacity for further innovation
- Standardize operations

## Categories in Automation operations
Automation is required in three broad categories of operations:

- **Deployment and management of resources**: Create and configure programmatically using automation or infrastructure as code tooling to deliver repeatable and consistent deployment and management of cloud resources. For example, an Azure Network Security Group can be deployed, and security group rules are created using an Azure Resource Manager template or an automation script.

- **Response to external events**: Based on a critical external event, such as responding to database changes, acting as per the  inputs given to a web page, and so on, you can diagnose and resolve issues.

- **Complex Orchestration**: By integrating with first- or third-party products, you can define end-to-end automation workflows.

## Azure services for Automation

Multiple Azure services can fulfill the above requirements. Each service has its benefits and limitations, and customers can use multiple services to meet their automation requirements.

**Deployment and management of resources**
  - Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates with Bicep
  - Azure Blueprints
  - Azure Automation
  - Azure Automanage (for machine configuration and management)

**Responding to external events**
  - Azure Functions
  - Azure Automation
  - Azure Policy Guest Config (to take an action when there's a change in the compliance state of resource)

**Complex orchestration and integration with first- or third-party products**
  - Azure Logic Apps
  - Azure Functions or Azure Automation (Azure Logic app has over 400+ connectors to other services, including Azure Automation and Azure Functions, which could be used to meet complex automation scenarios)

## Deploy and manage Automation services

### Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template

Azure Resource Manager provides a language to develop repeatable and consistent deployment templates for Azure resources. The template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. It uses declarative syntax, which lets you state what you intend to deploy without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. In the template, you specify the resources to deploy and the properties for those resources. [Learn more](../azure-resource-manager/templates/overview.md).

### Bicep

We introduced a new language named [Bicep](../azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview.md) that offers the same capabilities as ARM templates but with a syntax that's easier to use. Each Bicep file is automatically converted to an ARM template during deployment. If you're considering infrastructure as code options, we recommend Bicep. For more information, see [What is Bicep?](../azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview.md)

The following table describes the scenarios and users for ARM template and Bicep:

### Azure Blueprints (Preview)

>[!Note]
> On July 11, 2026, Azure Blueprints (Preview) will be deprecated. [Learn more](../governance/blueprints/overview.md) 

 Azure Blueprints (Preview) define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements. Blueprints are a declarative way to orchestrate the deployment of various resource templates and other artifacts such as Role assignments, Policy assignments, ARM templates, and Resource groups. [Learn more](../governance/blueprints/index.yml).

### [Azure Automation](./overview.md)

Azure Automation orchestrates repetitive processes using graphical, PowerShell, and Python runbooks in the cloud or hybrid environments. It provides persistent shared assets, including variables, connections, and objects, that allow orchestration of complex jobs. [Learn more](./automation-runbook-gallery.md).

There are more than 3,000 modules in the PowerShell Gallery, and the PowerShell community continues to grow. Azure Automation based on PowerShell modules can work with multiple applications and vendors, both first- and third-party. As more application vendors release PowerShell modules for integration, extensibility, and automation tasks, you could use an existing PowerShell script as-is to execute it as a PowerShell runbook in an automation account without making any changes.

### Azure functions

Provides a serverless, event-driven compute platform for automation that allows you to write code to react to critical events from various sources, third-party services, and on-premises systems. For example, an HTTP trigger without worrying about the underlying platform. [Learn more](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md).

  - You can use a variety of languages to write functions in a language of your choice, such as C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, or Python, and focus on specific pieces of code. Functions runtime is an open source.
  - You can choose the hosting plan according to your function app scaling requirements, functionality, and resources required.
  - You can orchestrate complex workflows through [durable functions](../azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview.md?tabs=csharp).

### Azure functions

Provides a serverless, event-driven compute platform for automation that allows you to write code to react to critical events from various sources, third-party services, and on-premises systems. For example, an HTTP trigger without worrying about the underlying platform [Learn more](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md).

  - You can use a variety of languages to write functions in a language of your choice, such as C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, or Python, and focus on specific pieces of code. Functions runtime is an open source.
  - You can choose the hosting plan according to your function app scaling requirements, functionality, and resources required.
  - You can orchestrate complex workflows through [durable functions](../azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview.md?tabs=csharp).
  - You should avoid large and long-running functions that can cause unexpected timeout issues. [Learn more](../azure-functions/functions-best-practices.md?tabs=csharp#write-robust-functions).
  - When you write PowerShell scripts within Function Apps, you must tweak the scripts to define how the function behaves, such as how it's triggered and its input and output parameters. [Learn more](../azure-functions/functions-reference-powershell.md?tabs=portal).
