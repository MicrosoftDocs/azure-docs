# Tutorial: Create a PowerShell Workflow runbook in Automation

This tutorial walks you through the creation of a [PowerShell Workflow runbook](../automation-runbook-types.md#powershell-workflow-runbooks) in Azure Automation. PowerShell Workflow runbooks are text runbooks based on Windows PowerShell Workflow. You can create and edit the code of the runbook using the text editor in the Azure portal.

>[!NOTE]
> This article is applicable only for PowerShell 5.1. PowerShell 7+ versions do not support Workflows, and outdated runbooks cannot be updated. We recommend you to use PowerShell 7.2 textual runbooks for advanced features such as parallel job execution. [Learn more](../automation-runbook-types.md#limitations) about limitations of PowerShell Workflow runbooks.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a PowerShell Workflow runbook
> * Test and publish the runbook
> * Run and track the status of the runbook job
> * Add authentication to manage Azure resources
> * Update the runbook parameters to start an Azure virtual machine

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure Automation account with at least one user-assigned managed identity. For more information, see [Enable managed identity](../quickstarts/enable-managed-identity.md).
* Az modules: `Az.Accounts` and `Az.Compute` imported into the Automation account. For more information, see [Import Az modules](../shared-resources/modules.md#import-az-modules).
* Two or more [Azure virtual machines](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-powershell). Since you stop and start these machines, they shouldn't be production VMs.
* The [Azure Az PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az) installed on your machine. To install or upgrade, see [How to install the Azure Az PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).

## Assign permissions to managed identities

Assign permissions to the appropriate [managed identity](../automation-security-overview.md#managed-identities) to allow it to stop a virtual machine. The runbook can use either the Automation account system-assigned managed identity or a user-assigned managed identity. Steps are provided to assign permissions to each identity. The steps below use the Azure portal. If you prefer using PowerShell, see [Assign Azure roles using Azure PowerShell](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-powershell.md).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to your Automation account.

1. Under **Account Settings**, select **Identity (Preview)**.

1. From the **System assigned** tab, under **Permissions**, select **Azure role assignments** to open the **Azure role assignments** page.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/automation-tutorial-runbook-textual/system-assigned-role-assignments-portal.png" alt-text="Selecting Azure role assignments in portal.":::

1. Select **+ Add role assignment (Preview)** to open the **Add role assignment (Preview)** page.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/automation-tutorial-runbook-textual/system-assigned-add-role-assignment-portal.png" alt-text="Add role assignments in portal.":::

1. Select the appropriate values.

   |Property |Description |
   |---|---|
   |Scope| Scope is a set of resources that the role assignment applies to. From the drop-down list, select **Resource Group**.|
   |Subscription|This field should be auto-populated with your subscription.|
   |Resource Group|From the drop-down list, select the resource group to give the identity permissions over.|
   |Role|From the drop-down list, select **DevTest Labs User**.|

1. Select **Save**, and then close the **Azure role assignments** page to return to the **System assigned** tab.

1. Select the **User assigned** tab.

1. Select your user-assigned managed identity from the list to open the **Managed Identity** page.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/automation-tutorial-runbook-textual/select-user-assigned-identity-portal.png" alt-text="Selecting user-assigned managed identity in portal.":::

1. Take note of the **Client ID** for later use.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/automation-tutorial-runbook-textual/managed-identity-client-id-portal.png" alt-text="Showing Client ID for managed identity in portal":::

1. From the left menu, select **Azure role assignments** and then **+ Add role assignment (Preview)** to open the **Add role assignment (Preview)** page.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/automation-tutorial-runbook-textual/user-assigned-add-role-assignment-portal.png" alt-text="Add role assignments in portal for user-assigned identity.":::

1. Select the appropriate values.

   |Property |Description |
   |---|---|
   |Scope| From the drop-down list, select **Resource Group**.|
   |Subscription|This field should be auto-populated with your subscription.|
   |Resource Group|From the drop-down list, select the resource group to give the identity permissions over.|
   |Role|From the drop-down list, select **DevTest Labs User**.|

1. Select **Save**, and then close the **Azure role assignments** page to return to the **User assigned** tab.

## Create new runbook

Start by creating a simple [PowerShell Workflow runbook](../automation-runbook-types.md#powershell-workflow-runbooks). One advantage of Windows PowerShell Workflows is the ability to perform a set of commands in parallel instead of sequentially as with a typical script.

>[!NOTE]
> With release runbook creation has a new experience in the Azure portal. When you select **Runbooks** blade > **Create a runbook**, a new page **Create a runbook** opens with applicable options.

1. From your open Automation account page, under **Process Automation**, select **Runbooks**

   :::image type="content" source="../media/automation-tutorial-runbook-textual/create-powershell-workflow-runbook.png" alt-text="Create PowerShell workflow runbook from portal":::

1. Select **+ Create a runbook**.
    1. Name the runbook. For example, test.
    1. From the **Runbook type** drop-down menu, select **PowerShell Workflow**.
    1. From the  **Runtime version** drop-down, select **5.1**.
    1. Enter applicable **Description**.
    1. Select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/automation-tutorial-runbook-textual/create-powershell-workflow-runbook-options.png" alt-text="PowerShell workflow runbook options from portal":::


## Add code to the runbook

You can either type code directly into the runbook, or you can select cmdlets, runbooks, and assets from the Library control and add them to the runbook with any related parameters. For this tutorial, you type code directly into the runbook.

Your runbook is currently empty with only the required `workflow` keyword, the name of the runbook, and the braces that encase the entire workflow.

```powershell
workflow MyFirstRunbook-Workflow
{
}
```

1. You can use the `Parallel` keyword to create a script block with multiple commands that will run concurrently. Enter the following code *between* the braces:

   ```powershell
	parallel
	{
		Write-Output "Parallel"
		Get-Date
		Start-Sleep -Seconds 3
		Get-Date
	}
	
	Write-Output " `r`n"
	Write-Output "Non-Parallel"
	Get-Date
	Start-Sleep -Seconds 3
	Get-Date
   ```

1. Save the runbook by selecting **Save**.

## Test the runbook

Before you publish the runbook to make it available in production, you should test it to make sure that it works properly. Testing a runbook runs its Draft version and allows you to view its output interactively.

1. Select **Test pane** to open the **Test** page.

1. Select **Start** to start the test.  A [runbook job](../automation-runbook-execution.md) is created and its status is displayed in the pane.

   The job status starts as Queued, indicating that the job is waiting for a runbook worker in the cloud to become available. The status changes to Starting when a worker claims the job. Finally, the status becomes Running when the runbook actually starts to run.

1. When the runbook job completes, the **Test** page displays its output. The output should look similar to the following image:

   :::image type="content" source="../media/automation-tutorial-runbook-textual/workflow-runbook-parallel-output.png" alt-text="PowerShell workflow runbook parallel output":::

   Review the output. Everything in the `Parallel` block, including the `Start-Sleep` command, executed at the same time. The same commands outside the `Parallel` block ran sequentially, as shown by the different date time stamps.

1. Close the **Test** page to return to the canvas.

## Publish and start the runbook

The runbook that you've created is still in Draft mode. You must publish it before you can run it in production. When you publish a runbook, you overwrite the existing Published version with the Draft version. In this case, you don't have a Published version yet because you just created the runbook.

1. Select **Publish** to publish the runbook and then **Yes** when prompted.

1. The **Status** field now shows **Published**. Review the options across the top that allow you to start the runbook now, schedule a future start time, or create a [webhook](../automation-webhooks.md) so that the runbook can be started through an HTTP call. Select **Start** and then **Yes** when prompted to start the runbook.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/automation-tutorial-runbook-textual/workflow-runbook-overview.png" alt-text="PowerShell workflow runbook overview page":::

1. A **Job** page opens for the runbook job that has been created. In this case, leave the page open so you can watch the job's progress. The **Status** field matches the statuses that you saw when testing the runbook.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/automation-tutorial-runbook-textual/job-page-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the runbook Job page.":::

1. Once the runbook status shows **Completed**, select **Output**. The output should look similar as the test output.

1. Close the **Job** page to return to runbook **Overview** page.

1. Under **Resources**, select **Jobs**. This page lists all the jobs created by your runbook. You should only see one job listed, since you have run the job only once.

1. Select the job to open the same **Job** page that you viewed when you started the runbook. Use this page to view the details of any job created for the runbook. Close the **Job** page to return to runbook **Overview** page.

## Add authentication to manage Azure resources

You've tested and published your runbook, but so far it doesn't do anything useful. You want to have it manage Azure resources. It can't do that unless it authenticates using the credentials for the subscription. The runbook uses the Automation account's system-assigned managed identity to authenticate with Azure to perform the management action against the VM. The runbook can be easily modified to use a user-assigned managed identity.

1. Select **Overview** and then **Edit** to open the textual editor.

1. Replace the existing code with the following:

   ```powershell
   workflow MyFirstRunbook-Workflow
   {
   	$resourceGroup = "resourceGroupName"
   	
   	# Ensures you do not inherit an AzContext in your runbook
   	Disable-AzContextAutosave -Scope Process
   	
   	# Connect to Azure with system-assigned managed identity
   	Connect-AzAccount -Identity
   	
   	# set and store context
   	$AzureContext = Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId "<SubscriptionID>"
   }
   ```

   Edit the `$resourceGroup` variable with a valid value representing your resource group.

1. If you want the runbook to execute with the system-assigned managed identity, leave the code as-is. If you prefer to use a user-assigned managed identity, then:
    1. From line 9, remove `Connect-AzAccount -Identity`,
    1. Replace it with `Connect-AzAccount -Identity -AccountId <ClientId>`, and
    1. Enter the Client ID you obtained earlier.

1. Select **Save** and then **Test pane**.

1. Select **Start** to start the test. Once it completes, you should see output similar to the following, displaying basic information from your account. This action confirms that the credential is valid.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/automation-tutorial-runbook-textual/runbook-auth-output.png" alt-text="Basic information that confirms credentials.":::

1. Close the **Test** page to return to the canvas.

## Add code to start a virtual machine

Now that your runbook is authenticating to the Azure subscription, you can manage resources. Add a command to start a virtual machine. You can pick any VM in your Azure subscription, and for now you're hardcoding that name in the runbook.

1. Add the code below as the last line immediately before the closing brace. Replace `VMName` with the actual name of a VM.

   ```powershell
   Start-AzVM -Name "VMName" -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -DefaultProfile $AzureContext
   ```

1. Test the runbook and confirm that the VM has started. Then return to the canvas.

## Add input parameters to the runbook

Your runbook currently starts the VM that you've hardcoded in the runbook. It will be more useful if you can specify the VM when the runbook is started. Add input parameters to the runbook to provide that functionality.

1. Replace line 3, `$resourceGroup = "resourceGroupName"`, with the following:

   ```powershell
   Param(
       [string]$resourceGroup,
       [string]$VMName
   )
   ```

1. Replace the previous `Start-AzVM` command with the following:

   ```powershell
   Start-AzVM -Name $VMName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -DefaultProfile $AzureContext
   ```

1. Test the runbook and confirm that the VM has started. Then return to the canvas.

## Manage multiple VMs simultaneously

You can use the `ForEach -Parallel` construct to process commands for each item in a collection concurrently. Revise the code so that the runbook will now:
- Accept a collection of virtual machine names,
- Accept a parameter to stop or start the virtual machines, and
- Perform the actions in parallel against all virtual machines

1. Replace all of the existing code with the following:

    ```powershell
    workflow MyFirstRunbook-Workflow
    {
    	param
    	(
    		[string]$resourceGroup,
    		[string[]]$VMs,
    		[string]$action
    	)

    	# Ensures you do not inherit an AzContext in your runbook
    	Disable-AzContextAutosave -Scope Process

    	# Connect to Azure with system-assigned managed identity
    	Connect-AzAccount -Identity

    	# set and store context
    	$AzureContext = Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId "<SubscriptionID>"

    	# Start or stop VMs in parallel
    	if ($action -eq "Start")
    	{
    		ForEach -Parallel ($vm in $VMs)
    		{
    			Start-AzVM -Name $vm -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -DefaultProfile $AzureContext
    		}
    	}
    	elseif ($action -eq "Stop")
    	{
    		ForEach -Parallel ($vm in $VMs)
    		{
    			Stop-AzVM -Name $vm -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -DefaultProfile $AzureContext -Force
    		}
    	}
    	else
    	{
    		Write-Output "`r`n Action not allowed. Please enter 'stop' or 'start'."
    	}
    }
    ```

1. If you want the runbook to execute with the system-assigned managed identity, leave the code as-is. If you prefer to use a user-assigned managed identity, then:

    1. From line 9, remove `Connect-AzAccount -Identity`,
    1. Replace it with `Connect-AzAccount -Identity -AccountId <ClientId>`, and
    1. Enter the Client ID you obtained earlier.

1. Select **Save**, then **Publish**, and then **Yes** when prompted.

1. From the **Overview** page, select **Start**.

1. Populate the parameters and then select **OK**.

   |Parameter |Description |
   |---|---|
   |RESOURCEGROUP|Enter the name of the resource group of the VMs.|
   |VMs|Enter the names of the virtual machines using the following syntax: `["VM1","VM2","VM3"]`|
   |Action|Enter `stop` or `start`.|

1. Navigate to your list of virtual machines and refresh the page every few seconds. Observe that the action for each VM happens in parallel. Without the `-Parallel` keyword, the actions would have performed sequentially. While the VMs will start in parallel, each VM may reach the **Running** phase at slightly different times based on the characteristics of each VM.

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this runbook, delete it with the following steps:

1. Navigate to your Automation Account.
1. Under **Process Automation**, select **Runbooks**.
1. Select the runbook.
1. From the runbook **Overview** page, select **Delete**.
