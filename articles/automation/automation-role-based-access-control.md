# Manage role permissions and security in Azure Automation

Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) enables access management for Azure resources. Using [Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/overview.md), you can segregate duties within your team and grant only the amount of access to users, groups, and applications that they need to perform their jobs. You can grant role-based access to users using the Azure portal, Azure Command-Line tools, or Azure Management APIs.

## Roles in Automation accounts

In Azure Automation, access is granted by assigning the appropriate Azure role to users, groups, and applications at the Automation account scope. Following are the built-in roles supported by an Automation account:

| **Role** | **Description** |
|:--- |:--- |
| Owner |The Owner role allows access to all resources and actions within an Automation account including providing access to other users, groups, and applications to manage the Automation account. |
| Contributor |The Contributor role allows you to manage everything except modifying other user’s access permissions to an Automation account. |
| Reader |The Reader role allows you to view all the resources in an Automation account but can't make any changes. |
| Automation Contributor | The Automation Contributor role allows you to manage all resources in the Automation account, except modifying other user's access permissions to an Automation account. |
| Automation Operator |The Automation Operator role allows you to view runbook name and properties and to create and manage jobs for all runbooks in an Automation account. This role is helpful if you want to protect your Automation account resources like credentials assets and runbooks from being viewed or modified but still allow members of your organization to execute these runbooks. |
|Automation Job Operator|The Automation Job Operator role allows you to create and manage jobs for all runbooks in an Automation account.|
|Automation Runbook Operator|The Automation Runbook Operator role allows you to view a runbook’s name and properties.|
| Log Analytics Contributor | The Log Analytics Contributor role allows you to read all monitoring data and edit monitoring settings. Editing monitoring settings includes adding the VM extension to VMs, reading storage account keys to be able to configure collection of logs from Azure storage, creating and configuring Automation accounts, adding Azure Automation features, and configuring Azure diagnostics on all Azure resources.|
| Log Analytics Reader | The Log Analytics Reader role allows you to view and search all monitoring data as well as view monitoring settings. This includes viewing the configuration of Azure diagnostics on all Azure resources. |
| Monitoring Contributor | The Monitoring Contributor role allows you to read all monitoring data and update monitoring settings.|
| Monitoring Reader | The Monitoring Reader role allows you to read all monitoring data. |
| User Access Administrator |The User Access Administrator role allows you to manage user access to Azure Automation accounts. |

## Role permissions

The following tables describe the specific permissions given to each role. This can include Actions, which give permissions, and Not Actions, which restrict them.

### Owner

An Owner can manage everything, including access. The following table shows the permissions granted for the role:

|Actions|Description|
|---|---|
|Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/*|Create and manage resources of all types.|

### Contributor

A Contributor can manage everything except access. The following table shows the permissions granted and denied for the role:

|**Actions**  |**Description**  |
|---------|---------|
|Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/*|Create and manage resources of all types|
|**Not Actions**||
|Microsoft.Authorization/*/Delete| Delete roles and role assignments.       |
|Microsoft.Authorization/*/Write     |  Create roles and role assignments.       |
|Microsoft.Authorization/elevateAccess/Action    | Denies the ability to create a User Access Administrator.       |

### Reader

>[!Note]
> We have recently made a change in the built-in Reader role permission for the Automation account. [Learn more](#reader-role-access-permissions)

A Reader can view all the resources in an Automation account but can't make any changes.

|**Actions**  |**Description**  |
|---------|---------|
|Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/read|View all resources in an Automation account. |


### Automation Contributor

An Automation Contributor can manage all resources in the Automation account except access. The following table shows the permissions granted for the role:

|**Actions**  |**Description**  |
|---------|---------|
|[Microsoft.Automation](../role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations.md#microsoftautomation)/automationAccounts/* | Create and manage resources of all types.|
|Microsoft.Authorization/*/read|Read roles and role assignments.|
|Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*|Create and manage resource group deployments.|
|Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read|Read resource group deployments.|
|Microsoft.Support/*|Create and manage support tickets.|
|Microsoft.Insights/ActionGroups/*|Read/write/delete action groups.|
|Microsoft.Insights/ActivityLogAlerts/*|Read/write/delete activity log alerts.|
|Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/*|Read/write/delete diagnostic settings.|
|Microsoft.Insights/MetricAlerts/*|Read/write/delete near real-time metric alerts.|
|Microsoft.Insights/ScheduledQueryRules/*|Read/write/delete log alerts in Azure Monitor.|
|Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/sharedKeys/action|List keys for a Log Analytics workspace|

> [!NOTE]
> The Automation Contributor role can be used to access any resource using the managed identity, if appropriate permissions are set on the target resource, or using a Run As account. An Automation Run As account are by default, configured with Contributor rights on the subscription. Follow the principal of least privilege and carefully assign permissions only required to execute your runbook. For example, if the Automation account is only required to start or stop an Azure VM, then the permissions assigned to the Run As account or managed identity needs to be only for starting or stopping the VM. Similarly, if a runbook is reading from blob storage, then assign read only permissions.
> 
> When assigning permissions, it is recommended to use Azure role based access control (RBAC) assigned to a managed identity. Review our [best approach](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/managed-identity-best-practice-recommendations.md) recommendations for using a system or user-assigned managed identity, including management and governance during its lifetime.

### Automation Operator

An Automation Operator is able to create and manage jobs, and read runbook names and properties for all runbooks in an Automation account.

>[!NOTE]
>If you want to control operator access to individual runbooks then don’t set this role. Instead use the **Automation Job Operator** and **Automation Runbook Operator** roles in combination.

## Reader role access permissions

>[!Important]
> To strengthen the overall Azure Automation security posture, the built-in RBAC Reader would not have access to Automation account keys through the API call - `GET /AUTOMATIONACCOUNTS/AGENTREGISTRATIONINFORMATION`. 

The Built-in Reader role for the Automation Account can't use the `API – GET /AUTOMATIONACCOUNTS/AGENTREGISTRATIONINFORMATION` to fetch the Automation Account keys. This is a high privilege operation providing sensitive information that could pose a security risk of an unwanted malicious actor with low privileges who can get access to automation account keys and can perform actions with elevated privilege level. 

To access the `API – GET /AUTOMATIONACCOUNTS/AGENTREGISTRATIONINFORMATION`, we recommend that you switch to the built-in roles like Owner, Contributor or Automation Contributor to access the Automation account keys. These roles, by default, will have the *listKeys* permission. As a best practice, we recommend that you create a custom role with limited permissions to access the Automation account keys. For a custom role, you need to add 
`Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/listKeys/action` permission to the role definition.
[Learn more](../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md) about how to create custom role from the Azure portal.

## Manage Role permissions for Hybrid Worker Groups and Hybrid Workers

You can create [Azure custom roles](../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md) in Automation and grant the following permissions to Hybrid Worker Groups and Hybrid Workers:

- [Extension-based Hybrid Runbook Worker](./extension-based-hybrid-runbook-worker-install.md?tabs=windows#manage-role-permissions-for-hybrid-worker-groups-and-hybrid-workers)
- [Agent-based Windows Hybrid Runbook Worker](./automation-windows-hrw-install.md#manage-role-permissions-for-hybrid-worker-groups-and-hybrid-workers)
 - [Agent-based Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker](./automation-linux-hrw-install.md#manage-role-permissions-for-hybrid-worker-groups-and-hybrid-workers) 


## Update Management permissions

Update Management can be used to assess and schedule update deployments to machines in multiple subscriptions in the same Microsoft Entra tenant, or across tenants using Azure Lighthouse. The following table lists the permissions needed to manage update deployments.

|**Resource** |**Role** |**Scope** |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Automation account |Virtual Machine Contributor  |Resource Group for the account  |

|Create update schedule ([Software Update Configurations](/rest/api/automation/softwareupdateconfigurations)) |Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/analytics/query/action |For workspace resource ID when using non-Azure dynamic list.|

>[!NOTE]
>When you use Update management, ensure that the execution policy for scripts is *RemoteSigned*.

## Configure Azure RBAC for your Automation account

The following section shows you how to configure Azure RBAC on your Automation account through the [Azure portal](#configure-azure-rbac-using-the-azure-portal) and [PowerShell](#configure-azure-rbac-using-powershell).

### Configure Azure RBAC using the Azure portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and open your Automation account from the **Automation Accounts** page.

1. Select **Access control (IAM)** and select a role from the list of available roles. You can choose any of the available built-in roles that an Automation account supports or any custom role you might have defined. Assign the role to a user to which you want to give permissions.

   For detailed steps, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.yml).

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can only set role-based access control at the Automation account scope and not at any resource below the Automation account.

#### Remove role assignments from a user

You can remove the access permission for a user who isn't managing the Automation account, or who no longer works for the organization. The following steps show how to remove the role assignments from a user. For detailed steps, see [Remove Azure role assignments](../../articles/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-remove.yml):

1. Open **Access control (IAM)** at a scope, such as management group, subscription, resource group, or resource, where you want to remove access.

1. Select the **Role assignments** tab to view all the role assignments at this scope.

1. In the list of role assignments, add a checkmark next to the user with the role assignment you want to remove.

1. Select **Remove**.

   ![Remove users](media/automation-role-based-access-control/automation-08-remove-users.png)

### Configure Azure RBAC using PowerShell

You can also configure role-based access to an Automation account using the following [Azure PowerShell cmdlets](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-powershell.md):

[Get-AzRoleDefinition](/powershell/module/Az.Resources/Get-AzRoleDefinition) lists all Azure roles that are available in Microsoft Entra ID. You can use this cmdlet with the `Name` parameter to list all the actions that a specific role can perform.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzRoleDefinition -Name 'Automation Operator'
```

The following is the example output:

```azurepowershell
Name             : Automation Operator
Id               : d3881f73-407a-4167-8283-e981cbba0404
IsCustom         : False
Description      : Automation Operators are able to start, stop, suspend, and resume jobs
Actions          : {Microsoft.Authorization/*/read, Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/jobs/read, Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/jobs/resume/action,
                   Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/jobs/stop/action...}
NotActions       : {}
AssignableScopes : {/}
```

[Get-AzRoleAssignment](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azroleassignment) lists Azure role assignments at the specified scope. Without any parameters, this cmdlet returns all the role assignments made under the subscription. Use the `ExpandPrincipalGroups` parameter to list access assignments for the specified user, as well as the groups that the user belongs to.

**Example:** Use the following cmdlet to list all the users and their roles within an Automation account.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzRoleAssignment -Scope '/subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/resourcegroups/<Resource Group Name>/Providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/<Automation account name>'
```

The following is the example output:

```powershell
RoleAssignmentId   : /subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/myAutomationAccount/provid
                     ers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Scope              : /subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/myAutomationAccount
DisplayName        : admin@contoso.com
SignInName         : admin@contoso.com
RoleDefinitionName : Automation Operator
RoleDefinitionId   : d3881f73-407a-4167-8283-e981cbba0404
ObjectId           : aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb
ObjectType         : User
```

Use [New-AzRoleAssignment](/powershell/module/Az.Resources/New-AzRoleAssignment) to assign access to users, groups, and applications to a particular scope.

**Example:** Use the following command to assign the "Automation Operator" role for a user in the Automation account scope.

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName <sign-in Id of a user you wish to grant access> -RoleDefinitionName 'Automation operator' -Scope '/subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/resourcegroups/<Resource Group Name>/Providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/<Automation account name>'
```

The following is the example output:

```azurepowershell
RoleAssignmentId   : /subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/Providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/myAutomationAccount/provid
                     ers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Scope              : /subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/Providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/myAutomationAccount
DisplayName        : admin@contoso.com
SignInName         : admin@contoso.com
RoleDefinitionName : Automation Operator
RoleDefinitionId   : d3881f73-407a-4167-8283-e981cbba0404
ObjectId           : bbbbbbbb-1111-2222-3333-cccccccccccc
ObjectType         : User
```

Use [Remove-AzRoleAssignment](/powershell/module/Az.Resources/Remove-AzRoleAssignment) to remove access of a specified user, group, or application from a particular scope.

**Example:** Use the following command to remove the user from the Automation Operator role in the Automation account scope.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName <sign-in Id of a user you wish to remove> -RoleDefinitionName 'Automation Operator' -Scope '/subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/resourcegroups/<Resource Group Name>/Providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/<Automation account name>'
```

In the preceding example, replace `sign-in ID of a user you wish to remove`, `SubscriptionID`, `Resource Group Name`, and `Automation account name` with your account details. Choose **yes** when prompted to confirm before continuing to remove user role assignments.

### User experience for Automation Operator role - Automation account

When a user assigned to the Automation Operator role on the Automation account scope views the Automation account to which he/she is assigned, the user can only view the list of runbooks, runbook jobs, and schedules created in the Automation account. This user can't view the definitions of these items. The user can start, stop, suspend, resume, or schedule the runbook job. However, the user doesn't have access to other Automation resources, such as configurations, Hybrid Runbook Worker groups, or DSC nodes.

## Configure Azure RBAC for runbooks

Azure Automation allows you to assign Azure roles to specific runbooks. To do this, run the following script to add a user to a specific runbook. An Automation Account Administrator or a Tenant Administrator can run this script.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$rgName = "<Resource Group Name>" # Resource Group name for the Automation account
$automationAccountName ="<Automation account name>" # Name of the Automation account
$rbName = "<Name of Runbook>" # Name of the runbook
$userId = "<User ObjectId>" # Azure Active Directory (AAD) user's ObjectId from the directory

# Gets the Automation account resource
$aa = Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName $rgName -ResourceType "Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts" -ResourceName $automationAccountName

# Get the Runbook resource
$rb = Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName $rgName -ResourceType "Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/runbooks" -ResourceName "$rbName"

# The Automation Job Operator role only needs to be run once per user.
New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId $userId -RoleDefinitionName "Automation Job Operator" -Scope $aa.ResourceId

# Adds the user to the Automation Runbook Operator role to the Runbook scope
New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId $userId -RoleDefinitionName "Automation Runbook Operator" -Scope $rb.ResourceId
```

Once the script has run, have the user sign in to the Azure portal and select **All Resources**. In the list, the user can see the runbook for which he/she has been added as an Automation Runbook Operator.

### User experience for Automation operator role - Runbook

When a user assigned to the Automation Operator role on the Runbook scope views an assigned runbook, the user can only start the runbook and view the runbook jobs.
