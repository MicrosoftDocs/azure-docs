# Update runbook from PowerShell 5.1 to PowerShell 7.2

Using the Runtime environment, you can upgrade a runbook from one Runtime version to the other by creating a different Runtime environment and then linking the runbook to it. You can follow similar steps for updating Python runbooks. 

> [!NOTE]
> [PowerShell 7.1](/powershell/scripting/install/powershell-support-lifecycle?view=powershell-7.3&preserve-view=true#powershell-end-of-support-dates) and [Python 2.7](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) are no longer supported by their respective parent products PowerShell and Python. We recommend that you update outdated runbooks to latest supported versions using Runtime environment.

## Prerequisites

 - An Azure Automation account (in any supported Public regions except Central India, Germany North, Italy North, Israel Central, Poland Central, UAE Central, and Government clouds).
 - A PowerShell 5.1 runbook in Azure Automation.
 
## Create Runtime environment

> [!NOTE]
> Instead of creating a new PowerShell 7.2 Runtime environment, you can use the System-generated PowerShell 7.2 Runtime environment.

1. Sign in to the Azure [portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select your Automation account.
1. Under **Process Automation**, select **Runtime Environments (preview)**. If you don't find Runtime Environments (preview) in the list, select **Try Runtime environment experience** to switch to the new portal interface.
1. Select **Create** to create a new PowerShell 7.2 Runtime.
1. On **Basics** tab, provide the following details:
    1. Provide **Name** for the Runtime environment. It must begin with alphabet and can contain only alphabets, numbers, underscores, and dashes.  
    1. From the **Language** dropdown list, select  **PowerShell**.
    1. In **Runtime version** for scripting language, select 7.2.
    1. Provide appropriate **Description**.
1. On **Packages** tab, in the **Package version** dropdown list, you would see **Az version 8.3.0** and **Azure CLI version 2.56.0** packages already present.
1. Select **+Add from gallery** to add more packages from gallery and select **Next**.
1. On **Review + create** tab, review the entries and select **Create**.

   A notification appears to confirm that a Runtime environment is successfully created.


## Update Runtime environment of runbook

1. In the **Automation account | Runbooks** page, select the runbook linked to PowerShell 5.1 Runtime environment that you want to update.

1. Select **Edit in portal**.
1. Select **Runtime environment**  from the dropdown to view the list of compatible Runtime environments that you can link to the runbook. Here, select the Runtime environment that you created in [Runtime environment](#create-runtime-environment) for PowerShell 7.2.

1. Make changes in the runbook code to ensure compatibility with PowerShell 7.2.
1. Select **Test pane** to test the upgraded runbook before you publish it.
1. After confirmation that the test results are as expected, select **Publish** to publish the runbook to production.
    On the **Runbooks** list page, you can see the same runbook linked to PowerShell 7.2 Runtime environment.
