# Run Azure CLI commands in PowerShell 7.2 runbooks

You can run Azure CLI commands in runbooks linked with PowerShell 7.2 Runtime environment.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure CLI commands version 2.56.0 are available as a default package in PowerShell 7.2 Runtime environment.

## Prerequisites

 - An Azure Automation account (in any supported Public regions except Central India, Germany North, Italy North, Israel Central, Poland Central, UAE Central, and Government clouds).
 
 
## Create Runtime environment

> [!NOTE]
> Instead of creating a new PowerShell 7.2 Runtime environment, you can use the System-generated PowerShell 7.2 Runtime environment.

#### [Azure portal](#tab/create-runtime-env-portal)

1. Sign in to the Azure [portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select your Automation account.
1. Under **Process Automation**, select **Runtime Environments (preview)** and then select **Create**.
1. On **Basics** tab, provide the following details:
    1. Provide **Name** for the Runtime environment. It must begin with alphabet and can contain only alphabets, numbers, underscores, and dashes.  
    1. From the **Language** dropdown list, select  **PowerShell**.
    1. In **Runtime version** for scripting language, select 7.2
    1. Provide appropriate **Description**.
1. On **Packages** tab, in the **Package version** dropdown list, you would see **Az version 8.3** and **Azure CLI version 2.56.0** already present.
1. Select **+Add from gallery** to add more packages from gallery and select **Next**.
1. On **Review + create** tab, review the entries and select **Create**.
      
   A notification appears to confirm that a Runtime environment is successfully created.
