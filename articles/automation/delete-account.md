# Manage your Azure Automation account

After you enable an Azure Automation account to help automate IT or business process, or enable its other features to support operations management of your Azure and non-Azure machines, you may decide to stop using the Automation account. If you have enabled features that depend on integration with an Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace, there are more steps required to complete this action.

This article tells you how to completely remove your Automation account through the Azure portal, using Azure PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or the REST API and restore your deleted Azure Automation account.

## Delete your Azure Automation account

Removing your Automation account can be done using one of the following methods based on the supported deployment models:

* Delete the resource group containing the Automation account.
* Delete the resource group containing the Automation account and linked Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace, if:

    * The account and workspace is dedicated to supporting Update Management, Change Tracking, and Inventory, and/or Start/Stop VMs during off-hours.
    * The account is dedicated to process automation and integrated with a workspace to send runbook job status and job streams.

* Unlink the Log Analytics workspace from the Automation account and delete the Automation account.
* Delete the feature from your linked workspace, unlink the account from the workspace, and then delete the Automation account.


### Prerequisite

Verify there aren't any [Resource Manager locks](../azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources.md) applied at the subscription, resource group, or resource, which prevents accidental deletion or modification of critical resources. If you've deployed the Start/Stop VMs during off-hours solution, it sets the lock level to **CanNotDelete** against several dependent resources in the Automation account (specifically its runbooks and variables). Remove any locks before deleting the Automation account.

> [!NOTE]
> If you receive an error message similar to: `The link cannot be updated or deleted because it is linked to Update Management and/or ChangeTracking Solutions`, then your Automation account is linked to a Log Analytics workspace with either the Update Management and/or Change Tracking and Inventory features enabled. For more information, see [Delete a shared capability Automation account](#delete-a-shared-capability-automation-account), below.

## Delete the dedicated resource group

To delete your Automation account, and also the Log Analytics workspace if linked to the account, created in the same resource group dedicated to the account, follow the steps outlined in the [Azure Resource Manager resource group and resource deletion](../azure-resource-manager/management/delete-resource-group.md) article.

## Delete a standalone Automation account

If your Automation account isn't linked to a Log Analytics workspace, perform the following steps to delete it.

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Sign in to Azure at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Automation Accounts**.

3. Open your Automation account and select **Delete** from the menu.

While the information is verified and the account is deleted, you can track the progress under **Notifications**, chosen from the menu.

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

This command removes the Automation account without prompting for validation.

```powershell
Remove-AzAutomationAccount -Name "automationAccountName" -Force -ResourceGroupName "resourceGroupName"
```

## Delete a standalone Automation account linked to workspace

## Delete a shared capability Automation account

To delete your Automation account linked to a Log Analytics workspace in support of Update Management, Change Tracking and Inventory, and/or Start/Stop VMs during off-hours, perform the following steps.

### Step 1: Delete the solution from the linked workspace

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

    * For Start/Stop VMs during off-hours, select **Start-Stop-VM[workspace name]**.
    * For Update Management, select **Updates(workspace name)**.
    * For Change Tracking and Inventory, select **ChangeTracking(workspace name)**.

6. On the **Solution** page, select **Delete** from the menu. If more than one of the above listed features are deployed to the Automation account and linked workspace, you need to select and delete each one before proceeding.

7. While the information is verified and the feature is deleted, you can track the progress under **Notifications**, chosen from the menu. You're returned to the Solutions page after the removal process.

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

To remove an installed solution using Azure PowerShell, use the [Remove-AzMonitorLogAnalyticsSolution](/powershell/module/az.monitoringsolutions/remove-azmonitorloganalyticssolution) cmdlet.

```powershell
Remove-AzMonitorLogAnalyticsSolution -ResourceGroupName "resourceGroupName" -Name "solutionName"

## Restore a deleted Automation account

You can recover a deleted automation account from Azure portal.

To recover an Automation account, ensure that the following conditions are met:
- You've created the Automation account with the Azure Resource Manager deployment model and deleted within the past 30 days.
- Before you attempt to recover a deleted Automation account, ensure that resource group for that account exists.

> [!NOTE]
> * If the resource group of the Automation account is deleted, to recover, you must recreate the resource group with the same name. 
> * Though the resource group isn't present, you can see the Automation account in the deleted list. If the resource group isn't present, the account restore operation fails with the error *Account restore failed*.

### Recover a deleted Automation account

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Go to your Automation account.
1. On the **Automation Accounts** page, select **Manage deleted accounts**.
