# Troubleshoot changes in your environment

In this tutorial, you learn how to troubleshoot changes on an Azure virtual machine. By enabling Change tracking, you can track changes to software, files, Linux daemons, Windows Services, and Windows Registry keys on your computers.
Identifying these configuration changes can help you pinpoint operational issues across your environment.

In this tutorial you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Onboard a VM for Change tracking and Inventory
> * Search change logs for stopped services
> * Configure change tracking
> * Enable Activity log connection
> * Trigger an event
> * View changes
> * Configure alerts

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have one yet, you can [activate your MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) or sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* An [Automation account](automation-offering-get-started.md) to hold the watcher and action runbooks and the Watcher Task.
* A [virtual machine](../virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal.md) to onboard.

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.

## Enable Change tracking and Inventory

First you need to enable Change tracking and Inventory for your VM for this tutorial. If you have previously enabled another automation solution for a VM, this step is not necessary.

1. On the left menu, select **Virtual machines** and select a VM from the list
1. On the left menu, under the **OPERATIONS** section, click **Inventory**. The **Change tracking** page opens.

![Enable change](./media/automation-tutorial-troubleshoot-changes/enableinventory.png)
The **Change Tracking** screen opens. Configure the location, Log analytics workspace, and Automation account to use and click **Enable**. If the fields are grayed out, that means another automation solution is enabled for the VM and the same workspace and Automation account must be used.

A [Log Analytics](../log-analytics/log-analytics-overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fautomation%2ftoc.json) workspace is used to collect data that is generated by features and services such as Inventory.
The workspace provides a single location to review and analyze data from multiple sources.

During onboarding, the VM is provisioned with the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) and hybrid worker.
This agent is used to communicate with the VM and obtain information about installed software.

Enabling the solution can take up to 15 minutes. During this time, you shouldn't close the browser window.
After the solution is enabled, information about installed software and changes on the VM flows to Azure Monitor logs.
It can take between 30 minutes and 6 hours for the data to be available for analysis.

[!INCLUDE [azure-monitor-log-analytics-rebrand](../../includes/azure-monitor-log-analytics-rebrand.md)]

## Using Change tracking in Azure Monitor logs

Change tracking generates log data that is sent to Azure Monitor logs.
To search the logs by running queries, select **Log Analytics** at the top of the **Change tracking** window.
Change tracking data is stored under the type **ConfigurationChange**.
The following sample Log Analytics query returns all the Windows Services that have been stopped.

```loganalytics
ConfigurationChange
| where ConfigChangeType == "WindowsServices" and SvcState == "Stopped"
```

To learn more about running and searching log files in Azure Monitor logs, see [Azure Monitor logs](../azure-monitor/log-query/log-query-overview.md).

## Configure Change tracking

Change tracking gives you the ability to track configuration changes on your VM. The following steps show you how to configure tracking of registry keys and files.

To choose which files and Registry keys to collect and track, select **Edit settings** at the top of the **Change tracking** page.

> [!NOTE]
> Inventory and Change tracking use the same collection settings, and settings are configured on a workspace level.

In the **Workspace Configuration** window, add the Windows Registry keys, Windows files, or Linux files to be tracked, as outlined in the next three sections.

### Add a Windows Registry key

1. On the **Windows Registry** tab, select **Add**.
    The **Add Windows Registry for Change Tracking** window opens.

1. On the **Add Windows Registry for Change Tracking**, enter the information for the key to track and click **Save**

|Property  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Enabled     | Determines if the setting is applied        |
|Item Name     | Friendly name of the file to be tracked        |
|Group     | A group name for logically grouping files        |
|Windows Registry Key   | The path to check for the file For example: "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders\Common Startup"      |

### Add a Windows file

1. On the **Windows Files** tab, select **Add**. The **Add Windows File for Change Tracking** window opens.

1. On the **Add Windows File for Change Tracking**, enter the information for the file or directory to track and click **Save**

|Item Name     | Friendly name of the file to be tracked        |
|Group     | A group name for logically grouping files        |
|Enter Path     | The path to check for the file For example: "c:\temp\\\*.txt"<br>You can also use environment variables such as "%winDir%\System32\\\*.*"         |
|Recursion     | Determines if recursion is used when looking for the item to be tracked.        |
|Upload file content for all settings| Turns on or off file content upload on tracked changes. Available options: **True** or **False**.|

### Add a Linux file

1. On the **Linux Files** tab, select **Add**. The **Add Linux File for Change Tracking** window opens.

1. On the **Add Linux File for Change Tracking**, enter the information for the file or directory to track and click **Save**

|Property  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Enabled     | Determines if the setting is applied        |
|Item Name     | Friendly name of the file to be tracked        |
|Group     | A group name for logically grouping files        |
|Enter Path     | The path to check for the file For example: "/etc/*.conf"       |
|Path Type     | Type of item to be tracked, possible values are File and Directory        |
|Recursion     | Determines if recursion is used when looking for the item to be tracked.        |
|Use Sudo     | This setting determines if sudo is used when checking for the item.         |
|Links     | This setting determines how symbolic links dealt with when traversing directories.<br> **Ignore** - Ignores symbolic links and does not include the files/directories referenced<br>**Follow** - Follows the symbolic links during recursion and also includes the files/directories referenced<br>**Manage** - Follows the symbolic links and allows alter the treatment of returned content      |
|Upload file content for all settings| Turns on or off file content upload on tracked changes. Available options: **True** or **False**.|

   > [!NOTE]
   > The "Manage" links option is not recommended. File content retrieval is not supported.

## Enable Activity log connection

From the **Change tracking** page on your VM, select **Manage Activity Log Connection**. This task opens the **Azure Activity log** page. Select **Connect** to connect Change tracking to the Azure activity log for your VM.

With this setting enabled, navigate to the **Overview** page for your VM and select **Stop** to stop your VM. When prompted, select **Yes** to stop the VM. When it is deallocated, select **Start** to restart your VM.

Stopping and starting a VM logs an event in its activity log. Navigate back to the **Change tracking** page. Select the **Events** tab at the bottom of the page. After a while, the events shown in the chart and the table. Like in the preceding step, each event can be selected to view detailed information on the event.

## View changes

Once the Change tracking and Inventory solution is enabled, you can view the results on the **Change tracking** page.

From within your VM, select **Change tracking** under **OPERATIONS**.

![Screenshot that shows the list of changes to the VM](./media/automation-tutorial-troubleshoot-changes/change-tracking-list.png)

The chart shows changes that have occurred over time.
After you have added an Activity Log connection, the line graph at the top displays Azure Activity Log events.
Each row of bar graphs represents a different trackable Change type.
These types are Linux daemons, files, Windows Registry keys, software, and Windows services.
The change tab shows the details for the changes shown in the visualization in descending order of time that the change occurred (most recent first).
The **Events** tab, the table displays the connected Activity Log events and their corresponding details with the most recent first.

You can see in the results, that there were multiple changes to the system, including changes to services and software. You can use the filters at the top of the page to filter the results by **Change type** or by a time range.

Select a **WindowsServices** change, this opens the **Change Details** window. The change details window shows details about the change and the values before and after the change. In this instance, the Software Protection service was stopped.

![Viewing change details in the portal](./media/automation-tutorial-troubleshoot-changes/change-details.png)

## Configure alerts

Viewing changes in the Azure portal can be helpful, but being able to be alerted when a change occurs, such as a stopped service is more beneficial.

To add an alert for a stopped service, in the Azure portal, go to **Monitor**. And then under **Shared Services**, select **Alerts** and click **+ New alert rule**

Click **Select** to choose a resource. On the **Select a resource** page, select **Log Analytics** from the **Filter by resource type** drop-down. Select your Log Analytics workspace, and then select **Done**.

![Select a resource](./media/automation-tutorial-troubleshoot-changes/select-a-resource.png)

Click **Add condition**, on the **Configure signal logic** page, in the table, select **Custom log search**. Enter the following query in the Search query text box:

```loganalytics
ConfigurationChange | where ConfigChangeType == "WindowsServices" and SvcName == "W3SVC" and SvcState == "Stopped" | summarize by Computer
```

This query returns the computers that had the W3SVC service stopped in the specified timeframe.

Under **Alert logic**, for **Threshold**, enter **0**. When you're finished, select **Done**.

![Configure signal logic](./media/automation-tutorial-troubleshoot-changes/configure-signal-logic.png)

Under **Action Groups**, select **Create New**. An action group is a group of actions that you can use across multiple alerts. The actions can include but are not limited to email notifications, runbooks, webhooks, and many more. To learn more about action groups, see [Create and manage action groups](../azure-monitor/platform/action-groups.md).

Under **Alert details**, enter a name and description for the alert. Set **Severity** to **Informational(Sev 2)**, **Warning(Sev 1)**, or **Critical(Sev 0)**.

In the **Action group name** box, enter a name for the alert and a short name. The short name is used in place of a full action group name when notifications are sent by using this group.

Under **Actions**, enter a name for the action, like **Email Administrators**. Under **ACTION TYPE**, select **Email/SMS/Push/Voice**. Under **DETAILS**, select **Edit details**.

![Add action group](./media/automation-tutorial-troubleshoot-changes/add-action-group.png)

In the **Email/SMS/Push/Voice** pane, enter a name. Select the **Email** check box, and then enter a valid email address. Click **OK** on the **Email/SMS/Push/Voice** page, and then click **OK** on the **Add action group** page.

To customize the subject of the alert email, under **Create rule**, under **Customize Actions**, select **Email subject**. When you're finished, select **Create alert rule**. The alert tells you when an update deployment succeeds, and which machines were part of that update deployment run.

The following image is an example email received wen the W3SVC service stops.
