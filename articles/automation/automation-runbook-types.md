# Azure Automation runbook types

The Azure Automation Process Automation feature supports several types of runbooks, as defined in the following table. To learn about the process automation environment, see [Runbook execution in Azure Automation](automation-runbook-execution.md).

| Type | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| [PowerShell](#powershell-runbooks) |Textual runbook based on Windows PowerShell scripting.  The currently supported versions are: PowerShell 7.2 (GA) and PowerShell 5.1 (GA). Since [PowerShell 7.1](/powershell/scripting/install/powershell-support-lifecycle?view=powershell-7.3&preserve-view=true#powershell-end-of-support-dates) is no longer supported by parent product PowerShell, we recommend that you to create runbooks in long term supported version PowerShell 7.2 |
| [PowerShell Workflow](#powershell-workflow-runbooks)|Textual runbook based on Windows PowerShell Workflow scripting. |
| [Python](#python-runbooks) |Textual runbook based on Python scripting. The currently supported versions are: Python 3.8 (GA) and Python 3.10 (preview). Since [Python 2.7](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) is no longer supported by parent product Python, we recommend that you to create runbooks in long term supported versions.  |
| [Graphical](#graphical-runbooks)|Graphical runbook based on Windows PowerShell and created and edited completely in the graphical editor in Azure portal. |
| [Graphical PowerShell Workflow](#graphical-runbooks)|Graphical runbook based on Windows PowerShell Workflow and created and edited completely in the graphical editor in Azure portal. |

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Automation will follow the support lifecycle of PowerShell and Python language versions in accordance with the timelines published by parent products [PowerShell](/powershell/scripting/install/powershell-support-lifecycle?view=powershell-7.3&preserve-view=true#powershell-end-of-support-dates) and [Python](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) respectively. We recommend that you to use runbooks with supported language versions.

Take into account the following considerations when determining which type to use for a particular runbook.

* You can't convert runbooks from graphical to text type, or the other way around.
* There are limitations when using runbooks of different types as child runbooks. For more information, see [Child runbooks in Azure Automation](automation-child-runbooks.md).


## PowerShell runbooks

PowerShell runbooks are based on Windows PowerShell. You directly edit the code of the runbook using the text editor in the Azure portal. You can also use any offline text editor and [import the runbook](manage-runbooks.md) into Azure Automation.

The PowerShell version is determined by the **Runtime version** specified (that is version 7.2, 7.1 (preview) or 5.1).

The same Azure sandbox and Hybrid Runbook Worker can execute multiple **PowerShell** runbooks targeting different runtime versions side by side.

> [!NOTE]
> - Currently, PowerShell 7.2 runtime version is supported for both Cloud and Hybrid jobs in all Public regions except Central India, UAE Central, Israel Central, Italy North, and Germany North. 
> - At the time of runbook execution, if you select **Runtime Version** as **7.2**, PowerShell modules targeting 7.2 runtime version are used and if you select **Runtime Version** as **5.1**, PowerShell modules targeting 5.1 runtime version are used. This applies for PowerShell 7.1 (preview) modules and runbooks.

Ensure that you select the right Runtime Version for modules.

For example: if you're executing a runbook for a SharePoint automation scenario in **Runtime version** *7.1 (preview)*, then import the module in **Runtime version** **7.1 (preview)**; if you're executing a runbook for a SharePoint automation scenario in **Runtime version** **5.1**, then import the module in **Runtime version** *5.1*. In this case, you would see two entries for the module, one for **Runtime Version** **7.1(preview)** and other for **5.1**.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, PowerShell 5.1, PowerShell 7.1 (preview) and PowerShell 7.2 are supported.

### Advantages

- Implement all complex logic with PowerShell code without the other complexities of PowerShell Workflow.
- Start faster than PowerShell Workflow runbooks, since they don't need to be compiled before running.
- Run in Azure and on Hybrid Runbook Workers for both Windows and Linux.

### Limitations and Known issues

The following are the current limitations and known issues with PowerShell runbooks:

# [PowerShell 7.2](#tab/lps72)

**Limitations**

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, PowerShell 7.2 runtime version is supported for both Cloud and Hybrid jobs in all Public regions except Central India, UAE Central, Israel  Central, Italy North, and Germany North.

- For the PowerShell 7.2 runtime version, the module activities aren't extracted for the imported modules. Use [Azure Automation extension for VS code](automation-runbook-authoring.md) to simplify runbook authoring experience. 
- PowerShell 7.x doesn't support workflows. For more information, see [PowerShell workflow](/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell#powershell-workflow) for more details.
- PowerShell 7.x currently doesn't support signed runbooks.
- Source control integration doesn't support PowerShell 7.2. Also, PowerShell 7.2 runbooks in source control get created in Automation account as Runtime 5.1.
- Az module 8.3.0 is installed by default. The complete list of component modules of selected Az module version is shown once Az version is configured again using Azure portal or API.
- The imported PowerShell 7.2 module would be validated during job execution. Ensure that all dependencies for the selected module are also imported for successful job execution.
- Azure runbook doesn't support `Start-Job` with `-credential`. 
- Azure doesn't support all PowerShell input parameters. [Learn more](runbook-input-parameters.md).

**Known issues**
- Runbooks taking dependency on internal file paths such as `C:\modules` might fail due to changes in service backend infrastructure. Change runbook code to ensure there are no dependencies on internal file paths and use [Get-ChildItem](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-childitem?view=powershell-7.3&preserve-view=true) to get the required module information.
- `Get-AzStorageAccount` cmdlet might fail with an error: *The `Get-AzStorageAccount` command was found in the module `Az.Storage`, but the module could not be loaded*.
- Executing child scripts using `.\child-runbook.ps1` is not supported.</br>
  **Workaround**: Use `Start-AutomationRunbook` (internal cmdlet) or `Start-AzAutomationRunbook` (from *Az.Automation* module) to start another runbook from parent runbook.
- When you use [ExchangeOnlineManagement](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true) module version: 3.0.0 or higher, you can experience errors. To resolve the issue, ensure that you explicitly upload [PowerShellGet](/powershell/module/powershellget/) and [PackageManagement](/powershell/module/packagemanagement/) modules.
- When you utilize the `New-AzAutomationVariable`  cmdlet within Az.Automation Module to upload a variable of type **object**, the operation doesn't function as expected.  

  **Workaround**: Convert the object to a JSON string using the ConvertTo-Json cmdlet and then upload the variable with the JSON string as its value. This workaround ensures proper handling of the variable within the Azure Automation environment as a JSON string. 

  **Example** - Create a PowerShell object that has stored information around Azure VMs 

  ```azurepowershell
    # Retrieve Azure virtual machines with status information for the 'northeurope' region 
    $AzVM = Get-AzVM -Status | Where-Object {$_.Location -eq "northeurope"} 
    
    $VMstopatch = @($AzVM).Id 
    # Create an Azure Automation variable (This cmdlet will not fail, but the variable may not work as intended when used in the runbook.) 
    New-AzAutomationVariable -ResourceGroupName "mrg" -AutomationAccountName "mAutomationAccount2" -Name "complex1" -Encrypted $false -Value $VMstopatch 
    
    # Convert the object to a JSON string 
    $jsonString = $VMstopatch | ConvertTo-Json 
    
    # Create an Azure Automation variable with a JSON string value (works effectively within the automation runbook) 
    New-AzAutomationVariable -ResourceGroupName "mrg" -AutomationAccountName "mAutomationAccount2" -Name "complex1" -Encrypted $false -Value $jsonString 
  ```
 

# [PowerShell 5.1](#tab/lps51)

**Limitations**

- Runbooks can't use [parallel processing](automation-powershell-workflow.md#use-parallel-processing) to execute multiple actions in parallel.
- Runbooks can't use [checkpoints](automation-powershell-workflow.md#use-checkpoints-in-a-workflow) to resume runbook if there's an error.
- You can include only PowerShell, PowerShell Workflow runbooks, and graphical runbooks as child runbooks by using the [Start-AzAutomationRunbook](/powershell/module/az.automation/start-azautomationrunbook) cmdlet, which creates a new job.
- Runbooks can't use the PowerShell [#Requires](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_requires) statement, it isn't supported in Azure sandbox or on Hybrid Runbook Workers and might cause the job to fail.
- Azure runbook doesn't support `Start-Job` with `-credential`. 
- Azure doesn't support all PowerShell input parameters. [Learn more](runbook-input-parameters.md).

**Known issues**

* Runbooks taking dependency on internal file paths such as `C:\modules` might fail due to changes in service backend infrastructure. Change runbook code to ensure there are no dependencies on internal file paths and use [Get-ChildItem](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-childitem?view=powershell-7.3&preserve-view=true) to get the required module information. 
  
  **Sample script**
  ```powershell-interactive

  # Get information about module "Microsoft.Graph.Authentication"
  $ModuleName = "Microsoft.Graph.Authentication"
    
  $NewPath = "C:\usr\src\PSModules\$ModuleName"
  $OldPath = "C:\Modules\User\$ModuleName"
    
  if (Test-Path -Path $NewPath -PathType Container) {
      Get-ChildItem -Path $NewPath
  } elseif (Test-Path -Path $OldPath -PathType Container) {
      Get-ChildItem -Path $OldPath
  } else {
      Write-Output "Module $ModuleName not present."
  }
  # Getting the path to the Temp folder, if needed.
  $tmp = $env:TEMP
  
  ```

* `Get-AzStorageAccount` cmdlet might fail with an error: *The `Get-AzStorageAccount` command was found in the module `Az.Storage`, but the module could not be loaded*.
* PowerShell runbooks can't retrieve an unencrypted [variable asset](./shared-resources/variables.md) with a null value.
* PowerShell runbooks can't retrieve a variable asset with `*~*` in the name.
* A [Get-Process](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-process) operation in a loop in a PowerShell runbook can crash after about 80 iterations.
* A PowerShell runbook can fail if it tries to write a large amount of data to the output stream at once. You can typically work around this issue by having the runbook output just the information needed  to work with large objects. For example, instead of using `Get-Process` with no limitations, you can have the cmdlet output just the required parameters as in `Get-Process | Select ProcessName, CPU`.
* When you use [ExchangeOnlineManagement](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true) module version: 3.0.0 or higher, you may experience errors. To resolve the issue, ensure that you explicitly upload [PowerShellGet](/powershell/module/powershellget/) and [PackageManagement](/powershell/module/packagemanagement/) modules as well.
* If you import module Az.Accounts with version 2.12.3 or newer, ensure that you import the **Newtonsoft.Json** v10 module explicitly if PowerShell 5.1 runbooks have a dependency on this version of the module. The workaround for this issue is to use PowerShell 7.2 runbooks.
* When you utilize the `New-AzAutomationVariable` cmdlet within Az.Automation Module to upload a variable of type **object**, the operation doesn't function as expected.  

  **Workaround**: Convert the object to a JSON string using the ConvertTo-Json cmdlet and then upload the variable with the JSON string as its value. This workaround ensures proper handling of the variable within the Azure Automation environment as a JSON string. 

  **Example** - Create a PowerShell object that has stored information around Azure VMs 

  ```azurepowershell
    # Retrieve Azure virtual machines with status information for the 'northeurope' region 
    $AzVM = Get-AzVM -Status | Where-Object {$_.Location -eq "northeurope"} 
    
    $VMstopatch = @($AzVM).Id 
    # Create an Azure Automation variable (This cmdlet will not fail, but the variable may not work as intended when used in the runbook.) 
    New-AzAutomationVariable -ResourceGroupName "mrg" -AutomationAccountName "mAutomationAccount2" -Name "complex1" -Encrypted $false -Value $VMstopatch 
    
    # Convert the object to a JSON string 
    $jsonString = $VMstopatch | ConvertTo-Json 
    
    # Create an Azure Automation variable with a JSON string value (works effectively within the automation runbook) 
    New-AzAutomationVariable -ResourceGroupName "mrg" -AutomationAccountName "mAutomationAccount2" -Name "complex1" -Encrypted $false -Value $jsonString 
  ```

# [PowerShell 7.1](#tab/lps71)

**Limitations**

- [PowerShell 7.1](/powershell/scripting/install/powershell-support-lifecycle?view=powershell-7.3&preserve-view=true#powershell-end-of-support-dates) is no longer supported by parent product PowerShell. We recommend you to create new runbooks in PowerShell 7.2 for a long term support and update the outdated runbooks.
- The Azure Automation internal PowerShell cmdlets aren't supported on a Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker. You must import the `automationassets` module at the beginning of your PowerShell runbook to access the Automation account shared resources (assets) functions.
- For the PowerShell 7 runtime version, the module activities aren't extracted for the imported modules.
- *PSCredential* runbook parameter type isn't supported in PowerShell 7 runtime version.
- PowerShell 7.x doesn't support workflows. For more information, see [PowerShell Workflow](/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell#powershell-workflow) for more details.
- PowerShell 7.x currently doesn't support signed runbooks.
- Source control integration doesn't support PowerShell 7.1 (preview) Also, PowerShell 7.1 (preview) runbooks in source control gets created in Automation account as Runtime 5.1.
- PowerShell 7.1 module management isn't supported through `Get-AzAutomationModule` cmdlets.
- Runbook fails with no log trace if the input value contains the character '.
- Azure runbook doesn't support `Start-Job` with `-credential`. 
- Azure doesn't support all PowerShell input parameters. [Learn more](runbook-input-parameters.md).

**Known issues**

- Runbooks taking dependency on internal file paths such as `C:\modules` might fail due to changes in service backend infrastructure. Change runbook code to ensure there are no dependencies on internal file paths and use [Get-ChildItem](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-childitem?view=powershell-7.3&preserve-view=true) to get the required module information.
   
  **Sample script**
  ```powershell-interactive

  # Get information about module "Microsoft.Graph.Authentication"
  $ModuleName = "Microsoft.Graph.Authentication"
    
  $NewPath = "C:\usr\src\PSModules\$ModuleName"
  $OldPath = "C:\Modules\User\$ModuleName"
    
  if (Test-Path -Path $NewPath -PathType Container) {
      Get-ChildItem -Path $NewPath
  } elseif (Test-Path -Path $OldPath -PathType Container) {
      Get-ChildItem -Path $OldPath
  } else {
      Write-Output "Module $ModuleName not present."
  }
  # Getting the path to the Temp folder, if needed.
  $tmp = $env:TEMP
  
  ```
- `Get-AzStorageAccount` cmdlet might fail with an error: *The `Get-AzStorageAccount` command was found in the module `Az.Storage`, but the module could not be loaded*.
- Executing child scripts using `.\child-runbook.ps1` isn't supported in this preview.
  **Workaround**: Use `Start-AutomationRunbook` (internal cmdlet) or `Start-AzAutomationRunbook` (from `Az.Automation` module) to start another runbook from parent runbook.
- Runbook properties defining logging preference isn't supported in PowerShell 7 runtime.
  **Workaround**: Explicitly set the preference at the start of the runbook as following -
  ```
      $VerbosePreference = "Continue"

      $ProgressPreference = "Continue"
  ```
- Avoid importing `Az.Accounts` module to version 2.4.0 version for PowerShell 7 runtime as there can be an unexpected behavior using this version in Azure Automation.
- You might encounter formatting problems with error output streams for the job running in PowerShell 7 runtime.
- When you import a PowerShell 7.1 module that's dependent on other modules, you may find that the import button is gray even when PowerShell 7.1 version of the dependent module is installed. For example, Az PowerShell module.Compute version 4.20.0, has a dependency on Az.Accounts being >= 2.6.0. This issue occurs when an equivalent dependent module in PowerShell 5.1 doesn't meet the version requirements. For example, 5.1 version of Az.Accounts were < 2.6.0.
- When you start PowerShell 7 runbook using the webhook, it auto-converts the webhook input parameter to an invalid JSON.
- We recommend that you use [ExchangeOnlineManagement](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true) module version: 3.0.0 or lower because version: 3.0.0 or higher may lead to job failures.
- If you import module Az.Accounts with version 2.12.3 or newer, ensure that you import the **Newtonsoft.Json** v10 module explicitly if PowerShell 7.1 runbooks have a dependency on this version of the module. The workaround for this issue is to use PowerShell 7.2 runbooks.
- When you utilize the `New-AzAutomationVariable`  cmdlet within Az.Automation Module to upload a variable of type **object**, the operation doesn't function as expected.  

  **Workaround**: Convert the object to a JSON string using the ConvertTo-Json cmdlet and then upload the variable with the JSON string as its value. This workaround ensures proper handling of the variable within the Azure Automation environment as a JSON string. 

  **Example** - Create a PowerShell object that has stored information around Azure VMs 

  ```azurepowershell
    # Retrieve Azure virtual machines with status information for the 'northeurope' region 
    $AzVM = Get-AzVM -Status | Where-Object {$_.Location -eq "northeurope"} 
    
    $VMstopatch = @($AzVM).Id 
    # Create an Azure Automation variable (This cmdlet will not fail, but the variable may not work as intended when used in the runbook.) 
    New-AzAutomationVariable -ResourceGroupName "mrg" -AutomationAccountName "mAutomationAccount2" -Name "complex1" -Encrypted $false -Value $VMstopatch 
    
    # Convert the object to a JSON string 
    $jsonString = $VMstopatch | ConvertTo-Json 
    
    # Create an Azure Automation variable with a JSON string value (works effectively within the automation runbook) 
    New-AzAutomationVariable -ResourceGroupName "mrg" -AutomationAccountName "mAutomationAccount2" -Name "complex1" -Encrypted $false -Value $jsonString 
  ```

## PowerShell Workflow runbooks

PowerShell Workflow runbooks are text runbooks based on [Windows PowerShell Workflow](automation-powershell-workflow.md). You directly edit the code of the runbook using the text editor in the Azure portal. You can also use any offline text editor and [import the runbook](manage-runbooks.md) into Azure Automation.

> [!NOTE]
> PowerShell 7.1 (preview) and PowerShell 7.2  do not support Workflow runbooks.

### Advantages

* Implement all complex logic with PowerShell Workflow code.
* Use [checkpoints](automation-powershell-workflow.md#use-checkpoints-in-a-workflow) to resume operation if there's an error.
* Use [parallel processing](automation-powershell-workflow.md#use-parallel-processing) to do multiple actions in parallel.
* Can include other graphical runbooks and PowerShell Workflow runbooks as child runbooks to create high-level workflows.

### Limitations

* PowerShell workflow isn't supported in PowerShell 7+ versions. Hence, the outdated runbooks can't be upgraded.
* Inefficient handling of parallel execution compared to newer PowerShell 7+ versions.
* PowerShell Workflow internally works using multiple processes. Hence, modules available in one process may not be available in another and cause exceptions like *command not found*.
* Runbooks must deal with the additional complexity of PowerShell Workflow, such as [deserialized objects](automation-powershell-workflow.md#deserialized-objects).
* Runbooks take longer to start than PowerShell runbooks since they must be compiled before running.
* You can only include PowerShell runbooks as child runbooks by using the `Start-AzAutomationRunbook` cmdlet.
* Runbooks can't run on a Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker.

## Python runbooks

Python runbooks compile under Python 2.7(GA), Python 3.8 (GA) and Python 3.10 (preview). You can directly edit the code of the runbook using the text editor in the Azure portal. You can also use an offline text editor and [import the runbook](manage-runbooks.md) into Azure Automation.

Currently, Python 3.10 (preview) runtime version is supported for both Cloud and Hybrid jobs in all Public regions except Australia Central2, Korea South, Sweden South, Jio India Central, Brazil SouthEast, Central India, West India, UAE Central, and Gov clouds.

### Advantages

> [!NOTE]
> Importing a Python package may take several minutes.

- Uses the robust Python libraries.
- Can run in Azure or on Hybrid Runbook Workers.
- For Python 2.7, Windows Hybrid Runbook Workers are supported with [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/) installed.
- For Python 3.8 Cloud Jobs, Python 3.8 version is supported. Scripts and packages from any 3.x version might work if the code is compatible across different versions.
- For Python 3.8 Hybrid jobs on Windows machines, you can choose to install any 3.x version you may want to use.
- For Python 3.8 Hybrid jobs on Linux machines, we depend on the Python 3 version installed on the machine to run DSC OMSConfig and the Linux Hybrid Worker. Different versions should work if there are no breaking changes in method signatures or contracts between versions of Python 3.


### Limitations

Following are the limitations of Python runbooks

# [Python 3.10 (preview)](#tab/py10)

- For Python 3.10 (preview) modules, currently, only the wheel files targeting cp310 Linux OS are supported. [Learn more](./python-3-packages.md)
- Source control integration isn't supported.
- Custom packages for Python 3.10 (preview) are only validated during job runtime. Job is expected to fail if the package is not compatible in the runtime or if required dependencies of packages aren't imported into automation account.
- Currently, Python 3.10 (preview) runbooks are only supported from Azure portal. Rest API and PowerShell aren't supported.

# [Python 3.8 (GA)](#tab/py38)

- You must be familiar with Python scripting.
- Source control integration isn't supported.
- For Python 3.8 modules, use wheel files targeting cp38-amd64.
- To use third-party libraries, you must [import the packages](python-packages.md) into the Automation account.
- Using **Start-AutomationRunbook** cmdlet in PowerShell/PowerShell Workflow to start a Python 3.8 runbook doesn't work. You can use **Start-AzAutomationRunbook** cmdlet from Az.Automation module or **Start-AzureRmAutomationRunbook** cmdlet from AzureRm.Automation module to work around this limitation. 
- Azure Automation doesn't support **sys.stderr**.
- The Python **automationassets** package isn't available on pypi.org, so it's not available for import onto a Windows machine.

# [Python 2.7](#tab/py27)

- [Python 2.7](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) is no longer supported by parent product Python. We recommend you to create new runbooks in the supported versions and update the outdated runbooks.
- You must be familiar with Python scripting.
- For Python 2.7.12 modules, use wheel files cp27-amd6.
- To use third-party libraries, you must [import the packages](python-packages.md) into the Automation account.
- Azure Automation doesn't support **sys.stderr**.
- The Python **automationassets** package isn't available on pypi.org, so it's not available for import onto a Windows machine.

---

### Multiple Python versions

It's applicable for Windows Hybrid workers. For a Windows Runbook Worker, when running a Python 2 runbook it looks for the environment variable `PYTHON_2_PATH` first and validates whether it points to a valid executable file. For example, if the installation folder is `C:\Python2`, it would check if `C:\Python2\python.exe` is a valid path. If not found, then it looks for the `PATH` environment variable to do a similar check.

For Python 3, it looks for the `PYTHON_3_PATH` env variable first and then falls back to the `PATH` environment variable.

When using only one version of Python, you can add the installation path to the `PATH` variable. If you want to use both versions on the Runbook Worker, set `PYTHON_2_PATH` and `PYTHON_3_PATH` to the location of the module for those versions.

### Known issues

For cloud jobs, Python 3.8 jobs sometimes fail with an exception message `invalid interpreter executable path`. You might see this exception if the job is delayed, starting more than 10 minutes, or using **Start-AutomationRunbook** to start Python 3.8 runbooks. If the job is delayed, restarting the runbook should be sufficient.

## Graphical runbooks

You can create and edit graphical and graphical PowerShell Workflow runbooks using the graphical editor in the Azure portal. However, you can't create or edit this type of runbook with another tool. Main features of graphical runbooks:

* Exported to files in your Automation account and then imported into another Automation account.
* Generate PowerShell code.
* Converted to or from graphical PowerShell Workflow runbooks during import.

### Advantages

* Use visual insert-link-configure authoring model.
* Focus on how data flows through the process.
* Visually represent management processes.
* Include other runbooks as child runbooks to create high-level workflows.
* Encourage modular programming.

### Limitations

* Can't create or edit outside the Azure portal.
* Might require a code activity containing PowerShell code to execute complex logic.
* Can't convert to one of the [text formats](automation-runbook-types.md), nor can you convert a text runbook to graphical format.
* Can't view or directly edit PowerShell code that the graphical workflow creates. You can view the code you create in any code activities.
* Can't run runbooks on a Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker. See [Automate resources in your datacenter or cloud by using Hybrid Runbook Worker](automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md).
* Graphical runbooks can't be digitally signed.
