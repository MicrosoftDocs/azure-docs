Customers can manage and secure encryption of Azure Automation assets using their own managed keys. With the introduction of customer-managed keys, you can supplement default encryption with an extra encryption layer using keys that you create and manage in Azure Key Vault. This additional level of encryption should help you meet your organizationâ€™s regulatory or compliance needs.

For more information, see [Use of customer-managed keys](automation-secure-asset-encryption.md#use-of-customer-managed-keys-for-an-automation-account).

## June 2021

### Security update for Log Analytics Contributor role

**Type:** Plan for change

Microsoft intends to remove the Automation account rights from the Log Analytics Contributor role. Currently, the built-in [Log Analytics Contributor](./automation-role-based-access-control.md#log-analytics-contributor) role can escalate privileges to the subscription [Contributor](./../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) role. Since Automation account Run As accounts are initially configured with Contributor rights on the subscription, it can be used by an attacker to create new runbooks and execute code as a Contributor on theâ€¯subscription.

As a result of this security risk, we recommend you don't use the Log Analytics Contributor role to execute Automation jobs. Instead, create the Azure Automation Contributor custom role and use it for actions related to the Automation account.

### Support for Automation and State Configuration available in West US 3

**Type:** New feature

For more information, see [Data residency in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/data-residency/) and select your geography from the drop-down list.

## April 2021

### Support for Update Management and Change Tracking

**Type:** New feature

Region mapping has been updated to support Update Management and Change Tracking in Norway East, UAE North, North Central US, Brazil South, and Korea Central. For more information, see [Supported mappings](./how-to/region-mappings.md#supported-mappings-for-log-analytics-and-azure-automation).

### Support for system-assigned Managed Identities

**Type:** New feature

Azure Automation now supports [system-assigned managed identities](./automation-security-overview.md#managed-identities) for cloud and hybrid jobs in Azure global and Azure Government regions. Read the [announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-automation-system-assigned-managed-identities/) for more information.
