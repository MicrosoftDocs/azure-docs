# Query logs from Start/Stop VMs during off-hours

Azure Automation forwards two types of records to the linked Log Analytics workspace: job logs and job streams. This article reviews the  data available for [query](../azure-monitor/log-query/log-query-overview.md) in Azure Monitor.

## Job logs

|Property | Description|
|----------|----------|
|Caller |  Who initiated the operation. Possible values are either an email address or system for scheduled jobs.|
|Category | Classification of the type of data. For Automation, the value is JobLogs.|
|CorrelationId | GUID that is the Correlation ID of the runbook job.|
|JobId | GUID that is the ID of the runbook job.|
|operationName | Specifies the type of operation performed in Azure. For Automation, the value is Job.|
|resourceId | Specifies the resource type in Azure. For Automation, the value is the Automation account associated with the runbook.|
|ResourceGroup | Specifies the resource group  name of the runbook job.|
|ResourceProvider | Specifies the Azure service that supplies the resources you can deploy and manage. For Automation, the value is Azure Automation.|
|ResourceType | Specifies the resource type in Azure. For Automation, the value is the Automation account associated with the runbook.|
|resultType | The status of the runbook job. Possible values are:<br>- Started<br>- Stopped<br>- Suspended<br>- Failed<br>- Succeeded|
|resultDescription | Describes the runbook job result state. Possible values are:<br>- Job is started<br>- Job Failed<br>- Job Completed|
|RunbookName | Specifies the name of the runbook.|
|SourceSystem | Specifies the source system for the data submitted. For Automation, the value is OpsManager|
|StreamType | Specifies the type of event. Possible values are:<br>- Verbose<br>- Output<br>- Error<br>- Warning|
|SubscriptionId | Specifies the subscription ID of the job.
|Time | Date and time when the runbook job executed.|

## Job streams

|Property | Description|
|----------|----------|
|Caller |  Who initiated the operation. Possible values are either an email address or system for scheduled jobs.|
|Category | Classification of the type of data. For Automation, the value is JobStreams.|
|JobId | GUID that is the ID of the runbook job.|
|operationName | Specifies the type of operation performed in Azure. For Automation, the value is Job.|
|ResourceGroup | Specifies the resource group  name of the runbook job.|
|resourceId | Specifies the resource ID in Azure. For Automation, the value is the Automation account associated with the runbook.|
|ResourceProvider | Specifies the Azure service that supplies the resources you can deploy and manage. For Automation, the value is Azure Automation.|
|ResourceType | Specifies the resource type in Azure. For Automation, the value is the Automation account associated with the runbook.|
|resultType | The result of the runbook job at the time the event was generated. A possible value is:<br>- InProgress|
|resultDescription | Includes the output stream from the runbook.|
|RunbookName | The name of the runbook.|
|SourceSystem | Specifies the source system for the data submitted. For Automation, the value is OpsManager.|
|StreamType | The type of job stream. Possible values are:<br>- Progress<br>- Output<br>- Warning<br>- Error<br>- Debug<br>- Verbose|
|Time | Date and time when the runbook job executed.|

When you perform any log search that returns category records of **JobLogs** or **JobStreams**, you can select the **JobLogs** or **JobStreams** view, which displays a set of tiles summarizing the updates returned by the search.

## Sample log searches

The following table provides sample log searches for job records collected by Start/Stop VMs during off-hours.

|Query | Description|
|----------|----------|
|Find jobs for runbook ScheduledStartStop_Parent that have finished successfully | <code>search Category == "JobLogs" <br>&#124;  where ( RunbookName_s == "ScheduledStartStop_Parent" ) <br>&#124;  where ( ResultType == "Completed" )  <br>&#124;  summarize AggregatedValue = count() by ResultType, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h) <br>&#124;  sort by TimeGenerated desc</code>|
|Find jobs for runbook ScheduledStartStop_Parent that have not completed successfully | <code>search Category == "JobLogs" <br>&#124;  where ( RunbookName_s == "ScheduledStartStop_Parent" ) <br>&#124;  where ( ResultType == "Failed" )  <br>&#124;  summarize AggregatedValue = count() by ResultType, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h) <br>&#124;  sort by TimeGenerated desc</code>|
|Find jobs for runbook SequencedStartStop_Parent that have finished successfully | <code>search Category == "JobLogs" <br>&#124;  where ( RunbookName_s == "SequencedStartStop_Parent" ) <br>&#124;  where ( ResultType == "Completed" ) <br>&#124;  summarize AggregatedValue = count() by ResultType, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h) <br>&#124;  sort by TimeGenerated desc</code>|
|Find jobs for runbook SequencedStartStop_Parent that have not completed successfully | <code>search Category == "JobLogs" <br>&#124;  where ( RunbookName_s == "SequencedStartStop_Parent" ) <br>&#124;  where ( ResultType == "Failed" ) <br>&#124;  summarize AggregatedValue = count() by ResultType, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h) <br>&#124;  sort by TimeGenerated desc</code>|
