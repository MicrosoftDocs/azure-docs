# Deploy an extension-based Windows or Linux User Hybrid Runbook Worker in Azure Automation

The extension-based onboarding is only for **User** Hybrid Runbook Workers. This article describes how to: deploy a user Hybrid Runbook Worker on a Windows or Linux machine, remove the worker, and remove a Hybrid Runbook Worker group. 

For **System** Hybrid Runbook Worker onboarding, see [Deploy an agent-based Windows Hybrid Runbook Worker in Automation](./automation-windows-hrw-install.md) or [Deploy an agent-based Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker in Automation](./automation-linux-hrw-install.md). 


You can use the user Hybrid Runbook Worker feature of Azure Automation to run runbooks directly on an Azure or non-Azure machine, including [Azure Arc-enabled servers](/azure/azure-arc/servers/overview), [Arc-enabled VMware vSphere](/azure/azure-arc/vmware-vsphere/overview), and [Arc-enabled SCVMM](/azure/azure-arc/system-center-virtual-machine-manager/overview). From the machine or server that's hosting the role, you can run runbooks directly against it and against resources in the environment to manage those local resources.
Azure Automation stores and manages runbooks and then delivers them to one or more chosen machines. After you successfully deploy a runbook worker, review [Run runbooks on a Hybrid Runbook Worker](automation-hrw-run-runbooks.md) to learn how to configure your runbooks to automate processes in your on-premises datacenter or other cloud environment.


> [!NOTE]
> A hybrid worker can co-exist with both platforms: **Agent based (V1)** and **Extension based (V2)**. If you install Extension based (V2) on a hybrid worker already running Agent based (V1), then you would see two entries of the Hybrid Runbook Worker in the group. One with Platform Extension based (V2) and the other Agent based (V1). [**Learn more**](#migrate-an-existing-agent-based-to-extension-based-hybrid-workers).

## Prerequisites

### Machine minimum requirements

- Two cores
- 4 GB of RAM
- **Non-Azure machines** must have the [Azure Connected Machine agent](/azure/azure-arc/servers/agent-overview) installed. To install the `AzureConnectedMachineAgent`, see [Connect hybrid machines to Azure from the Azure portal](/azure/azure-arc/servers/onboard-portal) for Arc-enabled servers. See [Install Arc agent for Arc-enabled VMware VMs](/azure/azure-arc/vmware-vsphere/enable-guest-management-at-scale) to enable guest management for Arc-enabled VMware vSphere VMs and install [Arc agent for Arc-enabled SCVMM](/azure/azure-arc/system-center-virtual-machine-manager/enable-guest-management-at-scale) to enable guest management for Arc-enabled SCVMM VMs.
- The system-assigned managed identity must be enabled on the Azure virtual machine, Arc-enabled server, Arc-enabled VMware vSphere VM or Arc-enabled SCVMM VM.  If the system-assigned managed identity isn't enabled, it will be enabled as part of the adding process.
 
### Supported operating systems

### Other Requirements

| Windows (x64)  | Linux (x64) |
|---|---|
| Windows PowerShell 5.1 (download WMF 5.1). PowerShell Core isn't supported.| Linux Hardening must not be enabled.  |
| .NET Framework 4.6.2 or later. |            |

### Package requirements for Linux

| Required package | Description | Minimum version |
|--------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Glibc |GNU C Library | 2.5-12 |
| Openssl | OpenSSL Libraries | 1.0 (TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 are supported) |

> [!NOTE]
> - Hybrid Runbook Worker is currently not supported for Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS).
> 
> - We strongly recommend that you never configure Hybrid Worker extension on a Virtual machine hosting domain controller. Security best practices don't advise such a setup due to the high-risk nature of exposing domain controllers to potential attack vectors via Azure Automation jobs. Domain controllers should be highly secured and isolated from non-essential services to prevent unauthorized access and maintain the integrity of the Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) environment.


### Permissions for Hybrid worker credentials

If extension-based Hybrid Worker is using custom Hybrid Worker credentials, then ensure that following folder permissions are assigned to the custom user to avoid jobs from getting suspended.

| **Resource Type**  | **Folder permissions** |
|---|---|
|Azure VM | C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.Automation.HybridWorker.HybridWorkerForWindows (read and execute)|
| Arc-enabled Server | C:\ProgramData\AzureConnectedMachineAgent\Tokens (read) </br> C:\Packages\Plugins\Microsoft.Azure.Automation.HybridWorker.HybridWorkerForWindows (read and execute).

> [!NOTE]
> When a system has UAC/LUA in place, permissions must be granted directly and not through any group membership. [Learn more](troubleshoot/extension-based-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#scenario-runbooks-go-into-a-suspended-state-on-a-hybrid-runbook-worker-when-using-a-custom-account-on-a-server-with-user-account-control-uac-enabled).



## Network requirements

### Proxy server use

If you use a proxy server for communication between Azure Automation and machines running the extension-base Hybrid Runbook Worker, ensure that the appropriate resources are accessible. The timeout for requests from the Hybrid Runbook Worker and Automation services is 30 seconds. After three attempts, a request fails.

> [!NOTE]
> For Azure VMs and Arc-enabled Servers, you can set up the proxy settings using PowerShell cmdlets or API. This is currently not supported for Arc-enabled VMware vSphere VMs. 

 To install the extension using cmdlets:
 
1. Get the automation account details using the below API call.

   ```http
   GET https://westcentralus.management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/{automationAccountName}?api-version=2021-06-22

   ```

   The API call will provide the value with the key: `AutomationHybridServiceUrl`. Use the URL in the next step to enable extension on the VM.

1. Install the Hybrid Worker Extension on the VM by running the following PowerShell cmdlet (Required module: Az.Compute). Use the `properties.automationHybridServiceUrl` provided by the above API call  
  

**Proxy server settings**
# [Windows](#tab/windows)

```azurepowershell-interactive
$settings = @{
    "AutomationAccountURL"  = "<registrationurl>";    
    "ProxySettings" = @{
        "ProxyServer" = "<ipaddress>:<port>";
        "UserName"="test";
    }
};
$protectedsettings = @{
"ProxyPassword" = "password";
};
```
**Azure VMs**

```powershell
Set-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName <VMResourceGroupName> -Location <VMLocation> -VMName <VMName> -Name "HybridWorkerExtension" -Publisher "Microsoft.Azure.Automation.HybridWorker" -ExtensionType HybridWorkerForWindows -TypeHandlerVersion 1.1 -Settings $settings -ProtectedSettings $protectedsettings -EnableAutomaticUpgrade $true/$false
```

### Firewall use

If you use a firewall to restrict access to the Internet, you must configure the firewall to permit access. The following port and URLs are required for the Hybrid Runbook Worker, and for [Automation State Configuration](./automation-dsc-overview.md) to communicate with Azure Automation.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Port | 443 for outbound internet access |
| Global URL | *.azure-automation.net |
| Global URL of US Gov Virginia | *.azure-automation.us |

### CPU quota limit

There is a CPU quota limit of 25% while configuring extension-based Linux Hybrid Runbook worker. There is no such limit for Windows Hybrid Runbook Worker.

## Create hybrid worker group

To create a hybrid worker group in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Go to your Automation account.

1. Under **Process Automation**, select **Hybrid worker groups**.

1. Select **+ Create hybrid worker group**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/extension-based-hybrid-runbook-worker-install/hybrid-worker-groups-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing to select hybrid Worker Groups option in portal.":::

1. From the **Basics** tab, in the **Name** text box, enter a name for your Hybrid worker group.

1. For the **Use Hybrid Worker Credentials** option:

   - If you select **Default**, the hybrid extension will be installed using the local system account.
   - If you select **Custom**, then from the drop-down list, select the credential asset.

1. Select **Next** to advance to the **Hybrid workers** tab. You can select Azure virtual machines, Azure Arc-enabled servers,  Azure Arc-enabled VMware vSphere and Arc-enabled SCVMM to be added to this Hybrid worker group. If you don't select any machines, an empty Hybrid worker group will be created. You can still add machines later.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/extension-based-hybrid-runbook-worker-install/basics-tab-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing to enter name and credentials in basics tab.":::

1. Select **Add machines** to go to the **Add machines as hybrid worker** page. You'll only see machines that aren't part of any other hybrid worker group.

1. Select the checkbox next to the machine(s) you want to add to the hybrid worker group. If you don't see your non-Azure machine listed, ensure Azure Arc Connected Machine agent is installed on the machine.

1. Select **Add**.

1. Select **Next** to advance to the **Review + Create** tab.

1. Select **Create**.

    The hybrid worker extension installs on the machine and the hybrid worker gets registered to the hybrid worker group. Adding a hybrid worker to the group happens immediately, while installation of the extension might take a few minutes. Select **Refresh** to see the new group. Select the group name to view the hybrid worker details.

   > [!NOTE]
   > A selected machine won't be added to a hybrid worker group if it is already part of another hybrid worker group.

## Add a machine to a hybrid worker group

You can also add machines to an existing hybrid worker group.

1. Under **Process Automation**, select **Hybrid worker groups** and then your existing hybrid worker group to go to the **Hybrid Worker Group** page.

1. Under **Hybrid worker group**, select **Hybrid Workers**.

1. Select **+ Add** to go to the **Add machines as hybrid worker** page. You'll only see machines that aren't part of any other hybrid worker group. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/extension-based-hybrid-runbook-worker-install/hybrid-worker-group-add-machine.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Add button to add machines to existing group.":::

1. Select the checkbox next to the machine(s) you want to add to the hybrid worker group. 

   If you don't see your non-Azure machine listed, ensure Azure Arc Connected Machine agent is installed on the machine. To install the `AzureConnectedMachineAgent` see [Connect hybrid machines to Azure from the Azure portal](/azure/azure-arc/servers/onboard-portal) for Arc-enabled servers. See [Install Arc agent for Arc-enabled VMs](/azure/azure-arc/vmware-vsphere/enable-guest-management-at-scale) to enable guest management for Arc-enabled VMware vSphere and [Install Arc agent for Arc-enabled SCVMM](/azure/azure-arc/system-center-virtual-machine-manager/enable-guest-management-at-scale) to enable guest management for Arc-enabled SCVMM VMs.

1. Select **Add** to add the machine to the group.

   After adding, you can see the machine type as Azure virtual machine, Machine – Azure Arc , Machine – Azure Arc (VMware) or Machine – Azure Arc SCVMM. The **Platform** field shows the worker as **Agent based (V1)** or **Extension based (V2)**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/extension-based-hybrid-runbook-worker-install/hybrid-worker-group-platform-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot of platform field showing agent or extension based." lightbox="./media/extension-based-hybrid-runbook-worker-install/hybrid-worker-group-platform-expanded.png":::

## Migrate an existing Agent based to Extension based Hybrid Workers

To utilize the benefits of extension based Hybrid Workers, you must migrate all existing agent based User Hybrid Workers to extension based Workers. A hybrid worker machine can co-exist on both **Agent based (V1)** and **Extension based (V2)** platforms. The extension based installation doesn't affect the installation or management of an agent based Worker.

To install Hybrid worker extension on an existing agent based hybrid worker, ensure the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) are fulfilled before following these steps:

1. Under **Process Automation**, select **Hybrid worker groups**, and then select your existing hybrid worker group to go to the **Hybrid worker group** page.
1. Under **Hybrid worker group**, select **Hybrid Workers** > **+ Add** to go to the **Add machines as hybrid worker** page.
1. Select the checkbox next to the existing Agent based (V1) Hybrid worker.
1. Select **Add** to append the machine to the group.

The Platform column shows the same Hybrid worker as both **Agent based (V1)** and **Extension based (V2)**. After you're confident of the extension based Hybrid Worker experience and use, you can remove the agent based Worker. 
   
For at-scale migration of multiple Agent based Hybrid Workers, you can also use other [channels](#manage-hybrid-worker-extension-using-bicep--arm-templates-rest-api-azure-cli-and-powershell) such as - Bicep, ARM templates, PowerShell cmdlets, REST API, and Azure CLI.


## Delete a Hybrid Runbook Worker

You can delete the Hybrid Runbook Worker from the portal.

1. Under **Process Automation**, select **Hybrid worker groups** and then your hybrid worker group to go to the **Hybrid Worker Group** page.

1. Under **Hybrid worker group**, select **Hybrid Workers**.

1. Select the checkbox next to the machine(s) you want to delete from the hybrid worker group.

1. Select **Delete**.

   You'll be presented with a warning in a dialog box **Delete Hybrid worker** that the selected hybrid worker would be deleted permanently. Select **Delete**. This operation will delete the extension for the **Extension based (V2)** worker or remove the **Agent based (V1)** entry from the portal. However, it leaves the stale hybrid worker on the VM. To manually uninstall the agent, see [Uninstall agent](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agent-manage#uninstall-agent).

   :::image type="content" source="./media/extension-based-hybrid-runbook-worker-install/delete-machine-from-group.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing to delete virtual machine from existing group.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > - A hybrid worker can co-exist with both platforms: **Agent based (V1)** and **Extension based (V2)**. If you install **Extension based (V2)** on a hybrid worker already running **Agent based (V1)**, then you would see two entries of the Hybrid Runbook Worker in the group. One with Platform **Extension based (V2)** and the other **Agent based (V1)**. </br> </br>
   > - After you disable the Private Link in your Automation account, it might take up to 60 minutes to remove the Hybrid Runbook worker.
   > - Hybrid Runbook Worker proxy settings can be deleted from  HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Azure\HybridWorker\Parameters, "Http Connection Proxy Url".

## Delete a Hybrid Runbook Worker group

You can delete an empty Hybrid Runbook Worker group from the portal.

1. Under **Process Automation**, select **Hybrid worker groups** and then your hybrid worker group to go to the **Hybrid Worker Group** page.

1. Select **Delete**.

   A warning message appears to remove any machines that are defined as hybrid workers in the hybrid worker group. If there's already a worker added to the group, you'll first have to delete the worker from the group.

1. Select **Yes**.

   The hybrid worker group will be deleted.


## Automatic upgrade of extension

Hybrid Worker extension supports [Automatic upgrade](/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-extension-upgrade) of minor versions by default. We recommend that you enable Automatic upgrades to take advantage of any security or feature updates without manual overhead. However, to prevent the extension from automatically upgrading (for example, if there is a strict change windows and can only be updated at specific time), you can opt out of this feature by setting the `enableAutomaticUpgrade`property in ARM, Bicep template, PowerShell cmdlets to *false*. Set the same property to *true* whenever you want to re-enable the Automatic upgrade.

```powershell
$extensionType = "HybridWorkerForLinux/HybridWorkerForWindows"
$extensionName = "HybridWorkerExtension"
$publisher = "Microsoft.Azure.Automation.HybridWorker"
Set-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName <RGName> -Location <Location>  -VMName <vmName> -Name $extensionName -Publisher $publisher -ExtensionType $extensionType -TypeHandlerVersion 1.1 -Settings $settings -EnableAutomaticUpgrade $true/$false
```
Major version upgrades must be managed manually. Run the below cmdlets with the latest TypeHandlerVersion.

> [!NOTE]
> If you had installed the Hybrid Worker extension during the public preview, ensure to upgrade it to the latest major version.

**Azure VMs**

```powershell
Set-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName <VMResourceGroupName> -Location <VMLocation> -VMName <VMName> -Name "HybridWorkerExtension" -Publisher "Microsoft.Azure.Automation.HybridWorker" -ExtensionType HybridWorkerForWindows -TypeHandlerVersion 1.1 -Settings $settings -EnableAutomaticUpgrade $true/$false
```
**Azure Arc-enabled VMs**

```powershell
New-AzConnectedMachineExtension -ResourceGroupName <VMResourceGroupName> -Location <VMLocation> -MachineName <VMName> -Name "HybridWorkerExtension" -Publisher "Microsoft.Azure.Automation.HybridWorker" -ExtensionType HybridWorkerForWindows -TypeHandlerVersion 1.1 -Setting $settings -NoWait -EnableAutomaticUpgrade
```


## Manage Hybrid Worker extension using Bicep & ARM templates, REST API, Azure CLI, and PowerShell

#### [Bicep template](#tab/bicep-template)

You can use the Bicep template to create a new Hybrid Worker group, create a new Azure Windows VM and add it to an existing Hybrid Worker Group. Learn more about [Bicep](../azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview.md).

Follow the steps mentioned below as an example:

1. Create a Hybrid Worker Group.
1. Create either an Azure VM or Arc-enabled server. Alternatively, you can also use an existing Azure VM or Arc-enabled server.
1. Connect the Azure VM or Arc-enabled server to the above created Hybrid Worker Group. 
1. Generate a new GUID and pass it as the name of the Hybrid Worker.
1. Enable System-assigned managed identity on the VM.
1. Install Hybrid Worker Extension on the VM.
1. To confirm if the extension has been successfully installed on the VM, in **Azure portal**, go to the VM > **Extensions** tab and check the status of the Hybrid Worker extension installed on the VM.

You can use an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to create a new Azure Windows VM and connect it to an existing Automation account and Hybrid Worker Group. To learn more about ARM templates, see [What are ARM templates?](../azure-resource-manager/templates/overview.md)

Follow the steps mentioned below as an example:

1. Create a Hybrid Worker Group.
1. Create either an Azure VM or Arc-enabled server. Alternatively, you can also use an existing Azure VM or Arc-enabled server.
1. Connect the Azure VM or Arc-enabled server to the above created Hybrid Worker Group. 
1. Generate a new GUID and pass it as the name of the Hybrid Worker.
1. Enable System-assigned managed identity on the VM.
1. Install Hybrid Worker Extension on the VM.
1. To confirm if the extension has been successfully installed on the VM, in **Azure portal**, go to the VM > **Extensions** tab and check the status of the Hybrid Worker extension installed on the VM.

#### [REST API](#tab/rest-api)

**Prerequisites**

You would require an Azure VM or Arc-enabled server. You can follow the steps [here](/azure/azure-arc/servers/onboard-portal) to create an Arc connected machine.

**Install and use Hybrid Worker extension**

To install and use Hybrid Worker extension using REST API, follow these steps. The West Central US region is considered in this example.

1. Create a Hybrid Worker Group by making this API call.

   ```http
   PUT https://westcentralus.management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/{automationAccountName}/hybridRunbookWorkerGroups/{hybridRunbookWorkerGroupName}?api-version=2021-06-22

   ```

   The request body should contain the following information:

   ```http
   {
   }
   ```

   Response of _PUT_ confirms if the Hybrid worker group is created or not. To reconfirm, you have to make another GET call on Hybrid worker group as follows:

   ```http
   GET https://westcentralus.management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/{automationAccountName}/hybridRunbookWorkerGroups/{hybridRunbookWorkerGroupName}?api-version=2021-06-22

   ```

1. Connect a VM to the above created Hybrid Worker Group by making the below API call. Before making the call, generate a new GUID to be used as _hybridRunbookWorkerId_.

   ```http
   PUT https://westcentralus.management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/{automationAccountName}/hybridRunbookWorkerGroups/{hybridRunbookWorkerGroupName}/hybridRunbookWorkers/{hybridRunbookWorkerId}?api-version=2021-06-22

   ```

   The request body should contain the following information:

   ```json
   {
   "properties": {"vmResourceId": "{VmResourceId}"}
   }
   ```

   Response of PUT call confirms if the Hybrid worker is created or not. To reconfirm, you would have to make another GET call on Hybrid worker as follows.

   ```http
   GET https://westcentralus.management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/{automationAccountName}/hybridRunbookWorkerGroups/{hybridRunbookWorkerGroupName}/hybridRunbookWorkers/{hybridRunbookWorkerId}?api-version=2021-06-22

   ```
    
1. Follow the steps [here](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm.md#enable-system-assigned-managed-identity-on-an-existing-vm) to enable the System-assigned managed identity on the VM.

1. Get the automation account details using this API call.

   ```http
   GET https://westcentralus.management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/HybridWorkerExtension?api-version=2021-06-22

   ```

   The API call will provide the value with the key: `AutomationHybridServiceUrl`. Use the URL in the next step to enable extension on the VM.

1. Install the Hybrid Worker Extension on Azure VM by using the following API call. 
  
    ```http
    PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vmName}/extensions/HybridWorkerExtension?api-version=2021-11-01

    ```
   
   The request body should contain the following information:

    ```json
    {
    "location": "<VMLocation>",
    "properties": {
    "publisher": "Microsoft.Azure.Automation.HybridWorker",
    "type": "<HybridWorkerForWindows/HybridWorkerForLinux>",
    "typeHandlerVersion": <version>,
    "settings": {
      "AutomationAccountURL" = "<AutomationHybridServiceUrl>"
      }
     }
    }

    ```
   
   For ARC VMs, use the below API call for enabling the extension:

    ```http
    PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/{machineName}/extensions/{extensionName}?api-version=2021-05-20

    ```
      
   The request body should contain the following information:

    ```json
    {
    "location": "<VMLocation>",
    "properties": {
    "publisher": "Microsoft.Azure.Automation.HybridWorker",
    "type": "<HybridWorkerForWindows/HybridWorkerForLinux>",
    "typeHandlerVersion": <version>,
    "settings": {
      "AutomationAccountURL" = "<AutomationHybridServiceUrl>"
      }
     }
    }
    ```
   Response of the *PUT* call will confirm if the extension is successfully installed or not on the targeted VM. You can also go to the VM in the Azure portal, and check status of extensions installed on the target VM under **Extensions** tab.

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

You can use Azure CLI to create a new Hybrid Worker group, create a new Azure VM, add it to an existing Hybrid Worker Group and install the Hybrid Worker extension. Learn more about [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli).

Follow the steps mentioned below as an example:

1. Create a Hybrid Worker Group.
   ```azurecli-interactive
      az automation hrwg create --automation-account-name accountName --resource-group groupName --name hybridrunbookworkergroupName
   ```
1. Create an Azure VM or Arc-enabled server and add it to the above created Hybrid Worker Group. Use the below command to add an existing Azure VM or Arc-enabled Server to the Hybrid Worker Group. Generate a new GUID and pass it as `hybridRunbookWorkerGroupName`. To fetch `vmResourceId`, go to the **Properties** tab of the VM on Azure portal.

   ```azurecli-interactive
    az automation hrwg hrw create --automation-account-name accountName --resource-group groupName --hybrid-runbook-worker-group-name hybridRunbookWorkerGroupName --hybrid-runbook-worker-id
   ```
1. Follow the steps [here](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm.md#enable-system-assigned-managed-identity-on-an-existing-vm) to enable the System-assigned managed identity on the VM.
1. Install Hybrid Worker Extension on the VM

   ```azurecli-interactive
       az vm extension set --name HybridWorkerExtension --publisher Microsoft.Azure.Automation.HybridWorker --version 1.1 --vm-name <vmname> -g <resourceGroupName> \ 
      --settings '{"AutomationAccountURL" = "<registration-url>";}' --enable-auto-upgrade true 
   ```
1. To confirm if the extension has been successfully installed on the VM, in **Azure portal**, go to the VM > **Extensions** tab and check the status of the Hybrid Worker extension installed on the VM.

**Manage Hybrid Worker Extension**

- To create, delete, and manage extension-based Hybrid Runbook Worker groups, see [az automation hrwg | Microsoft Docs](/cli/azure/automation/hrwg)
- To create, delete, and manage extension-based Hybrid Runbook Worker, see [az automation hrwg hrw | Microsoft Docs](/cli/azure/automation/hrwg/hrw)

After creating new Hybrid Runbook Worker, you must install the extension on the Hybrid Worker using [az vm extension set](/cli/azure/vm/extension#az-vm-extension-set).


#### [PowerShell](#tab/ps)

You can use PowerShell cmdlets to create a new Hybrid Worker group, create a new Azure VM, add it to an existing Hybrid Worker Group and install the Hybrid Worker extension.

Follow the steps mentioned below as an example:

1. Create a Hybrid Worker Group.

   ```powershell-interactive
       New-AzAutomationHybridRunbookWorkerGroup -AutomationAccountName "Contoso17" -Name "RunbookWorkerGroupName" -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01" 
   ```
1. Create an Azure VM or Arc-enabled server and add it to the above created Hybrid Worker Group. Use the below command to add an existing Azure VM or Arc-enabled Server to the Hybrid Worker Group. Generate a new GUID and pass it as the name of the Hybrid Worker. To fetch `vmResourceId`, go to the **Properties** tab of the VM on Azure portal.

    ```azurepowershell
      New-AzAutomationHybridRunbookWorker -AutomationAccountName "Contoso17" -Name "RunbookWorkerName" -HybridRunbookWorkerGroupName "RunbookWorkerGroupName" -VmResourceId "VmResourceId" -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01" 
    ```
1. Follow the steps [here](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm.md#enable-system-assigned-managed-identity-on-an-existing-vm) to enable the System-assigned managed identity on the VM.

1. Install Hybrid Worker Extension on the VM.
  
    **Hybrid Worker extension settings**

    ```powershell-interactive
      $settings = @{
    "AutomationAccountURL"  = "<registrationurl>";
    };
    ```
    
    **Azure VMs**

   ```powershell
    Set-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName <VMResourceGroupName> -Location <VMLocation> -VMName <VMName> -Name "HybridWorkerExtension" -Publisher "Microsoft.Azure.Automation.HybridWorker" -ExtensionType HybridWorkerForWindows -TypeHandlerVersion 1.1 -Settings $settings -EnableAutomaticUpgrade $true/$false
   ```
    **Azure Arc-enabled VMs**

   ```powershell
     New-AzConnectedMachineExtension -ResourceGroupName <VMResourceGroupName> -Location <VMLocation> -MachineName <VMName> -Name "HybridWorkerExtension" -Publisher "Microsoft.Azure.Automation.HybridWorker" -ExtensionType HybridWorkerForWindows -TypeHandlerVersion 1.1 -Setting $settings -NoWait -EnableAutomaticUpgrade
   ```

1.  To confirm if the extension has been successfully installed on the VM, In **Azure portal**, go to the VM > **Extensions** tab and check the status of Hybrid Worker extension installed on the VM.


**Manage Hybrid Worker Extension**

You can use the following PowerShell cmdlets to manage Hybrid Runbook Worker and Hybrid Runbook Worker groups:

| PowerShell cmdlet | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
|[`Get-AzAutomationHybridRunbookWorkerGroup`](/powershell/module/az.automation/get-azautomationhybridrunbookworkergroup) | Gets Hybrid Runbook Worker group|
|[`Remove-AzAutomationHybridRunbookWorkerGroup`](/powershell/module/az.automation/remove-azautomationhybridrunbookworkergroup) | Removes Hybrid Runbook Worker group|
|[`Set-AzAutomationHybridRunbookWorkerGroup`](/powershell/module/az.automation/set-azautomationhybridrunbookworkergroup) | Updates Hybrid Worker group with Hybrid Worker credentials|
