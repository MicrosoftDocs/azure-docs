An error similar to the following while deploying the extension is returned:

    ```json
    {
        "code": "DeploymentFailed",
        "message": "At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list deployment operations for details. Please see https://aka.ms/arm-debug for usage details.",
        "details": [{
            "code": "Conflict",
            "message": "{
                \"status\": \"Failed\",
                \"error\": {
                    \"code\": \"ResourceDeploymentFailure\",

                    } ]
                }
            }"
        }]
    }
    ```

As a part of this change, the extension will retry the installation if a previous install failed or re-enact a DSC configuration that had previously failed, for a maximum three times until it reaches the completion state (Success/Error) or if a new request comes. If the extension fails due to invalid user settings/user input, it does not retry. In this case, the extension needs to be invoked again with a new request and correct user settings.

   > The DSC extension is dependent on the Azure VM agent for the retries. Azure VM agent invokes the extension with the last failed request until it reaches a success or error state.
