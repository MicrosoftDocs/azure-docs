# Manage Runtime environment and associated runbooks

This article provides information on how to create Runtime Environment and perform various operations through Azure portal and REST API.  


## Prerequisites

An Azure Automation account in supported public region (except Central India, Germany North, Italy North, Israel Central, Poland Central, UAE Central, and Government clouds).


## Switch between Runtime environment and old experience

### Runtime environment experience

1. Select **Overview** and then select **Try Runtime environment experience**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-runtime-environment/runtime-environment-experience.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to try the runtime environment experience." lightbox="./media/manage-runtime-environment/runtime-environment-experience.png":::

1. Under **Process Automation**, you have the **Runtime Environments (Preview)** and the **Modules** and **Python packages** under **Shared resources** are removed as the Runtime environment allows management of Packages required during Runbook execution.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-runtime-environment/view-menu-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how the menu options when you switch to runtime environment experience." lightbox="./media/manage-runtime-environment/view-menu-options.png":::

1. To revert to the old experience for managing Modules and Packages, select **Overview** in the left pane and then select **Switch to Old Experience**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-runtime-environment/old-experience-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to navigate to the previous experience." lightbox="./media/manage-runtime-environment/old-experience-view.png":::

### Old experience

1. Go to your Automation account, under **Process Automation**, the **Runtime environments (preview)** is removed and under **Shared resources**, **Modules** and **Python packages** can be seen.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-runtime-environment/view-menu-options-old-experience.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the menu options when the default settings are restored." lightbox="./media/manage-runtime-environment/view-menu-options-old-experience.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> Runbook updates persist between new Runtime environment experience and old experience. Any changes done in the Runtime environment linked to a runbook would persist during runbook execution in old experience.


## Manage Runtime environment

### Create Runtime environment

#### [Azure portal](#tab/create-runtime-portal)
1. Sign in to the Azure [portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select your Automation account.
1. Under **Process Automation**, select **Runtime Environments (preview)** and then select **Create**.
1. On **Basics**, provide the following details:
    1. **Name** for the Runtime environment. It must begin with alphabet and can contain only alphabets, numbers, underscores, and dashes.  
    1. From the **Language** drop-down, select the scripting language for Runtime environment.
        - Choose **PowerShell** for PowerShell scripting language or **Python** for Python scripting language.
    1. Select **Runtime version** for scripting language.
        - For PowerShell - choose 5.1, 7.2
        - For Python - choose 3.8, 3.10 (preview)
    1. Provide appropriate **Description**.
    
       :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-runtime-environment/create-runtime-environment.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the entries in basics tab of create runtime environment.":::

1. Select **Next** and in the **Packages** tab, upload the packages required during the runbook execution. The *Az PowerShell package* is uploaded by default for all PowerShell Runtime environments, which includes all cmdlets for managing Azure resources. You can choose the version of Az package from the dropdown. Select **None** if you don't want the Package to be uploaded during runbook execution.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-runtime-environment/packages-runtime-environment.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the selections in packages tab of create runtime environment.":::
 
   > [!NOTE]
   > Azure CLI commands are supported (preview) in runbooks associated with PowerShell 7.2 Runtime environment. Azure CLI commands version 2.56.0 are available as a default package in PowerShell 7.2 Runtime environment.

1. To upload more Packages required during runbook execution. Select **Add a file** to add the file(s) stored locally on your computer or select **Add from gallery** to upload packages from PowerShell gallery.
      
    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-runtime-environment/packages-add-files-runtime-environment.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to add files from local computer or upload from gallery." lightbox="./media/manage-runtime-environment/packages-add-files-runtime-environment.png":::
        
    > [!NOTE]
    > - When you import a package, it might take several minutes. 100MB is the maximum total size of the files that you can import.
    > - Use *.zip* files for PowerShell runbook types as mentioned [here](/powershell/scripting/developer/module/understanding-a-windows-powershell-module)
     > - For Python 3.8 packages, use .whl files targeting cp38-amd64.
     > - For Python 3.10 (preview) packages, use .whl files targeting cp310 Linux OS.
  
1. Select **Next** and in the **Review + Create** tab, verify that the settings are correct. When you select **Create**, Azure runs validation on Runtime environment settings that you have chosen. If the validation passes, you can proceed to create Runtime environment else, the portal indicates the settings that you need to modify.

In the **Runtime Environments (preview)** page, you can view the newly created  Runtime environment for your Automation account. If you don't find the newly created Runtime environments in the list, select **Refresh**.

#### [REST API](#tab/create-runtime-rest)

  "properties": { 
        "runbookType": "PowerShell", 
        "runtimeEnvironment": <runtimeEnvironmentName>, 
        "publishContentLink": { 
            "uri": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-automation-runbook-getvms/Runbooks/Get-AzureVMTutorial.ps1" 
        } 
    }, 
   "location": "East US"
} 
```
> [!NOTE]
> Similar APIs also work for Python runbook type.

### Update Runbook

You can update runbook by changing the Runtime environment linked to the runbook. You can choose single or multiple runbooks for update. Runbook in running status would not be impacted by changing the Runtime environment linked to that runbook.

#### [Azure portal](#tab/update-runbook-portal)
1. In your Automation account, under **Process Automation**, select **Runbooks**.
1. Select the checkbox for the runbook(s) that you want to update.
1. Select **Update**.
   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-runtime-environment/update-runbook.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to update runbook in runtime environment." lightbox="./media/manage-runtime-environment/update-runbook.png":::

1. Select the Runtime environment from the dropdown to which you want to link the runbook(s).
   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-runtime-environment/update-runbook-runtime-environment.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to link runbook in runtime environment." lightbox="./media/manage-runtime-environment/update-runbook-runtime-environment.png":::

1. Select **Update** to update selected runbook(s) with new Runtime environment.
   
Check if the runbook executes as expected after update. If the runbook fails to provide the expected outcome, you can again update the Runtime environment to the old experience by following the steps 1-4.

> [!NOTE]
> Runbook updates persist between new Runtime environment experience and old experience. Any changes done in Runtime environment linked to a runbook would persist during runbook execution in old experience. 

#### [REST API](#tab/update-runbook-rest)

Update Runtime environment linked to a runbook.  

```rest
PATCH 
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/<accountName>/runbooks/<runbookName>?api-version=2023-05-15-preview 
{ 
  "properties": { 
    "type": "PowerShell" 
    "runtimeEnvironment": "<runtimeEnvironmentName>" 
  } 
} 
```
> [!NOTE]
> The View/Delete calls for runbook remains same and can be referenced [Runbook - REST API Azure Automation | Microsoft Learn](/rest/api/automation/runbook).

### Test Runbook update

Run a test job for a runbook with a different Runtime environment. This scenario is useful when a runbook needs to be tested with a Runtime environment before update.  

#### [Azure portal](#tab/test-update-portal)

You can update runbooks by changing the Runtime environment linked to that runbook. We recommend you to test runbook execution before publishing the changes. It's to ensure the runbook works as expected. 

To test runbook execution before publishing Runtime environment changes, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Runbooks** page, and select runbook for which you want to update the Runtime environment.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-runtime-environment/access-runbook.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to go to Runbooks page to select runbook." lightbox="./media/manage-runtime-environment/access-runbook.png":::

1. In the **Edit runbook** page, select **Edit in Portal** to open the text editor.
1. The Runtime environment field shows the existing configuration. Select the new Runtime environment from the dropdown list.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-runtime-environment/edit-runbook.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to select new Runtime environment." lightbox="./media/manage-runtime-environment/edit-runbook.png":::

1. Select **Test pane** to test runbook execution with the updated Runtime environment. Select **Start** to begin the test run.
1. Close the test pane and make the required changes in Runbook code or Runtime environment if necessary.
1. Select **Publish** to update the Runtime environment linked to the runbook. 
1. Select **Yes** to override the previously published version and confirm the changes.


#### [REST API](#tab/test-update-api)

Run a test job for a runbook with a different Runtime environment. This scenario is useful when a runbook needs to be tested with a Runtime environment before update.

```rest
PUT 
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/<accountName>/runbooks/<runbookName>/draft/testJob?api-version=2023-05-15-preview 
{ 
  "properties": { 
    "runtimeEnvironment": "<runtimeEnvironmentName>" 
    "runOn": "" 
  } 
} 
```
---

### Create Cloud Job

#### [Azure portal](#tab/create-cloud-job-portal)

Currently, runbooks linked to Runtime environment would run on Azure.

#### [REST API](#tab/create-cloud-job-rest)
Jobs inherit the Runtime environment from the runbook. Run a cloud job for a published runbook:  

```rest
PUT 
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/<accountName>/jobs/<jobName>?api-version=2023-05-15-preview 
{ 
  "properties": { 
    "runbook": { 
      "name": "<runbookName>" 
    }, 
    "runOn": "" 
  } 
} 
```
> [!NOTE]
> Create/View calls for job remains same and can be referenced from [Job-REST API (Azure Automation) | Microsoft Learn](/rest/api/automation/job).

### Link existing runbooks to System-generated Runtime environments

All existing runbooks in your Azure Automation account would be automatically linked to System-generated Runtime environments. These system-generated Runtime environments are created based on Runtime language, version and Modules/Packages present in your respective Azure Automation account. [Learn more](runtime-environment-overview.md#system-generated-runtime-environments). To update existing runbooks, change the Runtime environment by following the steps mentioned [here](#test-runbook-update).
