    | Property  | Description |
    |---------|---------|
    | **View properties**  | Display the properties of the serverless runtime environment |
    | **Edit properties**     |Edit the properties of the serverless runtime environment. If the environment is up and running, you can edit only certain properties. If the environment failed, you can edit all the properties. |
    | **Delete environment**  | Delete the serverless runtime environment if there are no dependencies. |
    | **Start environment** | Start a serverless runtime environment that wasn't running because it failed. Use this action after you update the properties of the serverless runtime environment. |
    | **Clone environment** | Copy the selected environment to quickly create a new serverless runtime environment. Cloning an environment can save you time if the properties are mostly similar. |
