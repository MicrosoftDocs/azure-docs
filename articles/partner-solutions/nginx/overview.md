# What is NGINXaaS?

[!INCLUDE [what-is](../includes/what-is.md)]

Microsoft and F5 developed the NGINXaaS Cloud-Native Observability Platform and manage it together. NGINX owns and runs the software as a service (SaaS) application including the NGINX accounts created. You can set up the NGINXaaS resources through a resource provider named *Nginx.NginxPlus*. You can create and manage NGINXaaS resources through the Azure portal.

NGINXaaS delivers secure and high performance applications using familiar and trusted load balancing solutions. Use NGINXaaS as a reverse proxy within your Azure environment. You can implement NGINXaaS as a monitoring solution for your cloud workloads through a streamlined workflow.

You can find the NGINXaaS Cloud-Native Observability Platform in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/NGINX.NGINXPLUS%2FnginxDeployments) or get it on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/f5-networks.f5-nginx-for-azure?tab=Overview). The NGINXaaS offering in Azure Marketplace allows you to manage NGINX in the Azure portal as an integrated service.
