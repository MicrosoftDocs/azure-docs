In this quickstart, use Azure Marketplace to create an instance of NGINXaaS.

## Prerequisites

## Create a resource

1. From the Azure portal menu's global search bar, search for *marketplace*. Select **Marketplace** from the Services results.

1. In the Marketplace, search for *F5 NGINX as a Service*. In the results, subscribe to NGINX as a Service.

In the **Networking** tab:

1. Specify a virtual network and subnet or accept the option to create new ones.

1. Select **I allow NGINX service provider to access the above virtual network for deployment.**

1. For **IP address type**, select **Public Only** or **Private Only**.

1. Select **Review + create**.

## Review and create

The **Review + Create** tab runs validations. Review the selections made in the **Basics**, **Networking**, and optionally **Tags** tabs. You can also review the NGINXaaS and Azure Marketplace terms and conditions.
