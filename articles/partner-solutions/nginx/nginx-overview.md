# What is NGINXaaS – An Azure Native ISV Service?

Azure Native ISV Services enable you to easily provision, manage, and tightly integrate independent software vendor (ISV) software and services on Azure. This Azure Native ISV Service is developed and managed by Microsoft and F5.

You can find NGINXaaS – An Azure Native ISV Service in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/NGINX.NGINXPLUS%2FnginxDeployments) or get it on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/f5-networks.f5-nginx-for-azure?tab=Overview).

In this article you learn how to enable deeper integration of the NGINXSaaS service with Azure.

NGINXaaS delivers secure and high performance applications using familiar and trusted load balancing solutions. Use NGINXaaS as a reverse proxy within your Azure environment.

The NGINXaaS offering in the Azure Marketplace allows you to manage NGINX in the Azure portal as an integrated service. You can implement NGINXaaS as a monitoring solution for your cloud workloads through a streamlined workflow.

You can set up the NGINXaaS resources through a resource provider named Nginx.NginxPlus. You can create and manage NGINXaaS resources through the Azure portal. NGINX owns and runs the software as a service (SaaS) application including the NGINX accounts created.
