# What is Neon Serverless Postgres?

Neon Serverless Postgres is a cloud-native, serverless, fully managed PostgreSQL database service jointly developed and managed by Microsoft and Neon as an Azure Native Integration. [!INCLUDE [what-is](../includes/what-is.md)]

## What is it used for?

Neon Serverless Postgres is designed for applications that require rapid scaling, cost optimization, and advanced development workflows.

Typical use cases include:

- Web and mobile applications with variable or unpredictable workloads
- Development and testing environments that benefit from database branching and instant restore
- Scenarios where developers need a fully managed PostgreSQL service with minimal operational overhead
- Data analytics and reporting applications that require high availability and performance without the complexity of managing database infrastructure.
- Applications that require a serverless database solution with automatic scaling and cost efficiency.

## Key Features

The following features set Neon Serverless Postgres apart from traditional managed database services and support modern application development and operations:

- **Scale-to-Zero**: Automatically scales down to zero when not in use, reducing costs while maintaining instant availability when needed.
- **Serverless Autoscaling**: Automatically scales resources based on workload demands, ensuring optimal performance without manual intervention.
- **Database Branching**: Enables developers to create isolated copies of a database for testing or development without impacting production data.
- **Instant Point-in-Time Restore**: Allows rapid recovery of a database to a previous state for disaster recovery or testing purposes.
