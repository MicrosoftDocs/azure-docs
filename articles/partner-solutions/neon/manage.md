This article describes how to manage a Neon resource in Azure portal.

## Resource overview

[!INCLUDE [manage](../includes/manage.md)]

The *Essentials* details include:

- Resource group
- Location
- Subscription
- Subscription ID
- Tags

To manage your resource, select the links next to corresponding details.

Below the essentials, you can navigate to other details about your resource by selecting the links.

## Single sign-on

Single sign-on (SSO) is already enabled when you create your Neon resource.

[!INCLUDE [sso](../includes/sso.md)]

> [!NOTE] 
> The first time you access this URL, depending on your Azure tenant settings, you might be asked to verify your email address on the Neon portal. Once the email address is verified, you can access the Neon portal.

## Projects

When you create your first Neon organization, a default project is created for you. You can create and view your projects from the resource overview.

### View projects

To view your projects, Choose **Projects** from the sidebar.

To view a specific project, select the project's name.

### Create a new project

1. From the menu bar in the working pane, select **+ Create project**.

    The **Create project** flyout appears in the right side of the working pane.

    :::image type="content" source="media/manage/create-project.png" alt-text="The Neon Create project flyout in the Azure portal.":::

1. Enter the values for each setting, or continue with the default values for your project.

    |Field              |Action                                                             |
    |-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |Project name       |Specify a name for your Neon project.                              |
    |Postgres version   |Choose a Postgres version for your project.                        |
    |Database name      |Specify a name for your first database in the project.             |
    |Project region     |Choose the region for your database.                               |

    > [!NOTE]
    > The *Project region* in this tab corresponds to your database. 
    > Don't confuse this value with the *Region* from the Basics tab, which is where your Azure resource is deployed.

1. Select the **Create** button.

### Add a branch to a project

A branch is a copy-on-write clone of your data. You can create a branch from a current or past state. Each Neon project is created with a root branch called main. The first branch that you create is branched from the project's root branch. Subsequent branches can branch off the root branch or from a previously created branch.

To create a new branch, open the project in the working pane.

1. Select **+ Create Branch** from the menu bar in the working pane.

    The **Create Branch** flyout appears in the right side of the working pane.

    :::image type="content" source="media/manage/create-branch.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the + Create branch button emphasized inside the working pane with the Create branch flyout open.":::

1. Enter the values for each setting.

1. Select the **Create** button.

### Connect to a database

You can connect clients and applications to a Neon database via a connection string.

To generate a connection string, open your project or branch in the working pane.

1. Select **Connect to database** from the menu bar in the working pane. 

1. Verify the default values or select new values from each dropdown.

1. Select the copy icon next to the connection string.
