# Manage your Neon  integration through the portal

## Single sign-on

Single sign-on (SSO) is already enabled when you created your Neon  resource. To access Neon through SSO, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Overview for your instance of the Neon resource. 

1. Select the SSO Url.

The first time you access this Url, depending on your Azure tenant settings, you might see a request to grant permissions and User consent. This step is only needed the first time you access the SSO Url.

## Delete a Neon deployment

Once the Neon resource is deleted, all billing stops for that resource through Azure Marketplace. If you're done using your resource and would like to delete it, follow these steps:

1. From the Resource menu, select the Neon deployment you would like to delete.

1. On the working pane of the **Overview**, select **Delete**.

1. Confirm that you want to delete the Neon resource by entering the name of the resource.

1. Select the reason why would you like to delete the resource.

1. Select **Delete**.
