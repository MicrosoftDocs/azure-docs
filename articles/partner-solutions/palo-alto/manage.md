# Manage your Cloud NGFW by Palo Alto Networks resource by using the Azure portal

After you create your Cloud NGFW by Palo Alto Networks resource, you might need to get information about it or change its settings. 

## Resource overview 

[!INCLUDE [manage](../includes/manage.md)]

You can view and change settings by selecting one of the following settings categories under **Settings** in the left pane:

- Networking & NAT
- Security Policies
- Log Settings
- DNS Proxy
- Rules
- Properties 
- Locks

## Change plan

To change the Cloud NGFW's billing plan, go to **Overview** and select **Change Plan**.

## Delete a resource

[!INCLUDE [delete-resource](../includes/delete-resource.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The **Delete** button on the resource is activated only if all connected resources are already deleted. For more information, see [Azure Resource Manager resource group and resource deletion](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/delete-resource-group).
