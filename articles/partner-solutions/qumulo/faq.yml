            [Cloud Native Qumulo (CNQ) on Microsoft Azure](https://qumulo.com/product/azure-cnq/) uses the same technology as ANQ but operates as a user-managed Platform-as-a-Service system within the customerâ€™s tenant. CNQ users manually control the architectural resources. Elastic performance is managed through the system controls and capacity expands dynamically as the organization adds more data.
