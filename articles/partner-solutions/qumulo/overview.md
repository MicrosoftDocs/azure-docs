# What is Azure Native Qumulo Scalable File Service?

[!INCLUDE [what-is](../includes/what-is.md)]

Microsoft and Qumulo developed this service and manage it together.

You can find Qumulo in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Qumulo.Storage%2FfileSystems) or get it on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/qumulo1584033880660.qumulo-saas-mpp?tab=Overview).

Qumulo is an industry leader in distributed file system and object storage. Qumulo provides a scalable, performant, and simple-to-use cloud-native file system that can support a wide variety of data workloads. The file system uses standard file-sharing protocols, such as NFS, SMB, FTP, and S3.

The Azure Native Qumulo Scalable File Service offering on Azure Marketplace allows you to create and manage a Qumulo file system by using the Azure portal with a seamlessly integrated experience. You can also create and manage Qumulo resources by using the Azure portal through the resource provider `Qumulo.Storage/fileSystem`. Qumulo manages the service while giving you full admin rights to configure details like file system shares, exports, quotas, snapshots, and Active Directory users.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Native Qumulo Scalable File Service stores and processes data only in the region where the service was deployed. No data is stored outside that region.
