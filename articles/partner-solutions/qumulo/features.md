# Get Started with Azure Native Qumulo Scalable File Service: Key Features and Set-Up Guides

In this article, you learn about the key capabilities of Azure Native Qumulo Scalable File Service.

## Multiprotocol support

Azure Native Qumulo Scalable File Service provides multi file-sharing protocols such as NFS, SMB, FTP, and S3. Qumuloâ€™s permissions model blends POSIX, Windows/NFSv4.1 ACLs, and S3 access levels.
