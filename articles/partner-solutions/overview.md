# What are Azure Native Integrations?

Azure Native Integrations are services that Microsoft and software development companies jointly develop and natively integrate into the Azure platform. Customers manage and operate these services through Azure, which provides a consistent experience for deployment, management, and monitoring.

- Automatic resource discovery for monitoring.
- Integration of logs and metrics with Azure Monitor.
- Centralized management through the Azure portal.
- Single sign-on (SSO) with Microsoft Entra ID.
- Consolidated billing through Azure Marketplace.
- Security features such as private data plane access and virtual network injection.
- Operational consistency via Azure tools and processes.
