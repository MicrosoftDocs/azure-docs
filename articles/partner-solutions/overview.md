# Azure Native ISV Services overview

Easily provision, manage, and tightly integrate *independent software vendor (ISV)* software and services on Azure with Azure Native ISV Services. Microsoft and the ISV work together to develop and manage the service. 

Currently, services are publicly available in these areas: 

- Observability
- Data and storage
- Networking and security

For a list of available partner services, see [Extend Azure with Azure Native ISV Services](partners.md).

## Features

Each Azure Native ISV Service offers unified operations and integrations. 

### Unified operations

- **Integrated onboarding:** Use ARM template, SDK, CLI, and the Azure portal to create and manage services.
- **Unified management:** Manage the service's entire lifecycle through the Azure portal.
- **Unified access:** Utilize Single Sign-on (SSO) through [Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/whatis). 

### Integrations

- **Logs and metrics:** Seamlessly direct logs and metrics from Azure Monitor to the Azure Native ISV Service using just a few gestures. You can configure autodiscovery of resources to monitor, and set up automatic log forwarding and metrics shipping. You can easily do the setup in Azure, without needing to create more infrastructure or write custom code.
- **Virtual network injection:** Provides private data plane access to Azure Native ISV services from customersâ€™ virtual networks.
- **Unified billing:** Engage with a single entity, Microsoft Azure Marketplace, for billing. No separate license purchase is required to use Azure Native ISV Services.
