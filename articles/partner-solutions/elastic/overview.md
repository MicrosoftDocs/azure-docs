# What is Elastic Cloud (Elasticsearch)?

[!INCLUDE [what-is](../includes/what-is.md)]

Microsoft and [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) developed this service and manage it together.

You can find Elastic Cloud (Elasticsearch) in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Elastic%2Fmonitors) or get it on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/elastic.ec-azure-pp?tab=Overview).

This article describes the Elastic software as a service (SaaS) application that is available through Azure Marketplace. The offering enables deeper integration of the Elastic service with Azure.

Elastic's Cloud-Native Observability Platform centralizes log, metric, and tracing analytics in one place. You can more easily monitor the health and performance of your Azure environment. This information helps you troubleshoot your services more quickly.

With the Elastic offering, you can manage the solution through the Azure portal. You implement Elastic as a monitoring solution for your cloud workloads through a streamlined workflow.

You can now provision the Elastic resources through a resource provider named **Microsoft.Elastic**. You create, provision, and manage Elastic resources through the Azure portal. Elastic owns and runs the SaaS application including the Elastic accounts created.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Elastic service on Azure only stores and processes customer data in the region where the service was deployed. No data is stored outside of that region.
