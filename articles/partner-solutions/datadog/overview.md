# What is Datadog?

## Overview

Datadog is a monitoring and analytics platform for large-scale applications. It encompasses infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, log management, and user-experience monitoring. Datadog aggregates data across your entire stack with 400+ integrations for troubleshooting, alerting, and graphing. You can use it as a single source for troubleshooting, optimizing performance, and cross-team collaboration.

Datadog's offering in the Azure Marketplace enables you to manage Datadog in the Azure console as an integrated service. This availability means you can implement Datadog as a monitoring solution for your cloud workloads through a streamlined workflow. The workflow covers everything from procurement to configuration. The onboarding experience simplifies how you start monitoring the health and performance of your applications, whether they're based entirely in Azure or spread across hybrid or multi-cloud environments.

You provision the Datadog resources through a resource provider named `Microsoft.Datadog`. You can create, provision, and manage Datadog organization resources through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Datadog owns and runs the software as a service (SaaS) application including the organization and API keys.
