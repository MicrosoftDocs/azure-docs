# QuickStart: Start a free trial

A 30-day free trial of Azure Native Dynatrace Service is available on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/dynatrace.dynatrace_portal_integration?tab=Overview). You can sign up using the trial plan published by Dynatrace. During the trial period, you can create a Dynatrace resource on Azure and use integrated services such as log forwarding, metrics integration, and agent based monitoring. Before the free trial expires, you can seamlessly upgrade to a paid public plan or a private offer customized for your organization.

Before you proceed, please make sure that your subscription is marketplace purchase enabled. For more information, visit [Purchase validation checks](/marketplace/purchase-validation-checks).
