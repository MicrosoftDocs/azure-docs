# How to modify access permissions to Azure Monitor

By default, when a Grafana workspace is created, it comes with a Monitoring Reader role granted on all Azure Monitor data and Log Analytics resources within the subscription.
 
This means that the new Grafana workspace can access and search all monitoring data in the subscription. It can view the Azure Monitor metrics and logs from all resources, and any logs stored in Log Analytics workspaces in the subscription.

In this article, learn how to manually grant permission for Azure Managed Grafana to access an Azure resource using a managed identity.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
- An Azure Managed Grafana workspace. If you don't have one yet, [create an Azure Managed Grafana workspace](./quickstart-managed-grafana-portal.md).
- An Azure resource with monitoring data and write permissions, such as [User Access Administrator](../../articles/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) or [Owner](../../articles/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner)

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/) with your Azure account.

## Edit Azure Monitor permissions

To edit permissions for a specific resource, follow these steps.

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Open a resource that contains the monitoring data you want to retrieve. In this example, we're configuring an Application Insights resource.
1. Select **Access Control (IAM)**.
1. Under **Grant access to this resource**, select **Add role assignment**.

1. The portal lists all the roles you can give to your Azure Managed Grafana resource. Select a role. For instance, **Monitoring Reader**, and select **Next**.

1. For **Assign access to**, select **Managed identity**.
1. Click on **Select members**.

1. Select the **Subscription** containing your Azure Managed Grafana workspace.
1. For **Managed identity**, select **Azure Managed Grafana**.
1. Select one or several Azure Managed Grafana workspaces.
1. Click **Select** to confirm

1. Select **Next**, then **Review + assign** to confirm the assignment of the new permission.

For more information about how to use Azure Managed Grafana with Azure Monitor, go to [Monitor your Azure services in Grafana](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/grafana-plugin).

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Assign a role assignment using the [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create) command.

In the code below, replace the following placeholders:

- `<assignee>`: If its --assignee parameter then enter the assignee's object ID or user sign-in name or service principal name. If its --assignee-object-id parameter then enter object IDs for users or groups or service principals or managed identities. For managed identities use the principal ID. For service principals, use the object ID and not the app ID. For more information, refer [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create) command.
- `<roleNameOrId>`: Enter the role's name or ID. For Monitoring Reader, enter `Monitoring Reader` or `43d0d8ad-25c7-4714-9337-8ba259a9fe05`.
- `<scope>`: Enter the full ID of the resource Azure Managed Grafana needs access to.

```azurecli
az role assignment create --assignee "<assignee>" \
--role "<roleNameOrId>" \
--scope "<scope>"
```

or

```azurecli
az role assignment create --assignee-object-id "<assignee>" --assignee-principal-type "<ForeignGroup / Group / ServicePrincipal / User>" \
--role "<roleNameOrId>" \
--scope "<scope>"
```

Example: assigning permission for an Azure Managed Grafana workspace to access an Application Insights resource using a managed identity.

```azurecli
az role assignment create --assignee-object-id "aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb" --assignee-principal-type "ServicePrincipal" \
--role "Monitoring Reader" \
--scope "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourcegroups/my-rg/providers/microsoft.insights/components/myappinsights/"
```

For more information about assigning Azure roles using the Azure CLI, refer to the [Role based access control documentation](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli.md).
