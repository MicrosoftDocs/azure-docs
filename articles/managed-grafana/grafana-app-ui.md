# Grafana application UI

This reference covers the main Grafana UI components, including panels, visualizations, and dashboards. For consistency, it links to the corresponding topics in the Grafana documentation.

## Panels

A Grafana panel is the basic building block in Grafana. Each panel displays a dataset from a data source query using a [visualization](#visualizations). Refer to the following for more information about panels:

## Dashboards

A Grafana dashboard is a collection of [panels](#panels) arranged in rows and columns. Typically panels in a dashboard show datasets that are related. You can create multiple dashboards in Grafana. Refer to the following for more information about dashboards:
