# Configure Grafana teams with Microsoft Entra groups and Grafana Team Sync

In this guide, you learn how to use Microsoft Entra groups with [Grafana Team Sync](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-team-sync/) to manage dashboard permissions in Azure Managed Grafana.

In Azure Managed Grafana, you can use Azure's role-based access control (RBAC) roles for Grafana to define access rights. These permissions apply to all resources in your Grafana workspace by default, not per folder or dashboard. If you assign a user to the Grafana Editor role, that user can edit any dashboard in your Grafana workspace. However, with Grafana's [granular permission model](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-team-sync/), you can adjust a user's default permission level for specific dashboards or dashboard folders. 


Microsoft Entra group sync helps you manage this. With it, you can create a *Grafana team* in a Grafana workspace, link it to a Microsoft Entra group, and then configure your dashboard permissions for that team. For example, you can allow a Grafana viewer to modify a dashboard, or prevent a Grafana editor from making changes.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
- An Azure Managed Grafana workspace. If needed, [create a new workspace](quickstart-managed-grafana-portal.md).
- A Microsoft Entra group. If needed, [create a basic group and add members](/entra/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups#create-a-basic-group-and-add-members).
- The Grafana Admin role is required to use Grafana Team Sync.

## Assign a permission to a Microsoft Entra group

The Microsoft Entra group must have a Grafana role to access the Grafana workspace.

1. In your Grafana workspace, open the **Access control (IAM)** menu select **Add** > **Add new role assignment**.

1. Assign a role, such as **Grafana viewer**, to the Microsoft Entra group. For more information about assigning a role, go to [Grant access](../role-based-access-control/quickstart-assign-role-user-portal.md#grant-access).

### Create a Grafana team

Set up a Microsoft Entra ID-backed Grafana team.

1. In the Azure portal, open your Grafana workspace and select **Configuration** under **Settings**.
1. Select the **Microsoft Entra Team Sync Settings** tab.
1. Select **Create new Grafana team**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/azure-ad-group-sync/team-sync-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. Configuring Microsoft Entra Team Sync.":::

1. Enter a name for the Grafana team and select **Add**.

### Assign a Microsoft Entra group to a Grafana team

1. In **Assign access to**, select the newly created Grafana team.
1. Select **+ Add a Microsoft Entra group**.

1. In the search box, enter a Microsoft Entra group name and select the group name in the results. Click **Select** to confirm.

    :::image type="content" source="media/azure-ad-group-sync/select-azure-ad-group.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. Finding and selecting a Microsoft Entra group.":::

1. Optionally repeat the previous three steps to add more Microsoft Entra groups to the Grafana team.

### Assign access to a Grafana folder or dashboard

1. In the Grafana UI, open a folder or a dashboard.
1. In the **Permissions** tab, select **Add a permission**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/azure-ad-group-sync/add-permission.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal, selecting Add a permission." lightbox="media/azure-ad-group-sync/add-permission.png":::

1. Under **Add permission for**, select **Team**, then select the team name, the **View**, **Edit** or **Admin** permission, and save. You can add permissions for a user, a team or a role.

### Scope down access

You can limit access by removing permissions to access one or more folders.

For example, to disable access to a user who has the Grafana Viewer role on a Grafana workspace, remove their access to a Grafana folder by following these steps:

1. In the Grafana UI, go to a folder you want to hide from the user.
1. In the **Permissions** tab, select the **X** button to the right of the **Viewer** permission to remove this permission from this folder.
1. Repeat this step for all folders you want to hide from the user.

    :::image type="content" source="media/azure-ad-group-sync/remove-permission.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Grafana UI, removing the Viewer permission in a Grafana folder.":::

<a name='remove-azure-ad-group-sync'></a>

## Remove a Grafana team

If you no longer need a Grafana team, follow these steps to delete it. Deleting a Grafana team also removes the link to the Microsoft Entra group.

1. In the Azure portal, open your Azure Managed Grafana workspace.
1. Select **Administration > Teams**.
1. Select the **X** button to the right of a team you're deleting.

    :::image type="content" source="media/azure-ad-group-sync/remove-azure-ad-group-sync.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Grafana platform. Removing a Grafana team.":::

1. Select **Delete** to confirm.
