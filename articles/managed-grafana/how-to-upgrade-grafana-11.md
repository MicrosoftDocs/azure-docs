# Upgrade to Grafana 11

Azure Managed Grafana will stop offering Grafana 10 as a supported software version on July 31, 2025. This guide provides information about the retirement of Grafana 10 and guides you through updating your Azure Managed Grafana workspace to Grafana 11.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the [breaking changes introduced in Grafana 11](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/breaking-changes/breaking-changes-v11-0/) and upgrade your workspace to Grafana 11 before August 2025. If your workspace is still running Grafana version 10 in August 2025, it will be automatically upgraded to Grafana 11.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
- An existing Azure Managed Grafana instance. [Create one if you haven't already](quickstart-managed-grafana-portal.md).

## Check the version of your Grafana workspace

To find out if your Azure Managed Grafana workspace needs to be upgraded, check the version of Grafana your workspace is running.

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)
  
In the Azure portal:

  1. Open your Azure Managed Grafana workspace.
  1. In the left menu, under **Settings** select **Configuration**.
  1. Review the Grafana version listed under **Grafana Version**. If version 10 is selected in the dropdown menu, your workspace is on the Grafana version that is reaching end of life and is scheduled for retirement. We recommend that you upgrade your workspace to Grafana 11 by following the steps below. If your Grafana version is Grafana 11, no further action is necessary.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Run the command [az grafana show](/cli/azure/grafana#az-grafana-show) in the Azure CLI to retrieve the properties of the Azure Managed Grafana workspace. Replace the placeholder `<azure-managed-grafana-workspace>` with the name of the Azure Managed Grafana instance.

```azurecli
az grafana show --name <azure-managed-grafana-workspace>
```

The version number is listed in the output after `grafanaMajorVersion`. If version is `10`, your workspace is on the Grafana version that is reaching end of life and is scheduled for retirement. We recommend that you upgrade your workspace to Grafana 11 by following the steps below. If your Grafana version is `11`, no further action is necessary.
