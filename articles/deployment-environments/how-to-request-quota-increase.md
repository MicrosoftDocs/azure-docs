# Request a quota limit increase for Azure Deployment Environments resources

This guide explains how to submit a support request to increase the number of resources available to Azure Deployment Environments in your Azure subscription.

If your organization uses Deployment Environments extensively, you might encounter a quota limit during deployment. When you reach the limit for a resource in your subscription, you can request a limit increase (sometimes called a capacity increase or a quota increase) to extend the number of resources available. The request process allows the Azure Deployment Environments team to ensure that your subscription isn't involved in any cases of fraud or unintentional, sudden large-scale deployments. 

To learn more about the general process for creating Azure support requests, see [Create an Azure support request](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request).

## Prerequisites

- To create a support request, your Azure account needs the [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner), [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor), or [Support Request Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#support-request-contributor) role at the subscription level.
- Before you create a support request for a limit increase, you need to gather additional information.

## Gather information for your request

Submitting a support request to increase your quota is quicker if you gather the required information before you begin the request process. 

- **Identify the quota type**

   If you reach the quota limit for a Deployment Environments resource, you see a notification indicating which quota type is affected during deployment. Take note of it and submit a request for that quota type.

   The following resources are limited by subscription: 
   - Runtime limit per month (mins)
   - Runtime limit per deployment (mins)
   - Storage limit per environment (GBs)

- **Determine the region for the quota increase**

   Deployment Environments resources can exist in many regions. For best performance, you should choose the region where your Deployment Environments project exists.

   For more information about Azure regions, how they relate to global geographies, and which services are available in each region, see [Azure global infrastructure](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/).
