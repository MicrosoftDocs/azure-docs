# Quickstart: Create and access an environment in Azure Deployment Environments

This quickstart describes how to create and access an [environment](concept-environments-key-concepts.md#environments) in Azure Deployment Environments by using the developer portal.

As a developer, you can create environments associated with a [project](concept-environments-key-concepts.md#projects) in Deployment Environments. An environment provides preconfigured Azure resources for deploying your application.

## Prerequisites

- Someone in your organization must configure Deployment Environments with a dev center and at least one project before you can create a deployment environment. To meet this prerequisite, platform engineers can complete the steps in [Quickstart: Configure Azure Deployment Environments](quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter.md).
- You must have permissions as a Deployment Environments User for a project. If you don't have permissions for a project, contact your administrator.

## Create an environment

An environment in Deployment Environments is a collection of Azure resources on which your application is deployed. You can create an environment from the developer portal.

[!INCLUDE [note-deployment-environments-user](includes/note-deployment-environments-user.md)]

[!INCLUDE [developer-portal-landing-page](includes/developer-portal-landing-page.md)]
 
3. In the **Add an environment** pane, enter or select the following information:

   |Field  |Value  |
   |---------|---------|
   |**Name**     | Enter a descriptive name for your environment. |
   |**Project**  | Select the project you want to create the environment in. If you have access to more than one project, you see a list of available projects. |
   |**Type**     | Select the environment type you want to create. If you have access to more than one environment type, you see a list of available types. |
   |**Definition** | Select the environment definition you want to use to create the environment. You see a list of the environment definitions that are available from the catalogs associated with your dev center. |

   If your environment is configured to accept parameters, you can enter them on a separate pane. In this example, you don't need to specify any parameters.

4. Select **Create**. You see your environment in the developer portal immediately. An indicator shows the progress of the environment creation.

## Access an environment

You can access and manage your environments in the Deployment Environments developer portal.

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://devportal.microsoft.com).

1. You can view all of your existing environments. To access the resources created as part of an environment, select **View resources**.

1. You can view the resources in your environment in the Azure portal:

   Creating an environment automatically creates a resource group that stores the environment's resources. The resource group name follows the pattern `{projectName}-{environmentName}`. You can view the resource group in the Azure portal.
