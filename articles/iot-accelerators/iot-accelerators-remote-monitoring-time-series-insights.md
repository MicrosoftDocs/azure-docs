# Use Time Series Insights to visualize telemetry sent from the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator

As an operator, you may want to extend the out-of-the-box data visualization capabilities of the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator. This how-to guide shows you how to use a Time Series Insights environment to visualize and analyze telemetry sent to the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator.

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps in this how-to guide, you need an active Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

The steps in this how-to guide assume you've deployed the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator to your Azure subscription. If you haven't deployed the solution accelerator, follow the steps in the [Deploy and run a cloud-based remote monitoring solution](quickstart-remote-monitoring-deploy.md) quickstart.

This article assumes the name of your solution accelerator is **contoso-simulation**. Replace **contoso-simulation** with the name of your solution accelerator as you complete the following steps.

## Time Series Insights explorer

The Time Series Insights explorer is a web app you can use to visualize your telemetry.

1. In the Azure portal, select the Time Series Insights **Overview** tab.

1. To open the Time Series Insights explorer web app, click **Go to Environment**:
