# How to cancel your Azure subscription

>[AZURE.NOTE] An Azure Support plan has a 6-month term and Microsoft requires continued monetary commitment for the duration of the term. Cancellation before the term expires does not forgive the remaining commitment or provide refunds any pre-paid amount. If you cancelled your subscription by mistake and need to get it reactivated, you can contact [Azure Support](billing-how-to-create-billing-support-ticket.md) for assistance.

If you cancel your subscription, all your services will be deleted immediately. Make sure you back up the data you want to save before you cancel.  

1. Log on to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions) as the Account Administrator.
2. Under **Click a subscription to view details and usage**, select the subscription that you want to cancel. </br> ![selectsub](.\media\billing-how-to-cancel-azure-subscription\Selectsub.png)
