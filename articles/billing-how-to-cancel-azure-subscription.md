# How to cancel your Azure subscription

>[AZURE.NOTE] An Azure Support plan has a 6-month term and Microsoft requires continued monetary commitment for the duration of the term. Cancellation before the term expires does not forgive the remaining commitment or provide refunds any pre-paid amount. If you canceled your subscription by mistake and need to get it reactivated, you can [contact support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) for assistance.

If you cancel your subscription, your data will be stored for 90 days as per [Microsoft's retention policy](http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=31). Learn more from [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Privacy/You-are-in-control-of-your-data).

1. Log on to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions) as the Account Administrator.
