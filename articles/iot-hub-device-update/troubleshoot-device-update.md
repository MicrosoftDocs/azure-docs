# Device Update for IoT Hub Troubleshooting Guide

This document lists some common questions and issues Device Update users have reported. If you encounter an issue that does not appear in this troubleshooting guide, refer to the [Contacting Microsoft Support](#contact) section to document your situation.

## <a name="import"></a>Importing updates

### Q: I'm having trouble connecting my Device Update instance to my IoT Hub instance

Please ensure your IoT Hub message routes are configured correctly, as per the [Device Update resources](./device-update-resources.md) documentation.

### Q: I'm encountering a role-related error (error message in Azure portal or a 403 API error)

You may not have access permissions configured correctly. Please ensure you have configured access permissions correctly as per the [Device Update access control](./device-update-control-access.md) documentation.

### Q: I'm encountering a 500-type error when importing content to the Device Update service

An error code in the 500 range may indicate an issue with the Device Update service. Please wait 5 minutes, then try again. If the same error persists, please follow the instructions in the [Contacting Microsoft Support](#contact) section to file a support request with Microsoft.

### Q: I want to keep the same compatibility properties (target my update to the same device type), but change the Provider or Name in the import manifest. But I get an error "Failed: error importing update due to exceeded limit" when I do so

The same exact set of compatibility properties cannot be used with more than one Update Provider and Name combination. This allows the Device Update service to determine with certainty which updates should be available to deploy to a given device. If you need to update multiple components or partitions on a single device, the [proxy updates](./device-update-proxy-updates.md) feature provides that capability.

### Q: I'm encountering an error message when importing content and would like to understand more about it

Please refer to the [Device Update Error Codes](./device-update-error-codes.md#device-update-content-service) documentation for more detailed information on import-related error messages.

## <a name="device-failure"></a>Device failures

### Q: How can I ensure my device is connected to Device Update for IoT Hub?

You can verify that your device is connected to Device Update by checking if it shows up under the "Ungrouped" devices section in the compliance view of Azure portal.

### Q: One or more of my devices is failing to update

There are many possible root causes for a device update failure. Please validate that the device is: 1) connected to your IoT Hub instance, 2) connected to your Device Update instance, and 3) the Delivery Optimization (DO) service is running. If all three are true for your device, please follow the instructions in the [Contacting Microsoft Support](#contact) section to file a support request with Microsoft.

### Q: My Device Update agent is failing to start up

One of the most common reasons for a failure in Device Update agent start-up is a malformed configuration file (du-config.json). Please refer to the [configuration file documentation](./device-update-configuration-file.md) and ensure your agent is configured correctly. Note that all values in the configuration file must use double-quotes.

## <a name="deploy"></a> Deploying an update

### Q: I've deployed an update to my device(s), but the compliance status says it isn't on the latest update. What should I do?

The device compliance status can take up to 5 minutes to refresh. Please wait, then check again.

### Q: My device's deployment status shows incompatible, what should I do?

The manufacturer and model properties of a targeted device may have been changed after connecting the device to IoT Hub, causing the device to now be considered incompatible with the update content of the current deployment.

Check the [ADU Core Interface](./device-update-plug-and-play.md) to see what manufacturer and model your device is reporting to the Device Update service, and make sure it matches the manufacturer and model you specified in the [import manifest](./import-concepts.md) of the update content being deployed. You can change these properties for a given device using the [Device Update configuration file](./device-update-configuration-file.md).

### Q: I see my deployment is in "Active" stage but none of my devices are "In progress" with the update. What should I do?

Ensure that your deployment start date is not set in the future. When you create a new deployment, the deployment start date is defaulted to the next day as a safeguard unless you explicitly change it. You can either wait for the deployment start date to arrive, or cancel the ongoing deployment and create a new deployment with the desired start date.

### Q: I'm trying to group my devices, but I don't see the tag in the drop-down when creating a group

Ensure that you have correctly configured the message routes in your IoT Hub as per the [Device Update resources](./device-update-resources.md) documentation. You will have to tag your device again after configuring the route.

Another root cause could be that you applied the tag before connecting your device to Device Update for IoT Hub. Ensure that your device is already connected to Device Update. You can verify that your device is connected to Device Update for IoT Hub by checking if it shows up under “Ungrouped” devices in the compliance view. Temporarily add a tag of a different value, and then add your intended tag again once the device is connected.

If you are using Device Provisioning Service (DPS), then ensure that you tag your devices after they are provisioned and not during the Device creation process. If you have already tagged your device during the Device creation step, then you will have to temporarily tag your device with a different value after it is provisioned, and then add your intended tag again.

### Q: My deployment completed successfully, but some devices failed to update

This may have been caused by a client-side error on the failed devices. Please see the Device Failures section of this troubleshooting guide.

### Q: I encountered an error in the UX when trying to initiate a deployment

This may have been caused by a service/UX bug, or by an API permissions issue. Please follow the instructions in the [Contacting Microsoft Support](#contact) section to file a support request with Microsoft.

### Q: I started a deployment but it isn’t reaching an end state

This may have been caused by a service performance issue, a service bug, or a client bug. Please retry your deployment after 10 minutes. If you encounter the same issue, please pull your device logs and refer to the Device Failures section of this troubleshooting guide. If the same issue persists, please follow the instructions in the [Contacting Microsoft Support](#contact) section to file a support request with Microsoft.

### Q: I migrated from a device level agent to adding the agent as a Module identity on the device, and my update shows as 'in-progress' even though it has been applied to the device

This may have been caused if you did not remove the older agent that was communicating over the Device Twin. When you provision the Device Update agent as a Module (see [how to](device-update-agent-provisioning.md)) all communications between the device and the Device Update service happen over the Module Twin so do remember to tag the Module Twin of the device when creating [groups](device-update-groups.md) and all [communications](device-update-plug-and-play.md) must happen over the module twin.

## <a name="download"></a> Downloading updates onto devices

### Q: How do I resume a download when a device has reconnected after a period of disconnection?

The download will self-resume when connectivity is restored within a 24-hour period. After 24 hours, the download will need to be reinitiated by the user.

## <a name="mcc"></a> Using Microsoft Connected Cache (MCC)

### Q: I am encountering an issue when attempting to deploy the MCC module on my IoT Edge device

Refer to the [IoT Edge documentation](../iot-edge/index.yml) for deploying Edge modules to IoT Edge devices. You can check if the MCC module is running successfully on your IoT Edge device by navigating to http://localhost:5100/Summary.

### Q: One of my IoT devices is attempting to download an update through MCC, but is failing

There are several issues that could be causing an IoT device to fail in connecting to MCC. In order to diagnose the issue, please collect the DO client and Nginx logs from the failing device (see the [Contacting Microsoft Support](#contact) section for instructions on gathering client logs).

Your device may be failing to pull content from the Internet to pass to its MCC module because the URL it’s using isn’t allowed. To determine if so, you will need to check your IoT Edge environment variables in Azure portal.

## <a name="instance"></a> Troubleshooting a missing instance in the Azure portal

### Q: I don’t see an instance of Device Update for IoT Hub when I select the "gear" icon

There are a few possible causes for this issue. See below for troubleshooting steps.

A Device Update instance needs to be associated with an Azure IoT hub in the same resource group and subscription. If you’ve moved either your Device Update instance or your hub to a different resource group or subscription, you may not see your instance in the Azure portal. You’ll need to do one of the following steps in order to continue using Device Update for IoT Hub:

- Return the moved item(s) to their original configuration.
- If you only moved your IoT hub from one resource group to another, modify your Device Update instance with the IoT hub’s new resourceId.
- If you moved item(s) from one subscription to another, make sure the Device Update account and IoT hub are in the same subscription, and then modify your Device Update instance with the IoT hub’s new resourceId.

At least Read-level permissions are needed for both your IoT hub and your Device Update for IoT Hub account in order to access Device Update functionality via the IoT hub experience in the Azure portal.

- To manage permissions for your IoT Hub:
  - Select your hub from the Azure portal
  - Select “Access control (IAM) from the left-hand navigation bar.
  - Select “Add role assignment”.
  - Select a role with at least Read access and select Next.
  - Next to “Members”, select “+Select members”.
  - Add your account in the right-hand flyout, and select the “Select” button.
  - Select “Review + assign”.
- To manage permissions for your Device Update for IoT Hub account, ask the owner of the account to take these steps:
  - Select your Device Update account from the Azure portal.
  - Select “Access control (IAM) from the left-hand navigation bar.
  - Select “Add role assignment”.
  - Select the Reader role (or one with equivalent permissions).
  - Next to “Members”, select “+Select members”.
  - Add your account in the right-hand flyout, and select the “Select” button.
  - Select “Review + assign”.
