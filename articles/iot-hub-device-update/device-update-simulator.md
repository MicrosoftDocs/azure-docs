# Tutorial: Azure Device Update for IoT Hub using a simulator agent

Azure Device Update for IoT Hub supports image-based, package-based, and script-based updates. This tutorial demonstrates an end-to-end image-based Device Update update that uses an Ubuntu simulator agent.

Image updates provide a high level of confidence in the end state of the device, and don't pose the same package and dependency management challenges as package or script based updates. It's easier to replicate the results of an image update between a preproduction and production environment, or easily adopt an A/B failover model.

In this tutorial, you:
> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Assign an IoT device to a Device Update group by using tags.
> - Download and install an image update.
> - Import the image update.
> - Deploy the image update.
> - View the update deployment history.

## Prerequisites

- An Ubuntu 18.04 x64 physical or virtual machine
- A [Device Update account and instance configured with an IoT hub](create-device-update-account.md)

## Register and configure a device and module

Add a device to the device registry in your IoT hub. Every device that connects to IoT Hub must be registered.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the IoT hub page associated with your Device Update instance.
1. In the navigation pane, select **Device management** > **Devices**.
1. On the **Devices** page, select **Add Device**.
1. Under **Device ID**, enter a name for the device. Ensure that **Autogenerate keys** checkbox is selected.
1. Select **Save**. The device appears in the list on the **Devices** page.

### Create a module identity

After you register the device, create a module identity. Modules are independent identities for IoT device components, which allow for finer granularity when the device runs multiple processes.

For this tutorial, you create a module identity for the Device Update agent that runs on the device. For more information, see [Understand and use module twins in IoT Hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-module-twins.md).

1. On the **Devices** page, select the device you registered.
1. On the device page, select **Add Module Identity**.
1. On the **Add Module Identity** page, under **Module Identity Name**, enter a name for the module such as *DeviceUpdateAgent*.
1. Select **Save**. The new module identity appears on the device page under **Module Identities**.
1. Select the module name, and on the **Module Identity Details** page, select the **Copy** icon next to **Connection string (primary key)**. Save this *module connection string* to use when you configure the Device Update agent.

### Add a group tag to your module twin

Device Update automatically organizes devices into groups based on their assigned tags and compatibility properties. Each device belongs to only one group, but groups can have multiple subgroups to sort different device classes.

You can assign a tag to any device that Device Update manages to assign the device to a Device Update group. The tag can be in the device twin or in the module twin as in this tutorial. Each device can be assigned to only one Device Update group.

1. On the **Module Identity Details** page, select **Module Identity Twin**.
1. On the **Module Identity Twin** page, add a new `DeviceUpdateGroup` tag to the JSON code at the same level as `modelId` and `version`, as follows:

   ```json
   "tags": {
       "DeviceUpdateGroup": "DU-simulator-tutorial"
   },
   ```

1. Select **Save**. The portal reformats the module twin to incorporate the tag into the JSON structure.

## Install and configure the Device Update agent

The Device Update agent runs on every device that Device Update manages. In this tutorial, you install the Device Update agent on the Ubuntu 18.04 device and configure it to run as a simulator, demonstrating how you can apply an update to a device without changing the device configuration.

>[!NOTE]
>You can also use the Azure IoT Identity Service to provision the device. To do that, [install the Azure IoT Identity Service](https://azure.github.io/iot-identity-service/installation.html) before installing the Device Update agent. Then configure the Device Update agent with `"connectionType": "AIS"` and leave `connectionData` as a blank string in the configuration file.

1. Add the Microsoft package repository, and then add the Microsoft package signing key to your list of trusted keys.

   ```bash
   wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/multiarch/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
   sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
   rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb   
   ```

1. Install the Device Update agent *.deb* packages.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install deviceupdate-agent
   ```

1. Open the *du-config.json* agent configuration file.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/adu/du-config.json
   ```

1. Update *du-config.json*  with the following example values. Replace the `<connection string>` placeholder with the connection string you copied from the module identity. For more information about the parameters, see [Device Update configuration file](device-update-configuration-file.md).

   - `manufacturer: "contoso"`
   - `model: "video"`
   - `agents.name: "aduagent"`
   - `agents.connectionData: <connection string>` 
   - `agents.manufacturer: "contoso"`
   - `agents.model: "video"`

   The edited *du-config.json* file should look like this:

   ```json
   {
      "schemaVersion": "1.0",
      "aduShellTrustedUsers": [
         "adu",
         "do"
      ],
      "manufacturer": "contoso",
      "model": "video",
      "agents": [
         {
         "name": "aduagent",
         "runas": "adu",
         "connectionSource": {
            "connectionType": "string",
            "connectionData": <connection string>
         },
         "manufacturer": "contoso",
         "model": "video"
         }
      ]
   }
   ```

1. Press **Ctrl**+**X** to exit the editor, and enter *y* to save your changes.

1. To set up the agent to run as a simulator, run the following command on the IoT device. The Device Update agent invokes the simulator handler to process updates that use the Microsoft SWUpdate extension.

   ```bash
     sudo /usr/bin/AducIotAgent --extension-type updateContentHandler --extension-id 'microsoft/swupdate:1' --register-extension /var/lib/adu/extensions/sources/libmicrosoft_simulator_1.so
   ```

### Get the simulator files

1. Download and extract the *Tutorial_Simulator.zip* archive from the [GitHub Device Update Releases](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases) latest release **Assets** section onto your Ubuntu 18.04 machine.

   You can use `wget` to download the ZIP file. Replace `<release_version>` with the latest release, for example `1.0.0`.

   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases/download/<release_version>/Tutorial_Simulator.zip
   ```

1. Copy the *sample-du-simulator-data.json* file from the extracted *Tutorial_Simulator* folder to the *tmp* folder.

   ```bash
   cp sample-du-simulator-data.json /tmp/du-simulator-data.json
   ```

   >[!NOTE]
   >If the *tmp* folder doesn't exist, create it as follows:
   >
   >```bash
   >sudo mkdir/tmp
   >sudo chown root:root/tmp
   >sudo chmod 1777/tmp
   >```  

1. Change the permissions for the */tmp/sample-du-simulator-data.json* file.

   ```bash
   sudo chown adu:adu /tmp/du-simulator-data.json
   sudo chmod 664 /tmp/du-simulator-data.json
   ```
  
1. Restart the Device Update agent to apply your changes.

   ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart deviceupdate-agent
   ```

## Import the update

Download and extract the *Tutorial_Simulator.zip* archive from the [GitHub Device Update Releases](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases) latest release **Assets** section onto your development machine, if it's different from your Ubuntu 18.04 IoT device. This section uses the *TutorialImportManifest_Sim.importmanifest.json* and *adu-update-image-raspberrypi3.swu* files from the *Tutorial_Simulator* folder.

The update file is the same one as in the [Raspberry Pi tutorial](device-update-raspberry-pi.md). Because the update in this tutorial is simulated, the specific file content doesn't matter.

1. On your development machine, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and go to the IoT hub configured with your Device Update instance.
1. In the navigation pane, select **Device Management** > **Updates**.
1. On the **Updates** page, select **Import a new update**.
1. On the **Import update** page, select **Select from storage container**.
1. Select an existing storage account, or create a new account by selecting **Storage account**.
1. Select an existing container, or create a new container by selecting **Container**. This container is used to stage the update files for importing.

   > [!NOTE]
   > To avoid accidentally importing files from previous updates, use a new container each time you import an update. If you don't use a new container, be sure to delete any files from the existing container.

1. On the container page, select **Upload**. Browse to and select the *TutorialImportManifest_Sim.importmanifest.json* and *adu-update-image-raspberrypi3.swu* files, and then select **Upload**.

1. Select the checkboxes by both files and then select **Select** to return to the **Import update** page.

For more information about the import process, see [Import an update to Device Update for IoT Hub](import-update.md).

## Select the device group

You can use the group tag you applied to your device to deploy the update to the device group. Select the **Groups and Deployments** tab at the top of the **Updates** page to view the list of groups and deployments and the update compliance chart.

The update compliance chart shows the count of devices in various states of compliance: **On latest update**, **New updates available**, and **Updates in progress**. For more information, see [Device Update compliance](device-update-compliance.md).

Under **Group name**, you see a list of all the device groups for devices connected to this IoT hub and their available updates, with links to deploy the updates under **Status**. Any devices that don't meet the device class requirements of a group appear in a corresponding invalid group. For more information about tags and groups, see [Manage device groups](create-update-group.md).

You should see the device group that contains the simulated device you set up in this tutorial. Select the group name to view its details.

:::image type="content" source="media/device-update-simulator/groups-and-deployments.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the update compliance view." lightbox="media/create-update-group/updated-view.png":::
