# Azure Device Update for IoT Hub import concepts

To deploy an update to devices using Azure Device Update for IoT Hub, you first import the update into the Device Update service, which stores the imported update and deploys it to devices. This article provides an overview of some important concepts to understand when it comes to importing updates.

## Import manifest

An import manifest is a JSON file that defines important information about the update you're importing. You submit both your import manifest and associated update file or files, such as a firmware update package, as part of the import process. The metadata defined in the import manifest is used to ingest the update. Some of the metadata is also used at deployment time, for example to validate if an update installed correctly.

The following JSON code shows an example import manifest file:

```json
{
  "updateId": {
    "provider": "Contoso",
    "name": "Toaster",
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "isDeployable": false,
  "compatibility": [
    {
      "manufacturer": "Contoso",
      "model": "Toaster"
    }
  ],
  "instructions": {
    "steps": [
      {
        "handler": "microsoft/swupdate:2",
        "files": [
          "firmware.swu"
        ],
        "handlerProperties": {
          "installedCriteria": "1.0"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "files": [
    {
      "filename": "firmware.swu",
      "sizeInBytes": 7558,
      "hashes": {
        "sha256": "/CD7Sn6fiknWa3NgcFjGlJ+ccA81s1QAXX4oo5GHiFA="
      }
    }
  ],
  "createdDateTime": "2022-01-19T06:23:52.6996916Z",
  "manifestVersion": "5.0"
}
```

The sections of the import manifest file represent important Device Update concepts, as described in the following sections. For information about the full import manifest schema, see [Import manifest JSON schema](./import-schema.md).

### Update identity

The *update identity* or `updateId` is the unique identifier for an update in Device Update, and contains the following properties:

- **Provider** is the entity that creates or is responsible for the update. **Provider** is often a company name.
- **Name** is the identifier for an update class. **Name** is often a device class or model name.
- **Version** is a number that distinguishes this update from others with the same provider and name.

For example:

```json
{
  "updateId": {
    "provider": "Contoso",
    "name": "Toaster",
    "version": "1.0"
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `updateId` is used only by the Device Update service, and is different from the software component identities on the devices.

### Compatibility

The **Compatibility** section uses one or more arbitrary key-value pairs to define the devices that can install an update. Only devices that report properties matching the compatibility values are eligible to deploy the update. You can make an update compatible with multiple device classes by including more than one set of device compatibility properties.

The following example shows an update that can only be deployed to devices that report *Contoso* and *Toaster* as their device manufacturer and model.

```json
{
  "compatibility": [
    {
      "manufacturer": "Contoso",
      "model": "Toaster"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Instructions

The **Instructions** section contains the necessary information or steps for the device agent to install the update. The simplest update contains a single inline step that executes the update payload file using a handler registered with the device agent. The following example shows a single-step instructions section.

```json
{
  "instructions": {
    "steps": [
      {
        "handler": "microsoft/swupdate:2",
        "files": [
          "contoso.toaster.1.0.swu"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `handler` property is equivalent to the `updateType` property in import manifest version 3.0 or older.

An update can contain more than one step, as in the following example:

```json
{
  "instructions": {
    "steps": [
      {
        "description": "pre-install script",
        "handler": "microsoft/script:1",
        "handlerProperties": {
          "arguments": "--pre-install"
        },
        "files": [
          "configure.sh"
        ]
      },
      {
        "description": "firmware package",
        "handler": "microsoft/swupdate:2",
        "files": [
          "contoso.toaster.1.0.swu"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

An update may contain *reference* steps that instruct the device agent to install another update with its own import manifest, establishing a parent and child update relationship. An update can contain any combination of inline and reference steps.

For example, an update for a toaster may contain two child updates:

```json
{
  "instructions": {
    "steps": [
      {
        "type": "reference",
        "updateId": {
          "provider": "Contoso",
          "name": "Toaster.HeatingElement",
          "version": "1.0"
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "reference",
        "updateId": {
          "provider": "Contoso",
          "name": "Toaster.Sensors",
          "version": "1.0"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


### Files

The **Files** section of the import manifest contains update payload file metadata like `name`, `size`, and `hash`. Device Update uses this metadata for integrity validation during the import process, and forwards the same information to the device agent for integrity validation before installation.

> [!NOTE]
> A parent update that contains only reference steps doesn't define any update payload files.

## Create an import manifest

While it's possible to author an import manifest JSON manually using a text editor, the Azure CLI simplifies the process greatly. When you're ready to try out the creation of an import manifest, you can use the [How-to guide](create-update.md#create-a-basic-device-update-import-manifest).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To import into the Device Update service via the Azure portal, an import manifest JSON filename must end with *.importmanifest.json*.

> [!TIP]
> You can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to enable autocomplete and JSON schema validation when you create an import manifest.

## Update import limits

Certain limits are enforced for each Device Update for IoT Hub instance. If you haven't already reviewed them, see [Device Update limits](./device-update-limits.md).
