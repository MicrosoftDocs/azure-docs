# Device Update for IoT Hub release notes and version history

Device Update for IoT Hub is an Azure service designed to work with an on-device agent built from the open-source Device Update for IoT Hub project hosted on GitHub. All new agent releases are made available under the [Releases section](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases) of the GitHub repository. Contributions, feature requests, and bug reports can also be filed on the [open-source Device Update for IoT Hub repository](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update).

## Detailed release notes for "February 2023 Release"

This latest release consists of several improvements to the experience when using Azure portal. These improvements are compatible with the [GA launch API version ("2022-10-01")](/rest/api/deviceupdate/2022-10-01/device-update) and agent versions [v1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases/tag/1.0.0), [v1.0.1](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases/tag/1.0.1), and [v1.0.2](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases/tag/1.0.2).

### Improvements

* Improved the import experience by adding support for actionable notifications with update progress, enabling simplification of the **Updates** view by removing the dedicated tab for import history.
* Added the **Manage Device Update limits** section to the **Diagnostics** tab. This section details how close your instance is to hitting [Device Group and Device Class limits](device-update-limits.md).
* Added the ability to export Deployment details to a CSV file. This can be done by navigating to the **Deployment history** tab within a Device Group and selecting **View deployment details** then clicking **Export to CSV**.
* Added the ability to navigate directly to **Deployment details** after creating a new deployment from **Available updates**.
* Added a guided tutorial that walks through creation of an import manifest if one isn't included when importing a new update. This **Create manifest** tutorial can be accessed by starting a new import and selecting the desired update files from your storage container. If you don't include an import manifest (file with .importmanifest.json extension), the resulting error message contains a hyperlink ("create one") that opens the Import tutorial.
* Added a hyperlink to the storage container where log files from a successful log operation have been uploaded. This can be accessed by navigating to **Log upload operation details** and opening the **Devices** section. Each device that successfully completed the log upload operation should display a hyperlink ("Open storage container") in the **Log location** field.
