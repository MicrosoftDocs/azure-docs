    questions:
      - question: |
          How many virtual machines (VMs) can I deploy using Azure Compute fleet? 
        answer: |
          Compute Fleet allows you to deploy up to 10,000 VMs in a singe request, as long as you have enough quota of Spot VMs and OnDemand VMs.
      - question: |
          Can I specify target capacity at a Compute Fleet level without specifying Spot and OnDemand capacity? 
        answer: |
          No, target capacity is set individually for Spot and OnDemand, even if you're using a combination of both VM types. 
      - question: |
          Can I deploy both Spot VMs and OnDemand VMs in a single Compute Fleet request? 
        answer: |
          Yes, you can mix both Spot and OnDemand VM types in a single fleet request. 
      - question: |
          If Spot eviction happens, is more capacity deployed for OnDemand VMs to meet total fleet capacity? 
        answer: |
          No, capacity is managed at a VM type level for Spot VMs and OnDemand VMs. Spot eviction doesn't trigger to deploy extra capacity on OnDemand VMs, nor are Spot VMs converted to OnDemand VMs.
      - question: |
          Which Azure regions support Compute Fleet? 
        answer: |
          West US, WestUS2, East US, East US2, Central US, South Central US, West Central US, North Central US, West Europe, North Europe, UK South, and France Central.
      - question: |
          Which SKUs are supported for Compute Fleet? 
        answer: |
          Most SKUs are supported. However, B-series and promo versions of any VM size (example: Dv2, NV, NC, H promo sizes) aren't supported for Azure Spot VMs.
      - question: |
          Do I have to request more quota for OnDemand VMs and Spot VMs to deploy Azure Compute Fleet? 
        answer: |
          No. Before deploying, check if you have enough quota on Spot and OnDemand based on the target capacity requested. Compute Fleet rejects requests if a subscription doesn't have enough quota. 
      - question: |
          Can I modify my target capacity on my Compute Fleet? 
        answer: |
          Yes, you're allowed to modify target capacity for OnDemand VMs. However, for Spot VMs, your Compute Fleet has to be configured for capacity preference "maintain capacity". 
      - question: |
          How many VM sizes/SKU types can I add while configuring the Compute Fleet? 
        answer: |
          You can add a minimum  of 3 and maximum of 15 VM sizes to deploy Compute Fleet for Spot using the capacity preference "Maintain". However, there's no minimum number for OnDemand VMs. The maximum you can add is 15. 
      - question: |
          How long is my Compute Fleet request active? 
        answer: |
          Compute Fleet requests are active for a year (365 days).
      - question: |
          Can I delete my Compute Fleet request? 
        answer: |
          Yes, you can delete your Compute Fleet request at any time. All VMs running inside the fleet are deleted. 
      - question: |
          What happens if I don't delete the Compute Fleet with Spot VMs, after workload completion? 
        answer: |
          Your Spot VMs continue to run until evicted and you incur billing charges. Your OnDemand VMs continue to run and you incur billing charges until you delete . 
      - question: |
          Can I specify target capacity using VM based attribute selection like vCPU or memory? 
        answer: |
          No, target capacity is set using VM instance attribute only. 
      - question: |
          Can I mix multiple CPU architecture while configuring my Compute Fleet? 
        answer: |
          No, you can't mix multiple CPU architectures in a single Compute Fleet request. 
      - question: |
          Can I configure start and stop time for my Compute Fleet? 
        answer: |
          No, there's no start and stop time configuration available on Compute Fleet.
