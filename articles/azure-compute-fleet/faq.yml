  - name: Top frequently asked questions for Compute Fleet
    questions:
      - question: |
          How many virtual machines (VMs) can I deploy using Azure Compute fleet? 
        answer: |
          Compute Fleet allows you to deploy up to 10,000 VMs in a singe request, as long as you have enough quota of Spot VMs and Standard VMs.
      - question: |
          Can I specify target capacity at a Compute Fleet level without specifying Spot and Standard capacity? 
        answer: |
          No, target capacity is set individually for Spot and Standard, even if you're using a combination of both virtual machine (VM) types. 
      - question: |
          Can I deploy both Spot VMs and Standard VMs in a single Compute Fleet request? 
        answer: |
          Yes, you can mix both Spot and Standard VM types in a single fleet request. 
      - question: |
          If Spot eviction happens, is more capacity deployed for Standard VMs to meet total fleet capacity? 
        answer: |
          No, capacity is managed at a VM type level for Spot VMs and Standard VMs. Spot eviction doesn't trigger to deploy extra capacity on Standard VMs, nor are Spot VMs converted to Standard VMs.
      - question: |
          Which Azure regions support Compute Fleet? 
        answer: |
          East US, East US2, West US, and West US2.
      - question: |
          Which SKUs are supported for Compute Fleet? 
        answer: |
          Most SKUs are supported. However, B-series and promo versions of any VM size (example: Dv2, NV, NC, H promo sizes) aren't supported for Azure Spot VMs.
      - question: |
          Do I have to request more quota for Standard VMs and Spot VMs to deploy Azure Compute Fleet? 
        answer: |
          No. Before deploying, check if you have enough quota on Spot and Standard based on the target capacity requested. Compute Fleet rejects requests if a subscription doesn't have enough quota. 
      - question: |
          Can I modify my target capacity on my Compute Fleet? 
        answer: |
          Yes, you're allowed to modify target capacity for Standard VMs. However, for Spot VMs, your Compute Fleet has to be configured for capacity preference *maintain capacity*. 
      - question: |
          How many VM sizes/SKU types can I add while configuring the Compute Fleet? 
        answer: |
          You can add a minimum  of 3 and maximum of 15 VM sizes to deploy Compute Fleet for Spot using the capacity preference *Maintain*. However, there's no minimum number for Standard VMs. The maximum you can add is 15. 
      - question: |
          How long is my Compute Fleet request active? 
        answer: |
          Compute Fleet requests are active for a year (365 days).
      - question: |
          Can I delete my Compute Fleet request? 
        answer: |
          Yes, you can delete your Compute Fleet request at any time. All VMs running inside the fleet are deleted. 
      - question: |
          What happens if I don't delete the Compute Fleet with Spot VMs, after workload completion? 
        answer: |
          Your Spot VMs continue to run until evicted and you incur billing charges. Your Standard VMs continue to run and you incur billing charges until you delete. 
      - question: |
          Can I specify target capacity using VM based attribute selection like vCPU or memory? 
        answer: |
          No, target capacity is set using VM instance attribute only. 
      - question: |
          Can I mix multiple CPU architectures while configuring my Compute Fleet? 
        answer: |
          No, you can't mix multiple CPU architectures in a single Compute Fleet request. 
      - question: |
          Can I configure start and stop time for my Compute Fleet? 
        answer: |
          No, there's no start and stop time configuration available on Compute Fleet.
