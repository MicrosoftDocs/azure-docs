# I received an email that my services might be interrupted

If we are unable to process your payment for some reason, you might receive an email with a message similar to:

**We have been unable to charge your credit card for your subscription. To prevent any service interruptions, please update your payment information.**

This can occur if your account is past due. If so, see this article for instructions to make a credit card or invoice payment:
[Why have you received a notification that your Azure subscription has a past due balance](billing-azure-subscription-past-due-balance.md).

If your Azure issue is not addressed in this article, visit the Azure forums on [MSDN and the Stack Overflow](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/forums/). You can post your issue on these forums or to @AzureSupport on Twitter. Also, you can file an Azure support request by selecting **Get support** on the [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/) site.

If you need help opening a ticket see [How to create a support ticket for Azure billing and subscription issues](billing-how-to-create-billing-support-ticket.md).
