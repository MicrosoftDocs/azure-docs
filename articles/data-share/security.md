# Security overview for Azure Data Share

This article provides a security overview of the Azure Data Share service.

## Security overview

Azure Data Share uses the underlying security that Azure offers to protect data at rest and in transit. Data is encrypted at rest, where supported by the underlying data store. Data is also encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2. Metadata about a data share is also encrypted at rest and in transit. Azure Data Share doesn't store contents of the customer data being shared.

Azure Data Share uses managed identity (previously known as MSI) to access data stores that are being used for data sharing. There's no exchange of credentials between a data provider and a data consumer. For more information on managed identity, see [Managed Identities for Azure Resources](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities.md). For more information on roles and permissions required to share data, see [Roles and requirements](concepts-roles-permissions.md).

## Access control

Access controls to Azure Data Share can be set on the Data Share resource level to ensure it's accessed by those that are authorized. Owners and Contributors on a Data Share resource can share data, receive shares, and make changes to existing shares. A Reader of a Data Share resource can view shares, but canâ€™t make changes.

Once a share is created or received, users with proper permission to the Data Share resource can make changes. When a user who creates or receives a share leaves the organization, it doesn't terminate the share or stop flow of data. Other users with proper permission to the Data Share resource can continue to manage the share.

## Share data from or to data stores with firewall enabled

To share data from or to storage accounts with firewall turned on, you need to enable **Allow trusted Microsoft services** in your storage account. See [Configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#trusted-microsoft-services) for details.
