# Azure security baseline for Azure Data Share

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Data Share. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Data Share. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Data Share have been excluded.

 
To see how Azure Data Share completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Data Share security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

Activity logs can be used to find an error when troubleshooting or to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource.

Enable diagnostic logs for Azure Data Share, specifically the diagnostic logs for MicrosoftDataShareSentShareSnapshotsLog &amp; MicrosoftDataShareReceivedShareSnapshotsLog. These logs will enable you to capture key information like synchronization start time, end time, status and other details. These logs can be critical for later investigating security incidents and performing forensic exercises.
