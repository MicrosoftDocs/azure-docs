## What's supported

### Share data

Azure Data Share supports sharing full data snapshots from several SQL resources in Azure. Incremental snapshots aren't currently supported for these resources.

|Resource type | Share tables   | Share views |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Azure SQL Database    | Yes       | Yes      |
|Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly Azure SQL DW)|Yes   |Yes|
|Synapse Analytics (workspace) dedicated SQL pool|Yes   |No|

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, Azure Data Share doesn't support sharing from these resources:
>
> - Azure Synapse Analytics (workspace) serverless SQL pool
> - Azure SQL databases with Always Encrypted configured

### Receive data

Data consumers can choose to accept shared data into several Azure resources:

- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Synapse Analytics

Shared data in **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2** or **Azure Blob Storage** can be stored as a csv or parquet file. Full data snapshots overwrite the contents of the target file if already exists.

Shared data in **Azure SQL Database** and **Azure Synapse Analytics** is stored in tables. If the target table doesn't already exist, Azure Data Share creates the SQL table with the source schema. If a target table with the same name already exists, it will be dropped and overwritten with the latest full snapshot.

>[!NOTE]
> For source SQL tables with dynamic data masking, data will appear masked on the recipient side.

### Supported data types

When you share data from a SQL source, the following mappings are used from SQL Server data types to Azure Data Share interim data types during the snapshot process.

>[!NOTE]
>
> 1. For data types that map to the Decimal interim type, currently snapshot supports precision up to 28. If you have data that requires precision larger than 28, consider converting to a string.
> 1. If you're sharing data from Azure SQL database to Azure Synapse Analytics, not all data types are supported. Refer to [Table data types in dedicated SQL pool](../synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-tables-data-types.md) for details.

| SQL Server data type | Azure Data Share interim data type |
|:--- |:--- |
| bigint |Int64 |
| binary |Byte[] |
| bit |Boolean |
| char |String, Char[] |
| date |DateTime |
| Datetime |DateTime |
| datetime2 |DateTime |
| Datetimeoffset |DateTimeOffset |
| Decimal |Decimal |
| FILESTREAM attribute (varbinary(max)) |Byte[] |
| Float |Double |
| image |Byte[] |
| int |Int32 |
| money |Decimal |
| nchar |String, Char[] |
| ntext |String, Char[] |
| numeric |Decimal |
| nvarchar |String, Char[] |
| real |Single |
| rowversion |Byte[] |
| smalldatetime |DateTime |
| smallint |Int16 |
| smallmoney |Decimal |
| sql_variant |Object |
| text |String, Char[] |
| time |TimeSpan |
| timestamp |Byte[] |
| tinyint |Int16 |
| uniqueidentifier |Guid |
| varbinary |Byte[] |
| varchar |String, Char[] |
| xml |String |

## Prerequisites to share data

To share data snapshots from your Azure SQL resources, you first need to prepare your environment. You'll need:

- An Azure subscription: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- An [Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart) or [Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly Azure SQL DW)](../synapse-analytics/get-started-create-workspace.md) with tables and views that you want to share.
- [An Azure Data Share account](share-your-data-portal.md#create-a-data-share-account).
- Your data recipient's Azure sign-in e-mail address (using their e-mail alias won't work).
- If your Azure SQL resource is in a different Azure subscription than your Azure Data Share account, register the [Microsoft.DataShare resource provider](concepts-roles-permissions.md#resource-provider-registration) in the subscription where your source Azure SQL resource is located.

### Source-specific prerequisites

There are also prerequisites for sharing that depend on where your data is coming from. Select your data share source and follow the steps:

- [Azure SQL Database or Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly Azure SQL DW)](#prerequisitesforsharingazuresqlorsynapse)
- [Azure Synapse Analytics (workspace) SQL pool](#prerequisitesforsharingazuresynapseworkspace)

## Receive shared data

### Open invitation

You can open invitation from email or directly from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

To open an invitation from email, check your inbox for an invitation from your data provider. The invitation is from Microsoft Azure, titled **Azure Data Share invitation from <yourdataprovider@domain.com>**. Select **View invitation** to see your invitation in Azure.

To open an invitation from Azure portal directly, search for **Data Share Invitations** in the Azure portal, which takes you to the list of Data Share invitations.

If you're a guest user on a tenant, you'll need to verify your email address for the tenant before viewing a Data Share invitation for the first time. Once verified, your email is valid for 12 months.

:::image type="content" source="./media/invitations.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the invitations page, showing a pending invitation.":::

Then, select the share you would like to view.

### Accept invitation

1. Make sure all fields are reviewed, including the **Terms of Use**. If you agree to the terms of use, you'll be required to check the box to indicate you agree.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/terms-of-use.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the invitation acceptance page, showing the terms of use highlighted and the agreement selected.":::

1. Under *Target Data Share Account*, select the Subscription and Resource Group that you'll be deploying your Data Share into.

1. For the **Data Share Account** field, select **Create new** if you don't have an existing Data Share account. Otherwise, select an existing Data Share account that you'd like to accept your data share into.

1. For the **Received Share Name** field, you might leave the default specified by the data provide, or specify a new name for the received share.

1. Once you've agreed to the terms of use and specified a Data Share account to manage your received share, Select **Accept and configure**. A share subscription will be created.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/accept-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the acceptance page, showing the target data share account information filled out.":::

If you don't want to accept the invitation, Select *Reject*.

### Configure received share

Follow the steps below to configure where you want to receive data.

1. Select **Datasets** tab. Check the box next to the dataset you'd like to assign a destination to. Select **+ Map to target** to choose a target data store.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/dataset-map-target.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the received shares page with the map to target button highlighted.":::

1. Select the target resource to store the shared data. Any data files or tables in the target data store with the same path and name will be overwritten. If you're receiving data into a SQL store and the **Allow Data Share to run the above 'create user' SQL script on my behalf** checkbox appears, check the checkbox. Otherwise, follow the instruction in prerequisites to run the script appear on the screen. This will give Data Share resource write permission to your target SQL DB.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/dataset-map-target-sql.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the map datasets to target window, showing available targets in the dropdown.":::

1. For snapshot-based sharing, if the data provider has created a snapshot schedule to provide regular updates to the data, you can also enable snapshot schedule by selecting the **Snapshot Schedule** tab. Check the box next to the snapshot schedule and select **+ Enable**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The first scheduled snapshot will start within one minute of the schedule time and the next snapshots will start within seconds of the scheduled time.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/enable-snapshot-schedule.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the snapshot schedule tab with the enable button selected.":::

### Trigger a snapshot

These steps only apply to snapshot-based sharing.

1. You can trigger a snapshot by selecting **Details** tab followed by **Trigger snapshot**. Here, you can trigger a full snapshot of your data. If it's your first time receiving data from your data provider, select full copy. When a snapshot is executing, the next snapshots won't start until the previous one is complete.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/trigger-snapshot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the received shares page, showing the trigger snapshot dropdown selected and the full copy option highlighted.":::

1. When the last run status is *successful*, go to target data store to view the received data. Select **Datasets**, and select the link in the Target Path.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/consumer-datasets.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the datasets tab showing a successful dataset selected.":::

### View history

This step only applies to snapshot-based sharing. To view history of your snapshots, select **History** tab. Here you'll find history of all snapshots that were generated for the past 30 days.

## Snapshot performance

SQL snapshot performance is impacted by many factors. It's always recommended to conduct your own performance testing. Below are some example factors impacting performance.

- Source or destination data store input/output operations per second (IOPS) and bandwidth.
- Hardware configuration (For example: vCores, memory, DWU) of the source and target SQL data store.
- Concurrent access to the source and target data stores. If you're sharing multiple tables and views from the same SQL data store, or receive multiple tables and views into the same SQL data store, performance will be impacted.
- Network bandwidth between the source and destination data stores, and location of source and target data stores.
- Size of the tables and views being shared. SQL snapshot sharing does a full copy of the entire table. If the size of the table grows over time, snapshot will take longer.

For large tables where incremental updates are desired, you can export updates to storage account and use the storage account’s incremental sharing capability for faster performance.

## Troubleshoot snapshot failure

The most common cause of snapshot failure is that Data Share doesn't have permission to the source or target data store. In order to grant Data Share permission to the source or target Azure SQL Database or Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly Azure SQL DW), you must run the provided SQL script when connecting to the SQL database using Microsoft Entra authentication. To troubleshoot other SQL snapshot failures, refer to [Troubleshoot snapshot failure](data-share-troubleshoot.md#snapshots).
