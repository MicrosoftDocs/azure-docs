# Monitor Azure Data Share status and history

This article explains how you can monitor your Azure Data Share status and history.

- As a data provider, you can monitor various aspects of your data sharing relationships. Details such as whether your data consumers accepted your invitation to the data share, and whether they created a share subscription and started to use your data, are all available to monitor.

- As a data consumer, you can monitor the snapshots that have been triggered into your Azure subscription.

You can also see Azure Monitor metrics, collect logs, analyze monitoring data, and create alerts for your Data Share shares. For information about all the monitoring options that are available for Data Share, see [Monitor Azure Data Share](monitor-data-share.md).

## Monitor invitation status

View the status of your data share invitations by navigating to Sent shares -> Invitations.

There are three states that your invitation can be in:

* Pending - Data share recipient hasn't yet accepted the invitation.
* Accepted - Data share recipient accepted the invitation.
* Rejected - Data share recipient rejected the invitation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you delete an invitation after it was accepted, it isn't equivalent to revoking access. If you would like to stop future snapshots from being copied into your data consumers storage account, you must revoke access through the *Share subscriptions* tab.

## Monitor share subscriptions

View the status of your share subscriptions by navigating to Sent Shares -> Share Subscriptions. This will give you details about active subscriptions created by your data consumers after accepting your invitation. You can stop future updates to your data consumer by selecting the share subscription and selecting *Revoke*.

## Snapshot history

In the **History** tab of a share, you're able to view when data is copied from data provider to data consumer's data store. You're able to monitor the frequency, duration, and status of each snapshot.

You can view more details about each snapshot run by selecting the run start date. Then select on the status for each dataset to view the amount of data transferred, number of files/records copied, duration of the snapshot, number of vCores used and error message if there's any.

Up to 30 days of snapshot history is displayed. If you need to save and see more than 30 days worth of history, you can use diagnostic setting.
