# How To: Revoke a consumer's share subscription

1. Navigate to your **Data Share Account** and go to **Sent Shares**. 
2. Select the share from which you would like to delete a share subscription. 
3. Click on the **Share Subscriptions** tab. Listed here are all of the share subscriptions to this data share.
4. Check the boxes next to the recipients whose share subscriptions you would like to delete.
