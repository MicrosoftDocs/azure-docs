For more information about the resource types for Azure Data Share, see [Data Share monitoring data reference](monitor-data-share-reference.md).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-data-storage](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-data-storage.md)]

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-platform-metrics](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-platform-metrics.md)]

To view charts for Data Share metrics, select **Metrics** under **Monitoring** in the left navigation of your Data Share page in the Azure portal.

For a full listing and descriptions of the available metrics for Data Share, see [Data Share monitoring data reference](monitor-data-share-reference.md#metrics).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-resource-logs](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-resource-logs.md)]

## Data Share status and history

To track Data Share invitation status, share subscription status, and snapshot history, select **Sent Shares** under **Data Share** in the left navigation of your Data Share page in the Azure portal. For more information and instructions, see [Monitor Data Share status and history](how-to-monitor.md).

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-kusto-queries](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-kusto-queries.md)]

To write queries and access example queries, select **Logs** under **Monitoring** in the left navigation of your Data Share page in the Azure portal, and then select the **Queries** tab. Here are a couple of example queries.

List of sent snapshots sorted by duration over the last seven days:

```kusto
// List sent snapshots by duration 
MicrosoftDataShareSentSnapshotLog
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d) 
| where StartTime != "" and EndTime  != "" 
| project StartTime , EndTime , DurationSeconds =(todatetime(EndTime)-todatetime(StartTime))/1s , ResourceName = split(_ResourceId,"/accounts/",1) 
| sort by DurationSeconds desc nulls last
```

Top 10 most frequent errors over the last seven days:

```kusto
// Frequent errors in received snapshots 
MicrosoftDataShareReceivedSnapshotLog 
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)  
| where Status == "Failed" 
| summarize count() by _ResourceId, DataSetType // Counting failed logs per datasettype
| top 10 by count_ desc nulls last
```

### Data Share alert rules

To create alerts for your Data Share monitoring data, select **Alerts** under **Monitoring** in the left navigation of your Data Share page in the Azure portal, and then select **Create alert rule**. You can select a signal and configure all the details to trigger and route the alert.

The following table lists some alert rules for Data Share. This is just a suggested list. You can set alerts for any metric, log entry, or activity log entry that's listed in the [Data Share monitoring data reference](monitor-data-share-reference.md).

| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
|Metrics |Received Share Failed Snapshots |Whenever the count Received Share Failed Snapshots is greater than 0|
|Activity log |Delete Data Share Account (Data Share Account) |Whenever the Activity Log has an event with Category='Administrative', Signal name='Delete Data Share Account (Data Share Account)'
