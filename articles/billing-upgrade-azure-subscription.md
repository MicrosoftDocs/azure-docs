# Upgrade your Azure Free Trial subscription to Pay-As-You-Go

Upgrade your [Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) subscription to [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) from the Azure Account Portal. You can upgrade your [Microsoft Imagine](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0144p/) subscription the same way.

1. Sign in to the [Azure Account Portal](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions) and navigate to the **subscriptions** tab.

2. In the subscription status section, select the **Click here to upgrade now** banner.

3. Select **Yes**, and then select **Upgrade now**.

When you upgrade from a Free Trial subscription to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, any benefits left over from your Free Trial such as the 30-day limit or the $200 credit to use on Azure services will continue until one of them is exhausted. The subscription upgrade will happen afterwards.
