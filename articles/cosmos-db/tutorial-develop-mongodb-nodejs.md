# Create a MongoDB app with Angular and Azure Cosmos DB 

This multi-part tutorial demonstrates how to create a new [MongoDB API](mongodb-introduction.md) app with Express, Angular, and Node.js (the MEAN stack), and connect it to your Azure Cosmos DB database. Azure Cosmos DB supports MongoDB client connections, so you can use Azure Cosmos DB in place of MongoDB, but use the same code that you use for MongoDB apps but with added benefits. These benefits from Azure Cosmos DB are easy cloud deployment, scaling, security, global replicated data, multi-model support, and super-fast reads and writes. 

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed multi-model database service. It enables you to quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases that benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

This multi-part tutorial covers the following tasks:

> * [Create a Node.js Express app with the Angular CLI](tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part2.md)
> * [Build the UI with Angular](tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part3.md)
> * [Create an Azure Cosmos DB account using the Azure CLI](tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part4.md) 
> * [Use Mongoose to connect to Azure Cosmos DB](tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part5.md)
> * [Add Post, Put, and Delete functions to the app](tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part6.md)

Want to do build this same app with React? See the [React tutorial video series](tutorial-develop-mongodb-react.md).

## Finished project 

This tutorial walks you through the steps to build the application step-by-step. If you want to download the finished project, you can get the completed application from the [angular-cosmosdb repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/angular-cosmosdb) on GitHub.

## Next steps

In this part of the tutorial, you've done the following:
