# Create an Angular app with Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB

This multi-part tutorial demonstrates how to create a new app written in Node.js with Express and Angular and then connect it to your [Cosmos account configured with Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB](mongodb-introduction.md).

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed multi-model database service. It enables you to quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases that benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Cosmos DB. 

This multi-part tutorial covers the following tasks:

> * [Create a Node.js Express app with the Angular CLI](tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part2.md)
> * [Build the UI with Angular](tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part3.md)
> * [Create an Azure Cosmos DB account using the Azure CLI](tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part4.md) 
> * [Use Mongoose to connect to Azure Cosmos DB](tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part5.md)
> * [Add Post, Put, and Delete functions to the app](tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part6.md)

Want to do build this same app with React? See the [React tutorial video series](tutorial-develop-mongodb-react.md).
