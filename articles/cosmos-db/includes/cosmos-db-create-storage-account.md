The easiest way to create an Azure storage account is by using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). To learn more, see [Create a storage account](../../storage/common/storage-account-create.md).

You can also create an Azure storage account by using [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/module/az.storage/) or [Azure CLI](../../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-cli.md).

If you prefer not to create a storage account at this time, you can also use the Azure Storage Emulator to run and test your code in a local environment. For more information, see [Use the Azure Storage Emulator for development and testing](../../storage/common/storage-use-emulator.md).
