  Manage an Azure Cosmos DB account by using the Azure portal

introduction: |
  [!INCLUDE[NoSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table](includes/appliesto-nosql-mongodb-cassandra-gremlin-table.md)]

  This article describes how to manage various tasks on an Azure Cosmos DB account by using the Azure portal. Azure Cosmos DB can also be managed with other Azure management clients including [Azure PowerShell](manage-with-powershell.md), [Azure CLI](nosql/manage-with-cli.md), [Azure Resource Manager templates](./manage-with-templates.md), [Bicep](nosql/manage-with-bicep.md), and [Terraform](nosql/samples-terraform.md).

  > [!TIP]
  > The management API for Azure Cosmos DB or *control plane* is not designed for high request volumes like the rest of the service. To learn more see [Control Plane Service Limits](concepts-limits.md#control-plane)

      Create an account
    summary: |
      Follow the steps:
    steps:
      - |
        From the Azure portal menu or the **Home page**, select **Create a resource**.
      - |
        Search for **Azure Cosmos DB**. Select **Create** > **Azure Cosmos DB**.
      - |
        On the **Create an Azure Cosmos DB account** page, select the **Create** option within the **Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL** section.

        Azure Cosmos DB provides several APIs:

          - NoSQL, for document data
          - PostgreSQL
          - MongoDB, for document data
          - Apache Cassandra
          - Table
          - Apache Gremlin, for graph data

        To learn more about the API for NoSQL, see [Welcome to Azure Cosmos DB](introduction.md).

      - |
        In the **Create Azure Cosmos DB Account** page, enter the basic settings for the new Azure Cosmos DB account.
      
        |Setting|Value|Description |
        |---|---|---|
        |Subscription|Subscription name|Select the Azure subscription that you want to use for this Azure Cosmos DB account. |
        |Resource Group|Resource group name|Select a resource group, or select **Create new**, then enter a unique name for the new resource group. |
        |Account Name|A unique name|Enter a name to identify your Azure Cosmos DB account. Because *documents.azure.com* is appended to the name that you provide to create your URI, use a unique name. The name can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-) character. It must be 3-44 characters.|
        |Location|The region closest to your users|Select a geographic location to host your Azure Cosmos DB account. Use the location that is closest to your users to give them the fastest access to the data.|
        |Capacity mode|**Provisioned throughput** or **Serverless**|Select **Provisioned throughput** to create an account in [provisioned throughput](set-throughput.md) mode. Select **Serverless** to create an account in [serverless](serverless.md) mode.|
        |Apply Azure Cosmos DB free tier discount|**Apply** or **Do not apply**|With Azure Cosmos DB free tier, you get the first 1000 RU/s and 25 GB of storage for free in an account. Learn more about [free tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cosmos-db/).|
        |Limit total account throughput|Selected or not|Limit the total amount of throughput that can be provisioned on this account. This limit prevents unexpected charges related to provisioned throughput. You can update or remove this limit after your account is created.|

        You can have up to one free tier Azure Cosmos DB account per Azure subscription and must opt in when creating the account. If you don't see the option to apply the free tier discount, another account in the subscription has already been enabled with free tier.

      - |
        In the **Global Distribution** tab, configure the following details. You can leave the default values for this quickstart:

        |Setting|Value|Description |
        |---|---|---|
        |Geo-Redundancy|Disable|Enable or disable global distribution on your account by pairing your region with a pair region. You can add more regions to your account later.|
        |Multi-region Writes|Disable|Multi-region writes capability allows you to take advantage of the provisioned throughput for your databases and containers across the globe.|
        |Availability Zones|Disable|Availability Zones help you further improve availability and resiliency of your application.|
    
        > [!NOTE]
        > The following options are not available if you select **Serverless** as the **Capacity mode** in the previous **Basics** page:
        >
        > - Geo-redundancy
        > - Multi-region Writes

      - |
        Optionally, you can configure more details in the following tabs:

          - **Networking**. Configure [access from a virtual network](how-to-configure-vnet-service-endpoint.md).
          - **Backup Policy**. Configure either [periodic](periodic-backup-restore-introduction.md) or [continuous](provision-account-continuous-backup.md) backup policy.
          - **Encryption**. Use either service-managed key or a [customer-managed key](how-to-setup-cmk.md#create-a-new-azure-cosmos-account).
          - **Tags**. Tags are name/value pairs that enable you to categorize resources and view consolidated billing by applying the same tag to multiple resources and resource groups.

      - |
        Select **Review + create**.

      - |
        Review the account settings, and then select **Create**. It takes a few minutes to create the account. Wait for the portal page to display **Your deployment is complete**.

      Add/remove regions from your database account
    summary: |
      > [!TIP]
      > When a new region is added, all data must be fully replicated and committed into the new region before the region is marked as available. The amount of time this operation takes depends upon how much data is stored within the account. If an [asynchronous throughput scaling operation](scaling-provisioned-throughput-best-practices.md#background-on-scaling-rus) is in progress, the throughput scale-up operation is paused and resumes automatically when the add/remove region operation is complete.
    steps:
      - |
        Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
      - |
        Go to your Azure Cosmos DB account and select **Replicate data globally** in the resource menu.
      - |
        To add regions, select the hexagons on the map with the **+** label that corresponds to your desired region(s). Alternatively, to add a region, select the **+ Add region** option and choose a region from the drop-down menu.
      - |
        To remove regions, clear one or more regions from the map by selecting the blue hexagons with check marks. You can also select the "wastebasket" (🗑) icon next to the region on the right side.

      - |
        To save your changes, select **OK**.

          :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-database-account/add-region.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Replicate data globally menu, highlighting a region.":::

        In a single-region write mode, you can't remove the write region. You must fail over to a different region before you can delete the current write region.

        In a multi-region write mode, you can add or remove any region, if you have at least one region.

        ## <a id="configure-multiple-write-regions"></a>Configure multiple write-regions

        Open the **Replicate data globally** tab and select **Enable** to enable multi-region writes. After you enable multi-region writes, all the read regions that you currently have on the account will become read and write regions.

      Enable service-managed failover for your Azure Cosmos DB account
    summary: |
      The Service-Managed failover option allows Azure Cosmos DB to fail over to the region with the highest failover priority with no user action should a region become unavailable. When service-managed failover is enabled, region priority can be modified. Your account must have two or more regions to enable service-managed failover.
    steps:
      - |
        From your Azure Cosmos DB account, open the **Replicate data globally** pane.
      - |
        At the top of the pane, select **Service-Managed Failover**.

          :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-database-account/replicate-data-globally.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the replicate data globally menu.":::
      - |
        On the **Service-Managed Failover** pane, make sure that **Enable Service-Managed Failover** is set to **ON**.
      - |
        Select **Save**.

      Set failover priorities for your Azure Cosmos DB account
    summary: |
      After an Azure Cosmos DB account is configured for service-managed failover, the failover priority for regions can be changed.

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > You can't modify the write region (failover priority of zero) when the account is configured for service-managed failover. To change the write region, you must disable service-managed failover and do a manual failover.
    steps:
      - |
        From your Azure Cosmos DB account, open the **Replicate data globally** pane.
      - |
        At the top of the pane, select **Service-Managed Failover**.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-database-account/replicate-data-globally.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Replicate data globally menu.":::
      - |
        On the **Service-Managed Failover** pane, make sure that **Enable Service-Managed Failover** is set to **ON**.
      - |
        To modify the failover priority, drag the read regions via the three dots on the left side of the row that appear when you hover over them.
      - |
        Select **Save**.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-database-account/automatic-failover.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Service-Managed failover portal menu.":::

      Perform manual failover on an Azure Cosmos DB account
    summary: |
      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > The Azure Cosmos DB account must be configured for manual failover for this operation to succeed.

      > [!NOTE]
      > If you perform a manual failover operation while an asynchronous throughput scaling operation is in progress, the throughput scale-up operation will be paused. It resumes automatically when the failover operation is complete. For more information, see [Best practices for scaling provisioned throughput (RU/s)](scaling-provisioned-throughput-best-practices.md#background-on-scaling-rus)
    steps:
      - |
        Go to your Azure Cosmos DB account and open the **Replicate data globally** menu.
      - |
        At the top of the menu, select **Manual Failover**.

          :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-database-account/replicate-data-globally.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Replicate data globally menu.":::
