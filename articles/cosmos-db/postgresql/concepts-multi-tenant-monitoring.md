# Multi-Tenant Monitoring

[!INCLUDE [PostgreSQL](../includes/appliesto-postgresql.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Applicable to Citus 11.3 & newer versions

Multi-tenant statistics monitoring is a crucial aspect of managing a multi-tenant SaaS platform. The feature offers insights into CPU usage and the overall query volume, attributed to specific tenants. Tracking of statistics is done locally on nodes where tenant resides and are made accessible at both tenant and node level of granularity. The collected statistics allows in quick identification of noisy neighbors & helps in better optimizing the resource usage in your cluster.

## Conceptual model

Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL uses row-based sharding at core, which means that each distributed table contains a distributed column - denoted as tenant key. Tenant key enables splitting data across shards, where each shard contains one or more tenants. Shards themselves are distributed among the nodes in the cluster, enabling horizontal scaling of your database.

## Node Parameters

### citus.stat_tenants_log_level (text)
Controls the logging insights. Valid values are `DEBUG5`, `DEBUG4`, `DEBUG3`, `DEBUG2`, `DEBUG1`, `DEBUG`, `LOG`, `INFO`, `NOTICE`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`. Default is `LOG`.

### citus.stat_tenants_limit (int)
Controls the number of tenants (top `N`) to be tracked. Default is `100`.

### citus.stat_tenants_period (int)
Controls the time window (in seconds) to which tenant statistics are allocated. Default is `60 * 60 * 24` seconds.

### citus.stat_tenants_track (boolean)
Enables or disables the tracking of tenant statistics. Default is `None`. Modification to the node parameter requires a restart.

## Statistics views 

### pg_catalog.citus_stat_tenants

The `citus_stat_tenants` view tracks these statistics within time buckets. Once a period ends, its statistics are stored in the last period, providing you with ongoing and completed period insights. Metrics currently tracked within the view include read query count, overall query count & CPU cycle consumed at the node, colocation group & tenant granularity.

|       ColumnName            |    Type       |                    Description                                                              |
|-----------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| nodeid                      | INT           | Autogenerated identifier for an individual node.                                            |
| colocation_id               | INT           | [Colocation group](concepts-colocation.md) to which this table belongs.                     |
| tenant_attribute            | VARCHAR(100)  | Represents the distribution column\shard key.                                               |
| read_count_in_this_period   | INT           | Represents select queries count for ongoing time period (defined by stat_tenants_period).   |
| read_count_in_last_period   | INT           | Represents select queries count for previous time period (defined by stat_tenants_period).  |
| query_count_in_this_period  | INT           | Represents overall queries count for ongoing time period (defined by stat_tenants_period).  |
| query_count_in_last_period  | INT           | Represents overall queries count for previous time period (defined by stat_tenants_period). |
| cpu_usage_in_this_period    | DOUBLE        | Represents seconds of CPU time consumed for this tenant in ongoing period.                  |
| cpu_usage_in_last_period    | DOUBLE        | Represents seconds of CPU time consumed for this tenant in previous period.                 |

### pg_catalog.citus_stat_tenants_reset()
The function resets the collected metrics within citus_stat_tenants view.

## Operations tracked
When you enable this feature, accounting is activated for SQL commands such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `SELECT`. This accounting is specifically designed for a `single tenant`. A query qualifies to be a single tenant query, if the query planner could restrict the query to a single shard or single tenant.

In a multi-tenant environment, each tenant typically has access to their own dataset, and as a result, queries are filtered based on tenant keys. Any query in such systems, which operates across tenants gets initiated by the system administrator or the landlord & aren't traced back to individual tenants. For example, if the landlord needs to generate a report that includes aggregated data from all tenants, a cross-tenant query gets initiated by the landlord and not associated\accounted against any specific tenant.

```postgresql
CREATE TABLE organizations (id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);

SELECT create_distributed_table ('organizations', 'id');

INSERT INTO organizations (name) VALUES ('Teleflora'); -- tracked
INSERT INTO organizations (name) VALUES ('BloomThat'); -- tracked
INSERT INTO organizations (name) VALUES ('UrbanStems');-- tracked

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organizations where id = 1; -- tracked

 count 
-------
     1
(1 row)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organizations where id IN (1,2); -- untracked

 count
-------
     1
(1 row)

UPDATE organizations SET name = 'Bloomers' WHERE id = 2; -- tracked

-- UPDATE 1

DELETE FROM organizations WHERE id = 3; -- tracked

-- DELETE 1
```

```postgresql
SELECT tenant_attribute,
       read_count_in_this_period,
       query_count_in_this_period,
       cpu_usage_in_this_period
FROM citus_stat_tenants;
```
```text
 tenant_attribute | read_count_in_this_period | query_count_in_this_period | cpu_usage_in_this_period 
------------------+---------------------------+----------------------------+--------------------------
 1                |                         2 |                          3 |                        0
 2                |                         0 |                          2 |                        0
 3                |                         0 |                          2 |                        0
(3 rows)
```
