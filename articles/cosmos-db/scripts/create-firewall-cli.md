# Azure Cosmos DB: Create a firewall using the Azure CLI

This sample CLI script creates a firewall policy for any kind of Azure Cosmos DB account. 

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

## Sample script

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```
