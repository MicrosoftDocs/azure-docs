# Replicate an Azure Cosmos DB database account in multiple regions and configure failover priorities using the Azure CLI

This sample replicates any kind of Azure Cosmos DB database account in multiple regions and configures failover priorities using the Azure CLI.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/cosmosdb/scale-cosmosdb-replicate-multiple-regions/scale-cosmosdb-replicate-multiple-regions.sh?highlight=21-31 "Scale Azure Cosmos DB into multiple regions")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az cosmosdb update](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/cosmosdb#az-cosmosdb-update) | Updates an Azure Cosmos DB account. |
| [az group delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |

## Next steps

For more information on the Azure CLI, see [Azure CLI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure).

Additional Azure Cosmos DB CLI script samples can be found in the [Azure Cosmos DB CLI documentation](../cli-samples.md).
