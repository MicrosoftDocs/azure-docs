# Create a database and collection for MongoDB API for Azure Cosmos DB using Azure CLI
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-mongodb-api](../../../includes/appliesto-mongodb-api.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This article requires version 2.9.1 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../../../cli_scripts/cosmosdb/mongodb/create.sh "Create an Azure Cosmos DB MongoDB API account, database, and collection.")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resourceGroupName
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az_group_create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az cosmosdb create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb#az_cosmosdb_create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos DB account. |
| [az cosmosdb mongodb database create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/mongodb/database#az_cosmosdb_mongodb_database_create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos MongoDB API database. |
| [az cosmosdb mongodb collection create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb/mongodb/collection#az_cosmosdb_mongodb_collection_create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos MongoDB API collection. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/resource#az_resource_delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
