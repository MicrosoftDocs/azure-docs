# Azure Cosmos DB: Create an MongoDB API account using the Azure CLI

This sample CLI script creates an Azure Cosmos DB MongoDB API account, database, and collection. 

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/cosmosdb/create-cosmosdb-mongodb-account/create-cosmosdb-mongodb-account.sh?highlight=15-35 "Create an Azure Cosmos DB MongoDB API account, database, and collection")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az cosmosdb create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb#az-cosmosdb-create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos DB account. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/resource#az-resource-delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |

## Next steps
