# Azure Cosmos DB: Build a Java application using the Graph API

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases, all of which benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

This quick start demonstrates how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account for Graph API (preview), database, and graph using the Azure portal. You then build and run a console app using the OSS [Gremlin Java](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.tinkerpop/gremlin-driver) driver.  

## Prerequisites

* Before you can run this sample, you must have the following prerequisites:
   * JDK 1.7+ (Run `apt-get install default-jdk` if you don't have JDK), and set environment variables like `JAVA_HOME`
   * Maven (Run `apt-get install maven` if you don't have Maven)

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Create a database account

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-graph](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-graph.md)]

## Add a graph

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-graph](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-graph.md)]

## Clone the sample application

Now let's clone a Graph API (preview) app from github, set the connection string, and run it. You see how easy it is to work with data programmatically. 

1. Open a git terminal window, such as git bash, and `cd` to a working directory.  

2. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-graph-java-getting-started.git
    ```

## Review the code

Let's make a quick review of what's happening in the app. Open the `Program.java` file and you find that these lines of code. 

* The Gremlin `Client` is initialized from the configuration in `src/remote.yaml`.

    ```java
    Cluster cluster = Cluster.build(new File("src/remote.yaml")).create();
    
    Client client = cluster.connect();
    ```

* A series of Gremlin steps are executed using the `client.submit` method.

    ```java
    ResultSet results = client.submit("g.V()");

    CompletableFuture<List<Result>> completableFutureResults = results.all();
    List<Result> resultList = completableFutureResults.get();

    for (Result result : resultList) {
        System.out.println(result.toString());
    }
    ```
## Update your connection string

Now go back to the Azure portal to get your connection string information and copy it into the app.

1. In the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/), in your Azure Cosmos DB account, in the left navigation click **Keys**, and then click **Read-write Keys**. You use the copy buttons on the right side of the screen to copy the URI and Primary Key into the `Program.java` file in the next step.

2. Open the `src/remote.yaml` file. 

3. Fill in your *host*, *port*, *username*, *password*, *connectionPool*, and *serializer* configurations in the `src/remote.yaml` file:

    Setting|Suggested value|Description
    ---|---|---
    Hosts|***.graphs.azure.com|Your graph service URI, which you can retrieve from the Azure portal
    Port|443|Set to 443
    Username|*Your username*|The resource of the form `/dbs/<db>/colls/<coll>`.
    Password|*Your primary master key*|Your primary master key for the Azure Cosmos DB
    ConnectionPool|{enableSsl: true}|Your connection pool setting for SSL
    Serializer|{ className:org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.<br>driver.ser.GraphSONMessageSerializerV1d0,<br> config: { serializeResultToString: true }}|Set to this value

## Run the console app

1. Run `mvn package` in a terminal to install required Java packages.

2. Run `mvn exec:java -D exec.mainClass=GetStarted.Program` in a terminal to start your Java application.

You can now go back to Data Explorer and see query, modify, and work with this new data. 

## Browse using the Data Explorer

You can now go back to Data Explorer in the Azure portal and browse and query your new graph data.

* In Data Explorer, the new database appears in the Collections pane. Expand **graphdb**, **graphcoll**, and then click **Graph**.

    The data generated by the sample app is displayed in the Graphs pane.

## Review SLAs in the Azure portal

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this app, delete all resources created by this quickstart in the Azure portal with the following steps: 

1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **Resource groups** and then click the name of the resource you created. 
2. On your resource group page, click **Delete**, type the name of the resource to delete in the text box, and then click **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you've learned how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account, create a graph using the Data Explorer, and run an app. You can now build more complex queries and implement powerful graph traversal logic using Gremlin.
