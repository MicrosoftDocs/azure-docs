## Release notes

### <a name="1.0.0"/>1.0.0
* General availability release

## Release and retirement dates
Microsoft will provide notification at least **12 months** in advance of retiring an SDK in order to smooth the transition to a newer/supported version.

New features and functionality and optimizations are only added to the current SDK, as such it is  recommended that you always upgrade to the latest SDK version as early as possible.
