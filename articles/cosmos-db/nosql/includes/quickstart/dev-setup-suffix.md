1. During initialization, configure a unique environment name.

    > [!TIP]
    > The environment name will also be used as the target resource group name. For this quickstart, consider using `msdocs-cosmos-db`.

1. Deploy the Azure Cosmos DB account using `azd up`. The Bicep templates also deploy a sample web application.

    ```azurecli
    azd up
    ```

1. During the provisioning process, select your subscription and desired location. Wait for the provisioning process to complete. The process can take **approximately five minutes**.

1. Once the provisioning of your Azure resources is done, a URL to the running web application is included in the output.

    ```output
    Deploying services (azd deploy)
    
      (✓) Done: Deploying service web
    - Endpoint: <https://[container-app-sub-domain].azurecontainerapps.io>
    
    SUCCESS: Your application was provisioned and deployed to Azure in 5 minutes 0 seconds.
    ```

1. Use the URL in the console to navigate to your web application in the browser. Observe the output of the running app.
