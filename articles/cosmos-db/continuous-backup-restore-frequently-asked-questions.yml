    questions:
      - question: |
          How much time does it takes to restore?
        answer: |
          Restore time is a function of the data size, the amount of log backup that needs to be replayed, and the number of partitions that need to be restored. Restoring 1 terabyte of data typically takes 30 to 90 minutes.
      - question: |
          Can I submit the restore time in local time?
        answer: |
          The restore might not happen, depending on whether key resources like databases or containers existed at that time. You can verify by entering the time and looking at a selected database or container for that time. If that is no resources exist to restore, the restore process doesn't work.
      - question: |
          How can I track the restoration of an account?

      - question: |
          How can I find out whether a continuous backup mode account was restored from another account?
        answer: |
          You can identify whether an account is restored and gets the restore details by using the [Azure portal](restore-account-continuous-backup.md#get-the-restore-details-portal), [Azure PowerShell](restore-account-continuous-backup.md#get-the-restore-details-powershell), and the [Azure CLI](restore-account-continuous-backup.md#get-the-restore-details-cli).          
      - question: |
          What is "instanceId" in the account definition?

      - question: |
          Is continuous backup supported for Azure Synapse Link-enabled accounts?
        answer: |
          The capability to turn on Synapse Link in database accounts with continuous backup enabled is in public preview now. The opposite situation, to turn on continuous backup in Synapse Link enabled databases accounts, is still not supported yet.
