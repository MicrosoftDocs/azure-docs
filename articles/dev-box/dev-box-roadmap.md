# Microsoft Dev Box roadmap

This roadmap presents a set of planned feature releases that underscores Microsoft's commitment to deliver the most secure and productive developer experience from the cloud. This feature list offers a glimpse into our plans for the next six months, highlighting key features we're developing. It's not exhaustive but shows major investments. Some features might release as previews and evolve based on your feedback before becoming generally available. We always listen to your input, so the timing, design, and delivery of some features might change.

Key Dev Box deliverables can be grouped under the following themes:

- Ready-to-code development environment

- Enterprise management

- Fundamental performance & reliability

## Ready-to-code development environment

Microsoft Dev Box can significantly enhance developer productivity by minimizing configuration time and IT overhead compared to traditional virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solutions. We're making it incredibly easy and quick for developers to create ready-to-code environments tailored to their specific projects. Not only are we reducing the time required to set up Dev Box machines, but we're also introducing innovative new customization options for both teams and individuals.

**Config-as-code workflow improvements**

- [Team customizations](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Share-customization-files-across-my-team/10729596?sort=newest) and [Dev Center Imaging](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Speed-up-Dev-Box-customization-using-a-c/10729598): 

    - As a project lead or a dev center admin, you can now use custom images to create image definitions, instead of just marketplace images.

    - As a project lead or a dev center admin, you can specify a custom network connection to use when building images, so that you can access and fetch resources that are only accessible from your custom virtual networks.

    - You can now use the CLI and VS Code extension to debug tasks that use the PowerShell and Winget primitives, and you can set them to have a custom time out for long running scripts.

    - As a project lead or a dev center admin you can use the Dev Box Visual Studio Code extension, now powered by GitHub Copilot chat, to create customization files.

**Developer onboarding & experience**

- [Region Selection Optimization for Dev Box Creation](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Region-selection-optimization-based-on-l/10784537): As a developer, easily create your new Dev Box in an optimal region based on your location. As a dev center admin, optimize the location of existing Dev Box machines based on end user location and available capacity.

## Enterprise management

Microsoft Dev Box aims to deliver centralized governance based on organizational standards for security, compliance, and cost controls. During this period, we're reducing the time it takes enterprises to get started with Dev Box by making it easier to set up a proof of concept (POC) and then move to production. We're also improving our monitoring, cost control, security, and privacy capabilities.

**Streamlined and flexible onboarding for enterprises**

## Fundamental performance & reliability

Microsoft Dev Box aims to provide a "like-local" developer experience that is as responsive and seamless as working on a local machine.
