# Manage quota for Microsoft Dev Box resources

This article describes how to determine your quota limits and usage. It also describes how to submit a support request to increase the number of resources for Microsoft Dev Box in your Azure subscription. 

To ensure that resources are available for customers, Microsoft Dev Box has a limit on the number of each type of resource that can be used in a subscription. This limit is called a _quota_.  

There are different types of quotas related to Dev Box that you might see in the Developer portal and Azure portal. Quota types include quota for Dev Box vCPU for box creation, and resource limits for Dev Centers, network connections, and Dev Box Definitions.

Here are some examples of quota limits you might encounter:

- There are limits on the number of vCPUs available for dev boxes. You might encounter this quota error in the developer portal during dev box creation. For example, if dev box users encounter a vCPU quota error such as *QuotaExceeded* during dev box creation there might be a need to increase this quota. 
- There are default subscription limits for dev centers, network connections, and dev box definitions. For more information, see [Microsoft Dev Box limits](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md#microsoft-dev-box-limits).

When you reach the limit for a resource in your subscription, you can request an increase to extend the number of resources available. The request process allows the Microsoft Dev Box team to ensure your subscription isn't involved in any cases of fraud or unintentional, sudden large-scale deployments. 

## Prerequisites

- To create a support request, your Azure account needs the [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner), [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor), or [Support Request Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#support-request-contributor) role at the subscription level.

## Determine resource usage and quota for Dev Box through QMS  

To help you understand where and how you're using your quota, the Quota Management System (QMS) provides a detailed report of resource usage across resources types in each of your subscriptions on the **My Quotas** page. QMS provides several advantages to the Dev Box service including:  

- Improved User Experience for an easier requesting process.
- Expedited approvals via automation based on thresholds.  
- Metrics to monitor quota usage in existing subscription.

Understanding quota limits that affect your Dev Box resources helps you to plan for future use. You can check the [default subscription limit](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits?branch=main#microsoft-dev-box-limits) for each resource, view your current usage, and determine how much quota remains in each region. By monitoring the rate at which your quota is used, you can plan and prepare to request a quota limit increase before you reach the quota limit for the resource. 

## Request a quota increase through QMS

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and go to the subscription you want to examine. 

1. In the Azure portal search bar, enter *quota*, and select **Quotas** from the results.  

1. On the Quotas page, select **Dev Box**.

## Initiate a support request by using Support + troubleshooting

1. On the Azure portal home page, select the **Support + Troubleshooting** icon (question mark) on the toolbar.
