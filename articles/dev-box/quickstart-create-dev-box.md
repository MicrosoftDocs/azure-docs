# Quickstart: Create and connect to a dev box by using the Microsoft Dev Box developer portal


In this quickstart, you get started with Microsoft Dev Box by creating a dev box through the developer portal. After you create the dev box, you can connect to it through a browser or through a Remote Desktop client like Windows App.

You can create and manage multiple dev boxes as a dev box user. Create a dev box for each task that you're working on, and create multiple dev boxes within a single project to help streamline your workflow. For example, you might switch to another dev box to fix a bug in a previous version, or if you need to work on a different part of the application.

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you need:

- Your organization must have configured Microsoft Dev Box with at least one project and dev box pool before you can create a dev box. 
    - Platform engineers can follow these steps to configure Microsoft Dev Box: [Quickstart: Configure Microsoft Dev Box](quickstart-configure-dev-box-service.md).  
- You must have permissions as a [Dev Box User](quickstart-configure-dev-box-service.md#provide-access-to-a-dev-box-project) for a project that has an available dev box pool. If you don't have permissions to a project, contact your administrator.

## Create a dev box

Microsoft Dev Box enables you to create cloud-hosted developer workstations in a self-service way. You can create and manage dev boxes by using the developer portal.

Depending on the project configuration and your permissions, you have access to different projects and associated dev box configurations. If you have a choice of projects and dev box pools, select the project and dev box pool that best fits your needs. For example, you might choose a project that has a dev box pool located near to you for least latency.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You organization must have configured Microsoft Dev Box with at least one project and dev box pool before you can create a dev box. If you don't see any projects or dev box pools, contact your administrator.

To create a dev box in the Microsoft Dev Box developer portal:

[!INCLUDE [developer-portal-landing-page](includes/developer-portal-landing-page.md)]

3. In **Add a dev box**, enter the following values:

   | Setting | Value |
   |---|---|
   | **Name** | Enter a name for your dev box. Dev box names must be unique within a project. |
   | **Project** | Select a project from the dropdown list. |
   | **Dev box pool** | Select a pool from the dropdown list, which includes all the dev box pools for that project. Choose a dev box pool near to you for least latency.|

   After you make your selections, the page shows you the following information:

   - How many dev boxes you can create in the project that you selected, if the project has limits configured.
   - Whether *Hibernation* is supported or not.
   - Whether *Customizations* is enabled or not.
   - A shutdown time if the pool where you're creating the dev box has a shutdown schedule.
   - A notification that the dev box creation process can take 25 minutes or longer.
   
4. Select **Create** to begin creating your dev box.

5. Use the dev box tile in the developer portal to track the progress of creation.

   > [!Note]
   > If you encounter a vCPU quota error with a *QuotaExceeded* message, ask your administrator to [request an increased quota limit](/azure/dev-box/how-to-request-quota-increase). If your admin can't increase the quota limit at this time, try selecting another pool with a region close to your location.

## Connect to a dev box

After you create a dev box, you can connect remotely to the developer virtual machine. You can connect from your desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone. Microsoft Dev Box supports connecting to a dev box in the following ways:

- Connect through the browser from within the developer portal
- Connect by using a Remote Desktop client application

To connect to a dev box by using the browser:

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal).

1. Select **Open in browser**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-create-dev-box/dev-portal-open-in-browser.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dev box card that shows the option for opening in a browser." lightbox="./media/quickstart-create-dev-box/dev-portal-open-in-browser.png":::

A new tab opens with a new session through which you can use your dev box. Use a work or school account to sign in to your dev box, not a personal Microsoft account.

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need your dev box, you can delete it:

[!INCLUDE [dev box runs on creation note](./includes/clean-up-resources.md)]
