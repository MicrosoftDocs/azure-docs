# Restore your dev box from a snapshot

This article explains how to restore your dev box to a previous state using a snapshot. Snapshots are point-in-time copies of your dev box that allow you to revert to a previous state if needed. Microsoft Dev Box automatically takes snapshots of your dev box, ensuring that you have recent restore points available. 

Restore your dev box from a snapshot to overcome critical issues, recover lost data, or fix corruption, ensuring minimal downtime and maximum productivity.

You can also use snapshots during the testing phase of a project. If you're testing new code or configurations and something goes wrong, restoring from a snapshot allows you to return to a known good state without losing progress or spending time troubleshooting the issue.

Dev Box automatically takes snapshots, retains them for each dev box, and overwrites the oldest snapshot when necessary. You can restore your dev box to any of the available snapshots.

## Prerequisites

| **Product**       | **Requirements**  |

| **Microsoft Dev Box**   | - Access to a dev box in the developer portal |

## How does Dev Box manage snapshots?

Microsoft Dev Box helps you recover from critical issues by using snapshots that allow you to revert to a previous state if needed. Snapshots are point-in-time copies of your dev box. If something goes wrong, you can restore your dev box to a known good state without losing progress or spending time troubleshooting the issue.

### Manual snapshots

Take manual snapshots of your dev box to create restore points before making significant changes to your dev box, such as installing new software or making configuration changes. You can use manual snapshots in addition to the automatic snapshots taken by Microsoft Dev Box.

### Automatic snapshots

Microsoft Dev Box automatically takes short snapshots every 12 hours and long snapshots every seven days. It retains snapshots for 28 days on a rotating basis, overwriting the oldest snapshot when necessary. 

The retention period includes 10 short snapshots and 4 long snapshots, totaling 14 snapshots over 28 days. Once the maximum number of snapshots is reached, the oldest one is deleted. Short snapshots and long snapshots operate independently.

## Take a manual snapshot of your dev box

You can take a manual snapshot of your dev box to create a restore point before making significant changes, such as installing new software or making configuration changes.

To take a manual snapshot, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/TryManualSnapshot).
