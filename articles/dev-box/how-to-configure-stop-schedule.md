# Auto-stop your Dev Boxes on schedule

To save on costs, you can enable an auto-stop schedule on a dev box pool. Microsoft Dev Box attempts to stop all dev boxes in the pool at the time specified in the schedule. You can configure one stop time in one timezone for each pool.

> [!NOTE]
> Auto-stop schedules hibernate Dev Boxes that were created with a hibernation-enabled Dev Box definition. Dev boxes that were created using Dev Box definitions that do not support hibernation will be shut down. To learn more about enabling hibernation on your Dev Box definitions, see  [how to configure dev box hibernation](./how-to-configure-dev-box-hibernation.md).

## Permissions

To manage a dev box schedule, you need the following permissions:

| Action | Permission required |
|---|---|
| _Configure a schedule_ | Owner, Contributor, or DevCenter Project Admin. |

## Manage an auto-stop schedule in the Azure portal

You can enable, modify, and disable auto-stop schedules by using the Azure portal.

### Create an auto-stop schedule

You can create an auto-stop schedule while configuring a new dev box pool, or by modifying an already existing dev box pool. The following steps show you how to use the Azure portal to create and configure an auto-stop schedule.

### Add an auto-stop schedule to an existing pool

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box, enter **projects**. In the list of results, select **Projects**.

1. Open the project associated with the pool that you want to edit, and then select **Dev box pools**.

1. Determine the pool that you want to modify and scroll right. Open the more options (**...**) menu for the pool and select **Edit**.

1. In the **Edit dev box pool** pane, configure the following settings in the **Auto-stop** section:

   | Setting | Value |
   |---|---|
   | **Enable Auto-stop** | Select **Yes** to enable an auto-stop schedule after the pool is created. |
   | **Stop time** | Select a time to shutdown all the dev boxes in the pool. All dev boxes in this pool shutdown at this time every day. |
   | **Time zone** | Select the time zone that the stop time is in. |
   
   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-stop-schedule/dev-box-enable-stop.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the edit dev box pool page showing the Auto-stop options and Yes selected." lightbox="./media/how-to-manage-stop-schedule/dev-box-enable-stop.png"::: 

1. Select **Save**. 

### Add an auto-stop schedule when you create a pool

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box, enter **projects**. In the list of results, select **Projects**.

1. Open the project for which you want to create a pool, select **Dev box pools**, and then select **Create**.
 
   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-stop-schedule/dev-box-pool-grid-empty.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the list of dev box pools within a project. The list is empty. The Create option is selected." lightbox="./media/how-to-manage-stop-schedule/dev-box-pool-grid-empty.png":::

1. On the **Create a dev box pool** pane, enter the following values:

   | Setting | Value |
   |---|---|
   | **Name** | Enter a name for the pool. The pool name is visible to developers to select when they're creating dev boxes. The name must be unique within a project. |
   | **Dev box definition** | Select an existing dev box definition. The definition determines the base image and size for the dev boxes that are created in this pool. |
   | **Network connection** | 1. Select **Deploy to a Microsoft hosted network**. </br>2. Select your desired deployment region for the dev boxes. Choose a region close to your expected dev box users for the optimal user experience. |
   | **Dev box Creator Privileges** | Select **Local Administrator** or **Standard User**. |
   | **Enable Auto-stop** | **Yes** is the default. Select **No** to disable an auto-stop schedule. You can configure an auto-stop schedule after the pool is created. |
   | **Stop time** | Select a time to shut down all the dev boxes in the pool. All dev boxes in this pool shut down at this time every day. |
   | **Time zone** | Select the time zone for the stop time. |
   | **Licensing** | Select this checkbox to confirm that your organization has Azure Hybrid Benefit licenses that you want to apply to the dev boxes in this pool. |

1. Select **Create**.
 
1. Verify that the new dev box pool appears in the list. You might need to refresh the screen.

### Delete an auto-stop schedule

Follow these steps to delete an auto-stop schedule for your pool:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box, enter **projects**. In the list of results, select **Projects**.

1. Open the project associated with the pool that you want to modify, and then select **Dev box pools**.

1. Determine the pool that you want to modify and scroll right. Open the more options (**...**) menu for the pool and select **Edit**.

1. In the **Edit dev box pool** pane, in the **Auto-stop** section, toggle the **Enable Auto-stop** setting to **No**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-stop-schedule/dev-box-disable-stop.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the edit dev box pool page showing the Auto-stop options and No selected." lightbox="./media/how-to-manage-stop-schedule/dev-box-disable-stop.png"::: 

1. Select **Save**. 

After you change the setting, dev boxes in this pool don't automatically shut down.
