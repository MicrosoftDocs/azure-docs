# Microsoft Dev Box capabilities are coming to Windows 365

Windows 365 delivers personalized, persistent Cloud PCs to meet the needs of organizations of all sizes, supporting a broad range of employee personas and business scenarios. The Microsoft Dev Box service in Azure extends this vision by providing ready-to-code, cloud-powered development environments that enable developers to quickly spin up secure, ready-to-code, project-specific workspaces optimized for productivity. We are excited to announce that we're bringing these developer-specific capabilities to Windows 365, further empowering organizations to deliver the best information worker and developer experiences from a single unified solution.

Dev Box is built on Windows 365, and by consolidating these capabilities into Windows 365 and unifying the solution, developers will benefit from a consistent, flexible solution, and seamless integration with enterprise identity and security. IT admins and platform engineers can leverage more centralized controls, streamlined provisioning, consistent policy enforcement, and unified visibility across Cloud PCs—from task workers to developers—all in one place.


Effective *November 1, 2025*, the following changes will take place:

- The Dev Box service will *stop accepting new customers*. Customers interested in the Dev Box capabilities should reach out to their Microsoft account team to begin learning about Windows 365.
- *Existing Dev Box customers can continue to use and expand their Dev Box deployments* while new capabilities are being introduced in Windows 365. As new capabilities are available in Windows 365, we will provide resources to customers to support a smooth migration. No immediate action is required.

For more details, contact your Microsoft account team with additional questions.
