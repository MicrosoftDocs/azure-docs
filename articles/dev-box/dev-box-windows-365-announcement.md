# Microsoft Dev Box capabilities are coming to Windows 365

Microsoft Dev Box is evolving and transitioning into a unified business model under Windows 365. This transition reflects feedback from customers who asked for: 

- A predictable business model that scales with enterprise adoption. 
- Support for smaller SKUs (2 vCPU, 4 vCPU). 
- Access to a broader range of options, including GPU-backed SKUs. 
- Greater flexibility to support hybrid and ephemeral development scenarios. 

Windows 365 delivers personalized, persistent Cloud PCs to meet the needs of organizations of all sizes, supporting a broad range of employee personas and business scenarios. The Microsoft Dev Box service in Azure extends this vision by providing ready-to-code, cloud-powered development environments that enable developers to quickly spin up secure, ready-to-code, project-specific workspaces optimized for productivity. 

We're excited to announce that we're bringing these developer-specific capabilities to Windows 365, further empowering organizations to deliver the best information worker and developer experiences from a single unified solution. 

Dev Box is built on Windows 365, and by consolidating these capabilities into Windows 365 and unifying the solution, developers will benefit from a consistent, flexible solution, and seamless integration with enterprise identity and security. IT admins and platform engineers can use more centralized controls, streamlined provisioning, consistent policy enforcement, and unified visibility across Cloud PCs—from task workers to developers—all in one place. 

Effective November 1, 2025, the following changes will take place: 

- The Microsoft Dev Box service stops accepting net new customers. 
    - *Net new customers* are defined as those with no prior Dev Box deployment in any form. 
    - As features are integrated into Windows 365 and made available publicly, Customers interested in continuing to leverage these capabilities should reach out to their Microsoft account team. 
- There's no immediate change to existing customers 
    - Customers who have run a POC, experimented, or begun configuring Dev Box are considered as existing customers and they can continue using and scaling their current Dev Box deployments. 
    - If you plan to start using or scaling Dev Boxes into additional tenants, submit a request through [Azure Support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2202692&clcid=0x409) to your new tenants allowlisted.  

All core workflows and value props remain intact - including managing development teams through the Dev Center/Project platform in Azure, configuring guardrails, providing self-serve capabilities for developers, and offering ready-to-code machines with imaging and customizations, as well as custom network support. 

As new developer capabilities are released in Windows 365, Microsoft will provide resources and tools to ensure a smooth transition.  

## Key Actions for Customers 

- **No Immediate Action Required:** Continue using and scaling your Dev Box deployments as usual. Migration resources will be provided as new features roll out in Windows 365. 
- **Stay Informed:** Monitor communications from Microsoft and your account team for updates. 
- **Interested in Previewing New Features?** Express your interest to your Microsoft account team. 

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 

### Why is Microsoft making this change? 

Dev Box is built on Windows 365, and by transitioning these capabilities into Windows 365 and unifying the solution, developers will benefit from a consistent, flexible solution with additional SKUs to choose from, and seamless integration with enterprise identity and security. By consolidating value propositions, we aim to offer a predictable license-based business model. Each license will allow the creation of three persistent dev boxes and one active connection, supporting ephemeral scenarios, and a broader range of SKUs, including 2-core, 4-core, 8-core, and 16-core GPU options. This shift addresses critical feedback from our customers. 

### Which edition of Windows 365 will incorporate Microsoft Dev Box functionalities? 

Dev Box capabilities will be enabled with Windows 365 Frontline. This edition is best suited for developers who need flexible work setups, advanced workstations, and support for multi-environment and hybrid development scenarios, which benefit geographically distributed development teams. Each license will allow creation of three persistent workstations and provides nonconcurrent access for as many as three users. 

### How do we define net new customers? 

Net new customers are those with no prior deployment of Dev Box in any form. Existing customers, or those who have run a POC, experimented, or begun configuring Dev Box, aren't affected and can continue to use and scale their deployments.  

### Will there be any changes to my core Dev Box experience? 

No. All core workflows will remain unchanged, including management of development teams through the Dev Center/Project platform in Azure, configuration of guardrails, access to self-service for developers, provisioning ready-to-code machines with in-built imaging and customizations, and support for custom networks. The existing automation investments will continue to be relevant and are expected to require only minor modifications when you transition. 

### Do I need to take any action before the transition? 

No action is required at this time. You're encouraged to explore Windows 365 and engage with your Microsoft account team to evaluate licensing options. If you're also interested in participating in the upcoming preview of the new developer features in Windows 365, please contact your Microsoft account team. 

### What is the transition timeline for existing customers?

### Will there be additional costs for using developer capabilities in Windows 365? 

No. Customers who plan to use developer capabilities in Windows 365 once they become available will receive them as part of their Windows 365 license at no additional cost. 

### How will my data and configurations be handled during migration? 

As new capabilities become available, Microsoft will release migration guidance, including tools and timelines. Stay engaged with your account team for updates.

### How can I try out new developer features in Windows 365 before they're released? 

Previews will be available as features are integrated into Windows 365. Contact your Microsoft account team to express interest in joining the preview.
