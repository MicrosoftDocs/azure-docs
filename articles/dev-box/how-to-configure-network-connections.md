# Connect dev boxes to resources by configuring network connections

In this article, you learn how to manage network connections for a dev center in Microsoft Dev Box. Network connections enable dev boxes to connect to existing virtual networks. In addition, you can configure the network settings to enable connecting to on-premises resources from your dev box. The location, or Azure region, of the network connection determines where associated dev boxes are hosted.

You can choose to deploy dev boxes to a Microsoft-hosted network associated with a [dev box pool](how-to-manage-dev-box-pools.md#create-a-dev-box-pool) or to a network that you manage. If you choose to deploy dev boxes to a network that you manage, you must first configure a network connection.

You need to add at least one network connection to a dev center in Microsoft Dev Box.

## Prerequisites

- Sufficient permissions to enable creating and configuring network connections.
- At least one virtual network and subnet available for your dev boxes.

When you're planning network connectivity for your dev boxes, consider the following points:

- Identify the region or location that's closest to your dev box users. Deploying dev boxes into a region that's close to users gives them a better experience.
- Determine whether dev boxes should connect to your existing networks by using Microsoft Entra join or Microsoft Entra hybrid join.

### Verify your permissions

To manage a network connection, confirm you have the following permissions:

| Action | Role | Permissions required |
|---|---|---|
| _Create and configure a virtual network and subnet_ | **Network Contributor** (**Owner** or **Contributor**) | Permissions on an existing virtual network or permission to create a new virtual network and subnet |
| _Create or delete a network connection_ | **Owner** or **Contributor** | Permissions on an Azure subscription or on a specific resource group, which includes permission to create a resource group |
| _Add or remove a network connection_ | **Contributor** | Permission to perform **Write** actions on the dev center |

## Create a virtual network and subnet

To create a network connection, you need an existing virtual network and subnet. If you don't have a virtual network and subnet available, use the following steps to create these resources:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box, enter **virtual network**. In the list of results, select **Virtual networks**.

1. On the **Virtual networks** page, select **+ Create**.

1. On the **Create virtual network** pane, configure the following values on the **Basics** tab:

   | Setting | Value |
   |---|---|
   | **Subscription** | Select your subscription. |
   | **Resource group** | Select an existing resource group, or create a new resource by selecting **Create new**, entering a name, and then selecting **OK**. |
   | **Virtual network name** | Enter a name for the virtual network. |
   | **Region** | Select the region for the virtual network and dev boxes. |

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The region you select for the virtual network is where Azure deploys the dev boxes.

1. On the **Security** tab, accept the default settings.

1. On the **IP addresses** tab, accept the default settings.

1. On the **Review + create** tab, review the settings.

1. After validation passes for your configuration, select **Create**.

This procedure creates a virtual network and a default subnet.

## Allow access to Microsoft Dev Box endpoints from your network

An organization can control network ingress and egress by using a firewall, network security groups, and even Microsoft Defender.

If your organization routes egress traffic through a firewall, you need to open certain ports to allow the Microsoft Dev Box service to function. For more information, see [Network requirements](/windows-365/enterprise/requirements-network).

## Plan a network connection

The following sections show how to create and configure a network connection in Microsoft Dev Box.

### Review types of Active Directory join

Microsoft Dev Box requires a configured and working Active Directory join, which defines how dev boxes join your domain and access resources. You have two choices:

- **Microsoft Entra join**: If your organization uses Microsoft Entra ID, you can use a Microsoft Entra join (sometimes called a _native_ Microsoft Entra join). Dev box users sign in to Microsoft Entra joined dev boxes by using their Microsoft Entra account. They access resources based on the permissions assigned to that account. Microsoft Entra join enables access to cloud-based and on-premises apps and resources. For more information, see [Plan your Microsoft Entra join deployment](../active-directory/devices/device-join-plan.md).

- **Microsoft Entra hybrid join**: If your organization has an on-premises Active Directory implementation, you can still benefit from some of the functionality in Microsoft Entra ID by using Microsoft Entra hybrid joined dev boxes. These dev boxes are joined to your on-premises Active Directory instance and registered with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra hybrid joined dev boxes require network line of sight to your on-premises domain controllers periodically. Without this connection, devices become unusable. For more information, see [Plan your Microsoft Entra hybrid join deployment](../active-directory/devices/hybrid-join-plan.md).

### Create a network connection

Use the following procedures to create a network connection for your dev box configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Dev Box automatically creates a resource group for each network connection, which holds the network interface cards (NICs) that use the virtual network assigned to the network connection. The resource group has a fixed name based on the name and region of the network connection. You can't change the name of the resource group, or specify an existing resource group.
