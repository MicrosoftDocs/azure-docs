## Get started with Microsoft Dev Box
To get started with Microsoft Dev Box, you need to set up a dev center. A dev center is a container for your projects and resources. You can create a dev center in the Azure portal, and then create projects within that dev center. Each project can have its own set of resources, including dev boxes, networks, and images.

Start your Dev Box journey with a basic template: [Microsoft Dev Box](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_DevCenter/DevCenterMenuBlade/~/overview).
