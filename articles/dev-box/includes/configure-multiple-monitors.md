You can configure multiple monitors for your dev box. This is useful when you want to work on multiple tasks at the same time, such as debugging and writing code. You can also use multiple monitors to view different applications side by side.

You enable or disable multiple monitors through the user settings in the developer portal:

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal).

1. Select the user settings icon in the top right corner.
