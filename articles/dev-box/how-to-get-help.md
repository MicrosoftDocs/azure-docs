# Get support for Microsoft Dev Box

There are multiple channels available to give you help and support in Microsoft Dev Box. The support channel you choose depends on your role and your access to existing Dev Box resources. The fastest way to get help is to use the correct channel.

In the following table, select your role to see how to get help for urgent issues. For non-urgent issues, select an option.

## Support for administrators
Administrators include IT admins, platform engineers, and anyone who has administrative access to all your Dev Box resources.
#### 1. Internal troubleshooting
Always use your internal troubleshooting processes before contacting support. As a platform engineer, you have access to all Dev Box resources through the Azure portal and through the Azure CLI.
#### 2. Contact support
If you can't resolve the issue, open a support request to contact Azure support: 

   **[Contact Microsoft Azure Support - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/contact-microsoft-azure-support-2315e669-8b1f-493b-5fb1-d88a8736ffe4).**

- To learn more about support requests, refer to: [Create an Azure support request](../azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request.md).

## Support for dev team leads
Developer team leads are often assigned the DevCenter Project Admin role. Project Admins have access to manage projects and pools.
#### 1. Internal troubleshooting
Always use your internal troubleshooting processes before escalating an issue.
As a DevCenter Project Admin, you can:
- View the network connections attached to the dev center.
- View the dev box definitions attached to the dev center.
- Create, view, update, and delete dev box pools in the project. 

#### 2. Contact your platform engineers
If you can't resolve the issue, escalate it to your platform engineering team.

## Support for developers
Developers are assigned the Dev Box User role, which enables you to create and manage your own dev boxes through the developer portal. You don't usually have permissions to manage Dev Box resources in the Azure portal; your dev team lead manages those resources.
#### 1. Internal troubleshooting
Always use your internal troubleshooting processes before escalating an issue.
As a developer, you can troubleshoot your dev boxes through the developer portal. You can create a dev box, start, stop, and delete your dev boxes. 
#### 2. Contact your dev team lead
If you can't resolve the issue, escalate it to your dev team lead (DevCenter Project Admin).
