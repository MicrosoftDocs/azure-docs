#Customer intent: As a Dev Box administrator, I want to configure dev boxes to stop when a user disconnects so that I can control costs.

# Auto-stop your Dev Boxes when users disconnect


To save on costs, you can configure your Dev Box pools to stop when a user disconnects from their RDP session, after a timeout period that you can configure. Microsoft Dev Box attempts to stop all dev boxes after a user disconnects, and they do not re-establish a new RDP session within the configured timeout period.

> [!NOTE]
> Stop on disconnect will only apply to Dev Boxes that are created with hibernation enabled Dev Box definitions. To learn more about enabling hibernation on your Dev Box definitions, see  [how to configure dev box hibernation](./how-to-configure-dev-box-hibernation.md).  

## Permissions

To manage stop on connect settings on a dev box pool, you need the following permissions:

| Action | Permission required |
|---|---|
| _Configure a pool_ | Owner, Contributor, or DevCenter Project Admin. |


## Manage stop on disconnect settings with the Azure CLI

You can manage stop on disconnect settings on dev box pools by using the Azure CLI.


### Update a pool with stop on disconnect

The following Azure CLI command enables stop on disconnect on a dev box pool:

```azurecli
az devcenter admin pool update --pool-name {poolName} --project {projectName} --resource-group {resourceGroupName} --stop-on-disconnect status="Enabled" grace-period-minutes="180"
```

| Parameter | Value |
