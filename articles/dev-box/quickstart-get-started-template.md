The following resources are created in your Azure subscription:
- **Dev center**: The central hub for managing dev boxes and resources.
- **Project**: A container for organizing dev boxes and resources within the dev center.
- **Dev box pool**: A collection of dev boxes that share the same configuration and resources.
- **Dev box definition**: A template that defines the configuration and resources for the dev boxes in the pool. The get started template uses the *Visual Studio 2022 Enterprise on Windows 11 Enterprise + Microsoft 365 Apps 24H2* image.

You can go to the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal) to create new dev boxes. The developer portal is a web-based interface that allows users to create, manage, and monitor their dev boxes. 

To learn more about creating dev boxes through the developer portal, see [Quickstart: Create and connect to a dev box by using the Microsoft Dev Box developer portal](quickstart-create-dev-box.md).
