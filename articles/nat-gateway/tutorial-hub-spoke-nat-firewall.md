# Tutorial: Integrate NAT gateway with Azure Firewall in a hub and spoke network for outbound connectivity

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate a NAT gateway with an Azure Firewall in a hub and spoke network

Azure Firewall provides [2,496 SNAT ports per public IP address](../firewall/integrate-with-nat-gateway.md) configured per backend Virtual Machine Scale Set instance (minimum of two instances). You can associate up to 250 public IP addresses to Azure Firewall. Depending on your architecture requirements and traffic patterns, you may require more SNAT ports than what Azure Firewall can provide. You may also require the use of fewer public IPs while also requiring more SNAT ports. A better method for outbound connectivity is to use NAT gateway. NAT gateway provides 64,512 SNAT ports per public IP address and can be used with up to 16 public IP addresses. 

NAT gateway can be integrated with Azure Firewall by configuring NAT gateway directly to the Azure Firewall subnet in order to provide a more scalable method of outbound connectivity. For production deployments, a hub and spoke network is recommended, where the firewall is in its own virtual network. The workload servers are peered virtual networks in the same region as the hub virtual network where the firewall resides. In this architectural setup, NAT gateway can provide outbound connectivity from the hub virtual network for all spoke virtual networks peered.

>[!NOTE]
>Azure NAT Gateway is not currently supported in secured virtual hub network (vWAN) architectures. You must deploy using a hub virtual network architecture as described in this tutorial. For more information about Azure Firewall architecture options, see [What are the Azure Firewall Manager architecture options?](/azure/firewall-manager/vhubs-and-vnets).

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a hub virtual network and deploy an Azure Firewall and Azure Bastion during deployment
> * Create a NAT gateway and associate it with the firewall subnet in the hub virtual network
> * Create a spoke virtual network
> * Create a virtual network peering
> * Create a route table for the spoke virtual network

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Public IP**. Select **Public IP addresses** in the search results.

1. Select **public-ip-nat**.

1. Make note of value in **IP address**. The example used in this article is **203.0.113.0.25**.

### Test NAT gateway from spoke

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machine**. Select **Virtual machines** in the search results.

1. Select **vm-spoke**.

1. In **Overview**, select **Connect** then **Connect via Bastion**.

1. Enter the username and password entered during VM creation. Select **Connect**.

1. In the bash prompt, enter the following command:

    ```bash
    curl ifconfig.me
    ```

1. Verify the IP address returned by the command matches the public IP address of the NAT gateway.

    ```output
    azureuser@vm-1:~$ curl ifconfig.me
    203.0.113.0.25
    ```

1. Close the Bastion connection to **vm-spoke**.
