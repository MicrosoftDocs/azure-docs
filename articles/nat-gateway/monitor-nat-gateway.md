## Collect data with Azure Monitor

This table describes how you can collect data to monitor your service, and what you can do with the data once collected:

|Data to collect|Description|How to collect and route the data|Where to view the data|Supported data|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Metric data|Metrics are numerical values that describe an aspect of a system at a particular point in time. Metrics can be aggregated using algorithms, compared to other metrics, and analyzed for trends over time.|[- Collected automatically at regular intervals.</br> - You can route some platform metrics to a Log Analytics workspace to query with other data. Check the **DS export** setting for each metric to see if you can use a diagnostic setting to route the metric data.]|[Metrics explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started)| [Azure NAT Gateway metrics supported by Azure Monitor](/azure/nat-gateway/monitor-nat-gateway-reference#metrics)|
|Resource log data|Logs are recorded system events with a timestamp. Logs can contain different types of data, and be structured or free-form text. You can route resource log data to Log Analytics workspaces for querying and analysis.|[Create a diagnostic setting](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/create-diagnostic-settings) to collect and route resource log data.| [Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace)|[Azure NAT Gateway resource log data supported by Azure Monitor](/azure/nat-gateway/monitor-nat-gateway-reference#activity-log)  |
|Activity log data|The Azure Monitor activity log provides insight into subscription-level events.
