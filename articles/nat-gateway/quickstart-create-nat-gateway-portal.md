# Quickstart: Create a NAT gateway using the Azure portal

In this quickstart, learn how to create a NAT gateway by using the Azure portal. The NAT Gateway service provides outbound connectivity for virtual machines in Azure.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your Azure account.

[!INCLUDE [virtual-network-create-with-nat-bastion.md](../../includes/virtual-network-create-with-nat-bastion.md)]

[!INCLUDE [create-test-virtual-machine-linux.md](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/create-test-virtual-machine-linux.md)]

## Test NAT gateway

In this section, you test the NAT gateway. You first discover the public IP of the NAT gateway. You then connect to the test virtual machine and verify the outbound connection through the NAT gateway.
    
1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Public IP**. Select **Public IP addresses** in the search results.

1. Select **public-ip-nat**.

1. Make note of the public IP address:

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machine**. Select **Virtual machines** in the search results.

1. Select **vm-1**.

1. On the **Overview** page, select **Connect**, then select the **Bastion** tab.

1. Select **Use Bastion**.

1. Enter the username and password entered during VM creation. Select **Connect**.

1. In the bash prompt, enter the following command:

    ```bash
    curl ifconfig.me
    ```

1. Verify the IP address returned by the command matches the public IP address of the NAT gateway.

    ```output
    azureuser@vm-1:~$ curl ifconfig.me
    203.0.113.0.25
    ```
