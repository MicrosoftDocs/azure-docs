# Tutorial: Migrate outbound access to Azure NAT Gateway

In this tutorial, you learn how to migrate your outbound connectivity from [default outbound access](../virtual-network/ip-services/default-outbound-access.md) to a NAT gateway. You learn how to change your outbound connectivity from load balancer outbound rules to a NAT gateway. You reuse the IP address from the outbound rule configuration for the NAT gateway.

Azure NAT Gateway is the recommended method for outbound connectivity. A NAT gateway is a fully managed and highly resilient Network Address Translation (NAT) service. A NAT gateway doesn't have the same limitations of Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) port exhaustion as default outbound access. A NAT gateway replaces the need for outbound rules in a load balancer for outbound connectivity.

For more information about Azure NAT Gateway, see [What is Azure NAT Gateway?](nat-overview.md)

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Migrate default outbound access to a NAT gateway.
> * Migrate load balancer outbound connectivity and IP address to a NAT gateway.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* A standard public load balancer in your subscription. The load balancer must have a separate frontend IP address and outbound rules configured. For more information on creating an Azure Load Balancer, see [Quickstart: Create a public load balancer to load balance VMs using the Azure portal](../load-balancer/quickstart-load-balancer-standard-public-portal.md).
    
    * The load balancer name used in the examples is **myLoadBalancer**.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure NAT Gateway provides outbound connectivity for standard internal load balancers. For more information on integrating a NAT gateway with your internal load balancers, see [Tutorial: Integrate a NAT gateway with an internal load balancer using Azure portal](tutorial-nat-gateway-load-balancer-internal-portal.md).

## Migrate default outbound access

In this section, you learn how to change your outbound connectivity method from default outbound access to a NAT gateway.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **NAT gateway**. Select **NAT gateways**.

1. In **NAT gateways**, select **+ Create**.

1. In **Create network address translation (NAT) gateway**, enter or select the following information in the **Basics** tab.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Project details** |   |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **Create new**. </br> Enter **myResourceGroup**. </br> Select **OK**. |
    | **Instance details** |   |
    | NAT gateway name | Enter **myNATgateway**. |
    | Region | Select the region of your virtual network. In this example, it's **West Europe**. |
    | Availability zone | Leave the default of **None**. |
    | Idle timeout (minutes) | Enter **10**. |

1. Select the **Outbound IP** tab, or select **Next: Outbound IP** at the bottom of the page.

1. In **Public IP addresses** in the **Outbound IP** tab, select **Create a new public IP address**.

1. In **Add a public IP address**, enter **myNATgatewayIP** in **Name**. Select **OK**.

1. Select the **Subnet** tab, or select **Next: Subnet** at the bottom of the page.

1. In the pull-down box for **Virtual network**, select your virtual network.

1. In **Subnet name**, select the checkbox next to your subnet.

1. Select the **Review + create** tab, or select **Review + create** at the bottom of the page.

1. Select **Create**.

## Migrate load balancer outbound connectivity

In this section, you learn how to change your outbound connectivity method from outbound rules to a NAT gateway. You keep the same frontend IP address used for the outbound rules. You remove the outbound ruleâ€™s frontend IP configuration then create a NAT gateway with the same frontend IP address. A public load balancer is used throughout this section.

### Remove outbound rule frontend IP configuration

You remove the outbound rule and the associated frontend IP configuration from your load balancer. The load balancer name used in this example is **myLoadBalancer**.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Load balancer**. Select **Load balancers** in the search results.

1. Select **myLoadBalancer** or your load balancer.

1. In **myLoadBalancer**, select **Frontend IP configuration** in **Settings**.

1. Note the **IP address** in **Frontend IP configuration** that you wish to migrate to a **NAT gateway**. You'll need this information in the next section. In this example, it's **myFrontendIP-outbound**.

1. Select **Delete** next to the IP configuration you wish to remove. In this example, it's **myFrontendIP-outbound**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-migrate-outbound-nat/frontend-ip.png" alt-text="Screenshot of frontend IP address removal for NAT gateway.":::

1. Select **Delete**.

1. In **Delete myFrontendIP-outbound**, select the check box next to **I have read and understood that this frontend IP configuration as well as the associated resources listed above will be deleted**.

1. Select **Delete**. This procedure deletes the frontend IP configuration and the outbound rule associated with the frontend.

### Create NAT gateway

In this section, you create a NAT gateway with the IP address previously used for outbound rule and assign it to your precreated subnet within your virtual network. The subnet name for this example is **myBackendSubnet**.

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **NAT gateway**. Select **NAT gateways**.

1. In **NAT gateways**, select **+ Create**.

1. In **Create network address translation (NAT) gateway**, enter or select the following information in the **Basics** tab.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Project details** |   |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **Create new**. </br> Enter **myResourceGroup**. </br> Select **OK**. |
    | **Instance details** |   |
    | NAT gateway name | Enter **myNATgateway**. |
    | Region | Select the region of your virtual network. In this example, it's **West Europe**. |
    | Availability zone | Leave the default of **None**. |
    | Idle timeout (minutes) | Enter **10**. |

1. Select the **Outbound IP** tab, or select **Next: Outbound IP** at the bottom of the page.

1. In **Public IP addresses** in the **Outbound IP** tab, select the IP address you noted from the previous section. In this example, it's **myPublicIP-outbound**.

1. Select the **Subnet** tab, or select **Next: Subnet** at the bottom of the page.

1. In the pull-down box for **Virtual network**, select your virtual network.

1. In **Subnet name**, select the checkbox for your subnet. In this example, it's **myBackendSubnet**.

1. Select the **Review + create** tab, or select **Review + create** at the bottom of the page.

1. Select **Create**.

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this application, delete
the NAT gateway with the following steps:

1. From the left-hand menu, select **Resource groups**.

1. Select the **myResourceGroup** resource group.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. Enter **myResourceGroup** and select **Delete**.

## Next step

In this article, you learned how to:

* Migrate default outbound access to a NAT gateway.

* Migrate load balancer outbound connectivity and IP address to a NAT gateway.
