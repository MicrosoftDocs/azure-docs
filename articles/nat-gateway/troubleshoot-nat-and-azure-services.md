# Troubleshoot outbound connectivity with NAT gateway and Azure services 

This article provides guidance on how to troubleshoot connectivity issues when using NAT gateway with other Azure services, including:

* [Azure App Services](#azure-app-services)

* [Azure Kubernetes Service](#azure-kubernetes-service) 

* [Azure Firewall](#azure-firewall)

* [Azure Databricks](#azure-databricks)

## Azure App Services 

### Azure App Services regional Virtual network integration turned off 

NAT gateway can be used with Azure app services to allow applications to make outbound calls from a virtual network. To use this integration between Azure app services and NAT gateway, regional virtual network integration must be enabled. See [how regional virtual network integration works](../app-service/overview-vnet-integration.md#how-regional-virtual-network-integration-works) to learn more.  

To use NAT gateway with Azure App services, follow these steps:  

1. Ensure that your applications have virtual network integration configured, see [Enable virtual network integration](../app-service/configure-vnet-integration-enable.md).  

1. Ensure that **Route All** is enabled for your virtual network integration, see [Configure virtual network integration routing](../app-service/configure-vnet-integration-routing.md). 

1. Create a NAT gateway resource.  

1. Create a new public IP address or attach an existing public IP address in your network to NAT gateway. 

1. Assign NAT gateway to the same subnet being used for Virtual network integration with your applications.  

To see step-by-step instructions on how to configure NAT gateway with virtual network integration, see [Configuring NAT gateway integration.](../app-service/networking/nat-gateway-integration.md#configure-nat-gateway-integration) 

Important notes about the NAT gateway and Azure App Services integration:  

* Virtual network integration doesn't provide inbound private access to your app from the virtual network.  

* Virtual network integration traffic doesn't appear in Azure Network Watcher or Network Security Group (NSG) flow logs due to the nature of how it operates.

### App services isn't using the NAT gateway public IP address to connect outbound 

App services can still connect outbound to the internet even if virtual network integration isn't enabled. By default, apps that are hosted in App Service are accessible directly through the internet and can reach only internet-hosted endpoints. To learn more, see [App Services Networking Features](/azure/app-service/networking-features). 

If you notice that the IP address used to connect outbound isn't your NAT gateway public IP address or addresses, check that virtual network integration is enabled. Ensure the NAT gateway is configured to the subnet used for integration with your applications. 

To validate that web applications are using the NAT gateway public IP, ping a virtual machine on your Web Apps and check the traffic via a network capture.  

## Azure Kubernetes Service

### How to deploy NAT gateway with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters 

NAT gateway can be deployed with AKS clusters in order to allow for explicit outbound connectivity. There are two different ways to deploy NAT gateway with AKS clusters: 

- **Managed NAT gateway**: Azure deploys a NAT gateway at the time of the AKS cluster creation. AKS manages the NAT gateway.

- **User-Assigned NAT gateway**: You deploy a NAT gateway to an existing virtual network for the AKS cluster. 

Learn more at [Managed NAT Gateway](/azure/aks/nat-gateway).

### Connecting from AKS cluster to the AKS API server over the internet

To manage an AKS cluster, the cluster interacts with its API server. When you create a non-private cluster that resolves to the API server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN), the API server is assigned a public IP address by default. The API server cluster traffic is routed and processed through the cluster's outbound type. When the outbound cluster type is set to NAT gateway (Managed or User-Assigned), the API server traffic is processed as public traffic through the NAT gateway. To prevent API server traffic from being processed as public traffic, consider using a [private cluster](/azure/aks/private-clusters) or use the [API Server VNet Integration](/azure/aks/api-server-vnet-integration) feature (in preview).

### Can't update my NAT gateway IPs or idle timeout timer for an AKS cluster 

Public IP addresses and the idle timeout timer for NAT gateway can be updated with the `az aks update` command for a managed NAT gateway ONLY.  

If you deployed a User-Assigned NAT gateway to your AKS subnets, then you can't use the `az aks update` command to update public IP addresses or the idle timeout timer. The user manages a User-Assigned NAT gateway. You need to update these configurations manually on your NAT gateway resource.  

Update your public IP addresses on your User-Assigned NAT gateway with the following steps: 

1. In your resource group, select your NAT gateway resource in the portal.

1. Under Settings on the left-hand navigation bar, select Outbound IP.

1. To manage your Public IP addresses, select the blue Change.

1. From the Manage public IP addresses and prefixes configuration that slides in from the right, update your assigned public IPs from the drop-down menu or select **Create a new public IP address**.

1. Once you're done updating your IP configurations, select the OK button at the bottom of the screen.

1. After the configuration page disappears, select the Save button to save your changes.

1. Repeat steps 3 - 6 to do the same for public IP prefixes. 

Update your idle timeout timer configuration on your User-Assigned NAT gateway with the following steps: 

1. In your resource group, select on your NAT gateway resource in the portal.

1. Under Settings on the left-hand navigation bar, select Configuration.

1. In the TCP idle timeout (minutes) text bar, adjust the idle timeout timer (the timer can be configured 4 – 120 minutes). 

1. Select the Save button when you’re done. 

>[!Note] 
>Increasing the TCP idle timeout timer to longer than 4 minutes can increase the risk of SNAT port exhaustion.

## Azure Firewall 

### Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) exhaustion when connecting outbound with Azure Firewall

Azure Firewall can provide outbound internet connectivity to virtual networks. Azure Firewall provides only 2,496 SNAT ports per public IP address. While Azure Firewall can be associated with up to 250 public IP addresses to handle egress traffic, you might require fewer public IP addresses for connecting outbound. The requirement for egressing with fewer public IP addresses is due to architectural requirements and allowlist limitations by destination endpoints.

One method by which to provide greater scalability for outbound traffic and also reduce the risk of SNAT port exhaustion is to use NAT gateway in the same subnet with Azure Firewall.
For more information on how to set up a NAT gateway in an Azure Firewall subnet, see [integrate NAT gateway with Azure Firewall](/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/tutorial-hub-spoke-nat-firewall). For more information about how NAT gateway works with Azure Firewall, see [Scale SNAT ports with Azure NAT Gateway](../firewall/integrate-with-nat-gateway.md).

> [!NOTE]
> NAT gateway is not supported in a vWAN architecture. NAT gateway cannot be configured to an Azure Firewall subnet in a vWAN hub.

## Azure Databricks

### How to use NAT gateway to connect outbound from a databricks cluster 

NAT gateway can be used to connect outbound from your databricks cluster when you create your Databricks workspace. NAT gateway can be deployed to your databricks cluster in one of two ways: 

* When you enable [Secure Cluster Connectivity (No Public IP)](/azure/databricks/security/secure-cluster-connectivity#use-secure-cluster-connectivity) on the default virtual network that Azure Databricks creates, Azure Databricks automatically deploys a NAT gateway to connect outbound from your workspace's subnets to the internet. Azure Databricks creates this NAT gateway resource within the managed resource group and you can't modify this resource group or any other resources deployed in it.

* After you deploy Azure Databricks workspace in your own virtual network (via [virtual network injection](/azure/databricks/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/azure/vnet-inject)), you can deploy and configure NAT gateway to both of your workspace’s subnets to ensure outbound connectivity through the NAT gateway. You can implement this solution using an [Azure template](/azure/databricks/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/azure/vnet-inject#advanced-configuration-using-azure-resource-manager-templates) or in the portal.
