# Frequently asked questions about Azure Dev Tools for Teaching	

This article addresses frequent questions about student subscriptions, Azure for Students Starter, and Azure Dev Tools for Teaching.	

## Azure for students	

### What happens after I use my $100 credit or I’m at the end of 12 months?	

After you exhaust your available credit or reach the end of 12 months, your Azure subscription will be disabled. To continue using [Azure](https://account.azure.com/), you may upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription in the Azure Account Portal. To get detailed terms of use for Azure for Students, please visit the [offer terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0170p/).	

### Can I get Azure for Students again next year?	

Thank you for your interest in Azure for Students! We’re glad that you’ve enjoyed using it. At this time, we are not announcing renewals. Check back here for updates.	

### What are subscriptions, and how do they relate to Azure for Students?	

Subscriptions provide access to Azure services. Azure for Students gives you $100 credit for 12 months and access to more than 25 free services, including compute, network, storage, and databases. Any charges incurred during this period are deducted from the credit. To continue using Azure at the end of 12 months or after you’ve exhausted your $100 credit, whichever occurs first, you must upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription.	

### What happens with my Azure services if I don’t upgrade?	

If you decide not to upgrade at the end of 12 months or after you’ve exhausted your $100 credit, whichever occurs first, any products you’ve deployed will be decommissioned and you won’t be able to access them. You can always come back within the next 90 days to upgrade your subscription.	

### How do I know how much of the $100 credit I have left?	

You can see your remaining credit on the Microsoft [Azure Sponsorships portal](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/).	


### How do I download the Software Developer Tools?	

Your Azure for Students subscription will provide you with access to certain Software Developer Tools, available to download for free.

### Can Azure for Students be used for production or only for development?	

Azure for Students provides access to all Azure products expressly intended to support education or teaching, non-commercial research, or efforts to design, develop, test, and demonstrate software applications for the above purposes.	

### Can I apply any of my $100 credit toward Azure Marketplace offers?

## Azure Academic Grant	

### How do I start using my Azure course credits?	

You can access your Azure course credits by creating a new Microsoft Azure Academic Grant subscription by clicking on the Activate button in the Sponsorship approval email. In addition, you can convert an existing subscription to the Microsoft Azure Sponsorship offer to access your credits. Details on how to do convert your subscription are in the question below.	

### Can I associate my course credits to an existing subscription?	

You can associate your course credits to an existing subscription on the account that is entitled for the offer. To do so, please contact [Azure Support](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview).	

### Why do I see a $0 Balance in the Azure Portal?	

When you go to your subscription details in the Azure Account Portal, you will see $0.00. The reason for this is that this offer places a 100% discount off all services. Therefore, the portal will show you what you will be charged for during your monthly usage period, which should be $0.00. To view your balance and sponsorship information, please go [here](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/balance) and enter in your log in details.	

### Can I apply my course credits to an existing Enterprise Agreement (EA)?	

Unfortunately, you cannot associate your course credits offer to any subscription that is on an account under an Enterprise Agreement. You must create a new account that is outside of the EA, which we can then entitle. Once the Sponsorship period has ended, you can associate that subscription back into the EA. If you associate, the account to your EA prior to the end of the Sponsorship, all sponsorship funds will be terminated. Please refer to the terms and conditions of the Sponsorship offer [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0143p/).	

### Can I apply my course credits to my CSP subscription?	

Unfortunately, you cannot associate your course credits offer to any CSP subscription.	

### Can I move my course credits to another account?	

Yes, you can move a course credits entitlement to another account. To do so, please contact [Azure Support](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview).	

### Are Marketplace applications covered by course credits?	

Unfortunately, 3rd party applications are not covered by course credits. They will be charged to credit card on the account. You can view marketplace services [here](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/). Please refer to the terms and conditions of the offer [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0143p/).	

### I have a previous balance due, can I pay it off with my course credits?	

Azure course credits only cover usage from the time you activate it. You are responsible for all charges prior to your offer start date.	

### How do I know if my subscription is on the Azure course credit offer?	

If you look at a specific subscription in the Subscriptions blade in your Azure Portal, you will see "Offer Name" as one of the properties. The Offer Name will say "Azure Sponsorship". If not, then it is not connected to your course credits and you will need to contact support to get it converted.
