          If you exhaust your available credit before 12 months and you want to continue to use Azure, you can upgrade to a [pay-as-you-go subscription](../../cost-management-billing/manage/upgrade-azure-subscription.md) in the Azure portal.  If you do not upgrade, your Azure subscription becomes disabled. If you’re at the end of 12 months, you can renew your subscription by signing up again for the offer.

      - question: |
          Can I deploy Windows 10 and Windows 11 VMs with my Azure for Students subscription?
        answer: |
          Yes, as a benefit of your Azure for Students subscription, you may use Windows 10 and 11 virtual machines without the need for a Windows 11 Enterprise license.
          
      - question: |
          Can I get Azure for Students again next year?
        answer: |
          Yes!  You can renew your Azure for Students subscription after 1 year.  We will send you emails reminding you to renew just before your anniversary.  To renew, simply re-signup for the offer from the Azure for Students [website](https://aka.ms/azure4students)

      - question: |
          Why did I receive an invoice from Microsoft?
        answer: |
          You may receive an invoice from Microsoft detailing the usage you incurred in the previous month while on Azure for Students.  Don’t worry, you do not have to pay for that usage – it’s all covered by the credit provided by Azure for Students.  To learn more about invoices and how they work, check out the [article](../../cost-management-billing/understand/mca-overview.md) on Microsoft technical documentation 
      
      - question: |
          What are subscriptions, and how do they relate to Azure for Students?
        answer: |
          Subscriptions provide access to Azure services. Azure for Students gives you $100 credit for 12 months and includes access to more than 25 free services, including compute, network, storage, and databases. Any charges incurred during this period are deducted from the credit. To continue using Azure services after you've exhausted your $100 credit, you must either renew (if you are 12 months in) or upgrade to a pay-as-you-go subscription.

      - question: |
          What happens with my Azure services if I don't upgrade?
        answer: |
          If you decide not to upgrade at the end of 12 months or after you've exhausted your $100 credit, whichever occurs first, any products you've deployed are decommissioned and you won't be able to access them. You have 90 days from the end of your free subscription to upgrade to a pay-as-you-go subscription.

      - question: |
          How do I know how much of the $100 credit I have left?
        answer: |
          You can see your remaining credit on the [Azure Sponsorships portal](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/).
          
      - question: |
          How do I download the software developer tools?
        answer: |
          Your Azure for Students subscription provides you with access to certain software developer tools. You must have a current, active Azure for Students subscription to access and download the software developer tools. Go to the  [Education Hub](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/software) to download the software developer tools by using your Azure for Students subscription.
          
      - question: |
          What is Microsoft Learn training?
        answer: |
          [Microsoft Learn training](/training/) is a free online learning platform that allows you to learn Azure technologies at your own pace. Learning paths combine modules that allow you to start with the basics, then move to advanced methods that address real-world challenges.
          
      - question: |
          Can Azure for Students be used for production or only for development?

  - name: Azure Academic Grant
    questions:
      - question: |
          How do I start using my Azure course credits?
        answer: |
          You can access your Azure course credits by creating a new Microsoft Azure Academic Grant subscription. Select the  **Activate** button in the sponsorship approval email.
          
          You can also convert an existing subscription to the Microsoft Azure Sponsorship Offer to access your credits. Details on how to convert your subscription are in the next question.
          
      - question: |
          Can I associate my course credits with an existing subscription?
        answer: |
          You can associate your course credits with an existing subscription on the account that is entitled to the offer. Contact [Azure Support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview) to associate your course credits.
          
      - question: |
          Why do I see a $0 balance in the Azure portal?
        answer: |
          When you go to your subscription details in the Azure portal, you will see $0.00. The offer places a 100% discount off of all services. Therefore, the portal shows you what you will be charged for during your monthly usage period, which should be $0.00.
          
          To view your balance and sponsorship information, go to [Azure Sponsorships](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/balance) and sign in to your account.
          
      - question: |
          Can I apply my course credits to an existing Enterprise Agreement (EA)?
        answer: |
          You cannot associate your course credits offer to any subscription that's on an account under an Enterprise Agreement (EA).
          
          To apply course credits, you must create a new account that's outside of the EA, which we can then entitle.
          
          Once the Sponsorship period ends, you can associate that subscription back into the EA.
          
          > [!WARNING]
          > If you associate the account to your EA prior to the end of the sponsorship, all sponsorship funds will be terminated. Refer to the terms and conditions of the [Azure Sponsorship Offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0143p/) for more information.
          
      - question: |
          Can I apply my course credits to my CSP subscription?
        answer: |

      - question: |
          Can I move my course credits to another account?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can move a course credits entitlement to another account. To do so, contact [Azure Support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview).
          
      - question: |
          Are Azure Marketplace applications covered by course credits?
        answer: |
          No, third party applications aren't covered by course credits. They will be charged to the credit card on the account. For more information:
          
          - View marketplace services at the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/).
          - Refer to the [Azure Sponsorship offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0143p/) terms and conditions.
          
      - question: |
          I have a previous balance due, can I pay it off with my course credits?
        answer: |
          Azure course credits only cover usage from the time you activate the Azure Sponsorship offer. You are responsible for all charges prior to your offer start date.

      - question: |
          How do I know if my subscription is on the Azure course credit offer?
        answer: |
          If you look at a specific subscription in the Subscriptions blade in your Azure portal, you will see **Offer Name** as one of the properties. The Offer Name will say **Azure Sponsorship** if it is connected to your course credits. If **Azure Sponsorship** doesn't display, then contact support to get it converted.
