      - question: |
          What happens after I use my $100 credit or when I'm at the end of 12 months?
        answer: |
          If you exhaust your available credit before 12 months and you want to continue to use Azure, you can upgrade to a [pay-as-you-go subscription](../../cost-management-billing/manage/upgrade-azure-subscription.md) in the Azure portal. If you don't upgrade, your Azure subscription is canceled.
          
          If you're at the end of 12 months, you can renew your subscription by signing up again for the offer. For more information, see the [terms and conditions for the Azure for Students offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0170p/).

      - question: |
          Can I deploy Windows 10 and Windows 11 virtual machines with my Azure for Students subscription?
        answer: |
          Yes. As a benefit of your Azure for Students subscription, you can use Windows 10 and 11 virtual machines without the need for a Windows 11 Enterprise license.
          
      - question: |
          Can I get Azure for Students again next year?
        answer: |
          Yes. You can renew your Azure for Students subscription after one year. Just before your anniversary, we send you emails that remind you to renew. To renew, sign up for the offer on the [Azure for Students website](https://aka.ms/azure4students).

      - question: |
          Why did I receive an invoice from Microsoft?
        answer: |
          You might receive an invoice from Microsoft that details your usage of Azure for Students in the previous month. Don't worry, because you don't have to pay for that usage. It's all covered by the credit in Azure for Students. To learn more about invoices and how they work, see the [article about billing accounts](../../cost-management-billing/understand/mca-overview.md).
      
      - question: |
          What are subscriptions, and how do they relate to Azure for Students?
        answer: |
          Subscriptions provide access to Azure services. Azure for Students gives you $100 credit for 12 months. The offer includes access to more than 25 free services, including compute, network, storage, and databases.

          Any charges that you incur during this period are deducted from the credit. To continue using Azure services after you exhaust your $100 credit, you must either renew (if you're 12 months in) or upgrade to a pay-as-you-go subscription.

      - question: |
          What happens with my Azure services if I don't upgrade?
        answer: |
          If you decide not to upgrade at the end of 12 months or after you exhaust your $100 credit (whichever occurs first), any products that you deployed are decommissioned and you won't be able to access them. You have 90 days from the end of your free subscription to upgrade to a pay-as-you-go subscription.

      - question: |
          How do I know how much of the $100 credit I have left?
        answer: |
          You can see your remaining credit in the [Azure Sponsorships portal](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/).
          
      - question: |
          How do I download the software developer tools?

  - name: Azure Academic Grant
    questions:
      - question: |
          How do I start using my Azure course credits?
        answer: |
          You can access your Azure course credits by creating a new Azure Academic Grant subscription. Select the **Activate** button in the sponsorship approval email.

          You can also convert an existing subscription to the Azure Sponsorship offer to access your credits. To convert your subscription, contact [Azure support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview).
          
      - question: |
          Can I associate my course credits with an existing subscription?
        answer: |
          You can associate your course credits with an existing subscription on the account that's entitled to the offer. To associate your course credits, contact [Azure support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview).
          
      - question: |
          Why do I see a $0 balance in the Azure portal?
        answer: |
          When you go to your subscription details in the Azure portal, you see $0.00. The offer places a 100% discount on all services. The portal shows what you're charged during your monthly usage period, which should be $0.00.

          To view your balance and sponsorship information, go to the [Azure Sponsorships portal](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/balance) and sign in to your account.

          Can I apply my course credits to an existing Enterprise Agreement?
        answer: |
          You can't associate your course credits with any subscription that's on an account under an Enterprise Agreement (EA). To apply course credits, you must create a new account that's outside the EA, which we can then entitle. After the sponsorship period ends, you can associate that subscription with the EA.
          
          > [!WARNING]
          > If you associate the account with your EA before the end of the sponsorship, all sponsorship funds are terminated. For more information, see the [terms and conditions of the Azure Sponsorship offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0143p/).

      - question: |
          Do course credits cover partner applications on Azure Marketplace?
        answer: |
          No, course credits don't cover applications from Microsoft partners on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/). Those applications are charged to the credit card on the account.

          For more information, see the [terms and conditions of the Azure Sponsorship offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0143p/).          
          
      - question: |
          Can I pay off a previous balance with my course credits?
