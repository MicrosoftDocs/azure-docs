# Azure for Students

Through the Azure Dev Tools for Teaching program, students who have a current and active Azure for Students 
subscription can download certain software developer tools for free. Azure for Students provides access to all 
Azure products that are expressly intended to support education or teaching, non-commercial research, or 
efforts to design, develop, test, and demonstrate software applications for these purposes. Students download 
the tools from the Azure Education Hub.

Azure for Students provides you with a $100 credit for 12 months. It includes access to more than 25 free 
services, including compute, network, storage, and databases. Any charges incurred during this period are 
deducted from the credit. You can see your remaining credit on the [Azure Sponsorships 
portal](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/).

After you exhaust your available credit or reach the end of 12 months, your Azure subscription becomes disabled. 
If you've reached the end of your 12 months and are still a student, you'll be able to renew your Azure for Students offer. 
We'll notify you shortly before your 12-month anniversary to let you know how to renew. 
If your student status is no longer valid after the offer expired, you will not be able to renew. 
In such case, if you wish to continue using Azure services, you may upgrade to a pay-as-you-go subscription in the Azure portal.
