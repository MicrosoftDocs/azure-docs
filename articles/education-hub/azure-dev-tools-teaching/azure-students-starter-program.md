# Azure for Students Starter

Azure for Students Starter gets you started with the Azure products you need to develop in the cloud. 
There is no cost to you. This benefit provides you access to a free tier of the following services:

- Azure App Service
- Azure Functions
- Azure Notification Hubs
- Azure Database for MySQL
- Application Insights
- Azure DevOps Server (formerly Visual Studio Team Foundation Server)

Azure for Students Starter is available to verified students at no cost and without commitment or 
time limit. See the [Azure for Students Starter Offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0144p/) 
for detailed terms of use.

This offer isn't available for use in a massive open online course (MOOC) or in other professional 
trainings from for-profit organizations.

This offer is limited to one Azure for Students Starter subscription per eligible customer. It's 
non-transferable and can't be combined with any other offer, unless otherwise permitted by Microsoft.

A credit card isn't required for the Azure for Students Starter offer. However, you can upgrade at 
any time to a pay-as-you-go subscription to get access to all Azure services, using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
