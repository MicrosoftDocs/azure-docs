# Access the Azure Education Hub

> [!WARNING]
> This offer requires assistance from your Microsoft sales representative. Self-service signup is not available.

The email that you received to confirm your approval for an academic sponsorship includes a [link to the Azure Education Hub](https://aka.ms/startedu) and an approved credit amount. Most sponsored academic offers include a Developer tier of Azure support for free.

To use your academic sponsorship, you must create a lab in the Education Hub and use subscriptions within the lab that will access your Azure credit. Start by signing in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) so you can access the Education Hub.

## Authenticate through the Azure portal

1. In a browser, open a private browsing tab such as Incognito in Google Chrome or InPrivate in Microsoft Edge.

1. On the address bar, enter the URL for the Azure portal: `https://portal.azure.com`.
