# Frequently asked questions about Azure for Education

In this article, discover all you need to know about Azure for Education. Find answers to common questions about eligibility, benefits, and usage to optimize your experience.

## Azure for Students

### What happens after I use my $100 credit or when I'm at the end of 12 months?

If you exhaust your available credit before 12 months and you want to continue to use Azure, you can upgrade to a [pay-as-you-go subscription](../cost-management-billing/manage/upgrade-azure-subscription.md) in the Azure portal. If you don't upgrade, your Azure subscription is canceled.

If you're at the end of 12 months, you can renew your subscription by signing up again for the offer. For more information, see the [terms and conditions for the Azure for Students offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0170p/).

### Who is eligible for Azure for Students?

Azure for Students is available only to students who meet the following requirements:

- You must affirm that you attend an accredited, degree-granting, two-year or four-year educational institution where you're a full-time student.
- You must verify your academic status through your organization's email address.

This offer isn't available for use in a massive open online course (MOOC) or in other professional trainings from for-profit organizations.

This offer is limited to one Azure for Student subscription per eligible customer. It's nontransferable and can't be combined with any other offer, unless otherwise permitted by Microsoft.

For more information, see the [terms and conditions for the Azure for Students offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0170p/).

Yes. As a benefit of your Azure for Students subscription, you can use Windows 10 and 11 virtual machines without the need for a Windows 11 Enterprise license.

### Can I get Azure for Students again next year?

Yes. You can renew your Azure for Students subscription after one year. Just before your anniversary, we send you emails that remind you to renew. To renew, sign up for the offer on the [Azure for Students website](https://aka.ms/azure4students).

### Why did I receive an invoice from Microsoft?

You might receive an invoice from Microsoft that details your usage of Azure for Students in the previous month. Don't worry, because you don't have to pay for that usage. It's all covered by the credit in Azure for Students. To learn more about invoices and how they work, see the [article about billing accounts](../cost-management-billing/understand/mca-overview.md).

### What are subscriptions, and how do they relate to Azure for Students?

Subscriptions provide access to Azure services. Azure for Students gives you $100 credit for 12 months. The offer includes access to more than 25 free services, including compute, network, storage, and databases.

Any charges that you incur during this period are deducted from the credit. To continue using Azure services after you exhaust your $100 credit, you must either renew (if you're 12 months in) or upgrade to a pay-as-you-go subscription.

### What happens with my Azure services if I don't upgrade?

If you decide not to upgrade at the end of 12 months or after you exhaust your $100 credit (whichever occurs first), any products that you deployed are decommissioned and you won't be able to access them. You have 90 days from the end of your free subscription to upgrade to a pay-as-you-go subscription.

### How do I know how much of the $100 credit I have left?

You can see your remaining credit in the [Azure Sponsorships portal](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/).

### How do I download the software developer tools?

Your Azure for Students subscription gives you access to certain software developer tools, as long as the subscription is current and active. You can download these tools for free. To download them, go to the [Azure Education Hub](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/software).

### What is Microsoft Learn training?

[Microsoft Learn training](/training/) is a free online learning platform that helps you learn Azure technologies at your own pace. Learning paths contain modules that start with the basics and then move to advanced methods that address real-world challenges.

### Can I use Azure for Students for production or only for development?

Azure for Students provides access to all Azure products expressly for the support of education or teaching, noncommercial research, or efforts to design, develop, test, and demonstrate software applications for these purposes.

### Can I apply any of my $100 credit to Azure Marketplace offers?

No, you can't apply your credit to Azure Marketplace offers. However, many Azure Marketplace partners offer free trials or free-tier plans for their solutions.

## Azure Academic Grant

### How do I start using my Azure course credits?

You can access your Azure course credits by creating a new Azure Academic Grant subscription. Select the **Activate** button in the sponsorship approval email.

You can also convert an existing subscription to the Azure Sponsorship offer to access your credits. To convert your subscription, contact [Azure support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview).

### Can I associate my course credits with an existing subscription?

You can associate your course credits with an existing subscription on the account that's entitled to the offer. To associate your course credits, contact [Azure support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview).

### Why do I see a $0 balance in the Azure portal?

When you go to your subscription details in the Azure portal, you see $0.00. The offer places a 100% discount on all services. The portal shows what you're charged during your monthly usage period, which should be $0.00.

To view your balance and sponsorship information, go to the [Azure Sponsorships portal](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/balance) and sign in to your account.

### Can I apply my course credits to an existing Enterprise Agreement?

You can't associate your course credits with any subscription that's on an account under an Enterprise Agreement (EA). To apply course credits, you must create a new account that's outside the EA, which we can then entitle. After the sponsorship period ends, you can associate that subscription with the EA.

> [!WARNING]
> If you associate the account with your EA before the end of the sponsorship, all sponsorship funds are terminated. For more information, see the [terms and conditions of the Azure Sponsorship offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0143p/).

For more information, see the [terms and conditions of the Azure Sponsorship offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0143p/).

### Can I pay off a previous balance with my course credits?

Azure course credits cover usage only from the time that you activate the Azure Sponsorship offer. You're responsible for all charges that you accrued before your offer start date.

### How do I know if my subscription is on the Azure course credit offer?

1. In the Azure portal, go to **Subscriptions**.
1. In a specific subscription, check for **Offer Name** as one of the properties. If the **Offer Name** value says **Azure Sponsorship**, the subscription is connected to your course credits.
