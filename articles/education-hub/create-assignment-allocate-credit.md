# Create a lab and allocate credit in the Azure Education Hub

> [!WARNING]
> This offer requires assistance from your Microsoft sales representative. Self-service signup is not available.

After you set up a lab in the Azure Education Hub, you can add students and allocate credits to them to deploy resources.

## Prerequisites

- An academic sponsorship with an approved credit amount
- A work or school account and a subscription within the course that will access your Azure credit

### Accounts

The Education Hub accepts any email address in the standard format. It does *not* currently check for a valid account in your organization or whether the Microsoft account is current or valid. Carefully check each email address before you continue.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Work and school accounts are subject to their own policies, including whether an email address from a domain other than the organization is permitted (for example, adding *student*@outlook.com to the @*school*.edu domain). Be sure to check these policies before you add new users.

When you add a work or school account (for example, *student*@*school*.edu) by using role-based access control (RBAC) in the Educator Sponsor Portal or the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), Azure automatically sends email to the recipient. This email requires the user to accept the new account and Azure role before receiving access to the subscription.

If you're a teaching assistant or a professor for a course, be sure to inform students of this requirement so that their subscription appears in the Azure portal as expected.

## Create a lab and invite students

1. Create a lab and fill in the required information such as lab name and method to invite students.

2. After you create the lab, you can begin inviting students to the lab
3. Optionally, you can remove existing students by selecting **Remove** next to each student's name.
4. When you finish, the students added will receive an invitation to join the lab.
