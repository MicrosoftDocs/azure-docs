# What is Azure Classroom?

> [!WARNING]
> This offer requires assistance from your Microsoft sales representative. Self-service signup is not available.

The Microsoft [Azure Classroom](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/quickstart) is a tool that helps academic users provision and manage cloud credit across Azure subscriptions.

This tool is useful when you need to manage many cloud-based student projects. Azure Classroom is also useful for research purposes when you don't yet know your Azure credit needs.

You can easily adjust the amount of allocated credit within each subscription or in bulk. You can also suspend subscriptions to maximize available credits. For example, you might suspend subscriptions when a semester or quarter project is complete.

## Prerequisites

To access Azure Classroom, you must first receive an email notification that confirms your approval for an academic sponsorship and contains your approved credit amount. After you have signed in, you can navigate to the Education Hub in the Azure portal.
