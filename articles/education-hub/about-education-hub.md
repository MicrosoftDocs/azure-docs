# What is the Azure Education Hub?

The Microsoft Azure [Education Hub](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/quickstart) is a tool that helps academic users provision and manage cloud credit across many different Azure subscriptions. This is useful when faculty
members need to manage many cloud-based student projects. The Education Hub is also useful for research purposes when your Azure credit needs are not yet known.

Users can easily adjust the amount of allocated credit within each subscription or in bulk. Subscriptions can also be suspended—for example, when a semester or quarter project is complete—to maximize available credits.

## Prerequisites

To access the Education Hub, you should already have received an email notification that you've been approved for an academic grant. The email contains your approved credit
amount and a link to the [Education Hub](https://aka.ms/startedu).

To use your academic grant, you must create a classroom in the
Education Hub and use subscriptions within the classroom that will access your Azure credit.
