# Managing your Academic Grant

Your main landing page in the Azure Education Hub is the Overview page. This page contains all relevant information on your Academic Grant, such as the number of classes you have established and your total running credit allocated and used from those classes. It also displays shortcuts to other benefits provided by the Education Hub: Software, Learning, and Quickstart templates.
