# Quickstart: Create a course in the Azure Education Hub

In this quickstart, you create a course in the Azure Education Hub. You also learn about subscriptions.

## Prerequisites

- An academic grant with an approved credit amount
- A subscription that will access your Azure credit

### Subscriptions

Each student receives a subscription tied to a monetary cap of credit that you allocate. A monetary cap is the US$ amount of an academic sponsorship. For example, a $1,000 monetary cap provides the recipient with a $1,000 Azure credit. You can calculate costs by using the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).

You can choose to allocate a cap to the subscriptions to prevent
unintended use, and then set an expiration date. For example:

- **Flat amount per class**: Each student gets $*x* to manage for the entire quarter or semester.
- **Flat amount per project group**: A project team receives $*x* to fund a group project.

At the subscription level, you can increase or decrease the cap. Changes take effect with minimal latency. When the class or project ends, you can reallocate an unused cap to other subscriptions before the expiration date.

## Create a course

1. In the Education Hub, select **Courses** to open the pane where you create and manage courses. A table shows all your existing courses.

1. On the **Create a Course** pane, fill in the details. You can create a course roster by using either of these methods:

    - **Roster**: If you already have the names and sign-in information for all students, you can populate and upload a roster file. To download a sample file of the .csv file that you need to upload the roster, select the **Download sample file** link.
    - **Invitation code**: If you choose to use an invitation code, decide how many codes can be redeemed and when they expire. You'll send your students the following link to redeem the code: `https://aka.ms/joinedu`.

1. Select **Create Course**. The process might take a few moments. When the process finishes, the Education Hub shows a message that you successfully created a course.
