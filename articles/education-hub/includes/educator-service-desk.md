# Support

Most sponsored academic offers include a Developer tier of Azure Support for free. Microsoft also offers an [Educator Services Desk](azuredu@microsoft.com) where your local Microsoft representative or teaching assistant (TA) can request support for any questions or issues regarding the Education Hub, including setup issues.
