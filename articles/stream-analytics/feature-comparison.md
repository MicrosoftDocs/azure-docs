# Choose developer tool for building Stream Analytic jobs

Beside building your Stream Analytic jobs in the Azure portal, you can use the [Azure Stream Analytics Tools extension for Visual Studio Code](quick-create-visual-studio-code.md) to write, debug and run your streaming query locally for better development experience. 

This table shows what features are supported between Azure portal and Visual Studio Code. 

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio Code tools don't support jobs in the China East, China North, Germany Central, and Germany NorthEast regions.
