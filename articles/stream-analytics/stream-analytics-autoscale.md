# Autoscale streaming units 

Streaming units (SUs) represent the computing resources that are allocated to execute a Stream Analytics job. The higher the number of SUs, the more CPU and memory resources are allocated to your job. Stream Analytics offers two types of scaling, which allows you to have the right number of [Streaming Units](stream-analytics-streaming-unit-consumption.md) (SUs) running to handle the load of your job.

This article explains how you can use these different scaling methods for your Stream Analytics job in the Azure portal.

The two types of scaling supported by Stream Analytics are _manual scale_ and _custom autoscale_.

_Manual scale_ allows you to maintain and adjust a fixed number of streaming units for your job.

_Custom autoscale_ allows you to specify the minimum and maximum number of streaming units for your job to dynamically adjust based on your rule definitions. Custom autoscale examines the preconfigured set of rules. Then it determines to add SUs to handle increases in load or to reduce the number of SUs when computing resources are sitting idle. For more information about autoscale in Azure Monitor, see [Overview of autoscale in Microsoft Azure](/azure/azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-overview).

> [!NOTE]
> Although you can use manual scale regardless of the job's state, custom autoscale can only be enabled when the job is in the `running` state.

Examples of custom autoscale rules include:

- Increase streaming units when the average SU% utilization of the job over the last 2 minutes goes above 75%.
- Decrease streaming units when the average SU% utilization of the job over the last 15 minutes is below 30%.
- Use more streaming units during business hours and fewer during off hours.

## Autoscale limits

All Stream Analytics jobs can autoscale between 1/3, 2/3 and 1 SU V2. Autoscaling beyond 1 SU V2 requires your job to have a parallel or [embarrassingly parallel topology](stream-analytics-parallelization.md#embarrassingly-parallel-jobs). Parallel jobs created with less than or equal to 1 streaming unit can autoscale to the maximum SU value for that job based on the number of partitions.

## Scaling your Stream Analytics job

First, follow these steps to navigate to the **Scale** page for your Azure Stream Analytics job.

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. In the list of resources, find the Stream Analytics job that you want to scale and then open it.
3. In the job page, under the **Configure** heading, select **Scale**.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/configure-scale.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing navigation to Scale." lightbox="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/configure-scale.png" :::
1. Under **Configure** , you'll see two options for scaling: **Manual scale** and **Custom autoscale**.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/configure-manual-custom-autoscale.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Configure area where you select Manual scale or custom autoscale." lightbox="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/configure-manual-custom-autoscale.png" :::

## Manual scale

This setting allows you to set a fixed number of streaming units for your job. Notice that the default number of SUs is 1 when creating a job.

### To manually scale your job

1. Select **Manual scale** if it isn't already selected.
2. Use the **Slider** to set the SUs for the job or type directly into the box. You're limited to specific SU settings when the job is running. The limitation is dependent on your job configuration.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/manual-scale-slider.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Manual scale where you select the number of streaming units with a slider." lightbox="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/manual-scale-slider.png" :::
3. Select **Save** on the toolbar to save the setting.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/save-manual-scale-setting.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Save option in the Configure area." lightbox="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/save-manual-scale-setting.png" :::
 
## Custom autoscale - default condition

You can configure automatic scaling of streaming units by using conditions. The **Default** scale condition is executed when none of the other scale conditions match. As such, you must select a Default condition for your job. You may choose a name for your Default condition or leave it as `Auto created scale condition`, which is pre-populated.

:::image type="content" source="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/configure-custom-autoscale-default-scale-condition.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Custom autoscale default condition that you edit." lightbox="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/configure-custom-autoscale-default-scale-condition.png" :::

Set the **Default** condition by choosing one of the following scale modes:

- **Scale based on a metric** (such as CPU or memory usage)
- **Scale to specific number of streaming units**

> [!NOTE]
> You can't set a **Schedule** within the Default condition. The Default is only executed when none of the other schedule conditions are met.

### Scale based on a metric

The following procedure shows you how to add a condition to automatically increase streaming units (scale out) when the SU (memory) usage is greater than 75%. Or how to decrease streaming units (scale in) when the SU usage is less than 25%. Increments are made from fractional units (1/3 and 2/3) to a full streaming unit (1 SU V2). Similarly, decrements are made from 1 to 2/3 to 1/3.

1. On the **Scale** page, select **Custom autoscale**.
2. In the **Default** section of the page, specify a **name** for the default condition. Select the **pencil** symbol to edit the text.
3. Select **Scale based on a metric** for **Scale mode**.
4. Select **+ Add a rule**.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/scale-metric-add-role.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the add scale rule option." lightbox="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/scale-metric-add-role.png" :::
5. On the **Scale rule** page, follow these steps:
    1. Under **Metric Namespace**, select a metric from the **Metric name** drop-down list. In this example, it's **SU % Utilization**.
    2. Select an Operator and threshold values. In this example, they're **Greater than** and **75** for **Metric threshold to trigger scale action**.
    3. Select an **operation** in the **Action** section. In this example, it's set to **Increase**.
    4. Then, select **Add**.  
        :::image type="content" source="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/rule-metric-operators-add.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing adding a rule metric options." lightbox="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/rule-metric-operators-add.png" :::
6. Select **+ Add a rule** again, and follow these steps on the **Scale rule** page:
    1. Select a metric from the **Metric name** drop-down list. In this example, it's **SU % Utilization**.
    2. Select an operator and threshold values. In this example, they're **Less than** and **25** for **Metric threshold to trigger scale action**.
    3. Select an **operation** in the **Action** section. In this example, it's set to **Decrease**.
    4. Then, select **Add**.
7. The autoscale feature decreases the streaming units for the namespace if the overall SU usage goes below 25% in this example.
8. Set the **minimum** and **maximum** and **default** number of streaming units. The minimum and maximum streaming units represent the scaling limitations for your job. The **default** value is used in the rare instance that scaling failed. We recommended that you set the **default** value to the number of SUs that the job is currently running with.
9. Select **Save**.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/save-scale-rule-streaming-units-limits.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Save option for a rule." lightbox="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/save-scale-rule-streaming-units-limits.png" :::

> [!NOTE]
> Flapping refers to a loop condition that causes a series of opposing scale events. Flapping happens when a scale event triggers the opposite scale event. Refer to [this](/azure/azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-flapping) article which describes flapping in autoscale and how to avoid it.

### Scale to specific number of streaming units

Follow these steps to configure the rule to scale the job to use specific number of streaming units. Again, the default condition is applied when none of the other scale conditions match.

1. On the **Scale** page, select **Custom autoscale**.
2. In the **Default** section of the page, specify a **name** for the default condition.
3. Select **Scale to specific streaming units** for **Scale mode**.
4. For **Streaming units**, select the number of default streaming units.

### Custom autoscale â€“ Add more scale conditions

The previous section shows you how to add a default condition for the autoscale setting. This section shows you how to add more conditions to the autoscale setting. For these other non-default conditions, you can set a schedule based on specific days of the week or a date range.

### Scale based on a metric

1. On the **Scale** page, select **Custom autoscale** for the **Choose how to scale your resource** option.
2. Select **Add a scale condition** under the **Default** block.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/save-custom-autoscale-add-condition.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the custom autoscale scale condition." lightbox="./media/stream-analytics-autoscale/save-custom-autoscale-add-condition.png" :::
3. Specify a **name** for the condition.
4. Confirm that the **Scale based on a metric** option is selected.
5. Select **+ Add a rule** to add a rule to increase streaming units when the overall SU % utilization goes above 75%. Follow steps from the preceding **Default condition** section.
6. Set the **minimum** and **maximum** and **default** number of streaming units.
7. Set **Schedule**, **Timezone**, **Start date**, and **End date** on the custom condition (but not on the default condition). You can either specify start and end dates for the condition (or) select **Repeat specific days** (Monday, Tuesday, and so on.) of a week.
    - If you select **Specify start/end dates**, select the **Timezone**, **Start date and time**, and **End date and time** for the condition to be in effect.
    - If you select **Repeat specific days**, select the days of the week, timezone, start time, and end time when the condition should apply.

### Scale to specific number of streaming units

1. On the **Scale** page, select **Custom autoscale** for the **Choose how to scale your resource** option.
2. Select **Add a scale condition** under the **Default** block.
3. Specify a **name** for the condition.
4. Select **scale to specific streaming units** option for **Scale mode**.
5. Type in the number of **streaming units**.
6. For the **Schedule**, specify either start and end dates for the condition (or) select specific days (Monday, Tuesday, and so on.) of a week and times.
    1. If you select **Specify start/end dates**, select the **Timezone**, **Start date and time**, and **End date and time** for the condition to be in effect.
    2. If you select **Repeat specific days**, select the days of the week, timezone, start time, and end time when the condition should apply.
