# Azure Stream Analytics data errors

Data errors are errors that occur while processing the data.  These errors most often occur during data de-serialization, serialization, and write operations.  When data errors occur, Stream Analytics writes detailed information and example events to the resource logs. Enable diagnostic logs in your job to get these additional details. In some cases, a summary of this information is also provided through portal notifications.

This article outlines the different error types, causes, and resource log details for input and output data errors.

## Resource Logs schema

See [Troubleshoot Azure Stream Analytics by using diagnostics logs](monitor-azure-stream-analytics-reference.md#resource-logs-schema) to see the schema for resource logs. The following JSON is an example value for the **Properties** field of a resource log for a data error.

```json
{
    "Source": "InputTelemetryData",
    "Type": "DataError",
    "DataErrorType": "InputDeserializerError.InvalidData",
    "BriefMessage": "Json input stream should either be an array of objects or line separated objects. Found token type: Integer",
    "Message": "Input Message Id: https:\\/\\/exampleBlob.blob.core.windows.net\\/inputfolder\\/csv.txt Error: JSON input stream should either be an array of objects or line separated objects. Found token type: Integer",
    "ExampleEvents": "[\"1,2\\\\u000d\\\\u000a3,4\\\\u000d\\\\u000a5,6\"]",
    "FromTimestamp": "2019-03-22T22:34:18.5664937Z",
    "ToTimestamp": "2019-03-22T22:34:18.5965248Z",
    "EventCount": 1
}
```

## Input data errors

**Error message**

```json
"Message": "Out of order event(s) received."
```

## Output data errors

Azure Stream Analytics can identify output data errors with or without an I/O request to the output sink depending on the configuration. For example, missing a required column, such as  `PartitionKey`, when using Azure Table output can be identified without an I/O request. However, constraint violations in SQL output do require an I/O request.

There are several data errors that can only be detected after making a call to the output sink, which can slow down processing. To resolve this, change your job's configuration or the query that is causing the data error.

### OutputDataConversionError.RequiredColumnMissing

* Cause: The column required for the output doesn't exist. For example, a column defined as Azure Table PartitionKey does't exist.
* Portal notification provided: Yes
* Resource log level: Warning
* Impact:  All output data conversion errors including missing required column are handled according to the [Output Data Policy](./stream-analytics-output-error-policy.md) setting.
* Log details
   * Name of the column and either the record identifier or part of the record.

**Error message**

```json
"Message": "The output record does not contain primary key property: [deviceId] Ensure the query output contains the column [deviceId] with a unique non-empty string less than '255' characters."
```

### OutputDataConversionError.ColumnNameInvalid

* Cause: The column value doesn't conform with the output. For example, the column name isn't a valid Azure table column.
* Portal notification provided: Yes
* Resource log level: Warning
* Impact:  All output data conversion errors including invalid column name are handled according to the [Output Data Policy](./stream-analytics-output-error-policy.md) setting.
* Log details
   * Name of the column and either record identifier or part of the record.

**Error message**

```json
"Message": "Invalid property name #deviceIdValue. Please refer MSDN for Azure table property naming convention."
```

### OutputDataConversionError.TypeConversionError

* Cause: A column can't be converted to a valid type in the output. For example, the value of column is incompatible with constraints or type defined in SQL table.
* Portal notification provided: Yes
* Resource log level: Warning
* Impact:  All output data conversion errors including type conversion error are handled according to the [Output Data Policy](./stream-analytics-output-error-policy.md) setting.
* Log details
   * Name of the column.
   * Either record identifier or part of the record.

**Error message**

```json
"Message": "The column [id] value null or its type is invalid. Ensure to provide a unique non-empty string less than '255' characters."
```

### OutputDataConversionError.RecordExceededSizeLimit

* Cause: The value of the message is greater than the supported output size. For example, a record is larger than 1 MB for an Event Hub output.
* Portal notification provided: Yes
* Resource log level: Warning
* Impact:  All output data conversion errors including record exceeded size limit are handled according to the [Output Data Policy](./stream-analytics-output-error-policy.md) setting.
* Log details
   * Either record identifier or part of the record.

**Error message**

```json
"BriefMessage": "Single output event exceeds the maximum message size limit allowed (262144 bytes) by Event Hub."
```

### OutputDataConversionError.DuplicateKey

* Cause: A record already contains a column with the same name as a System column. For example, CosmosDB output with a column named ID when ID column is to a different column.
* Portal notification provided: Yes
* Resource log level: Warning
* Impact:  All output data conversion errors including duplicate key are handled according to the [Output Data Policy](./stream-analytics-output-error-policy.md) setting.
* Log details
   * Name of the column.
   * Either record identifier or part of the record.

```json
"BriefMessage": "Column 'devicePartitionKey' is being mapped to multiple columns."
```
