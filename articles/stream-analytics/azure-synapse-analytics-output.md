# Azure Synapse Analytics output from Azure Stream Analytics

[Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/synapse-analytics) is a limitless analytics service that brings together enterprise data warehousing and Big Data analytics. 

Azure Stream Analytics jobs can output to a dedicated SQL pool table in Azure Synapse Analytics and can process throughput rates up to 200MB/sec. This supports the most demanding real-time analytics and hot-path data processing needs for workloads such as reporting and dashboarding.  

The dedicated SQL pool table must exist before you can add it as output to your Stream Analytics job. The table's schema must match the fields and their types in your job's output. 

> [!NOTE] 
> To use Azure Synapse Analytics as output, ensure that the storage account is configured at the job level, not at the output level. To change the storage account settings, in the **Configure** menu of the Stream Analytics job, go to **Storage account settings**. Use only storage account types that support tables: General Purpose V2 and General Purpose V1. Choose only Standard tier. Premium tier isn't supported in this scenario.
