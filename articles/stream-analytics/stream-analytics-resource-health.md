# Stream Analytics troubleshooting workflow

The primary goal of the resource health check blade is to help the customer answer the question: “Is the problem mine or Microsoft's?”

If the problem is on the Microsoft side, efforts towards troubleshooting the issue may be futile.  Thus, the resource health check blade helps ensure that customers do not needlessly spend time troubleshooting issues that they cannot possibly fix.

## Troubleshooting workflow

Resource Health can be seen by clocking on the “Resource Health” blade.
