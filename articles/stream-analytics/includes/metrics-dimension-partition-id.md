When streaming data is ingested into the Azure Stream Analytics service for processing, the input data is distributed to streaming nodes according to the partitions in the input source. The **Partition ID** dimension is the ID of the input data partition from the input source. 

For example, if the input source is an event hub, the partition ID is the event hub's partition ID. **Partition ID** in the input is the same as it is in the output.

The **Partition ID** dimension is available for filtering and splitting the following metrics:
-	**Backlogged Input Events**
-	**Data Conversion Errors**
-	**Early Input Events**
-	**Input Deserialization Errors**
-	**Input Event Bytes**
-	**Input Events**
-	**Input Source Received**
-	**Late Input Events**
-	**Output Events**
-	**Watermark Delay**
