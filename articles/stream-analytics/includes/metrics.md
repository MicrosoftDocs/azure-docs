Azure Stream Analytics provides the following metrics for you to monitor your job's health.

| Metric                 | Definition                               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Backlogged Input Events**       | Number of input events that are backlogged. A nonzero value for this metric implies that your job can't keep up with the number of incoming events. If this value is slowly increasing or is consistently nonzero, you should scale out your job. To learn more, see [Understand and adjust streaming units](../stream-analytics-streaming-unit-consumption.md). |
| **Data Conversion Errors** | Number of output events that couldn't be converted to the expected output schema. To drop events that encounter this scenario, you can change the error policy to **Drop**. |
| **CPU % Utilization** (preview)       | Percentage of CPU that your job utilizes. Even if this value is very high (90 percent or more), you shouldn't increase the number of SUs based on this metric alone. If the number of backlogged input events or watermark delays increases, you can then use this metric to determine if the CPU is the bottleneck. <br><br>This metric might have intermittent spikes. We recommend that you do scale tests to determine the upper bound of your job after which inputs are backlogged or watermark delays increase because of a CPU bottleneck. |
| **Early Input Events**       | Events whose application time stamp is earlier than their arrival time by more than 5 minutes. |
| **Failed Function Requests** | Number of failed Azure Machine Learning function calls (if present). |
| **Function Events**        | Number of events sent to the Azure Machine Learning function (if present). |
| **Function Requests**      | Number of calls to the Azure Machine Learning function (if present). |
| **Input Deserialization Errors**       | Number of input events that couldn't be deserialized.  |
| **Input Event Bytes**      | Amount of data that the Stream Analytics job receives, in bytes. You can use this metric to validate that events are being sent to the input source. |
| **Input Events**           | Number of records deserialized from the input events. This count doesn't include incoming events that result in deserialization errors. Stream Analytics can ingest the same events multiple times in scenarios like internal recoveries and self-joins. Don't expect **Input Events** and **Output Events** metrics to match if your job has a simple pass-through query. |
| **Input Sources Received**       | Number of messages that the job receives. For Azure Event Hubs, a message is a single `EventData` item. For Azure Blob Storage, a message is a single blob. <br><br>Note that input sources are counted before deserialization. If there are deserialization errors, input sources can be greater than input events. Otherwise, input sources can be less than or equal to input events because each message can contain multiple events. |
| **Late Input Events**      | Events that arrived later than the configured tolerance window for late arrivals. [Learn more about Azure Stream Analytics event order considerations](../stream-analytics-time-handling.md). |
| **Out-of-Order Events**    | Number of events received out of order that were either dropped or given an adjusted time stamp, based on the event ordering policy. This metric can be affected by the configuration of the **Out-of-Order Tolerance Window** setting. |
| **Output Events**          | Amount of data that the Stream Analytics job sends to the output target, in number of events. |
| **Runtime Errors**         | Total number of errors related to query processing. It excludes errors found while ingesting events or outputting results. |
| **SU (Memory) % Utilization**       | Percentage of memory that your job utilizes. If this metric is consistently over 80 percent, the watermark delay is rising, and the number of backlogged events is rising, consider increasing streaming units (SUs). High utilization indicates that the job is using close to the maximum allocated resources. |
| **Watermark Delay**       | Maximum watermark delay across all partitions of all outputs in the job. |
