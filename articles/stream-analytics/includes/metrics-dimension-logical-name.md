**Logical Name** is the input or output name for a Stream Analytics job. For example, assume that a Stream Analytics job has four inputs and five outputs. You'll see the four individual logical inputs and five individual logical outputs when you split input-related and output-related metrics by this dimension.

The **Logical Name** dimension is available for filtering and splitting the following metrics:
-	**Backlogged Input Events** 
-	**Data Conversion Errors**
-	**Early Input Events**
-	**Input Deserialization Errors**
-	**Input Event Bytes**
-	**Input Events**
-	**Input Source Received**
-	**Late Input Events**
-	**Out-of-Order Events**
-	**Output Events**
-	**Watermark Delay**
