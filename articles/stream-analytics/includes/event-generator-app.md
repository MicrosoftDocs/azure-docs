## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Create an event hub

You need to send some sample data to an event hub before Stream Analytics can analyze the fraudulent calls data stream. In this tutorial, you send data to Azure by using  [Azure Event Hubs](../../event-hubs/event-hubs-about.md).

Use the following steps to create an event hub and send call data to that event hub:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Select **All services** on the left menu, select **Internet of things**, mouse the mouse over **Event Hubs**, and then select **+ (Add)** button.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/event-generator-app/find-event-hub-resource.png" lightbox="media/event-generator-app/find-event-hub-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Event Hubs creation page.":::
3. On the **Create Namespace** page, follow these steps:
    1. Select an **Azure subscription** where you want to create the event hub. 
    1. For **Resource group**, select **Create new** and enter a name for the resource group. The Event Hubs namespace is created in this resource group.
    1. For **Namespace name**, enter a unique name for the Event Hubs namespace. 
    1. For **Location**, select the region in which you want to create the namespace. 
    1. For **Pricing tier**, select **Standard**.
    1. Select **Review + create** at the bottom of the page. 

        :::image type="content" source="media/event-generator-app/create-event-hub-namespace.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Create Namespace page.":::
    1. On the **Review + create** page of the namespace creation wizard, select **Create** at the bottom of the page after reviewing all settings. 
5. After the namespace is deployed successfully, select **Go to resource** to navigate to the **Event Hubs Namespace** page.
6. On the **Event Hubs Namespace** page, select **+Event Hub** on the command bar.

    :::image type="content" source="media/event-generator-app/add-event-hub-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Add event hub button on the Event Hubs Namespace page.":::    
1. On the **Create Event Hub** page, enter a **Name** for the event hub. Set the **Partition Count** to 2.  Use the default options in the remaining settings and select **Review + create**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/event-generator-app/create-event-hub-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Create event hub page.":::    
1. On the **Review + create** page, select **Create** at the bottom of the page. Then wait for the deployment to succeed.

### Grant access to the event hub and get a connection string

Before an application can send data to Azure Event Hubs, the event hub must have a policy that allows access. The access policy produces a connection string that includes authorization information.

1. On the **Event Hubs Namespace** page, select **Shared access policies** on the left menu.
1. Select **RootManageSharedAccessKey** from the list of policies. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/event-generator-app/select-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Shared access policies page.":::
1. Then, select the copy button next to **Connection string - primary key**. 
1. Paste the connection string into a text editor. You need this connection string in the next section.

   The connection string looks as follows:

   `Endpoint=sb://<Your event hub namespace>.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=<Your shared access policy name>;SharedAccessKey=<generated key>`

   Notice that the connection string contains multiple key-value pairs separated with semicolons: **Endpoint**, **SharedAccessKeyName**, and **SharedAccessKey**.

## Start the event generator application

Before you start the TelcoGenerator app, you should configure it to send data to the Azure Event Hubs you created earlier.

1. Extract the contents of [TelcoGenerator.zip](https://aka.ms/asatelcodatagen) file.
2. Open the `TelcoGenerator\TelcoGenerator\telcodatagen.exe.config` file in a text editor of your choice There's more than one `.config` file, so be sure that you open the correct one.
3. Update the `<appSettings>` element in the config file with the following details:

   * Set the value of the **EventHubName** key to the value of the **EntityPath** at the end of the connection string.
   * Set the value of the **Microsoft.ServiceBus.ConnectionString** key to the connection string to the namespace. If you use a connection string to an event hub, not a namespace, remove `EntityPath` value (`;EntityPath=myeventhub`) at the end. **Don't forget** to remove the semicolon that precedes the EntityPath  value. 
4. Save the file.
5. Next open a command window and change to the folder where you unzipped the TelcoGenerator application. Then enter the following command:

   ```cmd
   .\telcodatagen.exe 1000 0.2 2
   ```

   This command takes the following parameters:
   * Number of call data records per hour.
   * Percentage of fraud probability, which is how often the app should simulate a fraudulent call. The value 0.2 means that about 20% of the call records look fraudulent.
   * Duration in hours, which is the number of hours that the app should run. You can also stop the app at any time by ending the process (**Ctrl+C**) at the command line.

   After a few seconds, the app starts displaying phone call records on the screen as it sends them to the event hub. The phone call data contains the following fields:

   |**Record**  |**Definition**  |
   |---------|---------|
   |CallrecTime    |  The timestamp for the call start time.       |
   |SwitchNum     |  The telephone switch used to connect the call. For this example, the switches are strings that represent the country/region of origin (US, China, UK, Germany, or Australia).       |
   |CallingNum     |  The phone number of the caller.       |
   |CallingIMSI     |  The International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). It's a unique identifier of the caller.       |
   |CalledNum     |   The phone number of the call recipient.      |
   |CalledIMSI     |  International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). It's a unique identifier of the call recipient.       |

## Create a Stream Analytics job

Now that you have a stream of call events, you can create a Stream Analytics job that reads data from the event hub.

1. To create a Stream Analytics job, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Select **Create a resource** and search for **Stream Analytics job**. Select the **Stream Analytics job** tile and select **Create**.
1. On the **New Stream Analytics job** page, follow these steps:
    1. For **Subscription**, select the subscription that contains the Event Hubs namespace.
    1. For **Resource group**, select the resource group you created earlier.
    1. In the **Instance details** section, For **Name**, enter a unique name for the Stream Analytics job.         
    1. For **Region**, select the region in which you want to create the Stream Analytics job. We recommend that you place the job and the event hub in the same region for best performance and so that you don't pay to transfer data between regions.
    1. For **Hosting environment**< select **Cloud** if it's not already selected. Stream Analytics jobs can be deployed to cloud or edge. **Cloud** allows you to deploy to Azure Cloud, and **Edge** allows you to deploy to an IoT Edge device.
    1. For **Streaming units**, select **1**. Streaming units represent the computing resources that are required to execute a job. By default, this value is set to 1. To learn about scaling streaming units, see [understanding and adjusting streaming units](../stream-analytics-streaming-unit-consumption.md) article.
    1. Select **Review + create** at the bottom of the page. 
    
        :::image type="content" source="media/event-generator-app/create-stream-analytics-job.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Create Azure Stream Analytics job page.":::
1. On the **Review + create** page, review settings, and then select  **Create** to create the Stream Analytics job. 
5. After the job is deployed, select **Go to resource** to navigate to the **Stream Analytics job** page. 

## Configure job input

The next step is to define an input source for the job to read data using the event hub you created in the previous section.

1. On the **Stream Analytics job** page, in the **Job Topology** section on the left menu, select **Inputs**.
2. On the **Inputs** page, select **+ Add input** and **Event hub**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/event-generator-app/add-input-event-hub-menu.png" lightbox="media/event-generator-app/add-input-event-hub-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Input page for a Stream Analytics job."::: 
3. On the **Event hub** page, follow these steps: 
    1. For **Input alias**, enter **CallStream**. Input alias is a friendly name to identify your input. Input alias can only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens, and must be 3-63 characters long.
    1. For **Subscription**, select the Azure subscription where you created the event hub. The event hub can be in same or a different subscription as the Stream Analytics job.
    1. For **Event Hubs namespace**, select the Event Hubs namespace you created in the previous section. All the namespaces available in your current subscription are listed in the dropdown.
    1. For **Event hub name**, select the event hub you created in the previous section. All the event hubs available in the selected namespace are listed in the dropdown.
    1. For **Event hub consumer group**, keep the **Create new** option selected so that a new consumer group is created on the event hub. We recommend that you use a distinct consumer group for each Stream Analytics job. If no consumer group is specified, the Stream Analytics job uses the `$Default` consumer group. When a job contains a self-join or has multiple inputs, some inputs later might be read by more than one reader. This situation affects the number of readers in a single consumer group.
    1. For **Authentication mode**, select **Connection string**. It's easier to test the tutorial with this option.  
    1. For **Event hub policy name**, select **Use existing**, and then select the policy you created earlier. 
    1. Select **Save** at the bottom of the page.
