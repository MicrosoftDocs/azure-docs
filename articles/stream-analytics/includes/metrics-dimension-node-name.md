A streaming node represents a set of compute resources that's used to process your input data. Every six streaming units (SUs) translate to one node, which the service automatically manages on your behalf. For more information about the relationship between streaming units and streaming nodes, see [Understand and adjust streaming units](../stream-analytics-streaming-unit-consumption.md).

**Node Name** is a dimension at the streaming node level. It can help you to drill down certain metrics to the specific streaming node level. For example, you can split the **CPU % Utilization** metric by streaming node level to check the CPU utilization of an individual streaming node.

The **Node Name** dimension is available for filtering and splitting the following metrics:
-	**Backlogged Input Events**
-	**CPU % Utilization (preview)** 
-	**Input Events**
-	**Output Events**
-	**SU (Memory) % Utilization**
-	**Watermark Delay**
