# Export and manage Stream Analytics jobs in Visual Studio Code

The Azure Stream Analytics (ASA) extension for Visual Studio Code gives you a seamless experience for managing Stream Analytics jobs in the cloud. It can be used across Windows, Mac and Linux platforms. With the ASA extension, it allows you to:

- Create, start, and stop a cloud job in Azure
- Export existing jobs to a local machine
- List jobs and view job entities
- View and debug job using **Job Diagram** and **Monitor**

2. Select **STREAM ANALYTICS** in the explorer to locate the job you want to export.
