# Use Visual Studio to view Azure Stream Analytics jobs

Azure Stream Analytics tools for Visual Studio makes it easy for developers to manage their Stream Analytics jobs directly from the IDE. With Azure Stream Analytics tools, you can:
- [Create new jobs](stream-analytics-quick-create-vs.md)
- Start, stop, and [monitor jobs](stream-analytics-monitor-jobs-use-vs.md)
- Check job results
- Export existing jobs to a project
- Test input and output connections
- [Run queries locally](stream-analytics-vs-tools-local-run.md)

Learn how to [install Azure Stream Analytics tools for Visual Studio](stream-analytics-tools-for-visual-studio-install.md).

## Explore the job view

You can use the job view to interact with Azure Stream Analytics jobs from Visual Studio.

### Open the job view

1. In **Server Explorer**, select **Stream Analytics jobs** and then select **Refresh**. Your job should appear under **Stream Analytics jobs**.
