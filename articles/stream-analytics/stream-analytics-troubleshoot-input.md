# Troubleshoot input connections

This article describes common problems with Azure Stream Analytics input connections, how to troubleshoot those problems, and how to correct them. 

Many troubleshooting steps require you to turn on resource logs for your Stream Analytics job. If you don't have resource logs turned on, see [Troubleshoot Azure Stream Analytics by using resource logs](stream-analytics-job-diagnostic-logs.md).

## Job doesn't receive input events

1. Verify your connectivity to inputs and outputs. Use the **Test Connection** button for each input and output.

2. Examine your input data:

    1. Use the [Sample Data](./stream-analytics-test-query.md) button for each input. Download the input sample data.

    1. Inspect the sample data to understand the schema and [data types](/stream-analytics-query/data-types-azure-stream-analytics).

    1. Check [Azure Event Hubs metrics](../event-hubs/event-hubs-metrics-azure-monitor.md) to ensure that events are being sent. Message metrics should be greater than zero if Event Hubs is receiving messages.

3. Ensure that you selected a time range in the input preview. Choose **Select time range**, and then enter a sample duration before testing your query.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For [Azure Stream Analytics jobs](./run-job-in-virtual-network.md) that aren't network injected, don't rely on the source IP address of connections coming from Stream Analytics in any way. They can be public or private IPs, depending on service infrastructure operations that happen from time to time.

## Malformed input events cause deserialization errors

Deserialization problems happen when the input stream of your Stream Analytics job contains malformed messages. For example, a missing parenthesis or brace in a JSON object, or an incorrect time-stamp format in the time field, can cause a malformed message.

When a Stream Analytics job receives a malformed message from an input, it drops the message and notifies you with a warning. A warning symbol appears on the **Inputs** tile of your Stream Analytics job. The warning symbol exists as long as the job is in a running state.

Turn on resource logs to view the details of the error and the message (payload) that caused the error. There are multiple reasons why deserialization errors can occur. For more information about specific deserialization errors, see [Input data errors](data-errors.md#input-data-errors). If resource logs aren't turned on, a brief notification appears in the Azure portal.

If the message payload is greater than 32 KB or is in binary format, run the *CheckMalformedEvents.cs* code available in the [GitHub samples repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-stream-analytics/tree/master/Samples/CheckMalformedEventsEH). This code reads the partition ID offset and prints the data located in that offset.

Other common reasons for input deserialization errors are:

* An integer column that has a value greater than `9223372036854775807`.
* Strings instead of an array of objects or line-separated objects. Valid example: `*[{'a':1}]*`. Invalid example: `*"'a' :1"*`.
* Using an Event Hubs capture blob in Avro format as input in your job.
* Having two columns in a single input event that differ only in case. Example: `*column1*` and `*COLUMN1*`.

## Partition count changes

The partition count of event hubs can be changed. If the partition count of an event hub is changed, you need to stop and restart the Stream Analytics job.

The following error appears when the partition count of an event hub is changed while the job is running: `Microsoft.Streaming.Diagnostics.Exceptions.InputPartitioningChangedException`.

## Job exceeds the maximum Event Hubs receivers

A best practice for using Event Hubs is to use multiple consumer groups for job scalability. The number of readers in the Stream Analytics job for a specific input affects the number of readers in a single consumer group.

The precise number of receivers is based on internal implementation details for the scale-out topology logic. The number isn't exposed externally. The number of readers can change when a job is started or upgraded.

The following error message appears when the number of receivers exceeds the maximum. The message includes a list of existing connections made to Event Hubs under a consumer group. The tag `AzureStreamAnalytics` indicates that the connections are from an Azure streaming service.

```
The streaming job failed: Stream Analytics job has validation errors: Job will exceed the maximum amount of Event Hubs Receivers.

The following information may be helpful in identifying the connected receivers: Exceeded the maximum number of allowed receivers per partition in a consumer group which is 5. List of connected receivers –

AzureStreamAnalytics_c4b65e4a-f572-4cfc-b4e2-cf237f43c6f0_1.
```

> [!NOTE]
> When the number of readers changes during a job upgrade, transient warnings are written to audit logs. Stream Analytics jobs automatically recover from these transient problems.

To add a new consumer group in your Event Hubs instance, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.

2. Locate your event hub.

3. Under the **Entities** heading, select **Event Hubs**.

4. Select the event hub by name.

5. On the **Event Hubs Instance** page, under the **Entities** heading, select **Consumer groups**. A consumer group with the name **$Default** is listed.

6. Select **+ Consumer Group** to add a new consumer group.

   ![Screenshot that shows the button for adding a consumer group in Event Hubs.](media/stream-analytics-event-hub-consumer-groups/new-eh-consumer-group.png)

7. When you created the input in the Stream Analytics job to point to the event hub, you specified the consumer group there. Event Hubs uses **$Default** if no consumer group is specified. After you create a consumer group, edit the event hub input in the Stream Analytics job and specify the name of the new consumer group.

## Readers per partition exceed the Event Hubs limit

If your streaming query syntax references the same resource for event hub input multiple times, the job engine can use multiple readers per query from that same consumer group. When there are too many references to the same consumer group, the job can exceed the limit of five and throw an error. In those circumstances, you can further divide by using multiple inputs across multiple consumer groups.

Scenarios in which the number of readers per partition exceeds the Event Hubs limit of five include:

* Multiple `SELECT` statements: If you use multiple `SELECT` statements that refer to the *same* event hub input, each `SELECT` statement causes a new receiver to be created.

* `UNION`: When you use `UNION`, it's possible to have multiple inputs that refer to the *same* event hub and consumer group.

* `SELF JOIN`: When you use a `SELF JOIN` operation, it's possible to refer to the *same* event hub multiple times.

The following best practices can help mitigate scenarios in which the number of readers per partition exceeds the Event Hubs limit of five.

### Split your query into multiple steps by using a WITH clause

The `WITH` clause specifies a temporary named result set that a `FROM` clause in the query can reference. You define the `WITH` clause in the execution scope of a single `SELECT` statement.

For example, instead of this query:

```SQL
SELECT foo 
INTO output1
FROM inputEventHub

SELECT bar
INTO output2
FROM inputEventHub 
…
```

Use this query:

```SQL
WITH data AS (
   SELECT * FROM inputEventHub
)

SELECT foo
INTO output1
FROM data

SELECT bar
INTO output2
FROM data
…
```

### Ensure that inputs bind to different consumer groups

For queries in which three or more inputs are connected to the same Event Hubs consumer group, create separate consumer groups. This task requires the creation of additional Stream Analytics inputs.

### Create separate inputs with different consumer groups

You can create separate inputs with different consumer groups for the same event hub. In the following example of a `UNION` query, *InputOne* and *InputTwo* refer to the same Event Hubs source. Any query can have separate inputs with different consumer groups. The `UNION` query is only one example.

```sql
WITH 
DataOne AS 
(
SELECT * FROM InputOne 
),

DataTwo AS 
(
SELECT * FROM InputTwo 
),

SELECT foo FROM DataOne
UNION 
SELECT foo FROM DataTwo

```

## Readers per partition exceed the IoT Hub limit

Stream Analytics jobs use the built-in [Event Hubs-compatible endpoint](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-read-builtin.md) in Azure IoT Hub to connect and read events from IoT Hub. If your readers per partition exceed the limits of IoT Hub, you can use the [solutions for Event Hubs](#readers-per-partition-exceed-the-event-hubs-limit) to resolve it. You can create a consumer group for the built-in endpoint through the IoT Hub portal endpoint session or through the [IoT Hub SDK](/rest/api/iothub/IotHubResource/CreateEventHubConsumerGroup).
