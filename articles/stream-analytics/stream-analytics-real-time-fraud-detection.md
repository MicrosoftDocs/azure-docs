# Tutorial: Analyze fraudulent call data with Stream Analytics and visualize results in Power BI dashboard

This tutorial shows you how to analyze phone call data using Azure Stream Analytics. The phone call data, generated by a client application, contains fraudulent calls, which are detected by the Stream Analytics job. You can use techniques from this tutorial for other types of fraud detection, such as credit card fraud or identity theft.

In this tutorial, you perform the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Generate sample phone call data and send it to Azure Event Hubs.
> * Create a Stream Analytics job.
> * Configure job input and output.
> * Define queries to filter fraudulent calls.
> * Test and start the job.
> * Visualize results in Power BI.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you've completed the following steps:

* If you don't have an **Azure subscription**, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Download the **phone call event generator app**, [TelcoGenerator.zip](https://aka.ms/asatelcodatagen) from the Microsoft Download Center or get the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-stream-analytics/tree/master/DataGenerators/TelcoGeneratorCore).
* You need a **Power BI** account.

## Configure job output

The last step is to define an output sink where the job can write the transformed data. In this tutorial, you output and visualize data with Power BI.

1. From the Azure portal, open **All resources**, and select the *ASATutorial* Stream Analytics job.
2. In the **Job Topology** section of the Stream Analytics job, select the **Outputs** option.
3. Select **+ Add output** > **Power BI**. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/stream-analytics-real-time-fraud-detection/select-output-type.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Outputs page with Add output -> Power BI menu selected.":::
1. Fill the output form with the following details:

   |**Setting**  |**Suggested value**  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Output alias  |  MyPBIoutput  |
   |Group workspace| My workspace |
   |Dataset name  |   ASAdataset  |
   |Table name |  ASATable  |
   | Authentication mode | User token |
5. Select **Authorize** and follow the prompts to authenticate Power BI.

6. Select **Save** at the bottom of the **Power BI** page. 

   This tutorial uses the *User token* authentication mode. To use Managed Identity, see [Use Managed Identity to authenticate your Azure Stream Analytics job to Power BI](powerbi-output-managed-identity.md).

## Create queries to transform real-time data

At this point, you have a Stream Analytics job set up to read an incoming data stream. The next step is to create a query that analyzes the data in real time. The queries use a SQL-like language that has some extensions specific to Stream Analytics.

In this section of the tutorial, you create and test several queries to learn a few ways in which you can transform an input stream for analysis. 

The queries you create here will just display the transformed data to the screen. In a later section, you'll write the transformed data to Power BI.

To learn more about the language, see the [Azure Stream Analytics Query Language Reference](/stream-analytics-query/stream-analytics-query-language-reference).

### Test using a pass-through query

If you want to archive every event, you can use a pass-through query to read all the fields in the payload of the event.

1. Navigate to your Stream Analytics job in the Azure portal and select **Query** under **Job topology** on the left menu. 
2. In the query window, enter this query:

   ```SQL
   SELECT 
       *
   FROM 
       CallStream
   ```

    >[!NOTE]
    >As with SQL, keywords are not case-sensitive, and whitespace is not significant.

    In this query, `CallStream` is the alias that you specified when you created the input. If you used a different alias, use that name instead.
3. Select **Test query**.

    The Stream Analytics job runs the query against the sample data from the input and displays the output at the bottom of the window. The results indicate that the Event Hubs and the Streaming Analytics job are configured correctly.

    :::image type="content" source="media/stream-analytics-real-time-fraud-detection/sample-output-passthrough.png" alt-text="Sample output from test query.":::

    The exact number of records you see depends on how many records were captured in the sample.

### Reduce the number of fields using a column projection

In many cases, your analysis doesn't need all the columns from the input stream. You can use a query to project a smaller set of returned fields than in the pass-through query.

Run the following query and notice the output.

```SQL
SELECT CallRecTime, SwitchNum, CallingIMSI, CallingNum, CalledNum 
INTO
    [MyPBIoutput]
FROM 
    CallStream
```

### Count incoming calls by region: Tumbling window with aggregation

Suppose you want to count the number of incoming calls per region. In streaming data, when you want to perform aggregate functions like counting, you need to segment the stream into temporal units, since the data stream itself is effectively endless. You do this using a Streaming Analytics [window function](stream-analytics-window-functions.md). You can then work with the data inside that window as a unit.

For this transformation, you want a sequence of temporal windows that don't overlapâ€”each window has a discrete set of data that you can group and aggregate. This type of window is referred to as a *Tumbling window*. Within the Tumbling window, you can get a count of the incoming calls grouped by `SwitchNum`, which represents the country/region where the call originated.

1. Paste the following query in the query editor:

    ```SQL
    SELECT 
        System.Timestamp as WindowEnd, SwitchNum, COUNT(*) as CallCount 
    FROM
        CallStream TIMESTAMP BY CallRecTime 
    GROUP BY TUMBLINGWINDOW(s, 5), SwitchNum
    ```

    This query uses the `Timestamp By` keyword in the `FROM` clause to specify which timestamp field in the input stream to use to define the Tumbling window. In this case, the window divides the data into segments by the `CallRecTime` field in each record. (If no field is specified, the windowing operation uses the time that each event arrives at the event hub. See "Arrival Time vs Application Time" in [Stream Analytics Query Language Reference](/stream-analytics-query/stream-analytics-query-language-reference). 

    The projection includes `System.Timestamp`, which returns a timestamp for the end of each window. 

    To specify that you want to use a Tumbling window, you use the [TUMBLINGWINDOW](/stream-analytics-query/tumbling-window-azure-stream-analytics) function in the `GROUP BY` clause. In the function, you specify a time unit (anywhere from a microsecond to a day) and a window size (how many units). In this example, the Tumbling window consists of 5-second intervals, so you get a count by country/region for every 5 seconds' worth of calls.

2. Select **Test query**. In the results, notice that the timestamps under **WindowEnd** are in 5-second increments.

### Detect SIM fraud using a self-join

For this example, consider fraudulent usage to be calls that originate from the same user but in different locations within 5 seconds of one another. For example, the same user can't legitimately make a call from the US and Australia at the same time.

To check for these cases, you can use a self-join of the streaming data to join the stream to itself based on the `CallRecTime` value. You can then look for call records where the `CallingIMSI` value (the originating number) is the same, but the `SwitchNum` value (country/region of origin) isn't the same.

When you use a join with streaming data, the join must provide some limits on how far the matching rows can be separated in time. As noted earlier, the streaming data is effectively endless. The time bounds for the relationship are specified inside the `ON` clause of the join, using the `DATEDIFF` function. In this case, the join is based on a 5-second interval of call data.

1. Paste the following query in the query editor:

    ```sql
    SELECT System.Timestamp AS WindowEnd, COUNT(*) AS FraudulentCalls
        INTO "MyPBIoutput"
        FROM "CallStream" CS1 TIMESTAMP BY CallRecTime
        JOIN "CallStream" CS2 TIMESTAMP BY CallRecTime
        ON CS1.CallingIMSI = CS2.CallingIMSI
        AND DATEDIFF(ss, CS1, CS2) BETWEEN 1 AND 5
        WHERE CS1.SwitchNum != CS2.SwitchNum
        GROUP BY TumblingWindow(Duration(second, 1))
    ```

    This query is like any SQL join except for the `DATEDIFF` function in the join. This version of `DATEDIFF` is specific to Streaming Analytics, and it must appear in the `ON...BETWEEN` clause. The parameters are a time unit (seconds in this example) and the aliases of the two sources for the join. This function is different from the standard SQL `DATEDIFF` function.

    The `WHERE` clause includes the condition that flags the fraudulent call: the originating switches aren't the same.

2. Select **Test query**. Review the output, and then select **Save query**.

## Start the job and visualize output

1. To start the job, navigate to the job **Overview** and select **Start**.

2. Select **Now** for job output start time and select **Start**. You can view the job status in the notification bar.

3. Once the job succeeds, navigate to [Power BI](https://powerbi.com/) and sign in with your work or school account. If the Stream Analytics job query is outputting results, the *ASAdataset* dataset you created exists under the **Datasets** tab.

4. From your Power BI workspace, select **+ Create** to create a new dashboard named *Fraudulent Calls*.

5. At the top of the window, select **Edit** and **Add tile**. 
1. In the **Add tile** window, select **Custom Streaming Data** and **Next**. 
1. Choose the **ASAdataset** under **Your Datasets**, and select **Next**. 
1. Select **Card** from the **Visualization type** dropdown, add **fraudulent calls** to **Fields**, and then select **Next**.

1. Enter a name for the tile (for example, **Fraudulent calls**), and then select **Apply** to create the tile.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/stream-analytics-real-time-fraud-detection/tile-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Tile details page." lightbox="./media/stream-analytics-real-time-fraud-detection/tile-details.png":::    
1. Follow the step 5 again with the following options:
   * When you get to Visualization Type, select Line chart.
   * Add an axis and select **windowend**.
   * Add a value and select **fraudulent calls**.
   * For **Time window to display**, select the last 10 minutes.

## Embedding your Power BI Dashboard in a web application

For this part of the tutorial, you use a sample [ASP.NET](https://asp.net/) web application created by the Power BI team to embed your dashboard. For more information about embedding dashboards, see [embedding with Power BI](/power-bi/developer/embedding) article.

To set up the application, go to the [Power BI-Developer-Samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-Developer-Samples) GitHub repository and follow the instructions under the **User Owns Data** section (use the redirect and homepage URLs under the **integrate-web-app** subsection). Since we're using the Dashboard example, use the **integrate-web-app** sample code located in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerBI-Developer-Samples/tree/master/.NET%20Framework/Embed%20for%20your%20organization/).
Once you have the application running in your browser, follow these steps to embed the dashboard you created earlier into the web page:

1. Select **Sign in to Power BI**, which grants the application access to the dashboards in your Power BI account.

2. Select the **Get Dashboards** button, which displays your account's Dashboards in a table. Find the name of the dashboard you created earlier, **powerbi-embedded-dashboard**, and copy the corresponding **EmbedUrl**.

3. Finally, paste the **EmbedUrl** into the corresponding text field and select **Embed Dashboard**. You can now view the same dashboard embedded within a web application.
