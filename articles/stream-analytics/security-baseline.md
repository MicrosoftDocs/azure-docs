### 9.1: Ensure regular automated back-ups

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/2973).

**Guidance**: Based on the type of output service selected. you can perform automated backups of the output data as per recommended guidelines for your output service.  The internal data including User-defined functions, queries, data snapshots is stored in the configured storage account which you can backup on a regular basis.

The data in your Microsoft Azure storage account is always automatically replicated to ensure durability and high availability. Azure Storage copies your data so that it is protected from planned and unplanned events, including transient hardware failures, network or power outages, and massive natural disasters. You can choose to replicate your data within the same data center, across zonal data centers within the same region, or across geographically separated regions. 

You can also use lifecycle management feature to backup data to the Archive tier.  Additionally, enable soft delete for your backups stored in Storage account.

**Guidance**: The internal data including User-defined functions, queries, data snapshots is stored in the configured storage account which you can backup on a regular basis.

In order to backup data from Storage account supported services, there are multiple methods available including using azcopy or third-party tools. Immutable storage for Azure Blob storage enables users to store business-critical data objects in a WORM (Write Once, Read Many) state. This state makes the data non-erasable and non-modifiable for a user-specified interval.
