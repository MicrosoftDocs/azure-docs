# Quickstart: Create an Azure Stream Analytics job by using Visual Studio

This quickstart shows you how to create and run a Stream Analytics job using Azure Stream Analytics tools for Visual Studio. The example job reads streaming data from an IoT Hub device. You define a job that calculates the average temperature when over 27° and writes the resulting output events to a new file in blob storage.

> [!NOTE] 
> - We strongly recommend using [**Stream Analytics tools for Visual Studio Code**](./quick-create-visual-studio-code.md) for best local development experience. There are known feature gaps in Stream Analytics tools for Visual Studio 2019 (version 2.6.3000.0) and it won't be improved going forward.
> - Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code tools don't support jobs in the China East, China North, Germany Central, and Germany NorthEast regions.

## Before you begin

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

* Install Visual Studio 2019, Visual Studio 2015, or Visual Studio 2013 Update 4. Enterprise (Ultimate/Premium), Professional, and Community editions are supported. Express edition isn't supported.

* Follow the  [installation instructions](./stream-analytics-tools-for-visual-studio-install.md) to install Stream Analytics tools for Visual Studio.

## Prepare the input data

Before defining the Stream Analytics job, you should prepare the data, which is later configured as the job input. To prepare the input data required by the job, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Select **Create a resource** > **Internet of Things** > **IoT Hub**.

3. In the **IoT Hub** pane, enter the following information:
   
    |**Setting**  |**Suggested value**  |**Description**  |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    |Subscription  | \<Your subscription\> |  Select the Azure subscription that you want to use. |
    |Resource group   |   asaquickstart-resourcegroup  |   Select **Create New** and enter a new resource-group name for your account. |
    |IoT Hub Name  | MyASAIoTHub  |   Select a name for your IoT Hub.   |
    |Region  |  \<Select the region that is closest to your users\> | Select a geographic location where you can host your IoT Hub. Use the location that's closest to your users. |
    | Tier | Free | For this quickstart, select **Free** if it's still available on your subscription. If the free tier is unavailable, choose the lowest tier available. For more information, see [IoT Hub pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-hub/). |

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resource group, the streaming job, and all related resources. Deleting the job avoids billing the streaming units consumed by the job. If you're planning to use the job in future, you can stop it and restart it later when you need. If you aren't going to continue to use this job, delete all resources created by this quickstart by using the following steps:

1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** and then select the name of the resource you created.  
2. On your resource group page, select **Delete**, type the name of the resource to delete in the text box, and then select **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed a simple Stream Analytics job using Visual Studio. You can also deploy Stream Analytics jobs using the [Azure portal](stream-analytics-quick-create-portal.md) and [PowerShell](stream-analytics-quick-create-powershell.md).
