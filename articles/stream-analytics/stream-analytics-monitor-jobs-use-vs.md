# Monitor and manage Stream Analytics jobs with Visual Studio

This article demonstrates how to monitor your Stream Analytics job in Visual Studio. Azure Stream Analytics tools for Visual Studio provides a monitoring experience similar to Azure portal without having to leave the IDE. You can begin to monitor a job as soon as you **Submit to Azure** from your **Script.asaql**, or you can monitor existing jobs regardless of how they were created. 

## Job summary

The **Job Summary** and **Job Metrics** give a quick snapshot of your job. At a glance, you can determine a job's status and event information.]

## Job metrics

You can collapse the **Job Summary** and click the **Job Metrics** tab to view a graph with important metrics. Check and un-check metrics types to add and remove them from the graph.
