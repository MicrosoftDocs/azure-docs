This topic shows you how to use Azure Mobile Services to send push notifications to a Windows Store app. 
In this tutorial you enable push notifications using Azure Notification Hubs to the quickstart project. When complete, your mobile service will send a push notification using Notification Hubs each time a record is inserted. The notification hub that you create is free with your mobile service, can be managed independent of the mobile service, and can be used by other applications and services.

>[WACOM.NOTE]This tutorial demonstrates Mobile Services integration with Notification Hubs, which is currently how you send push notifications from a newly created mobile service. If you are using an older mobile service that has not yet been upgraded to use Notification Hubs, we recommend that you do so as part of this tutorial. If you choose not to upgrade now, you should follow [this version](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-windows-store-javascript-get-started-push/) of the tutorial. 

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable push notifications:

1. [Register your app with WNS and configure Mobile Services](#register)
2. [Update the app to register for notifications](#update-app)
3. [Update server scripts to send push notifications](#update-scripts)
3. [Insert data to receive push notifications](#test)

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Get started with data] to connect your project to the mobile service. When a mobile service has not been connected, the Add Push Notification wizard creates this connection for you. 

##<a id="register"></a> Register your app with WNS and configure Mobile Services

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-notification-hubs-register-windows-store-app](../includes/mobile-services-notification-hubs-register-windows-store-app.md)]

Both your mobile service and your app are now configured to work with WNS and Notification Hubs. Next, you will update your Windows Store app to register for notifications.

##<a id="update-app"></a> Update the app to register for notifications

Before your app can receive push notifications, you must register a notification channel.

1. Open the file default.js and insert the following code after the code that creates the **MobileServiceClient** instance:

        // Request a push notification channel.
        Windows.Networking.PushNotifications
            .PushNotificationChannelManager
            .createPushNotificationChannelForApplicationAsync()
            .then(function (channel) {
                // Register for notifications using the new channel
                client.push.registerNative(channel.uri);                    
            });      

	This code retrieves the ChannelURI for the app from WNS, and then registers that ChannelURI for push notifications.

2. Press the **F5** key to run the app. A popup dialog with the registration key is displayed.

6. Open the Package.appxmanifest file and make sure that in the **Application UI** tab, **Toast capable** is set to **Yes**.

   	![][2]

   	This makes sure that your app can raise toast notifications.
