## <a name="copy-paste"></a>Copy and paste

You can copy and paste text between your local device and the remote session. Only text copy/paste is supported. By default, this feature is enabled. If you want to disable this feature for web-based clients, you can change the setting on the configuration page for your bastion host. To disable, your bastion host must be configured with the Standard SKU tier.
