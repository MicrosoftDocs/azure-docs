# Create an SSH connection to a Linux VM using Azure Bastion

This article shows you how to securely and seamlessly create an SSH connection to your Linux VMs located in an Azure virtual network directly through the Azure portal. When you use Azure Bastion, your VMs don't require a client, agent, or additional software.

Azure Bastion provides secure connectivity to all of the VMs in the virtual network in which it's provisioned. Using Azure Bastion protects your virtual machines from exposing RDP/SSH ports to the outside world, while still providing secure access using RDP/SSH. For more information, see the [What is Azure Bastion?](bastion-overview.md) article.

When connecting to a Linux virtual machine using SSH, you can use both username/password and SSH keys for authentication.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have set up an Azure Bastion host for the virtual network in which the VM resides. For more information, see [Create an Azure Bastion host](./tutorial-create-host-portal.md). Once the Bastion service is provisioned and deployed in your virtual network, you can use it to connect to any VM in this virtual network.

The connection settings and features that are available depend on the Bastion SKU you're using. Make sure your Bastion deployment is using the required SKU.

* To see the available features and settings per SKU tier, see the [SKUs and features](bastion-overview.md#sku) section of the Bastion overview article.  
* To check the SKU tier of your Bastion deployment and upgrade if necessary, see [Upgrade a Bastion SKU](upgrade-sku.md).

### Required roles

In order to make a connection, the following roles are required:

* Reader role on the virtual machine.
* Reader role on the NIC with private IP of the virtual machine.
* Reader role on the Azure Bastion resource.
* Reader role on the virtual network of the target virtual machine (if the Bastion deployment is in a peered virtual network).

### Ports

In order to connect to the Linux VM via SSH, you must have the following ports open on your VM:

* Inbound port: SSH (22) ***or***
* Inbound port: Custom value (you'll then need to specify this custom port when you connect to the VM via Azure Bastion). This setting isn't available for the Basic or Developer SKU.

## Bastion connection page

1. In the Azure portal, go to the virtual machine to which you want to connect. At the top of the virtual machine **Overview** page, select **Connect**, then select **Connect via Bastion** from the dropdown. This opens the **Bastion** page. You can go to the Bastion page directly in the left pane.

1. On the **Bastion** page, the settings that you can configure depend on the Bastion [SKU](bastion-overview.md#sku) tier that your bastion host has been configured to use.

   * If you're using a SKU higher than the Basic SKU, **Connection Settings** values (ports and protocols) are visible and can be configured.

   * If you're using the Basic SKU or Developer SKU, you can't configure **Connection Settings** values. Instead, your connection uses the following default settings: SSH and port 22.

   * To view and select an available **Authentication Type**, use the dropdown.

1. Use the following sections in this article to configure authentication settings and connect to your VM.

   * [Microsoft Entra ID Authentication](#microsoft-entra-id-authentication)
   * [Username and password](#password-authentication)
   * [Password - Azure Key Vault](#password-authentication---azure-key-vault)
   * [SSH private key from local file](#ssh-private-key-authentication---local-file)
   * [SSH private key - Azure Key Vault](#ssh-private-key-authentication---azure-key-vault)

## Microsoft Entra ID authentication
> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Entra ID Authentication support for SSH connections within the portal is only supported for Linux VMs.

If  the following prerequisites are met, Microsoft Entra ID becomes the default option to connect to your VM. If not, Microsoft Entra ID won't appear as an option.

Prerequisites:

* Microsoft Entra ID Login should be enabled on the VM. Microsoft Entra ID Login can be enabled during VM creation or by adding the **Microsoft Entra ID Login** extension to a pre-existing VM.

* One of the following required roles should be configured on the VM for the user:

  * **Virtual Machine Administrator Login**: This role is necessary if you want to sign in with administrator privileges.
  * **Virtual Machine User Login**: This role is necessary if you want to sign in with regular user privileges.

Use the following steps to authenticate using Microsoft Entra ID.

    * If you didnâ€™t set up an Azure Key Vault resource, see [Create a key vault](/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-powershell) and store your SSH private key as the value of a new Key Vault secret.

    * Make sure you have **List** and **Get** access to the secrets stored in the Key Vault resource. To assign and modify access policies for your Key Vault resource, see [Assign a Key Vault access policy](/azure/key-vault/general/assign-access-policy-portal).

    * Store your SSH private key as a secret in Azure Key Vault using the **PowerShell** or **Azure CLI** experience. Storing your private key via the Azure Key Vault portal experience interferes with the formatting and result in unsuccessful login. If you did store your private key as a secret using the portal experience and no longer have access to the original private key file, see [Update SSH key](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/vmaccess-linux#update-ssh-key) to update access to your target VM with a new SSH key pair.
