# Authorize requests to Azure SignalR resources with Managed identities for Azure resources

Azure SignalR Service supports Microsoft Entra ID for authorizing requests from [Managed identities for Azure resources](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

This article explains how to set up your resource and code to authorize requests to the resource using a managed identity.

## Configure managed identities

The first step is to configure managed identities on your app or virtual machine.

- [Configure managed identities for App Service and Azure Functions](/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity)
- [Configure managed identities on Azure virtual machines (VMs)](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-configure-managed-identities)
- [Configure managed identities for Azure resources on a virtual machine scale set](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-configure-managed-identities-scale-sets)

## Add role assignments in the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [add role assignments](includes/signalr-add-role-assignments.md)]

## Configure Microsoft.Azure.SignalR app server SDK for C#

[Azure SignalR server SDK for C#](https://github.com/Azure/azure-signalr)

The Azure SignalR server SDK leverages the [Azure.Identity library](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme) to generate tokens for connecting to resources.
Click to explore detailed usages.

### Use system-assigned identity

```C#
services.AddSignalR().AddAzureSignalR(option =>
{
    option.Endpoints = new ServiceEndpoint[]
    {
        new ServiceEndpoint(new Uri("https://<resource-name>.service.signalr.net"), new ManagedIdentityCredential()),
    };
});
```

### Use user-assigned identity

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the client ID, not the object (principal) ID

```C#
services.AddSignalR().AddAzureSignalR(option =>
{
    option.Endpoints = new ServiceEndpoint[]
    {
        var clientId = "<your-user-assigned-identity-client-id>";
        new ServiceEndpoint(new Uri("https://<resource-name>.service.signalr.net"), new ManagedIdentityCredential(clientId)),
    };
});
```

More sample can be found in this [Sample link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-signalr/blob/dev/samples/ChatSample/ChatSample/Startup.cs)

### Use multiple endpoints

Credentials can be different for different endpoints.

In this sample, the Azure SignalR SDK will connect to `resource1` with system-assigned managed identity and connect to `resource2` with user-assigned managed identity.

```csharp
services.AddSignalR().AddAzureSignalR(option =>
{
    option.Endpoints = new ServiceEndpoint[]
    {
        var clientId = "<your-user-assigned-identity-client-id>";
        new ServiceEndpoint(new Uri("https://<resource1>.service.signalr.net"), new ManagedIdentityCredential()),
        new ServiceEndpoint(new Uri("https://<resource2>.service.signalr.net"), new ManagedIdentityCredential(clientId)),
    };
});
```


### Azure SignalR Service bindings in Azure Functions

Azure SignalR Service bindings in Azure Functions use [application settings](../azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md) in the portal or [local.settings.json](../azure-functions/functions-develop-local.md#local-settings-file) locally to configure a managed identity to access your Azure SignalR Service resources.

You might need a group of key/value pairs to configure an identity. The keys of all the key/value pairs must start with a *connection name prefix* (which defaults to `AzureSignalRConnectionString`) and a separator. The separator is an underscore (`__`) in the portal and a colon (`:`) locally. You can customize the prefix by using the binding property [`ConnectionStringSetting`](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-signalr-service.md).

#### Use a system-assigned identity

If you configure only the service URI, you use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class. This class is useful when you want to share the same configuration on Azure and local development environments. To learn how it works, see [DefaultAzureCredential](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme#defaultazurecredential).

In the Azure portal, use the following example to configure `DefaultAzureCredential`. If you don't configure any of [these environment variables](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme#environment-variables), the system-assigned identity is used for authentication.

```bash
<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__serviceUri=https://<SIGNALR_RESOURCE_NAME>.service.signalr.net
```

Here's a configuration sample of `DefaultAzureCredential` in the *local.settings.json* file. At the local scope, there's no managed identity. Authentication via Visual Studio, the Azure CLI, and Azure PowerShell accounts is attempted in order.

```json
{
  "Values": {
    "<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>:serviceUri": "https://<SIGNALR_RESOURCE_NAME>.service.signalr.net"
  }
}
```

If you want to use a system-assigned identity independently and without the influence of [other environment variables](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme#environment-variables), set the `credential` key with the connection name prefix to `managedidentity`. Here's a sample for application settings:

```bash
<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__serviceUri = https://<SIGNALR_RESOURCE_NAME>.service.signalr.net
<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__credential = managedidentity
```

#### Use a user-assigned identity

If you want to use a user-assigned identity, you need to assign `clientId` in addition to `serviceUri` and `credential` keys with the connection name prefix. Here's a sample for application settings:

```bash
<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__serviceUri = https://<SIGNALR_RESOURCE_NAME>.service.signalr.net
<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__credential = managedidentity
<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientId = <CLIENT_ID>
```
