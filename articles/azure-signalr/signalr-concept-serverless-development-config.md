# Azure Functions development and configuration with Azure SignalR Service

Azure Functions applications can use the [Azure SignalR Service bindings](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-signalr-service.md) to add real-time capabilities. Client applications use client SDKs available in several languages to connect to Azure SignalR Service and receive real-time messages.

This article describes the concepts for developing and configuring an Azure Function app that is integrated with SignalR Service.

[!INCLUDE [Connection string security](includes/signalr-connection-string-security.md)]

## SignalR Service configuration

Azure SignalR Service can be configured in [different modes](concept-service-mode.md). When used with Azure Functions, the service must be configured in **Serverless** mode.

In the Azure portal, locate the **Settings** page of your SignalR Service resource. Set the **Service mode** to **Serverless**.

![SignalR Service Mode](media/signalr-concept-azure-functions/signalr-service-mode.png)

## Azure Functions development

A serverless real-time application built with Azure Functions and Azure SignalR Service requires at least two Azure Functions:

- A `negotiate` function that the client calls to obtain a valid SignalR Service access token and endpoint URL.
- One or more functions that handle messages sent from SignalR Service to clients.

### Negotiation function

A client application requires a valid access token to connect to Azure SignalR Service. An access token can be anonymous or authenticated to a user ID. Serverless SignalR Service applications require an HTTP endpoint named `negotiate` to obtain a token and other connection information, such as the SignalR Service endpoint URL.

Use an HTTP-triggered Azure Function and the `SignalRConnectionInfo` input binding to generate the connection information object. The function must have an HTTP route that ends in `/negotiate`.

With [class-based model](#class-based-model) in C#, you don't need the `SignalRConnectionInfo` input binding and can add custom claims much more easily. For more information, see [Negotiation experience in class-based model](#negotiation-experience-in-class-based-model-1).

For more information about the `negotiate` function, see [Azure Functions development](#negotiation-function).

To learn how to create an authenticated token, refer to [Using App Service Authentication](#using-app-service-authentication).

### Handle messages sent from SignalR Service

Use the `SignalRTrigger` binding to handle messages sent from SignalR Service. You can get notified when clients send messages or clients get connected or disconnected.

For more information, see the [SignalR Service trigger binding reference](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-signalr-service-trigger.md).

You also need to configure your function endpoint as an upstream endpoint so that service triggers the function when there's message from a client. For more information about how to configure upstream endpoints, see [Upstream endpoints](concept-upstream.md).

> [!NOTE]
> SignalR Service doesn't support the `StreamInvocation` message from a client in Serverless Mode.

### Sending messages and managing group membership

Use the `SignalR` output binding to send messages to clients connected to Azure SignalR Service. You can broadcast messages to all clients, or you can send them to a subset of clients. For example, only send messages to clients authenticated with a specific user ID, or only to a specific group.

Users can be added to one or more groups. You can also use the `SignalR` output binding to add or remove users to/from groups.

For more information, see the [`SignalR` output binding reference](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-signalr-service-output.md).

### SignalR Hubs

SignalR has a concept of _hubs_. Each client connection and each message sent from Azure Functions is scoped to a specific hub. You can use hubs as a way to separate your connections and messages into logical namespaces.

## Class-based model

The class-based model is dedicated for C#.

# [Isolated worker model](#tab/isolated-process)

The class-based model provides better programming experience, which can replace SignalR input and output bindings, with the following features:
- More flexible negotiation, sending messages and managing groups experience.
- More managing functionalities are supported, including closing connections, checking whether a connection, user, or group exists.
- Strongly typed hub
- Unified hub name and connection string setting in one place.

The following code demonstrates how to write SignalR bindings in class-based model:

Firstly, define your hub derived from a class `ServerlessHub`:
```cs
[SignalRConnection("AzureSignalRConnectionString")]
public class Functions : ServerlessHub
{
    private const string HubName = nameof(Functions); // Used by SignalR trigger only

    public Functions(IServiceProvider serviceProvider) : base(serviceProvider)
    {
    }

    [Function("negotiate")]
    public async Task<HttpResponseData> Negotiate([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post")] HttpRequestData req)
    {
        var negotiateResponse = await NegotiateAsync(new() { UserId = req.Headers.GetValues("userId").FirstOrDefault() });
        var response = req.CreateResponse();
        response.WriteBytes(negotiateResponse.ToArray());
        return response;
    }

    [Function("Broadcast")]
    public Task Broadcast(
    [SignalRTrigger(HubName, "messages", "broadcast", "message")] SignalRInvocationContext invocationContext, string message)
    {
        return Clients.All.SendAsync("newMessage", new NewMessage(invocationContext, message));
    }

    [Function("JoinGroup")]
    public Task JoinGroup([SignalRTrigger(HubName, "messages", "JoinGroup", "connectionId", "groupName")] SignalRInvocationContext invocationContext, string connectionId, string groupName)
    {
        return Groups.AddToGroupAsync(connectionId, groupName);
    }
}
```

In the *Program.cs* file, register your serverless hub:
```cs
var host = new HostBuilder()
    .ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults(b => b.Services
        .AddServerlessHub<Functions>())
    .Build();
```

### Negotiation experience in class-based model

Instead of using SignalR input binding `[SignalRConnectionInfoInput]`, negotiation in class-based model can be more flexible. Base class `ServerlessHub` has a method `NegotiateAsync`, which allows users to customize negotiation options such as `userId`, `claims`, etc.

```cs
Task<BinaryData> NegotiateAsync(NegotiationOptions? options = null)
```


### Sending messages and managing experience in class-based model

You could send messages, manage groups, or manage clients by accessing the members provided by base class `ServerlessHub`.
- `ServerlessHub.Clients` for sending messages to clients.
- `ServerlessHub.Groups` for managing connections with groups, such as adding connections to groups, removing connections from groups.
- `ServerlessHub.UserGroups` for managing users with groups, such as adding users to groups, removing users from groups.
- `ServerlessHub.ClientManager` for checking connections existence, closing connections, etc.

### Strongly typed Hub

[Strongly typed hub](/aspnet/core/signalr/hubs?#strongly-typed-hubs) allows you to use strongly typed methods when you send messages to clients. To use strongly typed hub in class based model, extract client methods into an interface `T`, and make your hub class derived from `ServerlessHub<T>`.

The following code is an interface sample for client methods.
```cs
public interface IChatClient
{
    Task newMessage(NewMessage message);
}
```

Then you can use the strongly typed methods as follows.

[!INCLUDE [Connection string security comment](includes/signalr-connection-string-security-comment.md)]

```cs
[SignalRConnection("AzureSignalRConnectionString")]
public class Functions : ServerlessHub<IChatClient>
{
    private const string HubName = nameof(Functions);  // Used by SignalR trigger only

    public Functions(IServiceProvider serviceProvider) : base(serviceProvider)
    {
    }

    [Function("Broadcast")]
    public Task Broadcast(
    [SignalRTrigger(HubName, "messages", "broadcast", "message")] SignalRInvocationContext invocationContext, string message)
    {
        return Clients.All.newMessage(new NewMessage(invocationContext, message));
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can get a complete project sample from [GitHub](https://github.com/aspnet/AzureSignalR-samples/tree/main/samples/DotnetIsolated-ClassBased/).

### Unified hub name and connection string setting in one place

* The class name of the serverless hub is automatically used as `HubName`.
* You might have noticed the `SignalRConnection` attribute used on serverless hub classes as follows:
    ```cs
    [SignalRConnection("AzureSignalRConnectionString")]
    public class Functions : ServerlessHub<IChatClient>
    ```
    It allows you to customize where the connection string for serverless hub is. If it's absent, the default value `AzureSignalRConnectionString` is used.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SignalR triggers and serverless hubs are independent. Therefore, the class name of serverless hub and `SignalRConnection` attribute doesn't change the settings of SignalR triggers, even though you use SignalR triggers inside the serverless hub.

# [In-process model](#tab/in-process)

The class-based model provides a consistent SignalR server-side programming experience, with the following features:

- Less configuration work: The class name is used as `HubName`, the method name is used as `Event`, and the `Category` is decided automatically according to method name.
- Auto parameter binding: `ParameterNames` and attribute `[SignalRParameter]` aren't needed. Parameters are automatically bound to arguments of Azure Function methods in order.
- Convenient output and negotiation experience.

The following code demonstrates these features:

```cs
public class HubName1 : ServerlessHub
{
    [FunctionName("negotiate")]
    public SignalRConnectionInfo Negotiate([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous)]HttpRequest req)
    {
        return Negotiate(req.Headers["x-ms-signalr-user-id"], GetClaims(req.Headers["Authorization"]));
    }

    [FunctionName(nameof(OnConnected))]
    public async Task OnConnected([SignalRTrigger]InvocationContext invocationContext, ILogger logger)
    {
        await Clients.All.SendAsync(NewConnectionTarget, new NewConnection(invocationContext.ConnectionId));
        logger.LogInformation($"{invocationContext.ConnectionId} has connected");
    }

    [FunctionName(nameof(Broadcast))]
    public async Task Broadcast([SignalRTrigger]InvocationContext invocationContext, string message, ILogger logger)
    {
        await Clients.All.SendAsync(NewMessageTarget, new NewMessage(invocationContext, message));
        logger.LogInformation($"{invocationContext.ConnectionId} broadcast {message}");
    }

    [FunctionName(nameof(OnDisconnected))]
    public void OnDisconnected([SignalRTrigger]InvocationContext invocationContext)
    {
    }
}
```

All functions that want to use the class-based model need to be a method of the class that inherits from **ServerlessHub**. The class name `HubName1` in the sample is the hub name.

### Define hub method

All the hub methods **must** have an argument of `InvocationContext` decorated by `[SignalRTrigger]` attribute and use a parameterless constructor. Then the **method name** is treated as a parameter **event**.

By default, `category=messages` except the method name is one of the following names:

- `OnConnected`: Treated as `category=connections, event=connected`
- `OnDisconnected`: Treated as `category=connections, event=disconnected`

### Parameter binding experience

In class based model, `[SignalRParameter]` is unnecessary because all the arguments are marked as `[SignalRParameter]` by default except in one of the following situations:

- The argument is decorated by a binding attribute
- The argument's type is `ILogger` or `CancellationToken`
- The argument is decorated by attribute `[SignalRIgnore]`

### Negotiation experience in class-based model

Instead of using SignalR input binding `[SignalR]`, negotiation in class-based model can be more flexible. Base class `ServerlessHub` has a method:

```cs
SignalRConnectionInfo Negotiate(string userId = null, IList<Claim> claims = null, TimeSpan? lifeTime = null)
```

This feature allows user to customize `userId` or `claims` during the function execution.

## Use `SignalRFilterAttribute`

User can inherit and implement the abstract class `SignalRFilterAttribute`. If exceptions are thrown in `FilterAsync`, `403 Forbidden` will be sent back to clients.

The following sample demonstrates how to implement a customer filter that only allows the `admin` to invoke `broadcast`.

```cs
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method, AllowMultiple = true, Inherited = true)]
internal class FunctionAuthorizeAttribute: SignalRFilterAttribute
{
    private const string AdminKey = "admin";

    public override Task FilterAsync(InvocationContext invocationContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        if (invocationContext.Claims.TryGetValue(AdminKey, out var value) &&
            bool.TryParse(value, out var isAdmin) &&
            isAdmin)
        {
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        throw new Exception($"{invocationContext.ConnectionId} doesn't have admin role");
    }
}
```

Use the attribute to authorize the function.

```cs
[FunctionAuthorize]
[FunctionName(nameof(Broadcast))]
public async Task Broadcast([SignalRTrigger]InvocationContext invocationContext, string message, ILogger logger)
{
}
```

## Client development

SignalR client applications can use the SignalR client SDK in one of several languages to easily connect to and receive messages from Azure SignalR Service.

### Configuring a client connection

To connect to SignalR Service, a client must complete a successful connection negotiation that consists of these steps:

1. Make a request to the `negotiate` HTTP endpoint discussed above to obtain valid connection information
1. Connect to SignalR Service using the service endpoint URL and access token obtained from the `negotiate` endpoint

SignalR client SDKs already contain the logic required to perform the negotiation handshake. Pass the negotiation endpoint's URL, minus the `negotiate` segment, to the SDK's `HubConnectionBuilder`. Here's an example in JavaScript:

```javascript
const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
  .withUrl("https://my-signalr-function-app.azurewebsites.net/api")
  .build();
```

By convention, the SDK automatically appends `/negotiate` to the URL and uses it to begin the negotiation.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK in a browser, you need to [enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](#enabling-cors) on your Function App.

For more information on how to use the SignalR client SDK, see the documentation for your language:

- [.NET Standard](/aspnet/core/signalr/dotnet-client)
- [JavaScript](/aspnet/core/signalr/javascript-client)
- [Java](/aspnet/core/signalr/java-client)

### Sending messages from a client to the service

If you've [upstream](concept-upstream.md) configured for your SignalR resource, you can send messages from a client to your Azure Functions using any SignalR client. Here's an example in JavaScript:

```javascript
connection.send("method1", "arg1", "arg2");
```

## Azure Functions configuration

Azure Function apps that integrate with Azure SignalR Service can be deployed like any typical Azure Function app, using techniques such as [continuously deployment](../azure-functions/functions-continuous-deployment.md), [zip deployment](../azure-functions/deployment-zip-push.md), and [run from package](../azure-functions/run-functions-from-deployment-package.md).

However, there are a couple of special considerations for apps that use the SignalR Service bindings. If the client runs in a browser, CORS must be enabled. And if the app requires authentication, you can integrate the negotiation endpoint with App Service Authentication.

### Enabling CORS

The JavaScript/TypeScript client makes HTTP request to the negotiation function to initiate the connection negotiation. When the client application is hosted on a different domain than the Azure Function app, cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) must be enabled on the function app, or the browser will block the requests.

#### Localhost

When running the Function app on your local computer, you can add a `Host` section to _local.settings.json_ to enable CORS. In the `Host` section, add two properties:

- `CORS` - enter the base URL that is the origin the client application
- `CORSCredentials` - set it to `true` to allow "withCredentials" requests

Example:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    // values
  },
  "Host": {
    "CORS": "http://localhost:8080",
    "CORSCredentials": true
  }
}
```

#### Cloud - Azure Functions CORS

To enable CORS on an Azure Function app, go to the CORS configuration screen under the **Platform features** tab of your Function app in the Azure portal.

> [!NOTE]
> CORS configuration is not yet available in Azure Functions Linux Consumption plan. Use [Azure API Management](#cloud---azure-api-management) to enable CORS.

CORS with Access-Control-Allow-Credentials must be enabled for the SignalR client to call the negotiation function. To enable it, select the checkbox.

In the **Allowed origins** section, add an entry with the origin base URL of your web application.

![Configuring CORS](media/signalr-concept-serverless-development-config/cors-settings.png)

#### Cloud - Azure API Management

Azure API Management provides an API gateway that adds capabilities to existing back-end services. You can use it to add CORS to your function app. It offers a consumption tier with pay-per-action pricing and a monthly free grant.

Refer to the API Management documentation for information on how to [import an Azure Function app](../api-management/import-function-app-as-api.md). Once imported, you can add an inbound policy to enable CORS with Access-Control-Allow-Credentials support.

```xml
<cors allow-credentials="true">
  <allowed-origins>
    <origin>https://azure-samples.github.io</origin>
  </allowed-origins>
  <allowed-methods>
    <method>GET</method>
    <method>POST</method>
  </allowed-methods>
  <allowed-headers>
    <header>*</header>
  </allowed-headers>
  <expose-headers>
    <header>*</header>
  </expose-headers>
</cors>
```

Configure your SignalR clients to use the API Management URL.

### Using App Service Authentication

Azure Functions has built-in authentication, supporting popular providers such as Facebook, X, Microsoft Account, Google, and Microsoft Entra ID. This feature can be integrated with the `SignalRConnectionInfo` binding to create connections to Azure SignalR Service that is authenticated to a user ID. Your application can send messages using the `SignalR` output binding that are targeted to that user ID.

In the Azure portal, in your Function app's _Platform features_ tab, open the _Authentication/authorization_ settings window. Follow the documentation for [App Service Authentication](../app-service/overview-authentication-authorization.md) to configure authentication using an identity provider of your choice.

Once configured, authenticated HTTP requests include `x-ms-client-principal-name` and `x-ms-client-principal-id` headers containing the authenticated identity's username and user ID, respectively.

You can use these headers in your `SignalRConnectionInfo` binding configuration to create authenticated connections. Here's an example C# negotiation function that uses the `x-ms-client-principal-id` header.

```csharp
[FunctionName("negotiate")]
public static SignalRConnectionInfo Negotiate(
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous)]HttpRequest req,
    [SignalRConnectionInfo
        (HubName = "chat", UserId = "{headers.x-ms-client-principal-id}")]
        SignalRConnectionInfo connectionInfo)
{
    // connectionInfo contains an access key token with a name identifier claim set to the authenticated user
    return connectionInfo;
}
```

You can then send messages to that user by setting the `UserId` property of a SignalR message.

```csharp
[FunctionName("SendMessage")]
public static Task SendMessage(
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post")]object message,
    [SignalR(HubName = "chat")]IAsyncCollector<SignalRMessage> signalRMessages)
{
    return signalRMessages.AddAsync(
        new SignalRMessage
        {
            // the message will only be sent to these user IDs
            UserId = "userId1",
            Target = "newMessage",
            Arguments = new [] { message }
        });
}
```

For information on other languages, see the [Azure SignalR Service bindings](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-signalr-service.md) for Azure Functions reference.
