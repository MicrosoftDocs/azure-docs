# Create a SignalR Service with an App Service

This sample script creates a new Azure SignalR Service resource, which is used to push real-time content updates to clients. This script also adds a new Web App and App Service plan to host your ASP.NET Core Web App that uses the SignalR Service. The web app is configured with an App Setting named *AzureSignalRConnectionString* to connect to the new SignalR service resource.
