## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this app, delete all resources created by this quickstart with the following steps so you don't incur any charges:

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** on the far left, and then select the resource group you created. Alternatively, you may use the search box to find the resource group by its name.

1. In the window that opens, select the resource group, and then click **Delete resource group**.

1. In the new window, type the name of the resource group to delete, and then click **Delete**.
