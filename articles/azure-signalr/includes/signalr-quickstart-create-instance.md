 In this section, you'll create a basic Azure SignalR instance to use for your app. The following steps use the Azure portal to create a new instance, but you can also use the Azure CLI. For more information, see the [**az signalr create**](/cli/azure/signalr?view=azure-cli-latest#az-signalr-create&preserve-view=true) command in the [Azure SignalR Service CLI Reference](/cli/azure/service-page/azure%20signalr?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In the upper-left side of the page, select **+ Create a resource**.
1. On the **Create a resource** page, in the **Search services and marketplace** text box, enter **signalr** and then select **SignalR Service** from the list.
1. On the **SignalR Service** page, select **Create**.
1. On the **Basics** tab, you'll enter the essential information for your new SignalR Service instance. Enter the following values:

| Field | Suggested Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Subscription** | Choose your subscription | Select the subscription you want to use to create a new SignalR Service instance. |
| **Resource group**| Create a resource group named *SignalRTestResources*  |Select or create a resource group for your SignalR resource. It's useful to create a new resource group for this tutorial instead of using an existing resource group. To free resources after completing the tutorial, delete the resource group. <br /><br /> Deleting a resource group also deletes all of the resources that belong to the group. This action can't be undone. Before you delete a resource group, make certain that it doesn't contain resources you want to keep.<br /><br />For more information, see [Using resource groups to manage your Azure resources](../../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md).|
|**Resource name** | *testsignalr* | Enter a unique resource name to use for the SignalR resource. If *testsignalr* has already been used in your region, add a digit or character until the name is unique. <br /><br />The name must be a string of 1 to 63 characters and contain only numbers, letters, and the hyphen (`-`) character. The name can't start or end with the hyphen character, and consecutive hyphen characters aren't valid.|
| **Region** | Choose your region | Select the appropriate region for your new SignalR Service instance.<br /><br />Azure SignalR Service isn't currently available in all regions. For more information, see [Azure SignalR Service region availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=signalr-service) |
| **Pricing tier** | Select **Change** and then choose **Free (Dev/Test Only)**. Choose **Select**  to confirm your choice of pricing tier.| Azure SignalR Service has three pricing tiers: Free, Standard, and Premium. Tutorials use the **Free** tier, unless noted otherwise in the prerequisites.<br /><br />For more information about the functionality differences between tiers and pricing, see [Azure SignalR Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/signalr-service/) |
| **Service mode** | Choose the appropriate service mode for this tutorial | Use **Default** for ASP.NET. Use **Serverless** for Azure Functions or REST API.<br /><br /> **Classic** mode isn't used in the Azure SignalR tutorials.<br /><br />For more information, see [Service mode in Azure SignalR Service](../concept-service-mode.md).|

You don't need to change the settings on the **Networking** and **Tags** tabs for the SignalR tutorials.

6. Select the **Review + create** button at the bottom of the **Basics** tab.
1. On the **Review + create** tab, review the values and then select **Create**. It will take a few moments for deployment to complete.
1. When the deployment is complete, select the **Go to resource** button.
1. On the SignalR resource page, select **Keys** from the menu on the left, under **Settings**.
