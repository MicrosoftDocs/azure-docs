# Azure SignalR Service monitoring data reference

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-intro](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-intro.md)]

See [Monitor Azure SignalR Service](monitor-signalr.md) for details on the data you can collect for Azure SignalR Service and how to use it.

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro.md)]

Metrics for Azure SignalR Service are in the **Errors**, **Saturation**, or **Traffic** categories.

### Supported metrics for Microsoft.SignalRService/SignalR
The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.SignalRService/SignalR resource type.
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader.md)]
[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.SignalRService/SignalR](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/reference/metrics/microsoft-signalrservice-signalr-metrics-include.md)]

### Supported metrics for Microsoft.SignalRService/SignalR/replicas
The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.SignalRService/SignalR/replicas resource type.
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-tableheader.md)]
[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.SignalRService/SignalR/replicas](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/reference/metrics/microsoft-signalrservice-signalr-replicas-metrics-include.md)]

For more details about the metrics for Azure SignalR Service, see [Azure SignalR Service metrics](monitor-signalr.md#azure-signalr-service-metrics).

> [!NOTE]
> The metrics aggregation types appear in metrics explorer in the Azure portal as **Count**, **Avg**, **Min**, **Max**, and **Sum**.
> 
> **Count** is the count of sampling data received. Count is defined as a general metrics aggregation type and can't be excluded from the list of available aggregation types. It's not generally useful for SignalR Service but can sometimes be used to check if the sampling data has been sent to metrics.

### Endpoint

Describes the type of connection. Includes dimension values: **Client**, **Server**, and **LiveTrace**.

### ConnectionCloseCategory

Gives the reason for closing the connection. Includes the following dimension values.

|  Value | Description |
|---------|--------|
|**Normal** | Connection closed normally.|
|**Throttled**|With Message count/rate or connection throttling, check Connection Count and Message Count current usage and your resource limits.|
|**PingTimeout**|Connection ping timeout.|
|**NoAvailableServerConnection**|Client connection can't be established and doesn't pass handshake because there's no available server connection.|
|**InvokeUpstreamFailed**|Upstream invoke failed.|
|**SlowClient**|Too many unsent messages queued up at service side.|
|**HandshakeError**|Connection terminated in the handshake phase, which could be caused by the remote party closing the WebSocket connection without completing the close handshake. HandshakeError is caused by a network issue. Check browser settings to see if the client is able to create a websocket connection.|
|**ServerConnectionNotFound**|Target hub server not available. This value is by design and reconnection should be done after this drop.|
|**ServerConnectionClosed**|Client connection closed because the corresponding server connection was dropped. When app server uses Azure SignalR Service SDK, in the background, it initiates server connections to the remote Azure SignalR Service. Each client connection to the service is associated with one of the server connections to route traffic between the client and app server. Once a server connection is closed, all the client connections it serves are closed with the **ServerConnectionDropped** message.|
|**ServiceTransientError**|Internal server error.|
|**BadRequest**|A bad request is caused by an invalid hub name, wrong payload, or a malformed request.|
|**ClosedByAppServer**|App server asked the service to close the client.|
|**ServiceReload**|Service reload is triggered when a connection is dropped due to an internal service component reload. This event doesn't indicate a malfunction and is part of normal service operation.|
|**ServiceModeSwitched**|Connection closed after service mode switched, such as from Serverless mode to Default mode.|
|**Unauthorized**|The connection is unauthorized.|

## Resource Log table mapping

Field names for Log Analytics vary slightly from field names for Storage destinations.

### Archive log schema for a storage account

Archive log JSON strings include the following elements:

**Format**

Name | Description
