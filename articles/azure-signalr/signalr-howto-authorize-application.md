# Authorize requests to Azure SignalR Service resources with Microsoft Entra applications

Azure SignalR Service supports Microsoft Entra ID for authorizing requests with [Microsoft Entra applications](/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals).

This article explains how to set up your resource and code to authenticate requests to the resource using a Microsoft Entra application.

## Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID

The first step is to [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app):

After you register your application, you can find the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** values on the application's overview page. These GUIDs can be useful in the following steps.

## Add credentials

After registering an app, you can add **certificates, client secrets (a string), or federated identity credentials** as credentials to your confidential client app registration. Credentials allow your application to authenticate as itself, requiring no interaction from a user at runtime, and are used by confidential client applications that access a web API.

- [Add a certificate](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?tabs=certificate#add-credentials)
- [Add a client secret](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?tabs=client-secret#add-credentials)
- [Add a federated credential](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?tabs=federated-credential#add-credentials)

## Add role assignments in the Azure portal

## Configure Microsoft.Azure.SignalR app server SDK for C#

[Azure SignalR server SDK for C#](https://github.com/Azure/azure-signalr)

The Azure SignalR server SDK leverages the [Azure.Identity library](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme) to generate tokens for connecting to resources.
Click to explore detailed usages.

> [!NOTE]
> The tenantId must match the tenantId of the tenant where your SignalR resource is in.

### Use Microsoft Entra application with certificate
```csharp
services.AddSignalR().AddAzureSignalR(option =>
{
    var credential = new ClientCertificateCredential("tenantId", "clientId", "path-to-cert");

    option.Endpoints = [
      new ServiceEndpoint(new Uri(), "https://<resource>.service.signalr.net"), credential);
    ];
});
```

### Use Microsoft Entra application with client secret

```csharp
services.AddSignalR().AddAzureSignalR(option =>
{
    var credential = new ClientSecretCredential("tenantId", "clientId", "clientSecret");

    option.Endpoints = [
      new ServiceEndpoint(new Uri(), "https://<resource>.service.signalr.net"), credential);
    ];
});
```

### Use Microsoft Entra application with Federated identity

In the case of your organization disabled the usage of client secret/certificate, you can configure the application to trust a managed identity for authentication.

To learn more about it, see [Configure an application to trust a managed identity (preview)](/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-config-app-trust-managed-identity).

> [!NOTE]
> Configure an application to trust a managed identity is a preview feature. 

```csharp
services.AddSignalR().AddAzureSignalR(option =>
{
    var msiCredential = new ManagedIdentityCredential("msiClientId");

    var credential = new ClientAssertionCredential("tenantId", "appClientId", async (ctoken) =>
    {
        // Entra ID US Government: api://AzureADTokenExchangeUSGov
        // Entra ID China operated by 21Vianet: api://AzureADTokenExchangeChina
        var request = new TokenRequestContext([$"api://AzureADTokenExchange/.default"]);
        var response = await msiCredential.GetTokenAsync(request, ctoken).ConfigureAwait(false);
        return response.Token;
    });

    option.Endpoints = [
        new ServiceEndpoint(new Uri(), "https://<resource>.service.signalr.net"), credential);
    ];
});
```

This credential will use the user-assigned managed identity to generate a `clientAssertion` and use it to exchange for a `clientToken` for authentication.

The `appClientId` and `tenantId` should be the enterprise application that you provisioned in the tenant of SignalR resource.

### Use multiple endpoints

Credentials can be different for different endpoints.

In this sample, the Azure SignalR SDK will connect to `resource1` with client secret and connect to `resource2` with certificate.

```csharp
services.AddSignalR().AddAzureSignalR(option =>
{
    var credential1 = new ClientSecretCredential("tenantId", "clientId", "clientSecret");
    var credential2 = new ClientCertificateCredential("tenantId", "clientId", "path-to-cert");

    option.Endpoints = new ServiceEndpoint[]
    {
        new ServiceEndpoint(new Uri("https://<resource1>.service.signalr.net"), credential1),
        new ServiceEndpoint(new Uri("https://<resource2>.service.signalr.net"), credential2),
    };
});
```

## Azure SignalR Service bindings in Azure Functions

Azure SignalR Service bindings in Azure Functions use [application settings](../azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md) in the portal or [local.settings.json](../azure-functions/functions-develop-local.md#local-settings-file) locally to configure Microsoft Entra application identities to access your Azure SignalR Service resources.

First, you need to specify the service URI of Azure SignalR Service. The key of the service URI is `serviceUri`. It starts with a connection name prefix (which defaults to `AzureSignalRConnectionString`) and a separator. The separator is an underscore (`__`) in the Azure portal and a colon (`:`) in the *local.settings.json* file. You can customize the connection name by using the binding property [`ConnectionStringSetting`](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-signalr-service.md). Continue reading to find the sample.

Then, you choose whether to configure your Microsoft Entra application identity in [predefined environment variables](#configure-an-identity-in-predefined-environment-variables) or in [SignalR-specified variables](#configure-an-identity-in-signalr-specified-variables).

### Configure an identity in predefined environment variables

See [Environment variables](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme#environment-variables) for the list of predefined environment variables. When you have multiple services, we recommend that you use the same application identity, so that you don't need to configure the identity for each service. Other services might also use these environment variables, based on the settings of those services.

For example, to use client secret credentials, configure the identity as follows in the *local.settings.json* file:

```json
{
  "Values": {
    "<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>:serviceUri": "https://<SIGNALR_RESOURCE_NAME>.service.signalr.net",
    "AZURE_CLIENT_ID": "...",
    "AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET": "...",
    "AZURE_TENANT_ID": "..."
  }
}
```

In the Azure portal, add settings as follows:

```bash
 <CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__serviceUri=https://<SIGNALR_RESOURCE_NAME>.service.signalr.net
AZURE_CLIENT_ID = ...
AZURE_TENANT_ID = ...
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET = ...
```

### Configure an identity in SignalR-specified variables

SignalR-specified variables share the same key prefix with the `serviceUri` key. Here's the list of variables that you might use:

- `clientId`
- `clientSecret`
- `tenantId`

Here are the samples to use client secret credentials in the *local.settings.json* file:

```json
{
  "Values": {
    "<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>:serviceUri": "https://<SIGNALR_RESOURCE_NAME>.service.signalr.net",
    "<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>:clientId": "...",
    "<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>:clientSecret": "...",
    "<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>:tenantId": "..."
  }
}
```

In the Azure portal, add settings as follows:

```bash
<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__serviceUri = https://<SIGNALR_RESOURCE_NAME>.service.signalr.net
<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientId = ...
<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientSecret = ...
<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__tenantId = ...
```
