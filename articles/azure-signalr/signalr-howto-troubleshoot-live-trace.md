# Use the live trace tool for Azure SignalR Service

The live trace tool is a single web application for capturing and displaying live traces in Azure SignalR Service. The live traces can be collected in real time without any dependency on other services.

You can enable and disable the live trace feature with a single selection. You can also choose any log category that you're interested in.

> [!NOTE]
> Live traces are counted as outbound messages.
>
> Using Microsoft Entra ID to access the live trace tool is not supported.

## Open the live trace tool

When you enable an access key, you use an access token to authenticate the live trace tool. Otherwise, you use Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate the tool.

You can check whether you enabled an access key by going to the **Keys** page for Azure SignalR Service in the Azure portal.

### Steps if you enabled an access key

1. Go to the Azure portal and your Azure SignalR Service page.
1. On the left menu, under **Monitoring**, select **Live trace settings**.
1. Select **Enable Live Trace**.
1. Select the **Save** button, and then wait for the changes to take effect.
1. Select **Open Live Trace Tool**.

### Steps if you didn't enable an access key

#### Assign live trace tool API permission to yourself

1. Go to the Azure portal and your Azure SignalR Service page.
1. Select **Access control (IAM)**.
1. On the new page, select **+Add**, and then select **Role assignment**.
1. On the new page, select the **Job function roles** tab, select the **SignalR Service Owner** role, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Members** page, click **+Select members**.
1. On the new panel, search for and select members, and then click **Select**.
1. Select **Review + assign**, and wait for the completion notification.

#### Open the tool

1. Go to the Azure portal and your Azure SignalR Service page.

#### Sign in with your Microsoft account

1. When the Microsoft sign-in window opens in the live trace tool, enter your credentials. If no sign-in window appears, be sure to allow pop-up windows in your browser.
1. Wait for **Ready** to appear on the status bar.

## Capture live traces

In the live trace tool, you can:

* Begin to capture real-time live traces from the Azure SignalR Service instance.
* Clear the captured real-time live traces.
* Export live traces to a file. The currently supported file format is CSV.
* Filter the captured real-time live traces with one specific keyword. Separators (for example, space, comma, or semicolon), if present, are treated as part of the keyword.

The real-time live traces that the tool captures contain detailed information for troubleshooting.
