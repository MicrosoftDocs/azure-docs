# How to send events from Azure SignalR Service to Event Grid

Azure Event Grid is a fully managed event routing service that provides uniform event consumption using a pub-sub model. In this guide, you use the Azure CLI to create an Azure SignalR Service, subscribe to connection events, then deploy a sample web application to receive the events. Finally, you can connect and disconnect and see the event payload in the sample application.

 - The Azure CLI commands in this article are formatted for the **Bash** shell. If you're using a different shell like PowerShell or Command Prompt, you may need to adjust line continuation characters or variable assignment lines accordingly. This article uses variables to minimize the amount of command editing required.

## Create a resource group

An Azure resource group is a logical container in which you deploy and manage your Azure resources. The command [az group create][az-group-create] creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* region. If you want to use a different name for your resource group, set `RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` to a different value.

```azurecli-interactive
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=myResourceGroup

az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location eastus
```

## Create a SignalR Service

Next, deploy an Azure Signals Service into the resource group with the following commands.
```azurecli-interactive
SIGNALR_NAME=SignalRTestSvc

az signalr create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $SIGNALR_NAME --sku Free_F1
```

Once the SignalR Service has been created, the Azure CLI returns output similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "externalIp": "13.76.156.152",
  "hostName": "clitest.servicedev.signalr.net",
  "hostNamePrefix": "clitest",
  "id": "/subscriptions/28cf13e2-c598-4aa9-b8c8-098441f0827a/resourceGroups/clitest1/providers/Microsoft.SignalRService/SignalR/clitest",
  "location": "southeastasia",
  "name": "clitest",
  "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
  "publicPort": 443,
  "resourceGroup": "clitest1",
  "serverPort": 443,
  "sku": {
    "capacity": 1,
    "family": null,
    "name": "Free_F1",
    "size": "F1",
    "tier": "Free"
  },
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.SignalRService/SignalR",
  "version": "1.0"
}

```

## Create an event endpoint

In this section, you use a Resource Manager template located in a GitHub repository to deploy a prebuilt sample web application to Azure App Service. Later, you subscribe to your registry's Event Grid events and specify this app as the endpoint to which the events are sent.

To deploy the sample app, set `SITE_NAME` to a unique name for your web app, and execute the following commands. The site name must be unique within Azure because it forms part of the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the web app. In a later section, you navigate to the app's FQDN in a web browser to view your registry's events.

```azurecli-interactive
SITE_NAME=<your-site-name>

az deployment group create \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
    --template-uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/azure-event-grid-viewer/master/azuredeploy.json" \
    --parameters siteName=$SITE_NAME hostingPlanName=$SITE_NAME-plan
```

Once the deployment succeeds (it might take a few minutes), open your browser, and then go to your web app to make sure it's running:

`http://<your-site-name>.azurewebsites.net`

[!INCLUDE [register-provider-cli.md](../../articles/event-grid/includes/register-provider-cli.md)]

## Subscribe to registry events

In Event Grid, you subscribe to a *topic* to tell it which events you want to track, and where to send them. The command [`az eventgrid event-subscription create`][az-eventgrid-event-subscription-create] subscribes to the Azure SignalR Service you created and specifies your web app's URL as the endpoint to which it should send events. The environment variables you populated in earlier sections are reused here, so no edits are required.

```azurecli-interactive
SIGNALR_SERVICE_ID=$(az signalr show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $SIGNALR_NAME --query id --output tsv)
APP_ENDPOINT=https://$SITE_NAME.azurewebsites.net/api/updates

az eventgrid event-subscription create \
    --name event-sub-signalr \
    --source-resource-id $SIGNALR_SERVICE_ID \
    --endpoint $APP_ENDPOINT
```

When the subscription is completed, you should see output similar to the following example:

```JSON
{
  "deadLetterDestination": null,
  "destination": {
    "endpointBaseUrl": "https://$SITE_NAME.azurewebsites.net/api/updates",
    "endpointType": "WebHook",
    "endpointUrl": null
  },
  "filter": {
    "includedEventTypes": [
      "Microsoft.SignalRService.ClientConnectionConnected",
      "Microsoft.SignalRService.ClientConnectionDisconnected"
    ],
    "isSubjectCaseSensitive": null,
    "subjectBeginsWith": "",
    "subjectEndsWith": ""
  },
  "id": "/subscriptions/28cf13e2-c598-4aa9-b8c8-098441f0827a/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.SignalRService/SignalR/SignalRTestSvc/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/eventSubscriptions/event-sub-signalr",
  "labels": null,
  "name": "event-sub-signalr",
  "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup",
  "retryPolicy": {
    "eventTimeToLiveInMinutes": 1440,
    "maxDeliveryAttempts": 30
  },
  "topic": "/subscriptions/28cf13e2-c598-4aa9-b8c8-098441f0827a/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/microsoft.signalrservice/signalr/SignalRTestSvc",
  "type": "Microsoft.EventGrid/eventSubscriptions"
}
```

## Trigger registry events

Switch to the service mode to `Serverless Mode` and set up a client connection to the SignalR Service. You can take [Serverless Sample](https://github.com/aspnet/AzureSignalR-samples/tree/master/samples/Serverless) as a reference.

[!INCLUDE [Connection string security comment](includes/signalr-connection-string-security-comment.md)]

```bash
git clone git@github.com:aspnet/AzureSignalR-samples.git

cd samples/Management

# Start the negotiation server
# Negotiation server is responsible for generating access token for clients
cd NegotiationServer
dotnet user-secrets set Azure:SignalR:ConnectionString "<Connection String>"
dotnet run

# Use a separate command line
# Start a client
cd SignalRClient
dotnet run
```

## View registry events

You've now connected a client to the SignalR Service. Navigate to your Event Grid Viewer web app, and you should see a `ClientConnectionConnected` event. If you terminate the client, you'll also see a `ClientConnectionDisconnected` event.
