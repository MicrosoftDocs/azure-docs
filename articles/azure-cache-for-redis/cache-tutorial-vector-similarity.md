# Tutorial: Conduct vector similarity search on Azure OpenAI embeddings using Azure Cache for Redis

In this tutorial, you'll walk through a basic vector similarity search use-case. You'll use embeddings generated by Azure OpenAI Service and the built-in vector search capabilities of the Enterprise tier of Azure Cache for Redis to query a dataset of movies to find the most relevant match.

The tutorial uses the [Wikipedia Movie Plots dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots) that features plot descriptions of over 35,000 movies from Wikipedia covering the years 1901 to 2017.
The dataset includes a plot summary for each movie, plus metadata such as the year the film was released, the director(s), main cast, and genre. You'll follow the steps of the tutorial to generate embeddings based on the plot summary and use the other metadata to run hybrid queries.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an Azure Cache for Redis instance configured for vector search
> * Install Azure OpenAI and other required Python libraries.
> * Download the movie dataset and prepare it for analysis.
> * Use the **text-embedding-ada-002 (Version 2)** model to generate embeddings.
> * Create a vector index in Azure Cache for Redis
> * Use cosine similarity to rank search results.
> * Use hybrid query functionality through [RediSearch](https://redis.io/docs/interact/search-and-query/) to prefilter the data and make the vector search even more powerful.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This tutorial will walk you through building a Jupyter Notebook. You can follow this tutorial with a Python code file (.py) and get *similar* results, but you will need to add all of the code blocks in this tutorial into the `.py` file and execute once to see results. In other words, Jupyter Notebooks provides intermediate results as you execute cells, but this is not behavior you should expect when working in a Python code file.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you would like to follow along in a completed Jupyter notebook instead, [download the Jupyter notebook file named *tutorial.ipynb*](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cache-redis-samples/tree/main/tutorial/vector-similarity-search-open-ai) and save it into the new *redis-vector* folder.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true)
* Access granted to Azure OpenAI in the desired Azure subscription
    Currently, you must apply for access to Azure OpenAI. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI by completing the form at <a href="https://aka.ms/oai/access" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/oai/access</a>.
* <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python 3.7.1 or later version</a>
* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) (optional)
* An Azure OpenAI resource with the **text-embedding-ada-002 (Version 2)** model deployed. This model is currently only available in [certain regions](../ai-services/openai/concepts/models.md#model-summary-table-and-region-availability). See the [resource deployment guide](../ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource.md) for instructions on how to deploy the model.

## Create an Azure Cache for Redis Instance

1. Follow the [Quickstart: Create a Redis Enterprise cache](quickstart-create-redis-enterprise.md) guide. On the **Advanced** page, make sure that you've added the **RediSearch** module and have chosen the **Enterprise** Cluster Policy. All other settings can match the default described in the quickstart.

   It takes a few minutes for the cache to create. You can move on to the next step in the meantime.

## Set up your development environment

1. Create a folder on your local computer named *redis-vector* in the location where you typically save your projects.

1. Create a new python file (*tutorial.py*) or Jupyter notebook (*tutorial.ipynb*) in the folder.

1. Install the required Python packages:

   ```python
   pip install "openai==0.28.1" num2words matplotlib plotly scipy scikit-learn pandas tiktoken redis langchain
   ```

## Download the dataset

1. In a web browser, navigate to [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots).

1. Sign in or register with Kaggle. Registration is required to download the file.

1. Select the **Download** link on Kaggle to download the *archive.zip* file.

1. Extract the *archive.zip* file and move the *wiki_movie_plots_deduped.csv* into the *redis-vector* folder.

## Import libraries and set up connection information

To successfully make a call against Azure OpenAI, you need an **endpoint** and a **key**. You also need an **endpoint** and a **key** to connect to Azure Cache for Redis.

1. Go to your Azure Open AI resource in the Azure portal.

1. Locate **Endpoint and Keys** in the **Resource Management** section. Copy your endpoint and access key as you'll need both for authenticating your API calls. An example endpoint is: `https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com`. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`.

1. Go to the **Overview** page of your Azure Cache for Redis resource in the Azure portal. Copy your endpoint.

1. Locate **Access keys** in the **Settings** section. Copy your access key. You can use either `Primary` or `Secondary`.

1. Add the following code to a new code cell:

   ```python
   # Code cell 2

   import re
   from num2words import num2words
   import os
   import pandas as pd
   from openai.embeddings_utils import get_embedding
   import tiktoken
   from typing import List
   from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
   from langchain.vectorstores.redis import Redis as RedisVectorStore
   from langchain.document_loaders import DataFrameLoader

   API_KEY = "<your-azure-openai-key>"
   RESOURCE_ENDPOINT = "<your-azure-openai-endpoint>"
   DEPLOYMENT_NAME = "<name-of-your-model-deployment>"
   MODEL_NAME = "text-embedding-ada-002"
   REDIS_ENDPOINT = "<your-azure-redis-endpoint>"
   REDIS_PASSWORD = "<your-azure-redis-password>"
   ```

1. Update the value of `API_KEY` and `RESOURCE_ENDPOINT` with the key and endpoint values from your Azure OpenAI deployment. `DEPLOYMENT_NAME` should be set to the name of your deployment using the `text-embedding-ada-002 (Version 2)` embeddings model, and `MODEL_NAME` should be the specific embeddings model used.

1. Update `REDIS_ENDPOINT` and `REDIS_PASSWORD` with the endpoint and key value from your Azure Cache for Redis instance.

   > [!Important]
   > We strongly recommend using environmental variables or a secret manager like [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/general/overview.md) to pass in the API key, endpoint, and deployment name information. These variables are set in plaintext here for the sake of simplicity.

1. Execute code cell 2.

## Import dataset into pandas and process data

Next, you'll read the csv file into a pandas DataFrame.

1. Add the following code to a new code cell:

   ```python
   # Code cell 3

   df=pd.read_csv(os.path.join(os.getcwd(),'wiki_movie_plots_deduped.csv'))
   df
   ```

1. Execute code cell 3. You should see the following output:
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/cache-tutorial-vector-similarity/code-cell-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of results from executing code cell 3, displaying eight columns and a sampling of 10 rows of data." lightbox="media/cache-tutorial-vector-similarity/code-cell-3.png":::

1. Next, process the data by adding an `id` index, removing spaces from the column titles, and filters the movies to take only movies made after 1970 and from English speaking countries. This filtering step reduces the number of movies in the dataset, which lowers the cost and time required to generate embeddings. You're free to change or remove the filter parameters based on your preferences.

   To filter the data, add the following code to a new code cell:

   ```python
   # Code cell 4

   df.insert(0, 'id', range(0, len(df)))
   df['year'] = df['Release Year'].astype(int)
   df['origin'] = df['Origin/Ethnicity'].astype(str)
   del df['Release Year']
   del df['Origin/Ethnicity']
   df = df[df.year > 1970] # only movies made after 1970
   df = df[df.origin.isin(['American','British','Canadian'])] # only movies from English-speaking cinema
   df
   ```

1. Execute code cell 4. You should see the following results:

   :::image type="content" source="media/cache-tutorial-vector-similarity/code-cell-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of results from executing code cell 4, displaying nine columns and a sampling of 10 rows of data." lightbox="media/cache-tutorial-vector-similarity/code-cell-4.png":::

1. Create a function to clean the data by removing whitespace and punctuation, then use it against the dataframe containing the plot.

   Add the following code to a new code cell and execute it:

   ```python
   # Code cell 5

   pd.options.mode.chained_assignment = None

   # s is input text
   def normalize_text(s, sep_token = " \n "):
       s = re.sub(r'\s+',  ' ', s).strip()
       s = re.sub(r". ,","",s)
       # remove all instances of multiple spaces
       s = s.replace("..",".")
       s = s.replace(". .",".")
       s = s.replace("\n", "")
       s = s.strip()
    
       return s

   df['Plot']= df['Plot'].apply(lambda x : normalize_text(x))
   ```

1. Finally, remove any entries that contain plot descriptions that are too long for the embeddings model. (In other words, they require more tokens than the 8192 token limit.) and then calculate the numbers of tokens required to generate embeddings. This also impacts pricing for embedding generation.

   Add the following code to a new code cell:

   ```python
   # Code cell 6

   tokenizer = tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base")
   df['n_tokens'] = df["Plot"].apply(lambda x: len(tokenizer.encode(x)))
   df = df[df.n_tokens<8192]
   print('Number of movies: ' + str(len(df)))
   print('Number of tokens required:' + str(df['n_tokens'].sum()))
   ```

1. Execute code cell 6. You should see this output:

   ```output
   Number of movies: 11125
   Number of tokens required:7044844
   ```

   > [!Important]
   > Refer to [Azure OpenAI Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/) to caculate the cost of generating embeddings based on the number of tokens required.

## Load DataFrame into LangChain

Load the DataFrame into LangChain using the `DataFrameLoader` class. Once the data is in LangChain documents, it's far easier to use LangChain libraries to generate embeddings and conduct similarity searches. Set *Plot* as the `page_content_column` so that embeddings are generated on this column.

1. Add the following code to a new code cell and execute it:

   ```python
   # Code cell 7

   loader = DataFrameLoader(df, page_content_column="Plot" )
   movie_list = loader.load()
   ```

## Generate embeddings and load them into Redis

Now that the data has been filtered and loaded into LangChain, you'll create embeddings so you can query on the plot for each movie. The following code configures Azure OpenAI, generates embeddings, and loads the embeddings vectors into Azure Cache for Redis.

1. Add the following code a new code cell:

   ```python
   # Code cell 8

   embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings(
       deployment=DEPLOYMENT_NAME,
       model=MODEL_NAME,
       openai_api_base=RESOURCE_ENDPOINT,
       openai_api_type="azure",
       openai_api_key=API_KEY,
       openai_api_version="2023-05-15",
       chunk_size=16 # current limit with Azure OpenAI service. This will likely increase in the future.
       )

   # name of the Redis search index to create
   index_name = "movieindex"

   # create a connection string for the Redis Vector Store. Uses Redis-py format: https://redis-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/connections.html#redis.Redis.from_url
   # This example assumes TLS is enabled. If not, use "redis://" instead of "rediss://
   redis_url = "rediss://:" + REDIS_PASSWORD + "@"+ REDIS_ENDPOINT

   # create and load redis with documents
   vectorstore = RedisVectorStore.from_documents(
       documents=movie_list,
       embedding=embedding,
       index_name=index_name,
       redis_url=redis_url
   )

   # save index schema so you can reload in the future without re-generating embeddings
   vectorstore.write_schema("redis_schema.yaml")
   ```

1. Execute code cell 8.  This can take up to 10 minutes to complete. A `redis_schema.yaml` file is generated as well. This file is useful if you want to connect to your index in Azure Cache for Redis instance without re-generating embeddings.

## Run vector search queries

Now that your dataset, Azure OpenAI service API, and Redis instance are set up, you can search using vectors. In this example, the top 10 results for a given query are returned.

1. Add the following code to your Python code file:

   ```python
   # Code cell 9

   query = "Spaceships, aliens, and heroes saving America"
   results = vectorstore.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=10)

   for i, j in enumerate(results):
       movie_title = str(results[i][0].metadata['Title'])
       similarity_score = str(round((1 - results[i][1]),4))
       print(movie_title + ' (Score: ' + similarity_score + ')')
   ```

1. Execute code cell 9. You should see the following output:

   ```output
   Independence Day (Score: 0.8348)
   The Flying Machine (Score: 0.8332)
   Remote Control (Score: 0.8301)
   Bravestarr: The Legend (Score: 0.83)
   Xenogenesis (Score: 0.8291)
   Invaders from Mars (Score: 0.8291)
   Apocalypse Earth (Score: 0.8287)
   Invasion from Inner Earth (Score: 0.8287)
   Thru the Moebius Strip (Score: 0.8283)
   Solar Crisis (Score: 0.828)
   ```

   The similarity score is returned along with the ordinal ranking of movies by similarity. Notice that more specific queries have similarity scores decrease faster down the list.

## Hybrid searches

1. Since RediSearch also features rich search functionality on top of vector search, it's possible to filter results by the metadata in the data set, such as film genre, cast, release year, or director. In this case, filter based on the genre `comedy`.

   Add the following code to a new code cell:

   ```python
   # Code cell 10

   from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisText

   query = "Spaceships, aliens, and heroes saving America"
   genre_filter = RedisText("Genre") == "comedy"
   results = vectorstore.similarity_search_with_score(query, filter=genre_filter, k=10)
   for i, j in enumerate(results):
       movie_title = str(results[i][0].metadata['Title'])
       similarity_score = str(round((1 - results[i][1]),4))
       print(movie_title + ' (Score: ' + similarity_score + ')')
   ```

1. Execute code cell 10. You should see the following output:

   ```output
   Remote Control (Score: 0.8301)
   Meet Dave (Score: 0.8236)
   Elf-Man (Score: 0.8208)
   Fifty/Fifty (Score: 0.8167)
   Mars Attacks! (Score: 0.8165)
   Strange Invaders (Score: 0.8143)
   Amanda and the Alien (Score: 0.8136)
   Suburban Commando (Score: 0.8129)
   Coneheads (Score: 0.8129)
   Morons from Outer Space (Score: 0.8121)
   ```

With Azure Cache for Redis and Azure OpenAI Service, you can use embeddings and vector search to add powerful search capabilities to your application.
