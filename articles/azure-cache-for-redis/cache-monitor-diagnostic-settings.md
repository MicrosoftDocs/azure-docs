# Monitor Azure Cache for Redis using diagnostic settings

Azure Cache for Redis offers two monitoring options in **Diagnostic settings**:

- *Cache metrics* log Azure Monitor metrics about cache operations.
- *Connection logs* log connections to the cache. Azure captures these logs, also called *data plane logs*, per request. The contents of the connection logs vary by resource type.

For an overview of Azure Monitor monitoring and logging functionality, see [Diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings).

## Scope of availability

|Tier     | Basic, Standard, and Premium  | Enterprise and Enterprise Flash  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Cache metrics  | Yes         | Yes  |
|Connection logs | Yes | Yes |

## Cache metrics

Azure Redis emits many useful metrics, such as **Server Load** and **Connections per Second**. For a complete listing of Azure Redis metrics, see [Metrics](../redis/monitor-cache-reference.md#metrics).

To log cache metrics, enable the **AllMetrics** option in your cache **Diagnostic settings** according to the instructions for your tier. You can configure how long metrics are retained. For more information about logging and exporting metrics, see [Azure Cache for Redis metrics](../redis/monitor-cache.md#azure-cache-for-redis-metrics).

## Connection logs

Azure Cache for Redis uses Azure diagnostic settings to log client connection information about your cache. Logging and analyzing this information in diagnostic settings helps you understand who connects to your cache and when. You can use the log data for security auditing purposes, or to identify the scope of security issues.

> [!NOTE]
> You can always use the redis-cli [INFO](https://redis.io/commands/info/) or [CLIENT LIST](https://redis.io/commands/client-list/) commands to check who is connected to a cache instance on-demand.
>
The connection log implementation and the logs produced are similar among Azure Redis tiers, but Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers have some differences from Enterprise and Enterprise Flash tiers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - In the Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers, connection logging *polls* the current client connections in the cache. The same client IP addresses can appear repeatedly as long as their connections last.
> - In the Enterprise and Enterprise Flash tiers, logging focuses on connection *events*. Logging only occurs when the connection event or other connection-related event first happens.

## Requirements and limitations

#### [Basic, Standard, and Premium](#tab/basic-standard-premium)

Basic, Standard, and Premium-tier caches poll client connections by IP address, including the number of connections originating from each unique IP address. These logs aren't cumulative, but represent point-in-time snapshots taken at 10-second intervals. These tiers don't log successful or failed authentication events or disconnection events.

Keep the following limitations in mind:

- Because connection logs in these tiers consist of point-in-time snapshots taken every 10 seconds, connections that are established and removed within a 10-second interval aren't logged.
- Authentication and disconnection events aren't logged.
- Diagnostic settings can take up to [90 minutes](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#time-before-telemetry-gets-to-destination) to start flowing to your selected destination.
- Connection logging can cause a small performance degradation in your cache.
- To stream logs to Log Analytics, only the Analytics Logs pricing plan is supported. For more information, see [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/).

#### [Enterprise and Enterprise Flash](#tab/enterprise-enterprise-flash)

Enterprise and Enterprise Flash-tier caches use the [audit connection event](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/security/audit-events/) functionality built in to Redis Enterprise. Audit connection events allow every connection, disconnection, and authentication event to be logged, including failed authentication events.

Keep the following limitations in mind:

- When you use **OSS** cluster policy, logs are emitted from each data node. When you use **Enterprise** cluster policy, only the node being used as a proxy emits logs. This difference is only architectural. Both versions cover all connections to the cache.
- Data loss, or missing a connection event, is rare but possible. Data loss is typically caused by networking issues.
- Disconnection logs might not be fully stable, and events might be missed.
- Because connection logs on the Enterprise tiers are event-based, consider your retention policies. If retention is set to 10 days, a connection that started 15 days ago might still exist, but the log for that connection event isn't retained.
- If you use [active geo-replication](cache-how-to-active-geo-replication.md), you must configure logging individually for each cache instance in the geo-replication group.
- Diagnostic settings can take up to [90 minutes](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#time-before-telemetry-gets-to-destination) to start flowing to your selected destination.
- Connection logging can cause a small performance degradation in your cache.

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select logs, you can choose either **Categories** or **Category groups**, which are predefined groupings of logs across Azure services. If you use **Category groups**, you can't configure retention settings. If you need to set retention duration for your connection logs, select the item in **Categories** instead. For more information, see [Category groups](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#resource-logs).

## Log destinations

When you enable diagnostic settings for your Azure Redis instance, you can send resource logs to the following destinations:

- **Send to Log Analytics workspace**. The workspace doesn't need to be in the same region as the resource being monitored.
- **Archive to a storage account**. The storage account must be in the same region as the cache. <!--[Premium storage accounts are not supported](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#destination-limitations) as a destination, however.-->
- **Stream to an event hub**. The event hub must be in the same region as the cache.

  Diagnostic settings can't access event hub resources if virtual networks are enabled. Enable the **Allow trusted Microsoft services to bypass this firewall** setting in Azure Event Hubs to grant access to event hub resources. 
- **Send to partner solution**. For a list of potential partner logging solutions, see [Extend Azure with Azure Native Integrations - Data and storage](/azure/partner-solutions/partners#data-and-storage).

When you send diagnostic logs to a storage account or event hub, you're charged normal data rates for either destination. You're billed under Azure Monitor, not Azure Cache for Redis. When you send logs to Log Analytics, you're charged only for Log Analytics data ingestion. For more pricing information, see [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/).

## Enable diagnostic settings using the Azure portal

## Enable connection logging using Azure CLI

Use the Azure CLI `az monitor diagnostic-settings create` command to create a diagnostic setting. For more information on command and parameter descriptions, see [Create diagnostic settings to send platform logs and metrics to different destinations](/cli/azure/monitor/diagnostic-settings#az-monitor-diagnostic-settings-create).

The following example shows how to use the Azure CLI to stream data to four different endpoints:

#### [Basic, Standard, and Premium](#tab/basic-standard-premium)

```azurecli
az monitor diagnostic-settings create 
    --resource /subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupname}/providers/Microsoft.Cache/Redis/{cacheName}
    --name {logName}
    --logs '[{"category": "ConnectedClientList","enabled": true,"retentionPolicy": {"enabled": false,"days": 0}}]'    
    --event-hub {eventHubName}
    --event-hub-rule /subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/microsoft.eventhub/namespaces/{eventHubNamespace}/authorizationrule/{ruleName}
    --storage-account /subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}
    --workspace /subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{logAnalyticsWorkspaceName}
    --marketplace-partner-id/subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups{resourceGroupname}/providers/Microsoft.Datadog/monitors/mydatadog
```

#### [Enterprise and Enterprise Flash](#tab/enterprise-enterprise-flash)

```azurecli
az monitor diagnostic-settings create 
    --resource /subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Cache/redisenterprise/{cacheName}/databases/default
    --name {logName}
    --logs '[{"category": "ConnectionEvents","enabled": true,"retentionPolicy": {"enabled": false,"days": 0}}]'
    --event-hub {eventHubName}
    --event-hub-rule /subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/microsoft.eventhub/namespaces/{eventHubNamespace}/authorizationrule/{ruleName}
    --storage-account /subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}
    --workspace /subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{logAnalyticsWorkspaceName}
    --marketplace-partner-id/subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups{resourceGroupname}/providers/Microsoft.Datadog/monitors/mydatadog
```

## Connection log contents

#### [Basic, Standard, and Premium](#tab/basic-standard-premium)

The following fields and properties appear in the `ConnectedClientList` log category. In Azure Monitor, logs are collected in the `ACRConnectedClientList` table under the resource provider name of `MICROSOFT.CACHE`.

| Azure Storage field or property | Azure Monitor Logs property | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `time` | `TimeGenerated` | The UTC timestamp when the log was generated. |
| `location` | `Location` | The Azure region the Azure Redis cache was accessed in. |
| `category` | n/a | Available log category `ConnectedClientList`. |
| `resourceId` | `_ResourceId` | The Azure Redis resource logs are enabled for.|
| `operationName` | `OperationName` | The Redis operation associated with the log record. |
| `properties` | n/a | See the following rows. |
| `tenant` | `CacheName` | The name of the Azure Redis instance. |
| `roleInstance` | `RoleInstance` | The role instance that logged the client list. |
| `connectedClients.ip` | `ClientIp` | The Redis client IP address. |
| `connectedClients.privateLinkIpv6` | `PrivateLinkIpv6` | The Redis client private link IPv6 address if applicable. |
| `connectedClients.count` | `ClientCount` | The number of Redis client connections from the associated IP address. |

### Sample storage account log

The contents of a log sent to a storage account might look like the following example.

```json
{
    "time": "2021-08-05T21:04:58.0466086Z",
    "location": "canadacentral",
    "category": "ConnectedClientList",
    "properties": {
        "tenant": "mycache", 
        "connectedClients": [
            {
                "ip": "192.123.43.36", 
                "count": 86
            },
            {
                "ip": "10.1.1.4",
                "privateLinkIpv6": "fd40:8913:31:6810:6c31:200:a01:104", 
                "count": 1
            }
        ],
        "roleInstance": "1"
    },
    "resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/eeee4efe-ff5f-aa6a-bb7b-cccccc8c8c8c/RESOURCEGROUPS/AZURE-CACHE/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.CACHE/REDIS/MYCACHE", 
    "Level": 4,
    "operationName": "Microsoft.Cache/ClientList"
}
```

#### [Enterprise and Enterprise Flash](#tab/enterprise-enterprise-flash)

These fields and properties appear in the `ConnectionEvents` log category. In Azure Monitor, logs are collected in the `REDConnectionEvents` table under the resource provider name of `MICROSOFT.CACHE`.

| Azure Storage field or property | Azure Monitor Logs property | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `time` | `TimeGenerated` | The UTC timestamp when the log was generated. |
| `location` | `Location` | The Azure region the Azure Redis cache was accessed in. |
| `category` | n/a | Available log category `ConnectedClientList`. |
| `resourceId` | `_ResourceId` | The Azure Redis resource logs are enabled for.|
| `operationName` | `OperationName` | The Redis operation associated with the log record. |
| `properties` | n/a | See the following rows. |
| `eventEpochTime` | `EventEpochTime` | The UTC UNIX timestamp, or number of seconds since January 1, 1970, when the event happened. You can convert the timestamp to `datetime` format using the function `unixtime_seconds_todatetime` in the Log Analytics workspace. |
| `clientIP` | `ClientIP` | The Redis client IP address. If you use Azure storage, the IP address is IPv4 or Private Link IPv6 format based on cache type. If you use Log Analytics, this result is always in IPv4, because there's a separate IPv6 field. |
| n/a | `PrivateLinkIPv6` | The Redis client private link IPv6 address, emitted only if using both Private Link and Log Analytics. |
| `id` | `ConnectionId` | Unique connection ID assigned by Redis. |
| `eventType` |  `EventType` | Type of connection event: `new_conn`, `auth`, or `close_conn`. |
| `eventStatus` |  `EventStatus` | Results of an authentication request as a status code. Only applicable for authentication events. |

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Private Link, only an IPv6 address is logged, unless you stream the data to Log Analytics. You can convert the IPv6 address to the equivalent IPv4 address by using the last four bytes of data in the IPv6 address. For instance, in the Private Link IPv6 address `fd40:8913:31:6810:6c31:200:a01:104`, the last four bytes in hexadecimal are `0a`, `01`, `01`, and `04`. (In the address, leading zeros after colons are omitted.) These values correspond to `10`, `1`, `1`, and `4` in decimal, producing the IPv4 address `10.1.1.4`.  

### Sample storage account logs

A log for a connection event sent to a storage account might look like the following example.

```json
    {
        "time": "2023-01-24T10:00:02.3680050Z",
        "resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/ffff5f5f-aa6a-bb7b-cc8c-dddddd9d9d9d/RESOURCEGROUPS/TEST/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.CACHE/REDISENTERPRISE/AUDITING-SHOEBOX/DATABASES/DEFAULT",
        "category": "ConnectionEvents",
        "location": "westus",
        "operationName": "Microsoft.Cache/redisEnterprise/databases/ConnectionEvents/Read",
        "properties": {
            "eventEpochTime": 1674554402,
            "id": 6185063009002,
            "clientIP": "20.228.16.39",
            "eventType": "new_conn"
        }
    }
```

The log for an authentication event might look like this example:

```json
 {
        "time": "2023-01-24T10:00:02.3680050Z",
        "resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/ffff5f5f-aa6a-bb7b-cc8c-dddddd9d9d9d/RESOURCEGROUPS/TEST/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.CACHE/REDISENTERPRISE/AUDITING-SHOEBOX/DATABASES/DEFAULT",
        "category": "ConnectionEvents",
        "location": "westus",
        "operationName": "Microsoft.Cache/redisEnterprise/databases/ConnectionEvents/Read",
        "properties": {
            "eventEpochTime": 1674554402,
            "id": 6185063009002,
            "clientIP": "20.228.16.39",
            "eventType": "auth",
            "eventStatus": 8
        }
    }
```

The log for a disconnection event might look like this:
```json
    {
        "time": "2023-01-24T10:00:03.3680050Z",
        "resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/ffff5f5f-aa6a-bb7b-cc8c-dddddd9d9d9d/RESOURCEGROUPS/TEST/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.CACHE/REDISENTERPRISE/AUDITING-SHOEBOX/DATABASES/DEFAULT",
        "category": "ConnectionEvents",
        "location": "westus",
        "operationName": "Microsoft.Cache/redisEnterprise/databases/ConnectionEvents/Read",
        "properties": {
            "eventEpochTime": 1674554402,
            "id": 6185063009002,
            "clientIP": "20.228.16.39",
            "eventType": "close_conn"
        }
    }
```
