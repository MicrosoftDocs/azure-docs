## Clean up resources

If you want to continue to use the resources you created in this article, keep the resource group.

Otherwise, if you're finished with the resources, you can delete the Azure resource group that you created to avoid charges.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deleting a resource group is irreversible. When you delete a resource group, all the resources in it are permanently deleted. Make sure that you do not accidentally delete the wrong resource group or resources. If you created the resources inside an existing resource group that contains resources you want to keep, you can delete each resource individually instead of deleting the resource group.

### To delete a resource group

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and then select **Resource groups**.

1. Select the resource group you want to delete.

   If there are many resource groups, use the **Filter for any field...** box, type the name of your resource group you created for this article. Select the resource group in the results list.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.
