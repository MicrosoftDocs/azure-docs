# Configure virtual network (VNet) support for a Premium Azure Cache for Redis instance

[Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network/) deployment provides enhanced security and isolation along with: subnets, access control policies, and other features to restrict access further. When an Azure Cache for Redis instance is configured with a virtual network, it isn't publicly addressable. Instead, the instance can only be accessed from virtual machines and applications within the virtual network. This article describes how to configure virtual network support for a Premium-tier Azure Cache for Redis instance.

> [!NOTE]
>Classic deployment model is retiring in August 2024. For more information, see [Cloud Services (classic) deployment model is retiring on 31 August 2024](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/cloud-services-retirement-announcement/).
>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Cache for Redis recommends using Azure Private Link, which simplifies the network architecture and secures the connection between endpoints in Azure. You can connect to an Azure Cache instance from your virtual network via a private endpoint, which is assigned a private IP address in a subnet within the virtual network. Azure Private Links is offered on all our tiers, includes Azure Policy support, and simplified NSG rule management. To learn more, see [Private Link Documentation](cache-private-link.md). To migrate your VNet injected caches to Private Link, see [Migrate from VNet injection caches to Private Link caches](cache-vnet-migration.md).

## Limitations of VNet injection

- Creating and maintaining virtual network configurations are often error prone. Troubleshooting is challenging, too. Incorrect virtual network configurations can lead to issues:
  - obstructed metrics transmission from your cache instances
  - failure of replica node to replicate data from primary node
  - potential data loss
  - failure of management operations like scaling
  - intermittent or complete SSL/TLS failures
  - failure to apply updates, including important security and reliability improvements
  - in the most severe scenarios, loss of availability
- When using a VNet injected cache, you must keep your VNet updated to allow access to cache dependencies, such as Certificate Revocation Lists, Public Key Infrastructure, Azure Key Vault, Azure Storage, Azure Monitor, and more.
- VNet injected caches are only available for Premium-tier Azure Cache for Redis, not other tiers.
- You can't inject an existing Azure Cache for Redis instance into a Virtual Network. You must select this option when you _create_ the cache.
- Azure portal doesn't support configuring VNET injection during resource create

## Set up virtual network support

Refer to [az redis create](/cli/azure/redis#az-redis-create).

### What are some common misconfiguration issues with Azure Cache for Redis and virtual networks?

When Azure Cache for Redis is hosted in a virtual network, the ports in the following tables are used.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If the ports in the following tables are blocked, the cache might not function correctly. Having one or more of these ports blocked is the most common misconfiguration issue when you use Azure Cache for Redis in a virtual network.
>

- [Outbound port requirements](#outbound-port-requirements)
- [Inbound port requirements](#inbound-port-requirements)

#### Outbound port requirements

There are network connectivity requirements for Azure Cache for Redis needed for outbound connectivity to other dependency services necessary for the cache to function, or even internal to the Redis subnet for inter-node communication.

| Ports | Direction | Transport protocol | Purpose | Local IP | Remote IP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 80, 443 |Outbound |TCP |Redis dependencies on Azure Storage, PKI (internet), operating system, infrastructure, and the antivirus | (Redis subnet) |* <sup>4</sup> |
| 443 | Outbound | TCP | Redis dependency on Azure Key Vault and Azure Monitor | (Redis subnet) | AzureKeyVault, AzureMonitor <sup>1</sup> |
| 12000 | Outbound | TCP | Redis dependency on Azure Monitor | (Redis subnet) |  AzureMonitor <sup>1</sup> |
| 53 |Outbound |TCP/UDP | Redis dependencies on DNS (internet/virtual network) | (Redis subnet) | 168.63.129.16 and 169.254.169.254 <sup>2</sup> and any custom DNS server for the subnet <sup>3</sup> |
| 123 | Outbound | UDP | Operating system dependency on NTP | (Redis subnet) | * |
| 1688 | Outbound | TCP | Operating system dependency for activation | (Redis subnet) | * |
| 8443 |Outbound |TCP |Internal communications for Redis | (Redis subnet) | (Redis subnet) |
| 10221-10231 |Outbound |TCP |Internal communications for Redis | (Redis subnet) | (Redis subnet) |
| 20226 |Outbound |TCP |Internal communications for Redis | (Redis subnet) |(Redis subnet) |
| 13000-13999 |Outbound |TCP |Internal communications for Redis | (Redis subnet) |(Redis subnet) |
| 15000-15999 |Outbound |TCP |Internal communications for Redis and geo-replication | (Redis subnet) |(Redis subnet) (Geo-replica peer subnet) |
| 6379-6380 |Outbound |TCP |Internal communications for Redis | (Redis subnet) |(Redis subnet) |

<sup>1</sup> You can use the service tags AzureKeyVault and AzureMonitor with Resource Manager network security groups (NSGs).

<sup>2</sup> These IP addresses owned by Microsoft are used to address the host VM that serves Azure DNS.

<sup>3</sup> This information isn't needed for subnets with no custom DNS server or newer Redis caches that ignore custom DNS.

<sup>4</sup> For more information, see [Additional virtual network connectivity requirements](#additional-virtual-network-connectivity-requirements).

#### Geo-replication peer port requirements

If you're using geo-replication between caches in Azure virtual networks: a) unblock ports 15000-15999 for the whole subnet in both inbound _and_ outbound directions, and b) to both caches. With this configuration, all the replica components in the subnet can communicate directly with each other even if there's a future geo-failover.

#### Inbound port requirements

There are eight inbound port range requirements. Inbound requests in these ranges are either inbound from other services hosted in the same virtual network. Or, they're internal to the Redis subnet communications.

| Ports | Direction | Transport protocol | Purpose | Local IP | Remote IP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6379, 6380 |Inbound |TCP |Client communication to Redis, Azure load balancing | (Redis subnet) | (Redis subnet), (Client subnet), AzureLoadBalancer <sup>1</sup> |
| 8443 |Inbound |TCP |Internal communications for Redis | (Redis subnet) |(Redis subnet) |
| 8500 |Inbound |TCP/UDP |Azure load balancing | (Redis subnet) | AzureLoadBalancer |
| 10221-10231 |Inbound |TCP |Client communication to Redis Clusters, internal communications for Redis | (Redis subnet) |(Redis subnet), (Client subnet), AzureLoadBalancer |
| 13000-13999 |Inbound |TCP |Client communication to Redis Clusters, Azure load balancing | (Redis subnet) | (Redis subnet), (Client subnet), AzureLoadBalancer |
| 15000-15999 |Inbound |TCP |Client communication to Redis Clusters, Azure load balancing, and geo-replication | (Redis subnet) | (Redis subnet), (Client subnet), AzureLoadBalancer, (Geo-replica peer subnet) |
| 16001 |Inbound |TCP/UDP |Azure load balancing | (Redis subnet) | AzureLoadBalancer |
| 20226 |Inbound |TCP |Internal communications for Redis | (Redis subnet) |(Redis subnet) |

<sup>1</sup> You can use the service tag AzureLoadBalancer for Resource Manager or AZURE_LOADBALANCER for the classic deployment model for authoring the NSG rules.

#### Additional virtual network connectivity requirements

There are network connectivity requirements for Azure Cache for Redis needed for outbound connectivity to other dependency services necessary for the cache to function, or even internal to the Redis subnet for internode communication.  

Azure Cache for Redis requires all the following outbound connectivity items to function properly when used within a virtual network:

- The DNS configuration for the virtual network must be able to resolve all of the endpoints and domains mentioned in the earlier table entries. These DNS requirements can be met by ensuring a valid DNS infrastructure is configured and maintained for the virtual network.

### How can I verify that my cache is working in a virtual network?

>[!IMPORTANT]
>When you connect to an Azure Cache for Redis instance that's hosted in a virtual network, your cache clients must be in the same virtual network or in a virtual network with virtual network peering enabled within the same Azure region. Global virtual network peering isn't currently supported. This requirement applies to any test applications or diagnostic pinging tools. Regardless of where the client application is hosted, NSGs or other network layers must be configured such that the client's network traffic is allowed to reach the Azure Cache for Redis instance.
>

After the port requirements are configured as described in the previous section, a reboot is necessary in most cases to ensure the changes reflect correctly. Otherwise, you might experience some connectivity issues. You can verify that your cache is working by following these steps:

- [Reboot](cache-administration.md#reboot) all of the cache nodes. The cache won't be able to restart successfully if all of the required cache dependencies can't be reached---as documented in [Inbound port requirements](cache-how-to-premium-vnet.md#inbound-port-requirements) and [Outbound port requirements](cache-how-to-premium-vnet.md#outbound-port-requirements).
- After the cache nodes have restarted, as reported by the cache status in the Azure portal, you can do the following tests:
  - Ping the cache endpoint by using port 6380 from a machine that's within the same virtual network as the cache, using [`tcping`](https://www.elifulkerson.com/projects/tcping.php). For example:

    `tcping.exe contosocache.redis.cache.windows.net 6380`

    If the `tcping` tool reports that the port is open, the cache is available for connection from clients in the virtual network.

  - Another way to test: create a test cache client that connects to the cache, then adds and retrieves some items from the cache. The test cache client could be a console application using StackExchange.Redis. Install the sample client application onto a VM that's in the same virtual network as the cache. Then, run it to verify connectivity to the cache.

### When I try to connect to my Azure Cache for Redis instance in a virtual network, why do I get an error stating the remote certificate is invalid?

When you try to connect to an Azure Cache for Redis instance in a virtual network, you see a certificate validation error such as this one:

`{"No connection is available to service this operation: SET mykey; The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure.; â€¦"}`

The cause could be that you're connecting to the host by the IP address. We recommend that you use the host name. In other words, use the following string:

`[mycachename].redis.cache.windows.net:6380,password=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,ssl=True,abortConnect=False`

Avoid using the IP address similar to the following connection string:

`10.128.2.84:6380,password=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,ssl=True,abortConnect=False`

If you're unable to resolve the DNS name, some client libraries include configuration options like `sslHost`, which is provided by the StackExchange.Redis client. This option allows you to override the host name used for certificate validation. For example:

`10.128.2.84:6380,password=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,ssl=True,abortConnect=False;sslHost=[mycachename].redis.cache.windows.net`

In addition, if the subnet where Azure Cache for Redis is hosted is blocking TCP outbound connections over port 80 for SSL/TLS functionality, clients might experience intermittent TLS certificate validation errors.

### Can I use virtual networks with a standard or basic cache?

Virtual networks can only be used with Premium-tier caches.

### Why does creating an Azure Cache for Redis instance fail in some subnets but not others?

If you're deploying an Azure Cache for Redis instance to a virtual network, the cache must be in a dedicated subnet that contains no other resource type. If an attempt is made to deploy an Azure Cache for Redis instance to a Resource Manager virtual network subnet that contains other resources---such as Azure Application Gateway instances and Outbound NAT---the deployment usually fails. Delete the existing resources of other types before you create a new Azure Cache for Redis instance.

You must also have enough IP addresses available in the subnet.

### What are the subnet address space requirements?

Azure reserves some IP addresses within each subnet, and these addresses can't be used. The first and last IP addresses of the subnets are reserved for protocol conformance, along with three more addresses used for Azure services. For more information, see [Are there any restrictions on using IP addresses within these subnets?](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-faq.md#are-there-any-restrictions-on-using-ip-addresses-within-these-subnets)

In addition to the IP addresses used by the Azure virtual network infrastructure, each Azure Cache for Redis instance in the subnet uses two IP addresses per cluster shard, plus IP addresses for more replicas, if any. One more IP address is used for the load balancer. A non-clustered cache is considered to have one shard.

### Can I connect to my cache from a peered virtual network?

If the virtual networks are in the same region, you can connect them using virtual network peering or a VPN Gateway VNET-to-VNET connection.

If the peered Azure virtual networks are in _different_ regions: a client VM in region 1 can't access the cache in region 2 via its load balanced IP address because of a constraint with basic load balancers. That is, unless it's a cache with a standard load balancer, which is currently only a cache that was created with _availability zones_.

For more information about virtual network peering constraints, see Virtual Network - Peering - Requirements and constraints. One solution is to use a VPN Gateway VNET-to-VNET connection instead of virtual network peering.

### Do all cache features work when a cache is hosted in a virtual network?

When your cache is part of a virtual network, only clients in the virtual network can access the cache. As a result, the following cache management features don't work at this time:

- **Redis Console**: Because Redis Console runs in your local browser---usually on a developer machine that isn't connected to the virtual network---it can't then connect to your cache.

### Is VNet injection supported on a cache where Azure Lighthouse is enabled?

No, if your subscription has Azure Lighthouse enabled, you can't use VNet injection on an Azure Cache for Redis instance. Instead, use private links.

## Use ExpressRoute with Azure Cache for Redis

Customers can connect an [Azure ExpressRoute](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/expressroute/) circuit to their virtual network infrastructure. In this way, they extend their on-premises network to Azure.

By default, a newly created ExpressRoute circuit doesn't use forced tunneling (advertisement of a default route, 0.0.0.0/0) on a virtual network. As a result, outbound internet connectivity is allowed directly from the virtual network. Client applications can connect to other Azure endpoints, which include an Azure Cache for Redis instance.

A common customer configuration is to use forced tunneling (advertise a default route), which forces outbound internet traffic to instead flow on-premises. This traffic flow breaks connectivity with Azure Cache for Redis if the outbound traffic is then blocked on-premises such that the Azure Cache for Redis instance isn't able to communicate with its dependencies.

The solution is to define one or more user-defined routes (UDRs) on the subnet that contains the Azure Cache for Redis instance. A UDR defines subnet-specific routes that are honored instead of the default route.

If possible, use the following configuration:

- The ExpressRoute configuration advertises 0.0.0.0/0 and, by default, force tunnels all outbound traffic on-premises.
- The UDR applied to the subnet that contains the Azure Cache for Redis instance defines 0.0.0.0/0 with a working route for TCP/IP traffic to the public internet. For example, it sets the next hop type to _internet_.

The combined effect of these steps is that the subnet-level UDR takes precedence over the ExpressRoute forced tunneling and that ensures outbound internet access from the Azure Cache for Redis instance.

Connecting to an Azure Cache for Redis instance from an on-premises application by using ExpressRoute isn't a typical usage scenario because of performance reasons. For best performance, Azure Cache for Redis clients should be in the same region as the Azure Cache for Redis instance.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The routes defined in a UDR _must_ be specific enough to take precedence over any routes advertised by the ExpressRoute configuration. The following example uses the broad 0.0.0.0/0 address range and, as such, can potentially be accidentally overridden by route advertisements that use more specific address ranges.

>[!WARNING]
>Azure Cache for Redis isn't supported with ExpressRoute configurations that _incorrectly cross-advertise routes from the Microsoft peering path to the private peering path_. ExpressRoute configurations that have Microsoft peering configured receive route advertisements from Microsoft for a large set of Microsoft Azure IP address ranges. If these address ranges are incorrectly cross-advertised on the private peering path, the result is that all outbound network packets from the Azure Cache for Redis instance's subnet are incorrectly force-tunneled to a customer's on-premises network infrastructure. This network flow breaks Azure Cache for Redis. The solution to this problem is to stop cross-advertising routes from the Microsoft peering path to the private peering path.

Background information on UDRs is available in [Virtual network traffic routing](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview.md).

For more information about ExpressRoute, see [ExpressRoute technical overview](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md).
