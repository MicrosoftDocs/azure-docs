# Quickstart: Create an open-source Redis cache

Azure Cache for Redis provides fully managed [open-source Redis](https://redis.io/) within Azure. You can start with an Azure Cache for Redis instance of any tier (Basic, Standard, or Premium) and size, and scale it to meet your application's performance needs. This quickstart demonstrates how to use the Azure portal to create a new Azure Cache for Redis.

## Prerequisites

You'll need an Azure subscription before you begin. If you don't have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) first.
