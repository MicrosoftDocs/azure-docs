          The Redis open-source project changed to a dual-license model with support for the Redis Source Available License version 2 (RSALv2) or Server-Side Public License version 1 (SSPLv1). For more information, see the [Redis press release](https://aka.ms/redis/licensingchangepressrelease). Also see the [Microsoft blog post on the Redis licensing change](https://aka.ms/redis/licensechangeblog).
