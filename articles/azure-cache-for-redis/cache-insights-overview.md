# Azure Monitor insights for Azure Cache for Redis

Azure Monitor insights for Azure Cache for Redis provide a unified, interactive view of cache performance, failures, capacity, and operational health. This article shows you how to view Azure Cache for Redis insights across all of your subscriptions, and how to modify and adapt insights to fit the unique needs of your organization.

For more information about Azure Monitor for Azure Cache for Redis, see [Monitor Azure Cache for Redis](monitor-cache.md). For a full list of the metric definitions that form these insights, see [Supported metrics for Microsoft.Cache/redis](monitor-cache-reference.md#supported-metrics-for-microsoftcacheredis).

## View insights from Azure Monitor

You can access Azure Cache for Redis insights from the **Insights Hub** of Azure Monitor.

To view the utilization and performance of your Azure Cache for Redis instances across all of your subscriptions, do the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Search for **Monitor**, and select **Monitor**.

    :::image type="content" source="~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/media/cosmos-db/search-monitor.png" alt-text="Search box with the word 'Monitor' and the Services search result that shows 'Monitor' with a speedometer symbol":::

1. Select **Azure Cache for Redis**. If this option isn't present, select **More** > **Azure Cache for Redis**.

## Workbooks

Azure Cache for Redis insights are based on the [workbooks feature of Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview) that provides rich visualizations for metrics and other data. Azure Cache for Redis insights provides two workbooks by default:

   :::image type="content" source="media/cache-how-to-monitor/cache-monitoring-workbook.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the workbooks selected in the Resource menu.":::

- **Azure Cache For Redis Resource Overview** combines many of the most commonly used metrics so that the health and performance of the cache instance can be viewed at a glance.
    :::image type="content" source="media/cache-how-to-monitor/cache-monitoring-resource-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of graphs showing a resource overview for the cache.":::

- **Geo-Replication Dashboard** pulls geo-replication health and status metrics from both the geo-primary and geo-secondary cache instances to give a complete picture of geo-replication health. Using this dashboard is recommended, as some geo-replication metrics are only emitted from either the geo-primary or geo-secondary.
    :::image type="content" source="media/cache-how-to-monitor/cache-monitoring-geo-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the geo-replication dashboard with a geo-primary and geo-secondary cache set.":::

### Overview

On **Overview**, the table displays interactive Azure Cache for Redis metrics. You can filter the results based on the options you select from the following drop-down lists:

- **Subscriptions**: Only subscriptions that have an Azure Cache for Redis resource are listed.  

- **Azure Cache for Redis**: You can select all, a subset, or a single Azure Cache for Redis resource.

- **Time Range**: By default, the table displays the last four hours of information based on the corresponding selections.

There's a counter tile under the drop-down lists. The tile shows the total number of Azure Cache for Redis resources in the selected subscriptions. Conditional color codes or heat maps for workbook columns report transaction metrics. The deepest color represents the highest value. Lighter colors represent lower values.

Selecting a drop-down list arrow next to one of the Azure Cache for Redis resources reveals a breakdown of the performance metrics at the individual resource level.

:::image type="content" source="./media/cache-insights-overview/overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the overview experience.":::

When you select the Azure Cache for Redis resource name highlighted in blue, you see the default **Overview** table for the associated account. It shows these columns:

- **Used Memory**
- **Used Memory Percentage**
- **Server Load**
- **Server Load Timeline**
- **CPU**
- **Connected Clients**
- **Cache Misses**
- **Errors (Max)**

### Operations

When you select **Operations** at the top of the page, the **Operations** table of the workbook template opens. It shows these columns:

- **Total Operations**
- **Total Operations Timeline**
- **Operations Per Second**
- **Gets**
- **Sets**

:::image type="content" source="./media/cache-insights-overview/operations.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the operations experience.":::

### Usage

When you select **Usage** at the top of the page, the **Usage** table of the workbook template opens. It shows these columns:

- **Cache Read**
- **Cache Read Timeline**
- **Cache Write**
- **Cache Hits**
- **Cache Misses**

:::image type="content" source="./media/cache-insights-overview/usage.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the usage experience.":::

### Failures

When you select **Failures** at the top of the page, the **Failures** table of the workbook template opens. It shows these columns:

- **Total Errors**
- **Failover/Errors**
- **UnresponsiveClient/Errors**
- **RDB/Errors**
- **AOF/Errors**
- **Export/Errors**
- **Dataloss/Errors**
- **Import/Errors**

## View insights from an Azure Cache for Redis resource

To access Azure Monitor for Azure Cache for Redis directly from an individual resource:

1. In the Azure portal, select Azure Cache for Redis.

2. From the list, choose an individual Azure Cache for Redis resource. In the monitoring section, choose Insights.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/cache-insights-overview/insights.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Menu options with the words 'Insights' highlighted in a red box.":::

These views are also accessible by selecting the resource name of an Azure Cache for Redis resource from the Azure Monitor level workbook.

### Resource-level overview

On the **Overview** workbook for the Azure Redis Cache, it shows several performance metrics that give you access to:

- Interactive performance charts showing the most essential details related to Azure Cache for Redis performance.

- Metrics and status tiles highlighting shard performance, total number of connected clients, and overall latency.

:::image type="content" source="./media/cache-insights-overview/resource-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Insight overview dashboard displaying information such as Server load, CPU performance, used memory, connected clients, errors, expired keys, and evicted keys.":::

Selecting any of the other tabs for **Performance** or **Operations** opens that workbooks.

### Resource-level performance

## Pin, export, and expand

To pin any metric section to an [Azure dashboard](/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards), select the pushpin symbol in the section's upper right.

:::image type="content" source="~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/media/cosmos-db/pin.png" alt-text="Screenshot of metrics with the pushpin symbol highlighted.":::

To export your data into an Excel format, select the down arrow symbol to the left of the pushpin symbol.

:::image type="content" source="~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/media/cosmos-db/export.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a highlighted export-workbook symbol.":::

To expand or collapse all views in a workbook, select the expand symbol to the left of the export symbol.

:::image type="content" source="~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/media/cosmos-db/expand.png" alt-text="Screenshot of  highlighted expand-workbook symbol.":::

## Customize Azure Monitor insights for Azure Cache for Redis

Because this experience is built atop Azure Monitor workbook templates, you can select **Customize** > **Edit** > **Save** to save a copy of your modified version into a custom workbook.

:::image type="content" source="~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/media/cosmos-db/customize.png" alt-text="Screenshot of command bar with customize highlighted.":::

Workbooks are saved within a resource group in either the **My Reports** section or the **Shared Reports** section. **My Reports** is available only to you. **Shared Reports** is available to everyone with access to the resource group.

After you save a custom workbook, go to the workbook gallery to open it.
