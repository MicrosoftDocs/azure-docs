# Get started using Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise or Azure Managed Redis (preview) active replication with an AKS-hosted application

In this tutorial, you will host an inventory application on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and find out how you can use active geo-replication to replicate data in your Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise or Azure Managed Redis (preview) instances across Azure regions.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- One Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster - For more information on creating a cluster, see [Quickstart: Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using the Azure portal](/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). Alternatively, you can host two instances of the demo application on the two different AKS clusters. In a production environment, you would use two different clusters located in the same regions as your clusters to deploy two versions of the application. For this tutorial, you deploy both instances of the application on the same AKS cluster.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with basic Kubernetes concepts like containers, pods and service.

## Overview

This tutorial uses a sample inventory page that shows three different T-shirt options. The user can "purchase" each T-shirt and see the inventory drop. The unique thing about this demo is that we run the inventory app in two different regions. Typically, you would have to run the database storing inventory data in a single region so that there are no consistency issues. With other database backends and synchronization, customers might have unpleasant experience due to higher latency for calls across different Azure regions. When you use Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise as the backend, you can link two caches together with active geo-replication so that the inventory remains consistent across both regions while enjoying low latency performance from Redis Enterprise in the same region.

## Set up two Azure Redis instances

1. Create a new Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise or Azure Managed Redis (preview) instance in **West US 2** region by using the Azure portal or your preferred CLI tool. Alternately, you can use any region of your choice. Use the [quickstart guide](quickstart-create-redis-enterprise.md) to get started.

1. On the **Advanced** tab:

   1. Enable **Non-TLS access only**.
   1. Set **Clustering Policy** to **Enterprise**
   1. Configure a new active geo-replication group using [this guide](cache-how-to-active-geo-replication.md). Eventually, you add both caches to the same replication group. Create the group name with the first cache, and add the second cache to the same group.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > This tutorial uses a non-TLS port for demonstration, but we highly recommend that you use a TLS port for anything in production.

1. Set up another Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise in **East US** region with the same configuration as the first cache. Alternatively, you can use any region of your choice. Ensure that you choose the same replication group as the first cache.

## Prepare Kubernetes deployment files

Create two .yml files using the following procedure. One file for each cache you created in the two regions.

To demonstrate data replication across regions, we run two instances of the same application in different regions. Let's make one instance run in Seattle, west namespace, while the second runs in New York, east namespace.

### West namespace

Update the following fields in the following YAML file and save it as _app_west.yaml_.

1. Update the variable `REDIS_HOST` with the **Endpoint value** URL after removing the port suffix: 10000
1. Update `REDIS_PASSWORD` with the  **Access key** of your _West US 2_ cache.
1. Update `APP_LOCATION` to display the region where this application instance is running. For this cache, configure the `APP_LOCATION` to `Seattle` to indicate this application instance is running in Seattle.
1. Verify that the variable `namespace` value is `west` in both places in the file.

It should look like following code:

```YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: shoppingcart-app
  namespace: west
spec:
  replicas: 1 
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: shoppingcart
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: shoppingcart
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: demoapp
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-redis-cache/redisactivereplicationdemo:latest
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "0.5"
            memory: "250Mi"
          requests:
            cpu: "0.5"
            memory: "128Mi"
        env:
         - name: REDIS_HOST
           value: "DemoWest.westus2.redisenterprise.cache.azure.net"
         - name: REDIS_PASSWORD
           value: "myaccesskey"
         - name: REDIS_PORT
           value: "10000"   # redis enterprise port
         - name: HTTP_PORT
           value: "8080"
         - name: APP_LOCATION
           value: "Seattle, WA" 
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: shoppingcart-svc
  namespace: west
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: shoppingcart
```

### East namespace

Save another copy of the same YAML file as _app_east.yaml_. This time, use the values that correspond with your second cache.

 1. Update the variable `REDIS_HOST` with the **Endpoint value** after removing the port suffix: 10000
 1. Update `REDIS_PASSWORD` with the  **Access key** of your _East US_ cache.
 1. Update `APP_LOCATION` to display the region where this application instance is running. For this cache, configure the `APP_LOCATION` to _New York_ to indicate this application instance is running in New York.
 1. Verify that the variable `namespace` value is `east` in both places in the file.

It should look like following code:

```YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: shoppingcart-app
  namespace: east
spec:
  replicas: 1 
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: shoppingcart
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: shoppingcart
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: demoapp
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-redis-cache/redisactivereplicationdemo:latest
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "0.5"
            memory: "250Mi"
          requests:
            cpu: "0.5"
            memory: "128Mi"
        env:
         - name: REDIS_HOST
           value: "DemoEast.eastus.redisenterprise.cache.azure.net"
         - name: REDIS_PASSWORD
           value: "myaccesskey"
         - name: REDIS_PORT
           value: "10000"   # redis enterprise port
         - name: HTTP_PORT
           value: "8080"
         - name: APP_LOCATION
           value: "New York, NY" 
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: shoppingcart-svc
  namespace: east
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: shoppingcart
```

## Install Kubernetes CLI and connect to your AKS cluster

In this section, you first install the Kubernetes CLI and then connect to an AKS cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> An Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster is required for this tutorial. You deploy both instances of the application on the same AKS cluster.

### Install the Kubernetes CLI

Use the Kubernetes CLI, _kubectl, to connect to the Kubernetes cluster from your local computer. If you're running locally, then you can use the following command to install kubectl.

```bash
az aks install-cli
```

If you use Azure Cloud Shell, _kubectl_ is already installed, and you can skip this step.

### Connect to your AKS clusters in two regions

Use the portal to copy the resource group and cluster name for your AKS cluster in the West US 2 region. To configure _kubectl_ to connect to your AKS cluster, use the following command with your resource group and cluster name:

```bash
 az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myClusterName
 ```

Verify that you're able to connect to your cluster by running the following command:

```bash

kubectl get nodes
```

You should see similar output showing the list of your cluster nodes.

```output
NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE   VERSION
aks-agentpool-21274953-vmss000001   Ready    agent   1d    v1.24.15
aks-agentpool-21274953-vmss000003   Ready    agent   1d    v1.24.15
aks-agentpool-21274953-vmss000006   Ready    agent   1d    v1.24.15
```

## Deploy and test your application

You need two namespaces for your applications to run on your AKS cluster. Create a west and then deploy the application.

Run the following command to deploy the application instance to your AKS cluster in the _west_ namespace:

```bash
kubectl create namespace west

kubectl apply -f app_west.yaml
```

You get a response indicating your deployment and service was created:

```output
deployment.apps/shoppingcart-app created
service/shoppingcart-svc created
```

To test the application, run the following command to check if the pod is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n west
```

You see your pod running successfully like:

```output
NAME                                READY   STATUS                       RESTARTS   AGE
shoppingcart-app-5fffdcb5cd-48bl5   1/1     Running                      0          68s
```

Run the following command to get the endpoint for your application:

```bash
kubectl get service -n west
```

You might see that the EXTERNAL-IP has status `<pending>` for a few minutes. Keep retrying until the status is replaced by an IP address.

```output
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
shoppingcart-svc       LoadBalancer   10.0.166.147   20.69.136.105   80:30390/TCP   90s
```

Once the External-IP is available, open a web browser to the External-IP address of your service and you see the application.

Run the same deployment steps and deploy an instance of the demo application to run in East US region.

```bash
kubectl create namespace east

kubectl apply -f app_east.yml

kubectl get pods -n east

kubectl get service -n east
```

With each of the two services opened in a browser, you see that changing the inventory in one region is almost instantly reflected in the other region. The inventory data is stored in the Redis Enterprise instances that are replicating data across regions.

You did it! Click on the buttons and explore the demo.

To reset the count, add `/reset` after the url:

 `<IP address>/reset`

## Clean up your deployment

To clean up your cluster, run the following commands:

```bash
kubectl delete deployment shoppingcart-app -n west
kubectl delete service shoppingcart-svc -n west

kubectl delete deployment shoppingcart-app -n east
kubectl delete service shoppingcart-svc -n east
```
