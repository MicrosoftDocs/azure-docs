### Azure Managed Redis (preview)

Azure Managed Redis (preview) is now available to create and use managed caches. Azure Managed Redis runs on the [Redis Enterprise](https://redis.io/technology/advantages/) stack, which offers significant advantages over the community edition of Redis. 

Three tiers are for in-memory data:

- **Memory Optimized** Ideal for memory-intensive use cases that require a high memory-to-vCPU ratio (1:8) but don't need the highest throughput performance. It provides a lower price point for scenarios where less processing power or throughput is necessary, making it an excellent choice for development and testing environments.
- **Balanced (Memory + Compute)** Offers a balanced memory-to-vCPU (1:4) ratio, making it ideal for standard workloads. This tier provides a healthy balance of memory and compute resources. 
- **Compute Optimized** Designed for performance-intensive workloads requiring maximum throughput, with a low memory-to-vCPU (1:2) ratio. It's ideal for applications that demand the highest performance. 

One tier stores data both in-memory and on-disk:

- **Flash Optimized** Enables Redis clusters to automatically move less frequently accessed data from memory (RAM) to NVMe storage. This reduces performance, but allows for cost-effective scaling of caches with large datasets.
