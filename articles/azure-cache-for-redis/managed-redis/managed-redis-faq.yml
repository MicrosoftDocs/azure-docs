  - name: Redis licensing change
    questions:
      - question: What changes were made to Redis licensing?
        answer: |
          The Redis open-source project changed to a dual-license model with support for the Redis Source Available License version 2 (RSALv2) or Server-Side Public License version 1 (SSPLv1). For more information, see the [Redis press release](https://aka.ms/redis/licensingchangepressrelease). Also see the [Microsoft blog post on the Redis licensing change](https://aka.ms/redis/licensechangeblog).  

      - question: Is Azure Managed Redis now also covered by the RSALv2 and SSPLv1 licenses?  
        answer: |
          No, Azure Managed Redis is offered to customers under the Microsoft terms of service. The RSALv2 and SSPLv1 licenses don't apply to your use of Azure Managed Redis. 

      - question: Will my Azure Managed Redis instance continue to receive patches and bug fixes?

      - question: What do I need to do as an Azure Managed Redis customer in response to this licensing announcement?
