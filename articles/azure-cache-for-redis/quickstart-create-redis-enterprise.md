#Customer intent: As a Redis Enterprise developer who is new to Azure Cache for Redis, I want to create a new cache in the Enterprise tier of Azure Cache for Redis.

# Quickstart: Create a Redis Enterprise cache

The Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise tiers provide fully integrated and managed [Redis Enterprise](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise/) on Azure. The Enterprise tiers are:

- Enterprise, which uses volatile memory (DRAM) on a virtual machine to store data.
- Enterprise Flash, which uses both volatile and nonvolatile memory (NVMe or SSD) to store data.

Both Enterprise and Enterprise Flash tiers support open-source Redis 6 and some new features that aren't available in Basic, Standard, or Premium tiers. The supported features include Redis modules that enable search, bloom filters, and time series.

## Prerequisites

- You need an Azure subscription before you begin. If you don't have one, create an [account](https://azure.microsoft.com/). For more information, see [Special considerations for Enterprise tiers](cache-overview.md#special-considerations-for-enterprise-tiers).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following Enterprise settings can be enabled or configured only at cache creation time. Gather the information you need to configure these settings before you create your cache.
> 
> - You must enable Enterprise modules at the time you create the cache instance. You can't change modules or enable module configuration after you create a cache.
> - Redis Enterprise supports two clustering policies, **Enterprise** or **OSS**. Know which policy you need before you create your cache. You can't change the clustering policy of an Enterprise cache after you create it.
> - If you're using the cache in a geo-replication group, you can't change eviction policies after the cache is created. Be sure to know the eviction policies of your primary nodes before you create the cache.

### Availability by region

Azure Cache for Redis is continually expanding into new regions. To check the availability by region for all tiers, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=redis-cache&regions=all).

## Create an Enterprise cache

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for and select **Azure Cache for Redis**.
1. On the **Azure Cache for Redis** page, select **Create** > **Redis Enterprise**.
1. On the **Basics** tab of the **New Redis Cache** page, configure the following settings:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription to use.
   - **Resource group**: Select a resource group, or select **Create new** and enter a new resource group name. Putting all your app resources in the same resource group lets you easily manage or delete them together.
   - **Name**: Enter a cache name that's unique in the region. The name must:
     - Be a string of 1 to 63 characters when combined with the cache's region name.
     - Contain only numbers, letters, and hyphens.
     - Start and end with a number or letter.
     - Not contain consecutive hyphens.
   - **Region**: Select an [Azure region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) near other services that use your cache. Enterprise tiers are available in selected Azure regions.
   - **Cache SKU**: Select **Enterprise** or **Enterprise Flash** SKU to determine the available sizes, performance, and features for your cache.
   - **Cache size**: Select a cache size.

1. Select the **Terms** checkbox.

1. Select the **Networking** tab, or select **Next: Networking**.
1. On the **Networking** tab, select a connectivity method to use for the cache. **Private Endpoint** is recommended for security. If you select **Private Endpoint**, select **Add private endpoint** and create the private endpoint.
1. Select the **Advanced** tab, or select **Next: Advanced**.
1. On the **Advanced** tab, configure the following options:
   - **Modules**: Select the Redis modules you want to use.
   - **Zone redundancy**: Select whether to enable zone redundancy (recommended).
   - **Non-TLS access only**: Choose whether to **Enable** the non-TLS port and connect to the new cache without using Transport Layer Security (TLS). However, disabling TLS isn't recommended.
   - **Eviction Policy**: Select an eviction policy.
   - **Capacity**: Set the total number of virtual machines running for the cache.
   - **Clustering Policy**: Set to **Enterprise** to use the Redis API, or to **OSS** to use the OSS Cluster API.
1. Under **(PREVIEW) Data Persistence**, choose whether to enable **Redis Database (RDB)**, **Append-only file (AOF)**, or no data persistence for your cache.
1. Under **Active geo-replication**, if your SKU supports it, select **Configure** to configure active-active geo-replication for your cache.
1. Under **Customer-managed key encryption at rest**, choose whether to use your own key to encrypt the disk's data. Otherwise, Microsoft-managed keys are used.

   >

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you're using the [RediSearch](../redis/redis-modules.md#redisearch) module, the **Enterprise** cluster policy is required, and **No Eviction** is the only eviction policy supported.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Azure Redis Enterprise and Enterprise Flash tiers are inherently clustered, in contrast to Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers. Redis Enterprise supports two clustering policies, **Enterprise** and **OSS**. Use **Enterprise** to access your cache using the Redis API, or **OSS** to use the OSS Cluster API. You can't change the clustering policy of an Enterprise cache after you create it. For more information, see [Clustering](../redis/architecture.md#clustering).

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  If you're using this cache in a geo-replication group, you can't change eviction policies after the cache is created. Be sure to know the eviction policies of your primary nodes before you create the cache. For more information on active geo-replication, see [Active geo-replication prerequisites](cache-how-to-active-geo-replication.md#active-geo-replication-prerequisites).

1. Optionally, select the **Tags** tab or select **Next: Tags**, and enter tag names and values if you want to categorize your cache resources.

1. Select **Review + create**, and once validation passes, select **Create**.

It takes some time for the cache to create. You can monitor deployment progress on the portal Azure Cache for Redis page. When the cache **Status** displays **Running**, the cache is ready to use.
