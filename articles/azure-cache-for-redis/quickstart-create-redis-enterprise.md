#Customer intent: As a Redis Enterprise developer who is new to Azure Cache for Redis, I want to create a new cache in the Enterprise tier of Azure Cache for Redis.

# Quickstart: Create a Redis Enterprise cache

The Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise tiers provide fully integrated and managed [Redis Enterprise](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise/) on Azure. These tiers are:

- Enterprise, which uses volatile memory (DRAM) on a virtual machine to store data
- Enterprise Flash, which uses both volatile and nonvolatile memory (NVMe or SSD) to store data.

Both Enterprise and Enterprise Flash support open-source Redis 6 and some new features that aren't yet available in the Basic, Standard, or Premium tiers. The supported features include some Redis modules that enable other features like search, bloom filters, and time series.  

## Prerequisites

- You need an Azure subscription before you begin. If you don't have one, create an [account](https://azure.microsoft.com/). For more information, see [special considerations for Enterprise tiers](cache-overview.md#special-considerations-for-enterprise-tiers).

### Availability by region

Azure Cache for Redis is continually expanding into new regions. To check the availability by region for all tiers, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=redis-cache&regions=all).

## Create a cache

1. To create a cache, sign in to the Azure portal and select **Create a resource**.

1. On the **New** page, select **Databases** and then select **Azure Cache for Redis**.

1. On the **New Redis Cache** page, configure the settings for your new cache.

   | Setting      |  Choose a value  | Description |
   | ------------ |  ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Subscription** | Drop down and select your subscription. | The subscription under which to create this new Azure Cache for Redis instance. |
   | **Resource group** | Drop down and select a resource group, or select **Create new** and enter a new resource group name. | Name for the resource group in which to create your cache and other resources. By putting all your app resources in one resource group, you can easily manage or delete them together. |
   | **DNS name** | Enter a name that is unique in the region. | The cache name must be a string between 1 and 63 characters when _combined with the cache's region name_ that contain only numbers, letters, or hyphens. (If the cache name is fewer than 45 characters long it should work in all currently available regions.) The name must start and end with a number or letter, and can't contain consecutive hyphens. Your cache instance's _host name_ is `\<DNS name\>.\<Azure region\>.redisenterprise.cache.azure.net`. |
   | **Location** | Drop down and select a location. | Enterprise tiers are available in selected Azure regions. |
   | **Cache type** | Drop down and select an _Enterprise_ or _Enterprise Flash_ tier and a size. |  The tier determines the size, performance, and features that are available for the cache. |

1. Select **Next: Networking** and skip.

1. Select **Next: Advanced**.

   Enable **Non-TLS access only** if you plan to connect to the new cache without using TLS. Disabling TLS is **not** recommended, however. 

   Set **Clustering policy** to **Enterprise** for a nonclustered cache, or to **OSS** for a clustered cache. For more information on choosing **Clustering policy**, see [Clustering](managed-redis/managed-redis-architecture.md#clustering).

     :::image type="content" source="media/cache-create/cache-clustering-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Enterprise tier Advanced tab.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > Enterprise and Enterprise Flash tiers are inherently clustered, in contrast to the Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers. Redis Enterprise supports two clustering policies.
   >- Use the **Enterprise** policy to access your cache using the Redis API.
   >- Use **OSS** to use the OSS Cluster API..
   >

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > You can't change the clustering policy of an Enterprise cache instance after you create it. If you're using [RediSearch](cache-redis-modules.md#redisearch), the Enterprise cluster policy is required, and `NoEviction` is the only eviction policy supported. 
   >

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  If you're using this cache instance in a geo-replication group, eviction policies cannot be changed after the instance is created. Be sure to know the eviction policies of your primary nodes before you create the cache. For more information on active geo-replication, see [Active geo-replication prerequisites](cache-how-to-active-geo-replication.md#active-geo-replication-prerequisites).
   >
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > You can't change modules after you create a cache instance. Modules must be enabled at the time you create an Azure Cache for Redis instance. There is no option to enable the configuration of a module after you create a cache.
   >

1. Select **Next: Tags** and skip.

1. Select **Next: Review + create**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/cache-create/enterprise-tier-summary.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Enterprise tier Review + Create tab.":::

1. Review the settings and select **Create**.

   It takes some time for the cache to create. You can monitor progress on the Azure Cache for Redis **Overview** page. When **Status** shows as **Running**, the cache is ready to use.
