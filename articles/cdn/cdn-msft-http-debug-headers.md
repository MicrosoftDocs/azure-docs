# Debug HTTP header for Azure CDN from Microsoft

[!INCLUDE [Azure CDN from Microsoft (classic) retirement notice](../../includes/cdn-classic-retirement.md)]

The debug response header, `X-Cache`, provides details as to what layer of the CDN stack the content was served from. This header is specific to Azure CDN from Microsoft.

### Response header format

Header | Description
-------|------------
X-Cache: TCP_HIT | This header is returned when the content is served from the CDN edge cache.
X-Cache: TCP_REMOTE_HIT | This header is returned when the content is served from the CDN regional cache (Origin shield layer)
X-Cache: TCP_MISS | This header is returned when there's a cache miss, and the content is served from the Origin.
X-Cache: PRIVATE_NOSTORE | This header is returned when the request can't be cached as Cache-Control response header is set to either private or no-store.
X-Cache: CONFIG_NOCACHE | This header is returned when the request is configured not to cache in the CDN profile.
X-Cache: N/A | This header is returned when a request gets denied by Signed URL and Rules Set.
