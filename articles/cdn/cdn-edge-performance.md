# Analyze edge node performance in Microsoft Azure CDN

[!INCLUDE [cdn-premium-feature](../../includes/cdn-premium-feature.md)]

## Overview

Edge performance analytics provides granular information traffic and bandwidth usage for the CDN. This information can then be used to generate trending statistics, which allow you to gain insight on how your assets are being cached and delivered to your clients. Which allows you to form a strategy on how to optimize the delivery of your content and to determine what issues should be tackled to better use the CDN. As a result, not only can you be able to improve data delivery performance, but you can reduce your CDN costs.

> [!NOTE]
> All reports use UTC/GMT notation when specifying a date/time.

## Reports and log collection

CDN activity data must be collected with the Edge Performance Analytics module before it can generate reports on it. This collection process occurs once a day and it covers the activity that took place during the previous day. Therefore the report's statistics represent a sample of the day's statistics at the time it was processed, and don't necessarily contain the complete set of data for the current day. The primary function of these reports is to assess performance. They shouldn't be used for billing purposes or exact numeric statistics.

> [!NOTE]
> The raw data from which Edge Performance Analytic reports are generated is available for at least 90 days.

## Dashboard

The Edge Performance Analytics dashboard tracks current and historical CDN traffic through a chart and statistics. Use this dashboard to detect recent and long-term trends on the performance of CDN traffic for your account.

This dashboard consists of:

- An interactive chart that allows the visualization of key metrics and trends.
- A timeline that provides a sense of long term patterns for key metrics and trends.
- Key metrics and statistical information on how our CDN network improves site traffic as measured by overall performance, usage, and efficiency.

### Accessing the edge performance dashboard

1. From the CDN profile page, select the **Manage** button.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/cdn-edge-performance/cdn-manage-btn.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the manage button from an Azure CDN profile.":::

    The CDN management portal opens.
2. Hover over the **Analytics** tab, then hover over the **Edge Performance Analytics** flyout. Select on **Dashboard**.

    The edge node analytics dashboard is displayed.

### Chart

The dashboard contains a chart that tracks a metric over the time period selected in the timeline that appears directly below it. A timeline that graphs up to the last two years of CDN activity is displayed directly below the chart.

#### Using the chart

- By default, the cache efficiency rate for the last 30 days gets charted.
- This chart is generated from data collated on a daily basis.
- Hovering over a day on the line graph indicates a date and the value of the metric on that date.
- Select Highlight Weekends to toggle an overlay of light gray vertical bars that represent weekends onto the chart. This type of overlay is useful for identifying traffic patterns over weekends.
- Select View One Year Ago to toggle an overlay of the previous year's activity over the same time period onto the chart. This type of comparison provides insight into long-term CDN usage patterns. The upper-right hand corner of the chart contains a legend that indicates the color code for each line graph.

#### Updating the chart

- Time Range: Perform one of the following steps:
  - Select the desired region in the timeline. The chart is updated with data that corresponds to the selected time period.
  - Double-click the chart to display all available historical data up to a maximum of two years.
- Metric: Select the chart icon that appears next to the desired metric. The chart and the timeline get refreshed with data for the corresponding metric.

### Key metrics and statistics

#### Efficiency metrics

The purpose of these metrics is to see whether cache efficiency can be improved. The main benefits derived from cache efficiency are:

- Reduced load on the origin server, which might lead to:
  - Better web server performance.
  - Reduced operational costs.
- Improved data delivery acceleration since more requests gets served directly from the CDN.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Cache Efficiency |Indicates the percentage of data transferred that was served from cache. This metric measures when a cached version of the requested content was served directly from the CDN (edge servers) to requesters (for example, web browser) |
| Hit Rate |Indicates the percentage of requests that were served from cache. This metric measures when a cached version of the requested content was served directly from the CDN (edge servers) to requesters (for example, web browser). |
| % of Remote Bytes - No Cache Config |Indicates the percentage of traffic that was served from origin servers to the CDN (edge servers) that doesn't get cached as a result of the Bypass Cache feature (HTTP Rules Engine). |
| % of Remote Bytes - Expired Cache |Indicates the percentage of traffic that was served from origin servers to the CDN (edge servers) as a result of stale content revalidation. |

#### Usage metrics

The purpose of these metrics is to provide insight into the following cost-cutting measures:

- Minimizing operational costs through the CDN.
- Reducing CDN expenditures through cache efficiency and compression.

> [!NOTE]
> Traffic volume numbers represent traffic that was used in calculations of ratios and percentages, and may only show a portion of the total traffic for high-volume customers.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Ave Bytes Out |Indicates the average number of bytes transferred for each request served from the CDN (edge servers) to the requester (for example, web browser). |
| No Cache Config Byte Rate |Indicates the percentage of traffic served from the CDN (edge servers) to the requester (for example, web browser) that doesn't get cached due to the Bypass Cache feature. |
| Compressed Byte Rate |Indicates the percentage of traffic sent from the CDN (edge servers) to requesters (for example, web browser) in a compressed format. |
| Bytes Out |Indicates the amount of data, in bytes that were delivered from the CDN (edge servers) to the requester (for example, web browser). |
| Bytes In |Indicates the amount of data, in bytes, sent from requesters (for example, web browser) to the CDN (edge servers). |
| Bytes Remote |Indicates the amount of data, in bytes, sent from CDN and customer origin servers to the CDN (edge servers). |

#### Performance Metrics

The purpose of these metrics is to track overall CDN performance for your traffic.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Transfer Rate |Indicates the average rate at which content was transferred from the CDN to a requester. |
| Duration |Indicates the average time, in milliseconds, it took to deliver an asset to a requester (for example, web browser). |
| Compressed Request Rate |Indicates the percentage of hits that were delivered from the CDN (edge servers) to the requester (for example, web browser) in a compressed format. |
| 4xx Error Rate |Indicates the percentage of hits that generated a 4xx status code. |
| 5xx Error Rate |Indicates the percentage of hits that generated a 5xx status code. |
| Hits |Indicates the number of requests for CDN content. |

#### Secure Traffic Metrics

The purpose of these metrics is to track CDN performance for HTTPS traffic.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Secure Cache Efficiency |Indicates the percentage of data transferred for HTTPS requests that were served from cache. This metric measures when a cached version of the requested content was served directly from the CDN (edge servers) to requesters (for example, web browser) over HTTPS. |
| Secure Transfer Rate |Indicates the average rate at which content was transferred from the CDN (edge servers) to requesters (for example, web servers) over HTTPS. |
| Average Secure Duration |Indicates the average time, in milliseconds, it took to deliver an asset to a requester (for example, web browser) over HTTPS. |
| Secure Hits |Indicates the number of HTTPS requests for CDN content. |
| Secure Bytes Out |Indicates the amount of HTTPS traffic, in bytes that were delivered from the CDN (edge servers) to the requester (for example, web browser). |

## Reports

Each report in this module contains a chart and statistics on bandwidth and traffic usage for different types of metrics. For example, HTTP status codes, cache status codes, request URL, and so on. This information might be used to delve deeper into how content is being served to your clients and to fine-tune CDN behavior to improve data delivery performance.
