# Securing Azure Content Delivery Network assets with token authentication

[!INCLUDE [cdn-premium-feature](../../includes/cdn-premium-feature.md)]

## Overview

Token authentication is a mechanism that allows you to prevent the Azure content delivery network from serving assets to unauthorized clients. Token authentication is typically done to prevent *hotlinking* of content, in which a different website, such as a message board, uses your assets without permission. Hotlinking can have an effect on your content delivery costs. When you enable token authentication on content delivery network, requests get authenticated by content delivery network edge server before the content delivery network delivers the content.

## How it works

Token authentication verifies that requests get generated by a trusted site by requiring requests to contain a token value that holds encoded information about the requester. Content is served to a requester only if the encoded information meets the requirements; otherwise, requests are denied. You can set up the requirements by using one or more of the following parameters:

- Country/Region: Allow or deny requests that originate from the countries/regions specified by their [country/region code](/previous-versions/azure/mt761717(v=azure.100)).
- URL: Allow only requests that match the specified asset or path.
- Host: Allow or deny requests that use the specified hosts in the request header.
- Referrer: Allow or deny request from the specified referrer.
- IP address: Allow only requests that originated from specific IP address or IP subnet.
- Protocol: Allow or deny requests based on the protocol used to request the content.
- Expiration time: Assign a date and time period to ensure that a link remains valid only for a limited time period.

For more information, see the detailed configuration examples for each parameter in [Setting up token authentication](#setting-up-token-authentication).

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If token authorization is enabled for any path on this account, standard-cache mode is the only mode that can be used for query string caching. For more information, see [Control Azure Content Delivery Network caching behavior with query strings](cdn-query-string-premium.md).

## Reference architecture

The following workflow diagram describes how the content delivery network uses token authentication to work with your web app.

## Token validation logic on content delivery network endpoint

The following flowchart describes how Azure Content Delivery Network validates a client request when token authentication is configured on content delivery network endpoint.

## Setting up token authentication

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), browse to your content delivery network profile, then select **Manage** to launch the supplemental portal.

    ![Screenshot of the content delivery network profile manage button.](./media/cdn-token-auth/cdn-manage-btn.png)

2. Hover over **HTTP Large**, then select **Token Auth** in the flyout. You can then set up the encryption key and encryption parameters as follows:

   1. Create one or more encryption keys. An encryption key is case-sensitive and can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters. Any other types of characters, including spaces, aren't allowed. The maximum length is 250 characters. To ensure that your encryption keys are random, it's recommended that you create them by using the [OpenSSL tool](https://www.openssl.org/).

      The OpenSSL tool has the following syntax:

      `rand -hex <key length>`

      For example:

      `OpenSSL> rand -hex 32`

      To avoid downtime, create both a primary and a backup key. A backup key provides uninterrupted access to your content when your primary key is being updated.

   2. Enter a unique encryption key in the **Primary Key** box and optionally enter a backup key in the **Backup Key** box.

   3. Select the minimum encryption version for each key from its **Minimum Encryption Version** list, then select **Update**:
      - **V2:** Indicates that the key can be used to generate version 2.0 and 3.0 tokens. Use this option only if you're transitioning from a legacy version 2.0 encryption key to a version 3.0 key.
      - **V3:** (Recommended) Indicates that the key can only be used to generate version 3.0 tokens.

   4. Use the encrypt tool to set up encryption parameters and generate a token. With the encrypt tool, you can allow or deny requests based on expiration time, country/region, referrer, protocol, and client IP (in any combination). Although there's no limit to the number and combination of parameters that can be combined to form a token, the total length of a token is limited to 512 characters.

      Enter values for one or more of the following encryption parameters in the **Encrypt Tool** section:

      >    <td>Assigns an expiration time to a token, after which the token expires. Requests submitted after the expiration time are denied. This parameter uses a Unix timestamp, which is based on the number of seconds since the standard Unix epoch of `1/1/1970 00:00:00 GMT`. (You can use online tools to convert between standard time and Unix time.)
      >
      >    For example, if you want the token to expire at `12/31/2016 12:00:00 GMT`, enter the Unix timestamp value, `1483185600`.

   5. After you have finished entering encryption parameter values, select a key to encrypt (if you've created both a primary and a backup key) from the **Key To Encrypt** list.

   6. Select an encryption version from the **Encryption Version** list: **V2** for version 2 or **V3** for version 3 (recommended).

   7. Select **Encrypt** to generate the token.

      After the token is generated, it's displayed in the **Generated Token** box. To use the token, append it as a query string to the end of the file in your URL path. For example, `http://www.domain.com/content.mov?a4fbc3710fd3449a7c99986b`.

   8. Optionally, test your token with the decrypt tool so that you can view your token's parameters. Paste the token value in the **Token to Decrypt** box. Select the encryption key to use from the **Key To Decrypt** list, then select **Decrypt**.

      After the token is decrypted, its parameters are displayed in the **Original Parameters** box.

   9. Optionally, customize the type of response code that is returned when a request is denied. Select **Enabled**, then select the response code from the **Response Code** list. **Header Name** is automatically set to **Location**. Select **Save** to implement the new response code. For certain response codes, you must also enter the URL of your error page in the **Header Value** box. The **403** response code (Forbidden) is selected by default.

3. Under **HTTP Large**, select **Rules Engine**. You use the rules engine to define paths to apply the feature, enable the token authentication feature, and enable extra token authentication-related capabilities. For more information, see [Rules engine reference](./cdn-verizon-premium-rules-engine-reference.md).

   1. Select an existing rule or create a new rule to define the asset or path for which you want to apply token authentication.
   2. To enable token authentication on a rule, select **[Token Auth](https://docs.vdms.com/cdn/Content/HRE/F/Token-Auth.htm)** from the **Features** list, then select **Enabled**. Select **Update** if you're updating a rule or **Add** if you're creating a rule.

      ![Screenshot of the content delivery network rules engine token authentication enable example.](./media/cdn-token-auth/cdn-rules-engine-enable2.png)

4. In the rules engine, you can also enable more token authentication-related features. To enable any of the following features, select it from the **Features** list, then select **Enabled**.

   - **[Token Auth Denial Code](https://docs.vdms.com/cdn/Content/HRE/F/Token-Auth-Denial-Code.htm):** Determines the type of response that is returned to a user when a request is denied. Rules set here override the response code set in the **Custom Denial Handling** section on the token-based authentication page.

   - **[Token Auth Ignore URL Case](https://docs.vdms.com/cdn/Content/HRE/F/Token-Auth-Ignore-URL-Case.htm):** Determines whether the URL used to validate the token is case-sensitive.

   - **[Token Auth Parameter](https://docs.vdms.com/cdn/Content/HRE/F/Token-Auth-Parameter.htm):** Renames the token auth query string parameter that appears in the requested URL.
