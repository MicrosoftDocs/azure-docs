# China content delivery with Azure Content Delivery Network

Azure Content Delivery Network global can serve content to China users with point of presence (POP) locations near China or any POP that provides the best performance to requests originating from China. However, if China is a significant market for your customers and they need fast performance, consider using Azure Content Delivery Network China instead.

Azure Content Delivery Network China differs from Azure Content Delivery Network global in that it delivers content from POPs inside of China by partnering with many local providers. Due to Chinese compliance and regulation, you must register a separate subscription to use Azure Content Delivery Network China and your websites need to have an ICP license. The portal and API experience to enable and manage content delivery is identical between Azure Content Delivery Network global and Azure Content Delivery Network China.
