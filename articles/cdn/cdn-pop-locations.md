This article lists current metros containing point of presence (POP) locations, sorted by region, for Azure Content Delivery Network products. Each metro might contain more than one POP. For example, Azure Content Delivery Network from Microsoft has 192 POPs across 109 metro cities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each Azure Content Delivery Network product has a distinct way of building its content delivery network infrastructures, hence Microsoft recommends against using POP locations to decide which Azure Content Delivery Network product to use. Instead, you should consider its features and end-user performance. Test the performance with each Azure Content Delivery Network product to choose the right product for your users.
