# Best practices while migrating between content delivery network providers

[!INCLUDE [Azure CDN from Microsoft (classic) retirement notice](../../includes/cdn-classic-retirement.md)]

Content Delivery Network services can provide resiliency and add benefits for different types of workloads. Switching between content delivery network providers is a common practice when your web delivery requirements changes or when a different service is better suited for your business needs.

The purpose of this article is to share best practices when migrating from one content delivery network service to another.

## Pricing comparison

Switching between content delivery network profiles might introduce changes to your content delivery overall cost. For more information about service pricing, see [Azure Front Door pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/frontdoor/) and [Azure content delivery network pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cdn/).

## Guidance for migrating between content delivery network providers

The following guidance is consideration for scoping and tracking your content delivery network migration plans:

### Prepare

Review your existing content delivery network utilizations and network architecture. Including the following guidance:

- Create an inventory of each endpoint, custom domains and their use cases.
- Review your existing endpoint configurations and capture caching, compression rules and other applicable settings, such caching rule and their scenarios.

### Proof of concept

Create a small-scale proof of concept testing environment with your potential replacement content delivery network profile.

- Define success criteria:
    - Cost - does the new content delivery network profile meet your cost requirements?
    - Performance - does the new content delivery network profile meet the performance requirements of your workload?
- Create a new profile.
- Configure your new profile with similar configuration settings as your existing profile.
- Fine tune caching and compression configuration settings to meet your requirements.

### Implement

Once you've completed your proof of concept testing, you can begin the migration process.

- Set up the new content delivery network profile for production by performing validation before the change over.
    - **Staging environment testing:**
        - Test your workload and DNS configuration to see whether it's working properly.
        - Ensure caching is configured correctly. For example, account pages.
    - **A/B environment validation (if allowed):**
        - Configure Traffic Manager to route traffic to the new content delivery network profile and compare performance and caching behavior.
- **CDN service change over:** configure DNS change to point to the new content delivery network CNAME.
- **Post change monitoring:** monitor the content delivery network cache hit rate, origin traffic volume, any abnormal status codes, and top URLs.

> [!TIP]
> Items to verify prior to migrating production workloads
> 1. Verify configuration settings such as cache objects, TTLs and other potential custom settings at the content delivery network profile level are being accommodated.
> 2. Origin application customizations are adjusted:
>    - Update Access Control List (ACL) if one is being used to allow content delivery network egress ranges.
>    - Traffic management tools such as a load balancer have the correct policies and rules for the content delivery network.
> 3. Validate origin workloads and content delivery network caching performance.
>     - Changing between content delivery networks can increase traffic to origin for a period of time until the new provider caches the content.
