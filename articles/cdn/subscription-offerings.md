# Azure CDN subscription offers and bandwidth throttling

[!INCLUDE [Azure CDN from Microsoft (classic) retirement notice](../../includes/cdn-classic-retirement.md)]

Some Azure CDNs offerings are only available to certain subscription types. Bandwidth throttling might also apply depending on your subscription type.

## Free and Trial Subscription

Azure CDN from Microsoft is the only CDN offering that is available to trial subscriptions. Bandwidth throttling is applied for this type of subscription.

## Pay-as-you-go

Bandwidth for Azure CDN from Microsoft gets throttled until the subscription is determined to be in good standing and has a sufficient payment history. The process for determining the subscription status and having throttling removed happens automatically after the first payment has been received.

If you have made a payment and throttling hasn't been removed, you can request to do so by [contacting support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade).

## Enterprise agreements

Azure CDN is available to Enterprise Agreement subscriptions. Enterprise Agreements subscriptions don't have any bandwidth restrictions.

## Other offer types

The same functionality as Pay-as-you-go applies to these types of agreements:

- Visual Studio
- MSDN
- Students
- CSP
