# Analyze Azure CDN usage patterns

[!INCLUDE [Azure CDN from Microsoft (classic) retirement notice](../../includes/cdn-classic-retirement.md)]

After you enable CDN for your application, you can monitor CDN usage, check the health of your delivery, and troubleshoot potential issues. Azure CDN provides these capabilities in the following ways:

## Raw logs for Azure CDN from Microsoft

With a Standard Microsoft profile, you can enable raw logs and select to stream logs to:

- Azure Storage
- Event hubs
- Azure Log Analytics

With Azure Log Analytics you can view monitoring metrics, and set up alerts.

For more information, see [Azure CDN HTTP raw logs](monitoring-and-access-log.md).

## Core analytics via Azure diagnostic logs

Core analytics is available for content delivery network endpoints for all pricing tiers. Azure Diagnostics logs allow core analytics to be exported to Azure Storage, Event Hubs, or Azure Monitor logs. Azure Monitor logs offers a solution with graphs that are user-configurable and customizable. For more information about Azure diagnostic logs, see [Azure diagnostic logs](cdn-azure-diagnostic-logs.md).
