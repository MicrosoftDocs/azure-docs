# HTTP variables for Azure CDN rules engine

[!INCLUDE [Azure CDN from Microsoft (classic) retirement notice](../../includes/cdn-classic-retirement.md)]

HTTP variables provide the means through which you can retrieve HTTP request and response metadata. This metadata can then be used to dynamically alter a request or a response. The use of HTTP variables is restricted to the following rules engine features:

- [Cache-Key Rewrite](https://docs.vdms.com/cdn/Content/HRE/F/Cache-Key-Rewrite.htm)
- [Modify Client Request Header](https://docs.vdms.com/cdn/Content/HRE/F/Modify-Client-Request-Header.htm)
- [Modify Client Response Header](https://docs.vdms.com/cdn/Content/HRE/F/Modify-Client-Response-Header.htm)
- [URL Redirect](https://docs.vdms.com/cdn/Content/HRE/F/URL-Redirect.htm)
- [URL Rewrite](https://docs.vdms.com/cdn/Content/HRE/F/URL-Rewrite.htm)

## Definitions

The following table describes the supported HTTP variables. A blank value is returned when GEO metadata (for example, postal code) is unavailable for a particular request.

## Usage

The following table describes the proper syntax for specifying an HTTP variable.

| Syntax | Example | Description |
| ------ | -------- | ---------- |
| %{&lt;HTTPVariable&gt;} | %{host} | Use this syntax to get the entire value corresponding to the specified &lt;HTTPVariable&gt;. |
| %{&lt;HTTPVariableDelimiter&gt;} | %{host,} | Use this syntax to set the case for the entire value corresponding to the specified  &lt;HTTPVariableDelimiter&gt;. |
| %{&lt;HTTPVariableDelimiterExpression&gt;} | %{host/=^www\.([^\.]+)\.([^\.:]+)/cdn.$2.$3:80} | Use a regular expression for &lt;HTTPVariableDelimiterExpression&gt; to replace, delete, or manipulate an HTTP variable's value. |

HTTP variable names only support alphabetic characters and underscores. Convert unsupported characters to underscores.

## Delimiter reference

A delimiter can be specified after an HTTP variable to achieve any of the following effects:

- Transform the value associated with the variable.

     Example: Convert the entire value to lowercase.

- Delete the value associated with the variable.

- Manipulate the value associated with the variable.

     Example: Use regular expressions to change the value associated with the HTTP variable.

The delimiters are described in the following table.

| Delimiter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| := | Indicates that a default value is assigned to the variable when it's either: <br />- Missing <br />- Set to NULL. |
| :+ | Indicates that a default value is assigned to the variable when a value has been assigned to it. |
| : | Indicates that a substring of the value assigned to the variable is expanded. |
| # | Indicates that the pattern specified after this delimiter should be deleted when it's present at the beginning of the value associated with the variable. |
| % | Indicates that the pattern specified after this delimiter should be deleted when it's present at the end of the value associated with the variable. <br />This definition is only applicable when the % symbol is used as a delimiter. |
| / | Delimits an HTTP variable or a pattern. |
| // | Find and replace all instances of the specified pattern. |
| /= | Find, copy, and rewrite all occurrences of the specified pattern. |
| , | Convert the value associated with the HTTP variable to lowercase. |
| ^ | Convert the value associated with the HTTP variable to uppercase. |
| ,, | Convert all instances of the specified character in the value associated with the HTTP variable to lowercase. |
| ^^ | Convert all instances of the specified character in the value associated with the HTTP variable to uppercase. |

## Exceptions

The following table describes circumstances under which the specified text isn't treated as an HTTP variable.

| Condition | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | --------|
| Escaping % symbol | The percentage symbol can be escaped by using a backslash. <br />The sample value to the right is treated as a literal value and not as an HTTP variable.| \%{host} |
| Unknown variables | An empty string is always returned for unknown variables. | %{unknown_variable} |
| Invalid characters or syntax | Variables that contain invalid characters or syntax are treated as literal values. <br /><br />Example #1: The specified value contains an invalid character (for example, -). <br /><br />Example #2: The specified value contains a double set of curly braces. <br /><br />Example #3: The specified value is missing a closing curly brace.<br /> | Example #1: %{resp_user-agent} <br /><br />Example #2: %{{host}} <br /><br />Example #3: %{host |
| Missing variable name | A NULL value is always returned when a variable isn't specified. | %{} |
| Trailing characters | Characters that trail a variable are treated as literal values. <br />The sample value to the right contains a trailing curly brace that gets treated as a literal value. | %{host}} |

## Setting default header values

A default value can be assigned to a header when it meets any of the following conditions:
- Missing/unset
- Set to NULL.

The following table describes how to define a default value.

| Condition | Syntax | Example | Description |
| --------- | ------ | --------| ----------- |
| Set a header to a default value when it meets any of the following conditions: <br /><br />- Missing Header <br /><br />- Header value is set to NULL.| %{Variable:=Value} | %{http_referrer:=unspecified} | The Referrer header is set to *unspecified* only when it's either missing or set to NULL. No action takes place if it has been set. |
| Set a header to a default value when it's missing. | %{Variable=Value} | %{http_referrer=unspecified} | The Referrer header is set to *unspecified* only when it's missing. No action takes place if it has been set. |
| Set the header to a default value when it doesn't meet any of the following conditions: <br /><br />- Missing<br /><br /> - Set to NULL. | %{Variable:+Value} | %{http_referrer:+unspecified} | The Referrer header is set to *unspecified* only when a value has been assigned to it. No action takes place if it's either missing or set to NULL. |

## Manipulating variables

Variables can be manipulated in the following ways:

- Expanding substrings
- Removing patterns

### Substring expansion

By default, a variable expands to its full value. Use the following syntax to only expand a substring of the variable's value.

`%<Variable>:<Offset>:<Length>}`

Key information:

- The value assigned to the Offset term determines the starting character of the substring:

     - Positive: The starting character of the substring is calculated from the first character in the string.
     - Zero: The starting character of the substring is the first character in the string.
     - Negative: The starting character of the substring is calculated from the last character in the string.

- The length of the substring gets determined by the *Length* term:

     - Omitted: Omitting the Length term allows the substring to include all characters between the starting character and the end of the string.
     - Positive: Determines the length of the substring from the starting character to the right.
     - Negative: Determines the length of the substring from the starting character to the left.

#### Example:

The following example relies on the following sample request URL:

`HTTPS:\//cdn.mydomain.com/folder/marketing/myconsultant/proposal.html`

The following string demonstrates various methods for manipulating variables:

`HTTPS:\//www%{http_host:3}/mobile/%{request_uri:7:10}/%{request_uri:-5:-8}.htm`

Based on the sample request URL, the above variable manipulation produces the following value:

`HTTPS:\//www.mydomain.com/mobile/marketing/proposal.htm`

### Pattern removal

Text that matches a specific pattern can be removed from either the beginning or the end of a variable's value.

| Syntax | Action |
| ------ | ------ |
| %{Variable#Pattern} | Remove text when the specified pattern is found at the beginning of a variable's value. |
| %{Variable%Pattern} | Remove text when the specified pattern is found at the end of a variable's value. |

#### Example:

In this sample scenario, the *request_uri* variable is set to:

`/800001/myorigin/marketing/product.html?language=en-US`

The following table demonstrates how this syntax works.

| Sample syntax | Results | Description |
| ------------- | ------- | --- |
| %{request_uri#/800001}/customerorigin | /customerorigin/myorigin/marketing/product.html?language=en-US | Because the variable starts with the pattern, it was replaced. |
| %{request_uri%html}htm | /800001/myorigin/marketing/product.html?language=en-US | Because the variable doesn't end with the pattern, there was no change.|

### Find and replace

The find and replace syntax is described in the following table.

| Syntax | Action |
| ------ | ------ |
| %{Variable/Find/Replace} | Find and replace first occurrence of the specified pattern. |
| %{Variable//Find/Replace} | Find and replace all occurrences of the specified pattern. |
| %{Variable^} |Convert the entire value to uppercase. |
| %{Variable^Find} | Convert the first occurrence of the specified pattern to uppercase. |
| %{Variable,} | Convert the entire value to lowercase. |
| %{Variable,Find} | Convert the first occurrence of the specified pattern to lowercase. |

### Find and rewrite

For a variation on find and replace, use the text that matches the specified pattern when rewriting it. The find and rewrite syntax is described in the following table.

| Syntax | Action |
| ------ | ------ |
| %{Variable/=Find/Rewrite} | Find, copy, and rewrite all occurrences of the specified pattern. |
| %{Variable/^Find/Rewrite} | Find, copy, and rewrite the specified pattern when it occurs at the start of the variable. |
| %{Variable/$Find/Rewrite} | Find, copy, and rewrite the specified pattern when it occurs at the end of the variable. |
| %{Variable/Find} | Find and delete all occurrences of the specified pattern. |

Key information:

- Expand text that matches the specified pattern by specifying a dollar sign followed by a whole integer (for example, $1).

- Multiple patterns can be specified. The order in which the pattern is specified determines the integer that is assigned to it. In the following example, the first pattern matches "Www.," the second pattern matches the second-level domain, and the third pattern matches the top-level domain:

    `%{host/=^www\.([^\.]+)\.([^\.:]+)/cdn.$2.$3:80}`

- The rewritten value can consist of any combination of text and these placeholders.

    In the previous example, the hostname is rewritten to `cdn.$2.$3:80` (for example, cdn.mydomain.com:80).

- The case of a pattern placeholder (for example, $1) can be modified through the following flags:
     - U: Uppercase the expanded value.

         Sample syntax:

         `%{host/=^www\.([^\.]+)\.([^\.:]+)/cdn.$U2.$3:80}`

     - L: Lowercase the expanded value.

         Sample syntax:

         `%{host/=^www\.([^\.]+)\.([^\.:]+)/cdn.$L2.$3:80}`

- An operator must be specified before the pattern. The specified operator determines the pattern-capturing behavior:

     - `=`: Indicates that all occurrences of the specified pattern must be captured and rewritten.
     - `^`: Indicates that only text that starts with the specified pattern is captured.
     - `$`: Indicates that only text that ends with the specified pattern is captured.

- If you omit the */Rewrite* value, the text that matches the pattern is deleted.
