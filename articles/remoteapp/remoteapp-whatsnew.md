# What's new in RemoteApp?

One of the advantages of RemoteApp is that we are always working to improve it. Every time we do, we'll announce those changes here.

## May 2015

There have been a number of additions (and months) since we first created this topic, so this list cheats a bit and is from the beginning of March through May. Check out these new features:

- Automate everything - Azure RemoteApp now has [cmdlets in the Azure PowerShell module](remoteapp-tutorial-arawithpowershell.md). 
- [Create an Azure RemoteApp image from an Azure virtual machine](remoteapp-image-on-azurevm.md). Makes uploading your custom image to Azure much quicker.
- Use an Azure VNET instead of a RemoteApp VNET to connect your corporate network resources to Azure. We've updated the [hybrid collection instructions](remoteapp-create-hybrid-deployment.md) to walk you through creating an Azure VNET (it's Step 1).
- Speaking of VNETs, check out [the new guidance](remoteapp-vnetsizing.md) around VNET size limits and limitations.
- And speaking of limits - just what are the [service limits and defaults](remoteapp-servicelimits.md)?

Want to learn more about Azure RemoteApp? The RemoteApp team was out in force at Ignite a few weeks ago. Check out Eric's video, [The Fundamentals of Microsoft Azure RemoteApp Management and Administration](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/2015/BRK3868).

Need to see Azure RemoteApp in the real world? Check out the [Run any app on any device anywhere](remoteapp-anyapp.md) tutorial - it shows you how to share Access with your users, including sharing the database files. We also have a tutorial on [making Office 365](remoteapp-tutorial-o365anywhere.md) run the same on any device.

Thanks for sticking with us - back next month with more updates.
