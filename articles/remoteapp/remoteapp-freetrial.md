# Free 30 day trial of Azure RemoteApp

If you have an Azure subscription, you can try [Azure RemoteApp free for 30 days](https://www.remoteapp.windowsazure.com/en/tour.aspx). To start, simply sign in to the Azure Management Portal, navigate to the Azure RemoteApp node, and then create a collection. This is a great way to test drive the full administrative experience before converting to a paid subscription of Azure RemoteApp.  

While in trial mode, you can create two collections with a 10 user per collection limit. There are no other limitations. You can convert your trial to a paid subscription at any time. After 30 days your collections will go into disabled state if you don’t convert to paid subscription.

>[AZURE.NOTE] The Azure SLA does not apply to collections created in trial mode.
