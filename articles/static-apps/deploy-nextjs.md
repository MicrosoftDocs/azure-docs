# Deploy server-rendered Next.js websites on App Service Static Apps

In this tutorial, you learn to deploy a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) generated static website to [Azure Static Web Apps](overview.md). To begin, you learn to set up, configure, and deploy a Next.js app. During this process, you also learn to deal with common challenges often faced when generating static pages with Next.js

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- A GitHub account. [Create an account for free](https://github.com/join).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

## Set up a Next.js app

Rather than using the Next.js CLI to create an app, you can use a starter repository that includes an existing Next.js app. This repository features a Next.js app with dynamic routes, which highlights a common deployment issue. Dynamic routes need an extra deployment configuration which you will learn more about in a moment.

1. Clone starter repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/christiannwamba/nextjs-static-websites-starter
   ```

1. Navigate to the newly cloned Next.js app:

   ```bash
   cd nextjs-static-websites-starter
   ```

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1. Start Next.js app in development:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

You should see the following website open in your preferred browser:

![Start Next.js app](./media/deploy-nextjs/start-nextjs-app.png)

When you click on a framework/library, you should see a details page about the selected item:

![Details page](./media/deploy-nextjs/start-nextjs-details.png)

## Generate a static website from Next.js build

When you build a Next.js site using `npm run build`, the app is built as a traditional web app, not a static site. To generate a static site, use the following application configuration.

1. To configure static routes, create file named _next.config.js_ at the root of your project.

    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      exportTrailingSlash: true,
      exportPathMap: function() {
        return {
          '/': { page: '/' }
        };
      }
    };
    ```
    
  This configuration maps `/` to the Next.js page that is served for the `/` route, and that is the _pages/index.js_ page file.

1. Update the _package.json_'s build script to also generate a static site after building, using the `next export` command. The `export` command generates a static site.

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "next dev",
      "build": "next build && next export",
    },
    ```

    Now with this command in place, Static Web Apps will run the `build` script every time you push a commit.

1. Generate a static site:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    The static site is generated and copied into an _out_ folder at the root of your working directory.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This folder is listed in the _.gitignore_ file because it should be generated by CI/CD when you deploy.

## Push your static website to GitHub

Azure Static Web Apps deploys your app from a GitHub repository and keeps doing so for every pushed commit to a designated branch. Use the following command to set up a repository.

1. Initialize a git repo

    ```bash
    # Remove existing .git
    rm -rf .git
    # Initialize git
    git init
    # Add all files
    git add .
    # Commit changes
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    ```

1. Create a blank GitHub repo (don't create a README) from [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new) and name it whatever you like for example, **nextjs-static-website**.

1. Add the GitHub repo as a remote to your local repo.
    
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/<YOUR_REPO_NAME>
    ```

1. Push your local repo up to GitHub.

    ```bash
    git push --upstream origin master
    ```

## Deploy your static website

The following steps show how to deploy the app you just pushed to GitHub to Azure Static Web Apps. Once in Azure you can deploy the application to a production environment.

### Create Azure App Service Static App

1. Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click **Create a Resource** then search for **Static Web Apps** and select the matching result.

1. Select a subscription from the *Subscription* dropdown list or use the default one.
1. Click the **New** link below the *Resource group* dropdown. In *New resource group name*, type **nextjsstaticsite** and click **OK**
1. Provide a globally unique name for your app in the **Name** text box. Valid characters include `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, and `-`. This value is used as the URL prefix for your static app in the format of `https://<APP_NAME>.azurestaticapps.net`.
1. In the *Region* drop-down, choose a region closest to you.
1. Select **Free** from the SKU drop-down.

### Add a GitHub repository

The new Static Web Apps account needs access to the repository with your Next.js app so it can automatically deploy commits.

1. Click the **Sign in with GitHub button**
1. Select the **Organization** under which you created the repo for your Next.js project, which may be your GitHub username.
1. Find and select the name of the repository you created earlier.
1. Choose **master** as the branch from the *Branch* drop-down.

### Configure the build process

Azure Static Web Apps is built to automatically carry out common tasks like installing npm modules and running `npm run build` during each deployment. There are, however, a few settings like the application source folder and the build destination folder that you need to configure manually.

1. Click on the **Build** tab to configure the static output folder.

1. Type **out** in the *App artifact location* text box.

### Review and create

1. Click the **Review + Create** button to verify the details are all correct.
1. Click **Create** to start the creation of the resource and also provision a GitHub Action for deployment.
1. Once the deployment is completed, click **Go to resource**
1. On the resource screen, click the *URL* link to open your deployed application. 

## Configure dynamic routes

Navigate to the newly-deployed site and click on one of the framework or library logos. Instead of getting a details page, you get a 404 error page.

![404 on dynamic routes](./media/deploy-nextjs/404-in-production.png)

The reason for this error is because Next.js only generated the home page based on the application configuration.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  exportTrailingSlash: true,
  exportPathMap: function() {
    return {
      '/': { page: '/' }
    };
  }
};
```

## Generate static pages from dynamic routes

1. Update the _next.config.js_ file so that Next.js uses a list of all available data to generate static pages for each framework/library:

  ```javascript
  const data = require('./utils/projectsData');

  module.exports = {
    exportTrailingSlash: true,
    exportPathMap: async function () {
    const { projects } = data;
    const paths = {
      '/': { page: '/' },
    };

    projects.forEach((project) => {
      paths[`/project/${project.slug}`] = {
        page: '/project/[path]',
        query: { path: project.slug },
      };
    });

    return paths;
    },
  };
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > The `exportPathMap` function is an async function, so you can make a request to an API in this function and use the returned list to generate the paths.

1. Push the new changes to your GitHub repository and wait for a few minutes while GitHub Actions builds your site again. After the build is complete, the 404 error disappears.
