# Tutorial: View Azure DDoS Protection logs in Log Analytics workspace

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * view Azure DDoS Protection diagnostic logs including notifications, mitigation reports and mitigation flow logs.

DDoS Protection diagnostic logs provide you with the ability to view DDoS Protection notifications, mitigation reports and mitigation flow logs after a DDoS attack. You can view these logs in your Log Analytics workspace.

Attack mitigation reports use the Netflow protocol data, which is aggregated to provide detailed information about the attack on your resource. Anytime a public IP resource is under attack, the report generation starts as soon as the mitigation starts. There will be an incremental report generated every 5 mins and a post-mitigation report for the whole mitigation period. This is to ensure that in an event the DDoS attack continues for a longer duration of time, you'll be able to view the most current snapshot of mitigation report every 5 minutes and a complete summary once the attack mitigation is over.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [DDoS Network Protection](manage-ddos-protection.md) must be enabled on a virtual network or [DDoS IP Protection](manage-ddos-protection-powershell-ip.md) must be enabled on a public IP address. 
- Configure DDoS Protection diagnostic logs. To learn more, see [Configure diagnostic logs](diagnostic-logging.md).
- Simulate an attack using one of our simulation partners. To learn more, see [Test with simulation partners](test-through-simulations.md).

### View in Log Analytics workspace

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Log Analytics workspace**. Select **Log Analytics workspace** in the search results.
1. Under the **Log Analytics workspaces** blade, select your workspace.
1. On the left-side tab, select **Logs**. Here you see the query explorer. Exit out the *Queries* pane to utilize the *Logs* page.

1. In the *Logs* page, type in your query then hit *Run* to view results.

### Query Azure DDoS Protection logs in log analytics workspace

For more information on log schemas, see [View diagnostic logs](ddos-view-diagnostic-logs.md#example-log-queries).

#### DDoSProtectionNotifications logs

1. Under the **Log analytics workspaces** blade, select your log analytics workspace.


1. On the left side pane, select **Logs**. Here you see the query explorer. 

1. In Query explorer, type in the following Kusto Query and change the time range to Custom and change the time range to last three months. Then hit Run.

    ```kusto
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where Category == "DDoSProtectionNotifications"
    ```

1. To view **DDoSMitigationFlowLogs** change the query to the following and keep the same time range and hit Run.

    ```kusto
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where Category == "DDoSMitigationFlowLogs"
    ```

1. To view **DDoSMitigationReports** change the query to the following and keep the same time range and hit Run.

    ```kusto
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where Category == "DDoSMitigationReports"
    ```

## Example log queries

### DDoS Protection Notifications

Notifications will notify you anytime a public IP resource is under attack, and when attack mitigation is over.

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where Category == "DDoSProtectionNotifications"
```


The following table lists the field names and descriptions:

| Field name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **TimeGenerated** | The date and time in UTC when the notification was created. |
| **ResourceId** | The resource ID of your public IP address. |
| **Category** | For notifications, this will be `DDoSProtectionNotifications`.|
| **ResourceGroup** | The resource group that contains your public IP address and virtual network. |
| **SubscriptionId** | Your DDoS protection plan subscription ID. |
| **Resource** | The name of your public IP address. |
| **ResourceType** | This will always be `PUBLICIPADDRESS`. |
| **OperationName** | For notifications, this is `DDoSProtectionNotifications`.  |
| **Message** | Details of the attack. |
| **Type** | Type of notification. Possible values include `MitigationStarted`. `MitigationStopped`. |
| **PublicIpAddress** | Your public IP address. |

### DDoS Mitigation FlowLogs

Attack mitigation flow logs allow you to review the dropped traffic, forwarded traffic, and other interesting data-points during an active DDoS attack in near-real time. You can ingest the constant stream of this data into Microsoft Sentinel or to your third-party SIEM systems via event hub for near-real time monitoring, take potential actions and address the need of your defense operations.

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where Category == "DDoSMitigationFlowLogs"
```

The following table lists the field names and descriptions:

| Field name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **TimeGenerated** | The date and time in UTC when the flow log was created. |
| **ResourceId** | The resource ID of your public IP address. |
| **Category** | For flow logs, this is `DDoSMitigationFlowLogs`.|
| **ResourceGroup** | The resource group that contains your public IP address and virtual network. |
| **SubscriptionId** | Your DDoS protection plan subscription ID. |
| **Resource** | The name of your public IP address. |
| **ResourceType** | This will always be `PUBLICIPADDRESS`. |
| **OperationName** | For flow logs, this is `DDoSMitigationFlowLogs`. |
| **Message** | Details of the attack. |
| **SourcePublicIpAddress** | The public IP address of the client generating traffic to your public IP address. |
| **SourcePort** | Port number ranging from 0 to 65535. |
| **DestPublicIpAddress** | Your public IP address. |
| **DestPort** | Port number ranging from 0 to 65535. |
| **Protocol** | Type of protocol. Possible values include `tcp`, `udp`, `other`.|
