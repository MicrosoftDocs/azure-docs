> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Configure metrics alerts through Azure Monitor.

DDoS Protection metrics alerts are an important step in alerting your team through Azure portal, email, SMS message, push, or voice notification when an attack is detected.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [DDoS Network Protection](manage-ddos-protection.md) must be enabled on a virtual network or [DDoS IP Protection](manage-ddos-protection-powershell-ip.md) must be enabled on a public IP address. 
- Azure DDoS Protection monitors public IP addresses assigned to resources within a virtual network. If your virtual network doesn't have any resources with public IP addresses, you need to create one first.Â   

## Configure metric alerts through portal

You can configure Azure Monitor to alert you using any available Azure DDoS Protection metrics. This notifies you when there's active mitigation during an attack.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Alerts**. Select **Alerts** in the search results.

1. Select **+ Create** on the navigation bar, then select **Alert rule**.

1. On the **Create an alert rule** page, select **+ Select scope**, then select the following information in the **Select a resource** page.

    | Setting | Value |
    |--|--|
	|Filter by subscription | Select the **Subscription** that contains the public IP address you want to log. |
	|Filter by resource type | Select **Public IP Addresses**.|
    |Resource | Select the specific **Public IP address** you want to log metrics for. |

1. Select **Done**, then select **Next: Condition**.

1. On the **Condition** tab, select **+ Add Condition**, then in the *Select a signal* search box, search, and select **Under DDoS attack or not**.

1. In the **Create an alert rule** page, select the following information. 

    | Setting | Value |
    |--|--|
    | Threshold | Leave as the default *Static*. |
    | Aggregation type | Leave as default *Maximum*. |
    | Operator | Select **Greater than or equal to**. |
    | Unit | Leave as default *Count*. |
    | Threshold value | Enter **1**. For the *Under DDoS attack or not metric*, **0** means you're not under attack while **1** means you are under attack. |
    | Check every | Choose how often the alert rule checks if the condition is met. Leave as default *1 minute*. |
    | Lookback period | This is the lookback period, or the time period to look back at each time the data is checked. For example, every 1 minute you are looking at the past 5 minutes. Leave as default *5 minutes*. |
  

1. Select **Next: Actions** then select **+ Create action group**.

### Create action group

1. In the **Create action group** page, enter the following information, then select **Next: Notifications**.

    | Setting | Value |
    |--|--|
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription that contains the public IP address you want to log. |   
    | Resource Group | Select your Resource group. |
    | Region | Choose these locations for the broadest set of Azure products and long-term capacity growth. |
    | Action Group | Provide an action group name that is unique within the resource group. For this example, enter **myDDoSAlertsActionGroup**. |
    | Display name | This display name is shown as the action group name in email and SMS notifications. For this example, enter **myDDoSAlerts**. |

    
1. On the *Notifications* tab, under *Notification type*, select the notification type you wish to use. For this example, we select **Email/SMS message/Push/Voice**. In the *Name* tab, enter **myUnderAttackEmailAlert**.


1. On the *Email/SMS message/Push/Voice* pane, select the **Email** check box, then enter the required email. Select **OK**.

1. Select **Review + create** and then select **Create**.

> [!NOTE]
> Review the [Action groups](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/action-groups) documentation for more information on creating action groups. 

### Continue configuring alerts through portal

1. In the *Create an alert rule page*, select **Next: Details**. 

1. On the *Details* tab, under *Alert rule details* section, enter the following information. 

    | Setting | Value |
    |--|--|
    | Severity | Select **2 - Warning**. |   
    | Alert rule name | Enter **myDDoSAlert**. |

1. Select **Review + create** and then select **Create** after validation passes.

Within a few minutes of attack detection, you should receive an email from Azure Monitor metrics that looks similar to the following picture:
