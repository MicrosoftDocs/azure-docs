This page is an index of [Azure Policy](../governance/policy/overview.md) built-in policy
definitions for Azure DDoS Protection. For additional Azure Policy built-ins for other services, see
[Azure Policy built-in definitions](/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies).

The name of each built-in policy definition links to the policy definition in the Azure portal. Use
