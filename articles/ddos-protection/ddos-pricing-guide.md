# Compare pricing between Azure DDoS Protection tiers

Azure DDoS Protection has two tiers: Network Protection and IP Protection. The Network Protection tier is available for resources deployed in virtual networks that are enabled for DDoS Protection. The IP Protection tier is available for public IP addresses that are enabled for DDoS Protection. We recommend a cost analysis to understand the pricing differences between the tiers. In this article, we show you how to evaluate cost for your environment.

## Cost assessment

Network Protection cost begins once the DDoS protection plan is created. IP Protection cost begins once the Public IP address is configured with IP Protection, and its associated virtual network isn't protected by a DDoS protection plan. 
For more information, see [Azure DDoS Protection Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ddos-protection/).

When IP Protection is enabled for a public IP resource and a DDoS protection plan is created and enabled on its virtual network, customers are billed for the lower *per Public IP resource* rate. In this case, we'll automatically start billing for Network Protection. 

## Example scenarios

For this section we use the following pricing information:

|  Network Protection | IP Protection | 
|---|---|  
| $29.5 per resource.  | $199 per resource.  |

> [!NOTE]
> Prices shown in this article are examples and are for illustration purposes only. For pricing information according to your region, see the [Pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ddos-protection/)

### Scenario: A virtual network with 10 Public IP addresses

In this example, we compare the cost of Network Protection and IP Protection for a virtual network with 10 Public IP addresses. 

#### Network Protection

Let's assume you have only one subscription in your tenant. If you create a Network Protection plan, the plan includes protection for 100 IP address. That subscription is billed for $2,944 USD per month (29.5 USD x 100 resources). To learn more about different scenarios within DDoS Network Protection, see [Pricing examples](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ddos-protection/#pricing).

#### IP Protection 

Let's take this same scenario and assume you have 10 Public IP addresses. If you enable IP Protection for each Public IP address, you're billed for $1,990 USD per month (199 USD x 10 resources).

Under this scenario, it's more cost effective to enable IP Protection for each Public IP address. For environments with more than 15 Public IP addresses, it's more cost effective to create a Network Protection plan. To calculate your unique pricing scenarios, see the [pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/?service=ddos-protection).

> Network Protection includes valued-added benefits such as DDoS Rapid Protection, WAF Discount, and Cost Protection. For more information, see [Azure DDoS Protection SKU Comparison](ddos-protection-sku-comparison.md).
