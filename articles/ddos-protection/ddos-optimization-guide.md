# DDoS Protection cost optimization principles

When designing your architecture, balance security requirements with financial constraints while maintaining protection against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. For an overview of DDoS protection capabilities, see [DDoS Protection features](ddos-protection-features.md). Key considerations include:

- Do your allocated budgets enable you to meet security and availability goals?
- What's the spending pattern for DDoS protection across your workloads?
- How will you maximize protection investment through better resource selection and utilization?

A cost-optimized DDoS protection strategy isn't always the lowest cost option. You need to balance security effectiveness with financial efficiency. Tactical cost-cutting can create security vulnerabilities. To achieve long-term protection and financial responsibility, create a strategy with [risk-based prioritization](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/principles), continuous monitoring, and repeatable processes.

Start with the recommended approaches and justify the benefits for your security requirements. After you set your strategy, use these principles through regular assessment and optimization cycles. For comprehensive guidance on cost management, see [Azure Cost Management documentation](/azure/cost-management-billing/) and the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).

## Develop protection discipline

Cost optimization for DDoS protection requires understanding your risk profile and aligning protection investments with business priorities. Set up clear governance and accountability for protection decisions. For more on governance frameworks, see [Azure governance documentation](/azure/governance/).

| Recommendation | Benefit |
|---|---|
| **Develop a comprehensive asset inventory** that catalogs all public IP addresses and their business criticality levels. | A complete inventory enables risk-based protection decisions and prevents both over-provisioning expensive protection and leaving critical assets unprotected. You can prioritize protection investments based on actual business impact. |
| **Establish clear accountability** for protection decisions with defined roles for security, operations, and finance teams. | Clear accountability ensures protection decisions consider both security requirements and budget constraints. Collaborative decision-making prevents siloed choices that might compromise security or exceed budgets. |
| **Create realistic budgets** that account for both immediate protection needs and planned growth in public-facing resources. | Proper budgeting enables predictable protection costs and prevents reactive decisions during security incidents. You can plan protection expansion as your infrastructure grows. |
| **Implement [risk assessment frameworks](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/assess-cloud-risks)** that define minimum protection levels and standardized policies for different asset types. | Risk-based frameworks provide structured approaches to evaluate DDoS attack risks while ensuring consistent protection decisions. They help identify critical assets, assess vulnerabilities, and determine appropriate protection measures based on business impact and risk tolerance, preventing both under-protection of critical assets and over-protection of low-risk resources. |

## Choose the right protection model

Azure DDoS Protection offers two pricing models with different cost structures and protection scopes. Choose the model that aligns with your resource distribution and protection requirements. For details on DDoS protection SKUs and pricing, see [Compare DDoS protection SKUs](ddos-protection-overview.md) and [Azure DDoS Protection pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ddos-protection/).

| Recommendation | Benefit |
|---|---|
| **Choose IP Protection** when you need to protect specific critical resources rather than entire virtual networks. | You pay only for protected public IP addresses, avoiding costs for noncritical resources. This targeted approach provides granular cost control and enables protection across multiple virtual networks without per-network charges. To configure IP Protection, see [DDoS IP Protection configuration](manage-ddos-ip-protection-portal.md). |
| **Choose Network Protection** when you have many public IP addresses (typically 10 or more) in a single virtual network that all require protection. | Network Protection offers better value for comprehensive protection scenarios. You get simplified management with automatic protection for new resources and predictable monthly costs per virtual network. To configure Network Protection, see [DDoS IP Protection configuration](manage-ddos-protection.md). |
| **Develop phased protection rollout** plans that prioritize business-critical assets while considering budget constraints and virtual network resource distribution. | This systematic approach ensures immediate protection for essential endpoints while managing costs. You can expand protection based on risk assessment, available budget, and optimize protection models per virtual network to prevent over-spending on low-density networks. |

## Design for architecture efficiency

Optimize your architecture to reduce the number of public IP addresses requiring protection while maintaining security and functionality. Your architectural decisions directly impact protection costs. For architectural guidance, see [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/) and [Azure Architecture Center](/azure/architecture/).

| Recommendation | Benefit |
|---|---|
| **Use network segmentation such as [Azure Private Link](/azure/private-link/) and [virtual network peering](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview)** to separate public-facing and internal resources. | You can focus protection spending on genuinely public-facing resources while using private connectivity for internal communications. This eliminates DDoS protection needs on internal paths, reducing costs while improving security. |
| **Design application architecture** to minimize direct public IP exposure through proper use of [load balancing](/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/load-balancing-overview) and [content delivery networks](/azure/cdn/). | Architectural efficiency reduces the protection scope and associated costs. You can often protect an entire application through a single or few public endpoints rather than exposing multiple services directly. Fewer public IP addresses require protection, directly reducing expenses. Consolidation also improves security by reducing attack surface and simplifies protection management.|

## Optimize resource utilization

Get the most value from your protection investments by using included features and aligning protection with actual usage patterns.

| Recommendation | Benefit |
|---|---|
| **Take advantage of [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/)** integration and built-in telemetry without additional charges for protection monitoring and analysis. | You get maximum value from your protection investment by using included monitoring capabilities. This provides attack visibility and traffic analysis needed for ongoing optimization without additional costs. |
| **Implement [automated scaling](/azure/azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-overview)** for protected resources to match protection coverage with actual demand patterns. | Dynamic scaling ensures you maintain protection during traffic spikes while avoiding over-provisioning during low-demand periods. You align protection expenses with actual business value generated. |

## Monitor and optimize over time

Protection needs change as your infrastructure evolves. Set up continuous monitoring and regular optimization cycles to maintain cost efficiency.

| Recommendation | Benefit |
|---|---|
| **Configure cost alerts** when DDoS protection spending approaches predefined budget thresholds. | Proactive notifications prevent budget overruns and enable timely adjustments to protection strategy. You can respond to cost increases before they impact other initiatives. To create cost alerts, see [Monitor usage and spending with cost alerts in Cost Management](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/cost-mgt-alerts-monitor-usage-spending). |
| **Conduct quarterly reviews** of protected resources and their business criticality to identify optimization opportunities. | Regular reviews ensure protection investments remain aligned with business priorities. You can identify resources that no longer need protection or require upgraded protection based on changing importance. |
| **Monitor attack patterns** and protection effectiveness to optimize coverage decisions. [View alerts in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](ddos-view-alerts-defender-for-cloud.md) and utilize [DDoS Protection logs in Log Analytics workspace](ddos-view-diagnostic-logs.md). | Understanding actual threat patterns enables data-driven protection decisions. You can adjust protection levels based on real attack data rather than theoretical risks. |
| **Track protection return on investment (ROI) and implement lifecycle management** using [cost management best practices](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/cost-analysis-common-uses) to measure value and decommission unnecessary protection. | ROI measurement demonstrates protection value and guides future investment decisions. Regular cleanup of inactive or noncritical resources prevents spending growth that doesn't align with business value while freeing budget for higher-priority resources. |
