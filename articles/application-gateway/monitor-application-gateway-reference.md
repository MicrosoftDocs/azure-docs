For available Web Application Firewall (WAF) metrics, see [Application Gateway WAF v2 metrics](../web-application-firewall/ag/application-gateway-waf-metrics.md#application-gateway-waf-v2-metrics) and [Application Gateway WAF v1 metrics](../web-application-firewall/ag/application-gateway-waf-metrics.md#application-gateway-waf-v1-metrics).

### Timing metrics for Application Gateway v2 SKU

Application Gateway v2 SKU provides many builtâ€‘in timing metrics related to the request and response, which are all measured in milliseconds. What follows is expanded descriptions of the timing metrics already listed in the previous [metrics table](#supported-metrics-for-microsoftnetworkapplicationgateways).

- **Backend connect time**. This value includes the network latency and the time taken by the backend server's TCP stack to establish new connections. For TLS, it also includes the time spent on handshake.
- **Backend first byte response time**. This value approximates the sum of *Backend connect time*, time taken by the request to reach the backend from Application Gateway, time taken by backend application to respond, which is the time the server takes to generate content and potentially fetch database queries, and the time taken by first byte of the response to reach the Application Gateway from the backend.
- **Backend last byte response time**. This value approximates the sum of backend first byte response time and data transfer time. This number varies greatly depending on the size of objects requested and the latency of the server network.
- **Application gateway total time**. This interval is the time from Application Gateway receives the first byte of the HTTP request to the time when the last response byte was sent to the client.
- **Client RTT**. Average round-trip time between clients and Application Gateway.

### Metrics for Application Gateway v2 SKU

For Application Gateway v2 SKU, the following metrics are available. What follows is expanded descriptions of the metrics already listed in the previous [metrics table](#supported-metrics-for-microsoftnetworkapplicationgateways).

- **Bytes received**. This metric accounts for only the Request content size observed by the Application Gateway. It doesn't include data transfers such as TLS header negotiations, TCP/IP packet headers, or retransmissions.
- **Bytes sent**. This metric accounts for only the Response Content size served by the Application Gateway. It doesn't include data transfers such as TCP/IP packet headers or retransmissions.
- **Client TLS protocol**. Count of TLS and non-TLS requests.
- **Current capacity units**. There are three determinants to capacity unit: compute unit, persistent connections, and throughput. Each capacity unit is composed of at most one compute unit, or 2500 persistent connections, or 2.22-Mbps throughput.
- **Current compute units**. Factors affecting compute unit are TLS connections/sec, URL Rewrite computations, and WAF rule processing.
- **Current connections**. The total number of concurrent connections active from clients to the Application Gateway.
- **Estimated Billed Capacity units**. With the v2 SKU, consumption drives the pricing model. Capacity units measure consumption-based cost that is charged in addition to the fixed cost. *Estimated Billed Capacity units indicate the number of capacity units using which the billing is estimated. This amount is calculated as the greater value between *Current capacity units* (capacity units required to load balance the traffic) and *Fixed billable capacity units* (minimum capacity units kept provisioned).
- **Failed Requests**. This value includes the 5xx codes that are generated from the Application Gateway and the 5xx codes that are generated from the backend. The request count can be further filtered to show count per each/specific backend pool-http setting combination.
- **Fixed Billable Capacity Units**. The minimum number of capacity units kept provisioned as per the *Minimum scale units* setting in the Application Gateway configuration. One instance translates to 10 capacity units.
- **New connections per second**. The average number of new TCP connections per second established from clients to the Application Gateway and from the Application Gateway to the backend members.
- **Response Status**. The response status code distribution can be further categorized to show responses in 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx categories.
- **Throughput**. This metric accounts for only the Content size served by the Application Gateway. It doesn't include data transfers such as TLS header negotiations, TCP/IP packet headers, or retransmissions.
- **Total Requests**. Successful requests that Application Gateway served. The request count can be filtered to show count per each/specific backend pool-http setting combination.

### Backend metrics for Application Gateway v2 SKU

For Application Gateway v2 SKU, the following backend metrics are available. What follows is expanded descriptions of the backend metrics already listed in the previous [metrics table](#supported-metrics-for-microsoftnetworkapplicationgateways).

- **Backend response status**. Count of HTTP response status codes returned by the backends, not including any response codes generated by the Application Gateway. The response status code distribution can be categorized to show responses in 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx categories.|
- **Healthy host count**. The number of hosts that are determined healthy by the health probe. You can filter on a per backend pool basis to show the number of healthy hosts in a specific backend pool.
- **Unhealthy host count**. The number of hosts that are determined unhealthy by the health probe. You can filter on a per backend pool basis to show the number of unhealthy hosts in a specific backend pool.
- **Requests per minute per Healthy Host**. The average number of requests received by each healthy member in a backend pool in a minute. Specify the backend pool using the *BackendPool HttpSettings* dimension.

### Metrics for Application Gateway v1 SKU

For Application Gateway v1 SKU, the following metrics are available. What follows is expanded descriptions of the metrics already listed in the previous [metrics table](#supported-metrics-for-microsoftnetworkapplicationgateways).

- **CPU Utilization**. Displays the utilization of the CPUs allocated to the Application Gateway. Under normal conditions, CPU usage shouldn't regularly exceed 90%, because that situation might cause latency in the websites hosted behind the Application Gateway and disrupt the client experience. You can indirectly control or improve CPU utilization by modifying the configuration of the Application Gateway by increasing the instance count or by moving to a larger SKU size, or doing both.

- **Current connections**. Count of current connections established with Application Gateway.

- **Failed Requests**. Number of requests that failed due to connection issues. This count includes requests that failed due to exceeding the "Request time-out" HTTP setting and requests that failed due to connection issues between Application gateway and backend. This count doesn't include failures due to no healthy backend being available. 4xx and 5xx responses from the backend are also not considered as part of this metric.

- **Response Status**. HTTP response status returned by Application Gateway. The response status code distribution can be further categorized to show responses in 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx categories.

- **Throughput**. Number of bytes per second the Application Gateway served.

- **Total Requests**. Count of successful requests that Application Gateway has served. The request count can be further filtered to show count per each/specific backend pool-http setting combination.

### Backend metrics for Application Gateway v1 SKU

For Application Gateway v1 SKU, the following backend metrics are available. What follows is expanded descriptions of the backend metrics already listed in the previous [metrics table](#supported-metrics-for-microsoftnetworkapplicationgateways).

- **Healthy host count**. The number of backends that are determined healthy by the health probe. You can filter on a per backend pool basis to show the number of healthy hosts in a specific backend pool.

- **Unhealthy host count**. The number of backends that are determined unhealthy by the health probe. You can filter on a per backend pool basis to show the number of unhealthy hosts in a specific backend pool.

### Backend health API

See [Application Gateways - Backend Health](/rest/api/application-gateway/application-gateways/backend-health?tabs=HTTP) for details of the API call to retrieve the backend health of an application gateway.

Sample Request:

```http
POST
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/subid/resourceGroups/rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/
applicationGateways/appgw/backendhealth?api-version=2021-08-01
```

After sending this POST request, you should see an HTTP 202 Accepted response. In the response headers, find the Location header and send a new GET request using that URL.

```http
GET
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/subid/providers/Microsoft.Network/locations/region-name/operationResults/GUID?api-version=2021-08-01
```

### TLS/TCP proxy metrics

Application Gateway supports TLS/TCP proxy monitoring. With layer 4 proxy feature now available with Application Gateway, there are some Common metrics that apply to both layer 7 and layer 4. There are some layer 4 specific metrics. The following list summarizes the metrics are the applicable for layer 4 usage.

- Current Connections
- New Connections per second
- Throughput
- Healthy host count
- Unhealthy host count
- Client RTT
- Backend Connect Time
- Backend First Byte Response Time. `BackendHttpSetting` dimension includes both layer 7 and layer 4 backend settings.

For more information, see previous descriptions and the [metrics table](#supported-metrics-for-microsoftnetworkapplicationgateways).

These metrics apply to layer 4 only.

- **Backend Session Duration**. The total time of a backend connection. The average time duration from the start of a new connection to its termination. `BackendHttpSetting` dimension includes both layer 7 and layer 4 backend settings.
- **Connection Lifetime**. The total time of a client connection to application gateway. The average time duration from the start of a new connection to its termination in milliseconds.

### TLS/TCP proxy backend health

Application Gateway's layer 4 proxy provides the capability to monitor the health of individual members of the backend pools through the portal and REST API.

### Supported resource log categories for Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Network/applicationgateways](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/reference/logs/microsoft-network-applicationgateways-logs-include.md)]

- **Access log**. You can use the Access log to view Application Gateway access patterns and analyze important information. This information includes the caller's IP, requested URL, response latency, return code, and bytes in and out. An access log is collected every 60 seconds. This log contains one record per instance of Application Gateway. The `instanceId` property identifies the Application Gateway instance.

- **Firewall log**. You can use the Firewall log to view the requests that are logged through either detection or prevention mode of an application gateway that is configured with the web application firewall. Firewall logs are collected every 60 seconds.

- **Performance log**. You can use the Performance log to view how Application Gateway instances are performing. This log captures performance information for each instance, including total requests served, throughput in bytes, total requests served, failed request count, and healthy and unhealthy backend instance count. A performance log is collected every 60 seconds.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The Performance log is available only for the v1 SKU. For the v2 SKU, use [Metrics](application-gateway-metrics.md) for performance data.

### Access log category

The access log is generated only if you enable it on each Application Gateway instance, as detailed in [Enable logging](application-gateway-diagnostics.md#enable-logging-through-the-azure-portal). The data is stored in the storage account that you specified when you enabled the logging. Each access of Application Gateway is logged in JSON format as shown.

> [!NOTE]
> Latency is calculated from the time when the first byte of the HTTP request is received to the time when the last byte of the HTTP response is sent. It's the sum of the Application Gateway processing time plus the network cost to the back end, plus the time that the back end takes to process the request.

### Azure Monitor Logs and Log Analytics Tables

Azure Application Gateway uses the [Azure Diagnostics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics) table to store resource log information. The following columns are relevant.

| Property | Description |
|:-------- |:------------|
| requestUri_s   | The URI of the client request.|
| Message        | Informational messages such as "SQL Injection Attack"|
| userAgent_s    | User agent details of the client request|
| ruleName_s     | Request routing rule that is used to serve this request|
| httpMethod_s   | HTTP method of the client request|
| instanceId_s   | The Appgw instance to which the client request is routed to for evaluation|
| httpVersion_s  | HTTP version of the client request|
| clientIP_s     | IP from which is request is made|
| host_s         | Host header of the client request|
| requestQuery_s | Query string as part of the client request|
| sslEnabled_s   | Does the client request have SSL enabled|

### TLS/TCP proxy logs

Application Gateway's Layer 4 proxy provides log data through access logs. These logs are only generated and published if they're configured in the diagnostic settings of your gateway. Also see: [Supported categories for Azure Monitor resource logs](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-categories#microsoftnetworkapplicationgateways).

> [!NOTE]
> The columns with Mutual Authentication details for a TLS listener are currently available only through the [AzureDiagnostics table](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics).

| Category | Resource log category |
|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ResourceGroup | The resource group to which the application gateway resource belongs. |
| SubscriptionId | The subscription ID of the application gateway resource. |
| ResourceProvider | This value is MICROSOFT.NETWORK for application gateway. |
| Resource | The name of the application gateway resource. |
| ResourceType | This value is APPLICATIONGATEWAYS. |
| ruleName | The name of the routing rule that served the connection request. |
| instanceId | Application Gateway instance that served the request. |
| clientIP | Originating IP for the request. |
| receivedBytes | Data received from client to gateway, in bytes. |
| sentBytes | Data sent from gateway to client, in bytes. |
| listenerName | The name of the listener that established the frontend connection with client. |
| backendSettingName | The name of the backend setting used for the backend connection. |
| backendPoolName | The name of the backend pool from which a target server was selected to establish the backend connection. |
| protocol | TCP (Irrespective of it being TCP or TLS, the protocol value is always TCP). |
| sessionTime | Session duration, in seconds (this value is for the client->appgw session). |
| upstreamSentBytes | Data sent to backend server, in bytes. |
| upstreamReceivedBytes | Data received from backend server, in bytes. |
| upstreamSessionTime | Session duration, in seconds (this value is for the appgw->backend session). |
| sslCipher | Cipher suite being used for TLS communication (for TLS protocol listeners). |
| sslProtocol | SSL/TLS protocol being used (for TLS protocol listeners). |
| serverRouted | The backend server IP and port number to which the traffic was routed. |
| serverStatus | 200 - session completed successfully. 400 - client data couldn't be parsed. 500 - internal server error. 502 - bad gateway. For example, when an upstream server couldn't be reached. 503 - service unavailable. For example, if access is limited by the number of connections. |
| ResourceId | Application Gateway resource URI. |

- [applicationGateways resource provider operations](/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations#networking)

You can use Azure activity logs to view all operations that are submitted to your Azure subscription, and their status. Activity log entries are collected by default. You can view them in the Azure portal. Azure activity logs were formerly known as *operational logs* and *audit logs*.

Azure generates activity logs by default. The logs are preserved for 90 days in the Azure event logs store. Learn more about these logs by reading the [View events and activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) article.
