# Create an application gateway with external redirection using the Azure CLI

You can use the Azure CLI to configure [web traffic redirection](multiple-site-overview.md) when you create an [application gateway](overview.md). In this tutorial, you configure a listener and rule that redirects web traffic that arrives at the application gateway to an external site.

In this article, you learn how to:

* Set up the network
* Create a listener and redirection rule
* Create an application gateway

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

 - This tutorial requires version 2.0.4 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Create a resource group

A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. Create a resource group using [az group create](/cli/azure/group).

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroupAG* in the *eastus* location.

```azurecli-interactive 
az group create --name myResourceGroupAG --location eastus
```

## Create network resources 

Create the virtual network named *myVNet* and the subnet named *myAGSubnet* using [az network vnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet). Create the public IP address named *myAGPublicIPAddress* using [az network public-ip create](/cli/azure/network/public-ip). These resources are used to provide network connectivity to the application gateway and its associated resources.

```azurecli-interactive
az network vnet create \
  --name myVNet \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --location eastus \
  --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
  --subnet-name myAGSubnet \
  --subnet-prefix 10.0.1.0/24
az network public-ip create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --name myAGPublicIPAddress
```

## Create an application gateway

You can use [az network application-gateway create](/cli/azure/network/application-gateway) to create the application gateway named *myAppGateway*. When you create an application gateway using the Azure CLI, you specify configuration information, such as capacity, sku, and HTTP settings. The application gateway is assigned to *myAGSubnet* and *myPublicIPAddress* that you previously created. 

```azurecli-interactive
az network application-gateway create \
  --name myAppGateway \
  --location eastus \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --vnet-name myVNet \
  --subnet myAGsubnet \
  --capacity 2 \
  --sku Standard_v2 \
  --http-settings-cookie-based-affinity Disabled \
  --frontend-port 8080 \
  --http-settings-port 80 \
  --http-settings-protocol Http \
  --public-ip-address myAGPublicIPAddress \
  --priority 10 
```

It may take several minutes for the application gateway to be created. After the application gateway is created, you can see these new features of it:

- *appGatewayBackendPool* - An application gateway must have at least one backend address pool.
- *appGatewayBackendHttpSettings* - Specifies that port 80 and an HTTP protocol is used for communication.
- *appGatewayHttpListener* - The default listener associated with *appGatewayBackendPool*.
- *appGatewayFrontendIP* - Assigns *myAGPublicIPAddress* to *appGatewayHttpListener*.
- *rule1* - The default routing rule that is associated with *appGatewayHttpListener*.

### Add the redirection configuration

Add the redirection configuration that sends traffic from *www\.contoso.org* to the listener for *www\.contoso.com* to the application gateway using [az network application-gateway redirect-config create](/cli/azure/network/application-gateway/redirect-config).

```azurecli-interactive
az network application-gateway redirect-config create \
  --name myredirect \
  --gateway-name myAppGateway \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --type Temporary \
  --target-url "https://bing.com"
```

### Add a listener and routing rule

A listener is required to enable the application gateway to appropriately route traffic. Create the listener using [az network application-gateway http-listener create](/cli/azure/network/application-gateway) with the frontend port created with [az network application-gateway frontend-port create](/cli/azure/network/application-gateway). A rule is required for the listener to know where to send incoming traffic. Create a basic rule named *redirectRule* using [az network application-gateway rule create](/cli/azure/network/application-gateway).

```azurecli-interactive
az network application-gateway frontend-port create \
  --port 80 \
  --gateway-name myAppGateway \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --name redirectPort
az network application-gateway http-listener create \
  --name redirectListener \
  --frontend-ip appGatewayFrontendIP \
  --frontend-port redirectPort \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --gateway-name myAppGateway
az network application-gateway rule create \
  --gateway-name myAppGateway \
  --name redirectRule \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --http-listener redirectListener \
  --rule-type Basic \
  --redirect-config myredirect \
  --priority 11

```

## Test the application gateway

To get the public IP address of the application gateway, you can use [az network public-ip show](/cli/azure/network/public-ip). Copy the public IP address, and then paste it into the address bar of your browser.

You should see *bing.com* appear in your browser.
