# Configure Azure Application Gateway TCP/TLS proxy (Preview)

To try out the layer 4 features of Azure Application Gateway, this article shows how to use the Azure portal to create an Azure Application Gateway with a SQL Server virtual machine as the backend server. Connectivity through a SQL client is also tested to verify the configuration works correctly. The article guides you through the following procedures:

- Create a SQL server Azure virtual machine
- Create a new application gateway
    - Configure basic settings and a frontend public IP address
    - Add a backend pool and set the SQL server as a backend target
    - Create a routing rule
        - Create a listener with the required port (SQL 1433)
        - Create a backend setting using layer 4 protocol

    - Add a SQL server to the backend pool
- Connect to the application gateway using a SQL client

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Application Gateway TCP/TLS proxy is currently in PREVIEW.<br>
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **Create a resource**.
2. Under **Categories**, select **Networking** and then select **Application Gateway** in the **Popular Azure services** list.
3. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following details:
    -  **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription name. 
    - **Resource group**: Select the same resource group that you entered for the previous procedure to create a SQL server virtual machine.
    - **Application gateway name**: myL4AppGW
    - **Region**: Select the same region as your resource group.
    - **Tier**: Standard V2
    - **Enable autoscaling**: Accept the default setting.
    - **Minimum instance count**: 2
    - All other **Instance details**: Accept the default settings.
    - **Virtual network**: Select **Create new** and enter a name. For example: **myL4AppGWVNet**. Accept the default address space settings and replace the subnet name of default with a descriptive name such as **appgw-subnet**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Default address space and subnet settings are adjusted to avoid conflicting with other VNets that you have deployed.

    The following table provides more information about the settings used in this procedure.

    | Field | Details |
    |-------|---------|
    | Subscription | Select the same subscription where you deployed the SQL server. |
    | Resource group | Select the same resource group where you deployed the SQL server. |
    | Application gateway name | You can provide any name for easy identification. |
    | Region | The region is automatically selected based on the resource group that you choose. |
    | Tier | For TCP/TLS proxy, you can select either Standard v2 or WAF v2. The WAF functions only apply to HTTP(S) when using a gateway in hybrid mode (HTTP, HTTPS along with TCP or TLS). |
    | Enable autoscaling | This setting allows your gateway to scale out and scale in based on loads. This is applicable for both Layer 7 and Layer 4 proxy. The default setting is **Yes**. |
    | Min/Max instance counts | For more information, see [Scaling Application Gateway v2 and WAF v2](application-gateway-autoscaling-zone-redundant.md). |
    | Availability zone | For more information, see [What are Azure regions and availability zones?](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview). |
    | HTTP2 | The default setting of disabled can be used for this test. |
    | Virtual network and subnet | You can choose an existing VNet under the region or create a new VNet. Application Gateway requires its own dedicated subnet with no other services deployed in it. |
