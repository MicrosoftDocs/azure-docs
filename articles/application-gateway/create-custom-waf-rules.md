# Create and use web application firewall v2 custom rules

Azure Application Gateway web application firewall (WAF) v2 provides protection for web applications. This protection is provided by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) core rule set. In some cases, you might need to create your own custom rules to meet your specific needs. For more information about WAF custom rules, see [Overview: Custom web application firewall rules](custom-waf-rules-overview.md).

This article shows you some example custom rules that you can create and use with WAF v2. To learn how to deploy WAF with a custom rule by using Azure PowerShell, see [Configure web application firewall custom rules by using Azure PowerShell](configure-waf-custom-rules.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If your application gateway isn't using the WAF tier, the option to upgrade the application gateway to the WAF tier appears in the right pane.

## Example 1

You know there's a bot named *evilbot* that you want to block from crawling your website. In this example, you block the User-Agent *evilbot* in the request headers.

Logic: p

```azurepowershell
$variable = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallMatchVariable `
   -VariableName RequestHeaders `
   -Selector User-Agent

$condition = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCondition `
   -MatchVariable $variable `
   -Operator Contains `
   -MatchValue "evilbot" `
   -Transform Lowercase `
   -NegationCondition $False

$rule = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCustomRule `
   -Name blockEvilBot `
   -Priority 2 `
   -RuleType MatchRule `
   -MatchCondition $condition `
   -Action Block
```

Here's the corresponding JSON code:

```json
  {
    "customRules": [
      {
        "name": "blockEvilBot",
        "ruleType": "MatchRule",
        "priority": 2,
        "action": "Block",
        "matchConditions": [
          {
            "matchVariable": "RequestHeaders",
            "operator": "User-Agent",
            "matchValues": [
              "evilbot"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

To view a WAF that's deployed by using this custom rule, see [Configure a web application firewall custom rule by using Azure PowerShell](configure-waf-custom-rules.md).

### Example 1a

You can accomplish the same thing by using a regular expression:

```azurepowershell
$variable = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallMatchVariable `
   -VariableName RequestHeaders `
   -Selector User-Agent

$condition = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCondition `
   -MatchVariable $variable `
   -Operator Regex `
   -MatchValue "evilbot" `
   -Transform Lowercase `
   -NegationCondition $False

$rule = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCustomRule `
   -Name blockEvilBot `
   -Priority 2 `
   -RuleType MatchRule `
   -MatchCondition $condition `
   -Action Block
```

Here's the corresponding JSON code:

```json
  {
    "customRules": [
      {
        "name": "blockEvilBot",
        "ruleType": "MatchRule",
        "priority": 2,
        "action": "Block",
        "matchConditions": [
          {
            "matchVariable": "RequestHeaders",
            "operator": "User-Agent",
            "matchValues": [
              "evilbot"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

## Example 2

You want to block all requests from IP addresses in the range 198.168.5.0/24.

In this example, you block all traffic that comes from a range of IP addresses. The name of the rule is *myrule1*, and the priority is set to 100.

Logic: p

```azurepowershell
$variable1 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallMatchVariable `
   -VariableName RemoteAddr

$condition1 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCondition `
   -MatchVariable $variable1 `
   -Operator IPMatch `
   -MatchValue "192.168.5.0/24" `
   -NegationCondition $False

$rule = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCustomRule `
   -Name myrule1 `
   -Priority 10 `
   -RuleType MatchRule `
   -MatchCondition $condition1 `
   -Action Block
```

Here's the corresponding JSON code:

```json
  {
    "customRules": [
      {
        "name": "myrule1",
        "ruleType": "MatchRule",
        "priority": 10,
        "action": "Block",
        "matchConditions": [
          {
            "matchVariable": "RemoteAddr",
            "operator": "IPMatch",
            "matchValues": [
              "192.168.5.0/24"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

Here's the corresponding core rule set rule:

  `SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@ipMatch 192.168.5.0/24" "id:7001,deny"`

## Example 3

For this example, you want to block User-Agent *evilbot*, and traffic in the range 192.168.5.0/24. To achieve this result, you can create two separate match conditions and put them both in the same rule. This approach ensures that if both *evilbot* in the User-Agent header *and* IP addresses from the range 192.168.5.0/24 are matched, the request is blocked.

Logic: p *and* q

```azurepowershell
$variable1 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallMatchVariable `
   -VariableName RemoteAddr

 $variable2 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallMatchVariable `
   -VariableName RequestHeaders `
   -Selector User-Agent

$condition1 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCondition `
   -MatchVariable $variable1 `
   -Operator IPMatch `
   -MatchValue "192.168.5.0/24" `
   -NegationCondition $False

$condition2 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCondition `
   -MatchVariable $variable2 `
   -Operator Contains `
   -MatchValue "evilbot" `
   -Transform Lowercase `
   -NegationCondition $False

 $rule = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCustomRule `
   -Name myrule `
   -Priority 10 `
   -RuleType MatchRule `
   -MatchCondition $condition1, $condition2 `
   -Action Block
```

Here's the corresponding JSON code:

```json
{ 

    "customRules": [ 
      { 
        "name": "myrule", 
        "ruleType": "MatchRule", 
        "priority": 10, 
        "action": "block", 
        "matchConditions": [ 
            { 
              "matchVariable": "RemoteAddr", 
              "operator": "IPMatch", 
              "negateCondition": false, 
              "matchValues": [ 
                "192.168.5.0/24" 
              ] 
            }, 
            { 
              "matchVariable": "RequestHeaders", 
              "selector": "User-Agent", 
              "operator": "Contains", 
              "transforms": [ 
                "Lowercase" 
              ], 
              "matchValues": [ 
                "evilbot" 
              ] 
            } 
        ] 
      } 
    ] 
  } 
```

## Example 4

For this example, you want to block if the request is either outside of the IP address range *192.168.5.0/24*, or the user agent string isn't *chrome* (that is, the user isn’t using the Chrome browser). Because this logic uses *or*, the two conditions are in separate rules, as shown in the following example. To block the traffic, both *myrule1* and *myrule2* need to match.

Logic: *not* (p *and* q) = *not* p *or not* q.

```azurepowershell
$variable1 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallMatchVariable `
   -VariableName RemoteAddr

$variable2 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallMatchVariable `
   -VariableName RequestHeaders `
   -Selector User-Agent

$condition1 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCondition `
   -MatchVariable $variable1 `
   -Operator IPMatch `
   -MatchValue "192.168.5.0/24" `
   -NegationCondition $True

$condition2 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCondition `
   -MatchVariable $variable2 `
   -Operator Contains `
   -MatchValue "chrome" `
   -Transform Lowercase `
   -NegationCondition $True

$rule1 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCustomRule `
   -Name myrule1 `
   -Priority 10 `
   -RuleType MatchRule `
   -MatchCondition $condition1 `
   -Action Block

$rule2 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCustomRule `
   -Name myrule2 `
   -Priority 20 `
   -RuleType MatchRule `
   -MatchCondition $condition2 `
   -Action Block
```

Here's the corresponding JSON code:

```json
{
    "customRules": [
      {
        "name": "myrule1",
        "ruleType": "MatchRule",
        "priority": 10,
        "action": "block",
        "matchConditions": [
          {
            "matchVariable": "RequestHeaders",
            "operator": "IPMatch",
            "negateCondition": true,
            "matchValues": [
              "192.168.5.0/24"
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "myrule2",
        "ruleType": "MatchRule",
        "priority": 20,
        "action": "block",
        "matchConditions": [
          {
            "matchVariable": "RequestHeaders",
            "selector": "User-Agent",
            "operator": "Contains",
            "negateCondition": true,
            "transforms": [
              "Lowercase"
            ],
            "matchValues": [
              "chrome"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

## Example 5

You want to block custom SQLI. Because the logic used here is *or* and all the values are in the *RequestUri*, all the *MatchValues* can be in a comma-separated list.

Logic: p *or* q *or* r

```azurepowershell
$variable1 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallMatchVariable `
   -VariableName RequestUri 
$condition1 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCondition `
   -MatchVariable $variable1 `
   -Operator Contains `
   -MatchValue "1=1", "drop tables", "'—" `
   -NegationCondition $False

$rule1 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCustomRule `
   -Name myrule4 `
   -Priority 100 `
   -RuleType MatchRule `
   -MatchCondition $condition1 `
   -Action Block
```

Here's the corresponding JSON code:

```json
  {
    "customRules": [
      {
        "name": "myrule4",
        "ruleType": "MatchRule",
        "priority": 100,
        "action": "block",
        "matchConditions": [
          {
            "matchVariable": "RequestUri",
            "operator": "Contains",
            "matchValues": [
              "1=1",
              "drop tables",
              "'--"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

Here's the alternative Azure PowerShell code:

```azurepowershell
$variable1 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallMatchVariable `
   -VariableName RequestUri
$condition1 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCondition `
   -MatchVariable $variable1 `
   -Operator Contains `
   -MatchValue "1=1" `
   -NegationCondition $False

$rule1 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCustomRule `
   -Name myrule1 `
   -Priority 10 `
   -RuleType MatchRule `
   -MatchCondition $condition1 `
-Action Block

$variable2 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallMatchVariable `
   -VariableName RequestUri

$condition2 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCondition `
   -MatchVariable $variable2 `
   -Operator Contains `
   -MatchValue "drop tables" `
   -NegationCondition $False

$rule2 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCustomRule `
   -Name myrule2 `
   -Priority 20 `
   -RuleType MatchRule `
   -MatchCondition $condition2 `
   -Action Block

$variable3 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallMatchVariable `
   -VariableName RequestUri

$condition3 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCondition `
   -MatchVariable $variable3 `
   -Operator Contains `
   -MatchValue "’—" `
   -NegationCondition $False

$rule3 = New-AzApplicationGatewayFirewallCustomRule `
   -Name myrule3 `
   -Priority 30 `
   -RuleType MatchRule `
   -MatchCondition $condition3 `
   -Action Block
```

Here's the corresponding JSON code:

```json
  {
    "customRules": [
      {
        "name": "myrule1",
        "ruleType": "MatchRule",
        "priority": 10,
        "action": "block",
        "matchConditions": [
          {
            "matchVariable": "RequestUri",
            "operator": "Contains",
            "matchValues": [
              "1=1"
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "myrule2",
        "ruleType": "MatchRule",
        "priority": 20,
        "action": "block",
        "matchConditions": [
          {
            "matchVariable": "RequestUri",
            "operator": "Contains",
            "transforms": [
              "Lowercase"
            ],
            "matchValues": [
              "drop tables"
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "myrule3",
        "ruleType": "MatchRule",
        "priority": 30,
        "action": "block",
        "matchConditions": [
          {
            "matchVariable": "RequestUri",
            "operator": "Contains",
            "matchValues": [
              "'--"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```
