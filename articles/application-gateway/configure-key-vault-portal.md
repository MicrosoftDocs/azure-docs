# Configure TLS termination with Key Vault certificates using Azure portal

[Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview) is a platform-managed secret store that you can use to safeguard secrets, keys, and TLS/SSL certificates. Azure Application Gateway supports integration with Key Vault for server certificates that are attached to HTTPS-enabled listeners. This support is limited to the Application Gateway v2 SKU.

For more information, see [TLS termination with Key Vault certificates](key-vault-certs.md).

This article shows you how to use Azure portal to integrate your key vault with your application gateway for TLS/SSL termination certificates.


<!-- 3. Prerequisites 
Optional. If you need prerequisites, make them your first H2 in a how-to guide. 
Use clear and unambiguous language and use a list format.
-->

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have an Azure subscription. If not, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Configuration steps

### Create a resource group
<!-- Introduction paragraph -->
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Select **Resource groups**
3. Select **Add**.
4. Enter the following values:

    - **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription.

    - **Resource group**: Enter a new resource group name.

    - **Region**: Select an Azure location, such as **East US**.

5. Select **Review + Create**
6. Select **Create**. It takes a few seconds to create a resource group.
7. Select **Refresh** from the top menu to refresh the resource group list, and then select the newly created resource group to open it. Or select **Notification** (the bell icon) from the top, and then select **Go to resource group** to open the newly created resource group

### Create a Key Vault

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The key vault name must be universally unique.

1. In the **Search** box, enter **Key Vault**.
2. From the results list, choose **Key Vault**.
3. On the Key Vault section, choose **Create**.
4. On the **Create key vault** section provide the following information:
    - **Name**: A unique name is required. 
    - **Subscription**: Choose a subscription.
    - **Select Resource Group** previously created.
    - In the **Location** pull-down menu, choose a **East US**.
    Leave the other options to their defaults.
5. After providing the information above, select **create**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-key-vault-portal/create-key-vault.png" alt-text="screenshot of key vault creation":::

At this point, your Azure account is the only one authorized to perform operations on this new vault.

### Create Certificate and Issuance Policy

#### Certificate ####
1. In the Key Vault that was created earlier, navigate to **Certificate**.
2. Under **Certificate** select your desired method of creation, whether you want to **Import** or **Generate**. If you choose to generate the certificate, you would need to create the issuance policy.
3. Input your Certificate name and complete all the required fields. 
4. After providing the information above, select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-key-vault-portal/create-key-vault-certificate.png" alt-text="Screenshot of key vault certificate creation":::

> [!Important]
> Issuance policies only affect certificates that will be issued in the future. Modifying this issuance policy won't affect any existing certificates.

### Create a Virtual Network

1. In the **Search** box, enter **Virtual Network**.
2. In the **Virtual Network** page, select **Create**.
3. In **Create virtual network**, enter or select this information in the **Basics tab**:
    - **Subscription**: Choose a subscription.
    - **Select Resource Group** previously created.
    - **Name**: A unique name is required. 
    - In the **Location** pull-down menu, choose a **East US**.
4. Select **OK**.
5. Select the **IP Addresses** tab, or select the **Next: IP Addresses** button at the bottom of the page.
6. In IPv4 address space, select the existing address space and change it to 10.1.0.0/16.
7. Select **+ Add subnet**, then enter *MySubnet* for Subnet name and 10.1.0.0/24 for Subnet address range.
8. Select **Add**.
9. Select **OK**.
10. Select the **Review + create** button.


### Create an Application Gateway

You'll create the application gateway using the tabs on the **Create an application gateway** page.

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the Home page, select **Create a resource**. The New window appears.
2. Select **Networking** and then select Application Gateway in the Featured list.

**Basics tab**

1. On the Basics tab, enter these values for the following application gateway settings:

    **Resource group**: Select **myResourceGroupAG** for the resource group. If it doesn't exist, select **Create new** to create it.
    
    **Application gateway name**: Enter *_myAppGateway_* for the name of the application gateway.

2. For Azure to communicate between the resources that you create, it needs a virtual network. You can either create a new virtual network or use an existing one. In this example, you'll create a new virtual network at the same time that you create the application gateway. Application Gateway instances are created in separate subnets. You create two subnets in this example: one for the application gateway, and another for the backend servers.

    > [!Note]
    > [Virtual network service endpoint policies](../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoint-policies-overview.md) are currently not supported in an Application Gateway subnet.

    Under **Configure virtual network**, create a new virtual network by selecting **Create new**. In the Create virtual network window that opens, enter the following values to create the virtual network and two subnets:

    **Name**: Enter myVNet for the name of the virtual network.

    **Subnet name** (Application Gateway subnet): The Subnets grid will show a subnet named Default. Change the name of this subnet to myAGSubnet.
    The application gateway subnet can contain only application gateways. No other resources are allowed.

    **Subnet name** (backend server subnet): In the second row of the Subnets grid, enter myBackendSubnet in the Subnet name column.

    **Address range** (backend server subnet): In the second row of the Subnets Grid, enter an address range that doesn't overlap with the address range of myAGSubnet. For example, if the address range of myAGSubnet is 10.0.0.0/24, enter 10.0.1.0/24 for the address range of myBackendSubnet.

    Select **OK** to close the Create virtual network window and save the virtual network settings.

3. On the **Basics** tab, accept the default values for the other settings and then select **Next: Frontends**.

**Frontends tab**

1. On the **Frontends** tab, verify Frontend IP address type is set to Public.
You can configure the Frontend IP to be Public or Private as per your use case. In this example, you'll choose a Public Frontend IP.

   > [!Note]
   > For the Application Gateway v2 SKU, there must be a Public frontend IP configuration. You can still have both a Public and a Private frontend IP configuration, but Private only frontend IP configuration (Only ILB mode) is currently not enabled for the v2 SKU.

2. Select **Add new** for the Public IP address and enter myAGPublicIPAddress for the public IP address name, and then select OK.

3. Select **Next: Backends**.

**Backends tab**

The backend pool is used to route requests to the backend servers that serve the request. Backend pools can be composed of NICs, virtual machine scale sets, public IP addresses, internal IP addresses, fully qualified domain names (FQDN), and multi-tenant backends like Azure App Service. In this example, you'll create an empty backend pool with your application gateway and then add backend targets to the backend pool.

1. On the **Backends** tab, select **Add a backend pool**.

2. In the **Add a backend pool** window that opens, enter the following values to create an empty backend pool:

    **Name**: Enter myBackendPool for the name of the backend pool.

    **Add backend pool without targets**: Select Yes to create a backend pool with no targets. You'll add backend targets after creating the application gateway.

3. In the **Add a backend pool** window, select **Add** to save the backend pool configuration and return to the Backends tab.

4. On the **Backends** tab, select **Next: Configuration**.

**Configuration tab**

On the **Configuration** tab, you'll connect the frontend and backend pool you created using a routing rule.

1. Select **Add a routing rule** in the **Routing rules** column.

2. In the **Add a routing rule** window that opens, enter **myRoutingRule** for the Rule name.

3. A routing rule requires a listener. On the **Listener** tab within the **Add a routing rule** window, enter the following values for the listener:

    **Listener name**: Enter *myListener* for the name of the listener.

    **Frontend IP**: Select **Public** to choose the public IP you created for the frontend.

    Accept the default values for the other settings on the **Listener** tab, then select the **Backend targets** tab to configure the rest of the routing rule.

4. On the **Backend targets** tab, select **myBackendPool** for the **Backend target**.

5. For the **HTTP setting**, select **Add new** to add a new HTTP setting. The HTTP setting will determine the behavior of the routing rule. In the Add an HTTP setting window that opens, enter *myHTTPSetting* for the HTTP setting name and 80 for the Backend port. Accept the default values for the other settings in the **Add an HTTP setting** window, then select **Add** to return to the **Add a routing rule** window.

6. On the **Add a routing rule** window, select **Add** to save the routing rule and return to the **Configuration** tab.

7. Select **Next: Tags** and then **Next: Review + create**.

**Review + create tab**

Review the settings on the **Review + create** tab, and then select **Create** to configure the virtual network, the public IP address, and the application gateway. It may take several minutes for Azure to create the application gateway. Wait until the deployment finishes successfully before moving on to the next section.

Add backend targets to your Backend Pool.
