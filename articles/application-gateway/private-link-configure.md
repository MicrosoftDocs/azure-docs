# Configure Azure Application Gateway Private Link

Azure Application Gateway Private Link enables you to establish secure, private connections to your Application Gateway from workloads spanning across virtual networks (VNets) and subscriptions. This feature provides private connectivity without exposing traffic to the public internet. For more information, see [Application Gateway Private Link](private-link.md).

## Configuration options

You can configure Application Gateway Private Link using multiple methods:
- Azure portal
- Azure PowerShell
- Azure CLI

## Prerequisites

Before configuring Private Link, ensure you have:
- An existing Application Gateway
- A virtual network with a dedicated subnet for Private Link (separate from the Application Gateway subnet)
- Appropriate permissions to create and configure Private Link resources

## Subnet considerations for Private Link configuration

To enable Private Link configuration, you must have a dedicated subnet that's separate from the Application Gateway subnet. This subnet is used exclusively for Private Link IP configurations and can't contain any Application Gateway instances.

- Each IP address allocated to this subnet supports up to 65,536 concurrent TCP connections through Private Link
- To calculate required IP addresses: `n × 65,536` connections, where `n` is the number of IP addresses provisioned
- Maximum of eight IP addresses per Private Link configuration
- Only dynamic IP address allocation is supported
- The subnet must have [Private Link Service Network Policies](../private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy.md#disable-network-policy) disabled

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The combined length of the Application Gateway name and Private Link configuration name must not exceed 70 characters to avoid deployment failures.

To create a dedicated subnet for Private Link, see [Add, change, or delete a virtual network subnet](../virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If your client application connects to App Gateway via a private IP, requires an idle timeout greater > than 4 minutes, and the client application does not send TCP keep-alive packets, contact agprivateip-keepalive@microsoft.com to request initiation of keep‑alive from Application Gateway.

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

## Disable network policies on the Private Link subnet

To allow Private Link connectivity, you must [disable the Private Link Service Network Policies](../private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy.md#disable-network-policy) on the subnet designated for Private Link IP configurations.

To disable network policies, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for and select **Virtual networks**.
1. Select the virtual network containing the Private Link subnet.
1. In the left navigation pane, select **Subnets**.
1. Select the subnet designated for Private Link.
1. Under **Private link service network policies**, select **Disabled**.
1. Select **Save** to apply the changes.
    1. Wait a few minutes for the changes to take effect.
1. Verify the **Private link service network policies** setting is now **Disabled**.

## Configure Private Link

The Private Link configuration defines the infrastructure that enables connections from Private Endpoints to your Application Gateway. Before creating the Private Link configuration, ensure that a listener is actively configured to use the target frontend IP configuration.

Follow these steps to create the Private Link configuration:

1. Search for and select **Application Gateways**.
1. Select your Application Gateway instance.
1. In the left navigation pane, select **Private link**, then select **+ Add**.
1. Configure the following settings:
   - **Name**: Enter a name for the Private Link configuration
   - **Private link subnet**: Select the dedicated subnet for Private Link IP addresses
   - **Frontend IP Configuration**: Select the frontend IP configuration that Private Link should forward traffic to
   - **Private IP address settings**: Configure at least one IP address
1. Select **Add** to create the configuration.
1. From your Application Gateway settings, copy and save the **Resource ID**. This identifier is required when setting up Private Endpoints from different Microsoft Entra tenants.

## Configure Private Endpoint

A Private Endpoint is a network interface that uses a private IP address from your virtual network to connect securely to Azure Application Gateway. Clients use the Private Endpoint's private IP address to establish connections to the Application Gateway through a secure tunnel.

To create a Private Endpoint, follow these steps:

1. In the Application Gateway portal, select the **Private endpoint connections** tab.
1. Select **+ Private endpoint**.
1. On the **Basics** tab:
   - Configure the resource group, name, and region for the Private Endpoint
   - Select **Next: Resource >**
1. On the **Resource** tab:
   - Verify the target resource settings
   - Select **Next: Virtual Network >**
1. On the **Virtual Network** tab:
   - Select the virtual network and subnet where the Private Endpoint network interface will be created
   - Select **Next: DNS >**
1. On the **DNS** tab:
   - Configure DNS settings as needed
   - Select **Next: Tags >**
1. On the **Tags** tab:
   - Optionally add resource tags
   - Select **Next: Review + create >**
1. Review the configuration and select **Create**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the public or private IP configuration resource is missing when trying to select a _Target sub-resource_ on the _Resource_ tab of private endpoint creation, ensure a listener is actively utilizing the respected frontend IP configuration. Frontend IP configurations without an associated listener can't be shown as a _Target sub-resource_.

> [!NOTE]
> When provisioning a Private Endpoint from a different Microsoft Entra tenant, you must use the Azure Application Gateway Resource ID and specify the frontend IP configuration name as the target sub-resource. 
For example, if your private IP configuration is named `PrivateFrontendIp` in the portal, use `PrivateFrontendIp` as the target sub-resource value.


# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

## Configure Private Link using PowerShell

Use the following PowerShell commands to configure Private Link on an existing Application Gateway:

```azurepowershell
# Disable Private Link Service Network Policies
# https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy
$net =@{
    Name = 'AppGW-PL-PSH'
    ResourceGroupName = 'AppGW-PL-PSH-RG'
}
$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork @net

($vnet | Select -ExpandProperty subnets | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq 'AppGW-PL-Subnet'}).PrivateLinkServiceNetworkPolicies = "Disabled"

# Apply the network policy changes
$vnet | Set-AzVirtualNetwork

    --connection-name AppGW-PL-Connection
```

> [!Note]
> To move a Private Endpoint to a different subscription, you must delete the existing connection between the Private Link and Private Endpoint. After deletion, create a new Private Endpoint connection in the target subscription to reestablish connectivity.

>[!CAUTION]
>Private link configuration will momentarily cause traffic disruption (less than 1 minute) when enabled or disabled. Changes are recommended to be conducted during a maintenance window or period of low-traffic.  During this time, you may see connection timeouts or 4XX http status codes returned on request.  Add/Remove/Approval/Rejection of private endpoints will not cause traffic disruption.
