# Create an application gateway with internal redirection using the Azure CLI

You can use the Azure CLI to configure [web traffic redirection](multiple-site-overview.md) when you create an [application gateway](overview.md). In this tutorial, you define a backend pool using a virtual machines scale set. You then configure listeners and rules based on domains that you own to make sure web traffic arrives at the appropriate pool. This tutorial assumes that you own multiple domains and uses examples of *www\.contoso.com* and *www\.contoso.org*.

In this article, you learn how to:

* Set up the network
* Create an application gateway
* Add listeners and redirection rule
* Create a virtual machine scale set with the backend pool
* Create a CNAME record in your domain

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

 - This tutorial requires version 2.0.4 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Create a resource group

A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. Create a resource group using [az group create](/cli/azure/group).

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroupAG* in the *eastus* location.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroupAG --location eastus
```

## Create network resources

Create the virtual network named *myVNet* and the subnet named *myAGSubnet* using [az network vnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet). You can then add the subnet named *myBackendSubnet* that's needed by the backend pool of servers using [az network vnet subnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet). Create the public IP address named *myAGPublicIPAddress* using [az network public-ip create](/cli/azure/network/public-ip#az-network-public-ip-create).

```azurecli-interactive
az network vnet create \
  --name myVNet \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --location eastus \
  --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
  --subnet-name myAGSubnet \
  --subnet-prefix 10.0.1.0/24
az network vnet subnet create \
  --name myBackendSubnet \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --vnet-name myVNet \
  --address-prefix 10.0.2.0/24
az network public-ip create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --name myAGPublicIPAddress
```

## Create an application gateway

You can use [az network application-gateway create](/cli/azure/network/application-gateway) to create the application gateway named *myAppGateway*. When you create an application gateway using the Azure CLI, you specify configuration information, such as capacity, sku, and HTTP settings. The application gateway is assigned to *myAGSubnet* and *myAGPublicIPAddress* that you previously created.

```azurecli-interactive
az network application-gateway create \
  --name myAppGateway \
  --location eastus \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --vnet-name myVNet \
  --subnet myAGsubnet \
  --capacity 2 \
  --sku Standard_Medium \
  --http-settings-cookie-based-affinity Disabled \
  --frontend-port 80 \
  --http-settings-port 80 \
  --http-settings-protocol Http \
  --public-ip-address myAGPublicIPAddress
```

It may take several minutes for the application gateway to be created. After the application gateway is created, you can see these new features of it:

- *appGatewayBackendPool* - An application gateway must have at least one backend address pool.
- *appGatewayBackendHttpSettings* - Specifies that port 80 and an HTTP protocol is used for communication.
- *appGatewayHttpListener* - The default listener associated with *appGatewayBackendPool*.
- *appGatewayFrontendIP* - Assigns *myAGPublicIPAddress* to *appGatewayHttpListener*.
- *rule1* - The default routing rule that is associated with *appGatewayHttpListener*.


## Add listeners and rules

A listener is required to enable the application gateway to route traffic appropriately to the backend pool. In this tutorial, you create two listeners for your two domains. In this example, listeners are created for the domains of *www\.contoso.com* and *www\.contoso.org*.

Add the backend listeners that are needed to route traffic using [az network application-gateway http-listener create](/cli/azure/network/application-gateway/http-listener#az-network-application-gateway-http-listener-create).

```azurecli-interactive
az network application-gateway http-listener create \
  --name contosoComListener \
  --frontend-ip appGatewayFrontendIP \
  --frontend-port appGatewayFrontendPort \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --gateway-name myAppGateway \
  --host-name www.contoso.com
az network application-gateway http-listener create \
  --name contosoOrgListener \
  --frontend-ip appGatewayFrontendIP \
  --frontend-port appGatewayFrontendPort \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --gateway-name myAppGateway \
  --host-name www.contoso.org
  ```

### Add the redirection configuration

Add the redirection configuration that sends traffic from *www\.consoto.org* to the listener for *www\.contoso.com* in the application gateway using [az network application-gateway redirect-config create](/cli/azure/network/application-gateway/redirect-config#az-network-application-gateway-redirect-config-create).

```azurecli-interactive
az network application-gateway redirect-config create \
  --name orgToCom \
  --gateway-name myAppGateway \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --type Permanent \
  --target-listener contosoListener \
  --include-path true \
  --include-query-string true
```

### Add routing rules

Rules are processed in the order in which they are created, and traffic is directed using the first rule that matches the URL sent to the application gateway. For example, if you have a rule using a basic listener and a rule using a multi-site listener both on the same port, the rule with the multi-site listener must be listed before the rule with the basic listener in order for the multi-site rule to function as expected.

In this example, you create two new rules and delete the default rule that was created.  You can add the rule using [az network application-gateway rule create](/cli/azure/network/application-gateway/rule#az-network-application-gateway-rule-create).

```azurecli-interactive
az network application-gateway rule create \
  --gateway-name myAppGateway \
  --name contosoComRule \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --http-listener contosoComListener \
  --rule-type Basic \
  --address-pool appGatewayBackendPool
az network application-gateway rule create \
  --gateway-name myAppGateway \
  --name contosoOrgRule \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --http-listener contosoOrgListener \
  --rule-type Basic \
  --redirect-config orgToCom
az network application-gateway rule delete \
  --gateway-name myAppGateway \
  --name rule1 \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG
```

## Create virtual machine scale sets

In this example, you create a virtual machine scale set that supports the backend pool that you created. The scale set that you create is named *myvmss* and contains two virtual machine instances on which you install NGINX.

```azurecli-interactive
az vmss create \
  --name myvmss \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --image Ubuntu2204 \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --admin-password Azure123456! \
  --instance-count 2 \
  --vnet-name myVNet \
  --subnet myBackendSubnet \
  --vm-sku Standard_DS2 \
  --upgrade-policy-mode Automatic \
  --app-gateway myAppGateway \
  --backend-pool-name appGatewayBackendPool
```

### Install NGINX

Run this command in the shell window:

```azurecli-interactive
az vmss extension set \
  --publisher Microsoft.Azure.Extensions \
  --version 2.0 \
  --name CustomScript \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --vmss-name myvmss \
  --settings '{ "fileUris": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-docs-powershell-samples/master/application-gateway/iis/install_nginx.sh"],
  "commandToExecute": "./install_nginx.sh" }'
```

## Create CNAME record in your domain

After the application gateway is created with its public IP address, you can get the DNS address and use it to create a CNAME record in your domain. You can use [az network public-ip show](/cli/azure/network/public-ip#az-network-public-ip-show) to get the DNS address of the application gateway. Copy the *fqdn* value of the DNSSettings and use it as the value of the CNAME record that you create. The use of A-records is not recommended because the VIP may change when the application gateway is restarted.

```azurecli-interactive
az network public-ip show \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupAG \
  --name myAGPublicIPAddress \
  --query [dnsSettings.fqdn] \
  --output tsv
```

## Test the application gateway

Enter your domain name into the address bar of your browser. Such as, http:\//www.contoso.com.

![Test contoso site in application gateway](./media/redirect-internal-site-cli/application-gateway-nginxtest.png)

Change the address to your other domain, for example http:\//www.contoso.org and you should see that the traffic has been redirected back to the listener for www\.contoso.com.
