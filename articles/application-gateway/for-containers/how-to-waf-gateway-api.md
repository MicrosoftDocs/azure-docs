# Azure Web Application Firewall on Application Gateway for Containers with the Gateway API

This article helps you set up an example application that uses resources from the Gateway API. The article provides steps to:

- Create a [`Gateway`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/api-overview/#gateway) resource with one HTTPS listener.
- Create an [`HTTPRoute`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/httproute) resource that references a back-end service.
- Create a `WebApplicationFirewallPolicy` resource that references an `HTTPRoute` resource.

## Background

Application Gateway for Containers uses Azure Web Application Firewall to block a malicious request from being proxied to the back-end target. The following diagram shows an example scenario.

## Prerequisites

- If you're following the bring-your-own (BYO) deployment strategy, ensure that you set up your Application Gateway for Containers resources and [ALB Controller](quickstart-deploy-application-gateway-for-containers-alb-controller.md).

- If you're following the Application Load Balancer (ALB) managed deployment strategy, ensure that you:

  - Provisioned your [ALB Controller](quickstart-deploy-application-gateway-for-containers-alb-controller.md).
  - Provisioned the Application Gateway for Containers resources via the [`ApplicationLoadBalancer` custom resource](quickstart-create-application-gateway-for-containers-managed-by-alb-controller.md).

- Apply the following `deployment.yaml` file on your cluster to create a sample web application that demonstrates the header rewrite:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/refs/heads/main/articles/application-gateway/for-containers/examples/traffic-split-scenario/deployment.yaml
  ```
  
  This command creates the following items on your cluster:

  - A namespace called `test-infra`
  - Two services called `backend-v1` and `backend-v2` in the `test-infra` namespace
  - Two deployments called `backend-v1` and `backend-v2` in the `test-infra` namespace

## Deploy the required Gateway API resources

# [ALB managed deployment](#tab/alb-managed)

Create a `Gateway` resource:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-01
  namespace: test-infra
  annotations:
    alb.networking.azure.io/alb-namespace: alb-test-infra
    alb.networking.azure.io/alb-name: alb-test
spec:
  gatewayClassName: azure-alb-external
  listeners:
  - name: http-listener
    port: 80
    protocol: HTTP
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: Same
EOF
```

[!INCLUDE [application-gateway-for-containers-frontend-naming](../../../includes/application-gateway-for-containers-frontend-naming.md)]

# [BYO deployment](#tab/byo)

1. Set the following environment variables:

    ```bash
    RESOURCE_GROUP='<resource group name of the Application Gateway For Containers resource>'
    RESOURCE_NAME='alb-test'
    
    RESOURCE_ID=$(az network alb show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $RESOURCE_NAME --query id -o tsv)
    FRONTEND_NAME='frontend'
    ```

2. Create a `Gateway` resource:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Gateway
    metadata:
      name: gateway-01
      namespace: test-infra
      annotations:
        alb.networking.azure.io/alb-id: $RESOURCE_ID
    spec:
      gatewayClassName: azure-alb-external
      listeners:
      - name: http-listener
        port: 80
        protocol: HTTP
        allowedRoutes:
          namespaces:
            from: Same
      addresses:
      - type: alb.networking.azure.io/alb-frontend
        value: $FRONTEND_NAME
    EOF
    ```

---

After you create the `Gateway` resource, ensure that the status is valid, the listener has a status of `Programmed`, and an address is assigned to it:

```bash
kubectl get gateway gateway-01 -n test-infra -o yaml
```

Here's example output for successful creation of a `Gateway` resource:

```yaml
status:
  addresses:
  - type: IPAddress
    value: xxxx.yyyy.alb.azure.com
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
    message: Valid Gateway
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Accepted
    status: "True"
    type: Accepted
  - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
    message: Application Gateway For Containers resource has been successfully updated.
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Programmed
    status: "True"
    type: Programmed
  listeners:
  - attachedRoutes: 0
    conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
      message: ""
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: ResolvedRefs
      status: "True"
      type: ResolvedRefs
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
      message: Listener is accepted
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Accepted
      status: "True"
      type: Accepted
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
      message: Application Gateway For Containers resource has been successfully updated.
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Programmed
      status: "True"
      type: Programmed
    name: https-listener
    supportedKinds:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: HTTPRoute
```

Create an `HTTPRoute` resource that listens for the host name `contoso.com`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: contoso-waf-route
  namespace: test-infra
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: gateway-01
      namespace: test-infra
  hostnames:
  - "contoso.com"
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: backend-v1
      port: 8080
EOF
```

After you create the `HTTPRoute` resource, ensure that the status of the route is `Accepted` and the status of the Application Gateway for Containers resource is `Programmed`:

```bash
kubectl get httproute header-rewrite-route -n test-infra -o yaml
```

Verify that the status of the Application Gateway for Containers resource was successfully updated:

```yaml
status:
  parents:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T22:18:23Z"
      message: ""
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: ResolvedRefs
      status: "True"
      type: ResolvedRefs
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T22:18:23Z"
      message: Route is Accepted
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Accepted
      status: "True"
      type: Accepted
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T22:18:23Z"
      message: Application Gateway For Containers resource has been successfully updated.
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Programmed
      status: "True"
      type: Programmed
    controllerName: alb.networking.azure.io/alb-controller
    parentRef:
      group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
      name: gateway-01
      namespace: test-infra
  ```

### Configure WebApplicationFirewallPolicy

Application Gateway for Containers uses a custom resource called `WebApplicationFirewallPolicy` to define Azure Web Application Firewall protection. In this example, Azure Web Application Firewall helps protect a specific `HTTPRoute` resource:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: alb.networking.azure.io/v1
kind: WebApplicationFirewallPolicy
metadata:
  name: sample-waf-policy
  namespace: test-infra
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: contoso-waf-route
    namespace: test-infra
    #sectionNames: ["listenerA"] # defined if you're targeting a specific listener on a gateway resource or path
  webApplicationFirewall:
    id: /subscriptions/.../Microsoft.Network/applicationGatewayWebApplicationFirewallPolicies/waf-policy-0
EOF
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: alb.networking.azure.io/v1
kind: WebApplicationFirewallPolicy
metadata:
  name: sample-waf-policy
  namespace: test-infra
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: contoso-waf-route
    namespace: test-infra
    #sectionNames: ["listenerA"] # defined if you're targeting a specific listener on a gateway resource or path
  webApplicationFirewall:
    id: /subscriptions/711d99a7-fd79-4ce7-9831-ea1afa18442e/resourceGroups/AGC-RG/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGatewayWebApplicationFirewallPolicies/agc-waf
EOF
```

## Test access to the application

Now you're ready to send some traffic to the sample application, via the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) assigned to the frontend resource. Use the following command to get the FQDN:

```bash
fqdn=$(kubectl get gateway gateway-01 -n test-infra -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
```

If you specify the server name indicator by using the `curl` command, with `contoso.com` for the frontend resource's FQDN, the output should return a response from the `backend-v1` service:

```bash
fqdnIp=$(dig +short $fqdn)
curl -k --resolve contoso.com:80:$fqdnIp http://contoso.com
```

Via the response, you should see:

```json
{
 "path": "/",
 "host": "contoso.com",
 "method": "GET",
 "proto": "HTTP/1.1",
 "headers": {
  "Accept": [
   "*/*"
  ],
  "User-Agent": [
   "curl/7.81.0"
  ],
  "X-Forwarded-For": [
   "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
  ],
  "X-Forwarded-Proto": [
   "http"
  ],
  "X-Request-Id": [
   "dcd4bcad-ea43-4fb6-948e-a906380dcd6d"
  ]
 },
 "namespace": "test-infra",
 "ingress": "",
 "service": "",
 "pod": "backend-v1-5b8fd96959-f59mm"
}
```

Now, send a request with a malicious query string to trigger a `403 forbidden` response from Application Gateway for Containers.

Here's one example request:

```bash
curl -k --resolve contoso.com:80:$fqdnIp http://contoso.com/?text=/etc/passwd
```

Here's another example request:

```bash
curl -k --resolve contoso.com:80:$fqdnIp http://contoso.com/?1=1=1
```

Congratulations! You installed an ALB Controller, deployed a back-end application, and used Azure Web Application Firewall functionality to block a malicious request.
