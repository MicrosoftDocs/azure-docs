# Multi-site hosting with Application Gateway for Containers - Gateway API

This document helps you set up an example application that uses the resources from Gateway API to demonstrate hosting multiple sites on the same Kubernetes Gateway resource / Application Gateway for Containers frontend. Steps are provided to:

- Create a [Gateway](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/api-overview/#gateway) resource with one HTTP listener.
- Create two [HTTPRoute](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/httproute) resources that each reference a unique backend service.

## Background

Application Gateway for Containers enables multi-site hosting by allowing you to configure more than one web application on the same port. Two or more unique sites can be hosted using unique backend services. See the following example scenario:

![A figure showing multisite hosting with Application Gateway for Containers.](./media/how-to-multiple-site-hosting-gateway-api/multiple-site-hosting.png)

## Prerequisites

1. If you used the BYO deployment strategy, ensure you set up your Application Gateway for Containers resources and [ALB Controller](quickstart-deploy-application-gateway-for-containers-alb-controller.md).
2. If you used the ALB managed deployment strategy, ensure provisioning of your [ALB Controller](quickstart-deploy-application-gateway-for-containers-alb-controller.md) and the Application Gateway for Containers resources via the [ApplicationLoadBalancer custom resource](quickstart-create-application-gateway-for-containers-managed-by-alb-controller.md).
3. Deploy sample HTTP application:<br>
  Apply the following deployment.yaml file on your cluster to create a sample web application to demonstrate path, query, and header based routing.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/refs/heads/main/articles/application-gateway/for-containers/examples/traffic-split-scenario/deployment.yaml
    ```

   This command creates the following on your cluster:

   - A namespace called `test-infra`
   - Two services called `backend-v1` and `backend-v2` in the `test-infra` namespace
   - Two deployments called `backend-v1` and `backend-v2` in the `test-infra` namespace

## Deploy the required Gateway API resources

# [ALB managed deployment](#tab/alb-managed)

1. Create a Gateway

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-01
  namespace: test-infra
  annotations:
    alb.networking.azure.io/alb-namespace: alb-test-infra
    alb.networking.azure.io/alb-name: alb-test
spec:
  gatewayClassName: azure-alb-external
  listeners:
  - name: http-listener
    port: 80
    protocol: HTTP
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: Same
EOF
```

[!INCLUDE [application-gateway-for-containers-frontend-naming](../../../includes/application-gateway-for-containers-frontend-naming.md)]

# [Bring your own (BYO) deployment](#tab/byo)

1. Set the following environment variables

    ```bash
    RESOURCE_GROUP='<resource group name of the Application Gateway For Containers resource>'
    RESOURCE_NAME='alb-test'

    RESOURCE_ID=$(az network alb show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $RESOURCE_NAME --query id -o tsv)
    FRONTEND_NAME='frontend'
    ```

2. Create a Gateway

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Gateway
    metadata:
      name: gateway-01
      namespace: test-infra
      annotations:
        alb.networking.azure.io/alb-id: $RESOURCE_ID
    spec:
      gatewayClassName: azure-alb-external
      listeners:
      - name: http-listener
        port: 80
        protocol: HTTP
        allowedRoutes:
          namespaces:
            from: Same
      addresses:
      - type: alb.networking.azure.io/alb-frontend
        value: $FRONTEND_NAME
    EOF
    ```

---

Once the gateway resource is created, ensure the status is valid, the listener is _Programmed_, and an address is assigned to the gateway.

```bash
kubectl get gateway gateway-01 -n test-infra -o yaml
```

Example output of successful gateway creation.

```yaml
status:
  addresses:
  - type: Hostname
    value: xxxx.yyyy.alb.azure.com
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
    message: Valid Gateway

    status: "True"
    type: Accepted

      message: ""

      status: "True"
      type: ResolvedRefs
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
      message: Listener is accepted
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Accepted
      status: "True"
      type: Accepted
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
      message: Application Gateway For Containers resource has been successfully updated.
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Programmed
      status: "True"
      type: Programmed
    name: https-listener
    supportedKinds:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: HTTPRoute
```

Once the gateway is created, create two HTTPRoute resources for `contoso.com` and `fabrikam.com` domain names.  Each domain forwards traffic to a different backend service.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: contoso-route
  namespace: test-infra
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: gateway-01
  hostnames:
  - "contoso.com"
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: backend-v1
      port: 8080
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: fabrikam-route
  namespace: test-infra
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: gateway-01
  hostnames:
  - "fabrikam.com"
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: backend-v2
      port: 8080
EOF
```

Once the HTTPRoute resource is created, ensure both HTTPRoute resources show _Accepted_ and the Application Gateway for Containers resource is _Programmed_.
```bash
kubectl get httproute contoso-route -n test-infra -o yaml
kubectl get httproute fabrikam-route -n test-infra -o yaml
```

Verify the status of the Application Gateway for Containers resource is successfully updated for each HTTPRoute.

```yaml
status:
  parents:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T22:18:23Z"
      message: ""
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: ResolvedRefs
      status: "True"
      type: ResolvedRefs
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T22:18:23Z"
      message: Route is Accepted
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Accepted
      status: "True"
      type: Accepted
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T22:18:23Z"
      message: Application Gateway For Containers resource has been successfully updated.
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Programmed
      status: "True"
      type: Programmed
    controllerName: alb.networking.azure.io/alb-controller
    parentRef:
      group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
      name: gateway-01
      namespace: test-infra
  ```

## Test access to the application

Now we're ready to send some traffic to our sample application, via the FQDN assigned to the frontend. Use the following command to get the FQDN.

```bash
fqdn=$(kubectl get gateway gateway-01 -n test-infra -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
```

If you specify the server name indicator using the curl command, `contoso.com` for the frontend FQDN, it returns a response from the backend-v1 service.

```bash
fqdnIp=$(dig +short $fqdn)
curl -k --resolve contoso.com:80:$fqdnIp http://contoso.com
```

Via the response we should see:
```json
{
 "path": "/",
 "host": "contoso.com",
 "method": "GET",
 "proto": "HTTP/1.1",
 "headers": {
  "Accept": [
   "*/*"
  ],
  "User-Agent": [
   "curl/7.81.0"
  ],
  "X-Forwarded-For": [
   "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
  ],
  "X-Forwarded-Proto": [
   "http"
  ],
  "X-Request-Id": [
   "dcd4bcad-ea43-4fb6-948e-a906380dcd6d"
  ]
 },
 "namespace": "test-infra",
 "ingress": "",
 "service": "",
 "pod": "backend-v1-5b8fd96959-f59mm"
}
```

If you specify the server name indicator using the curl command, `fabrikam.com` for the frontend FQDN, it returns a response from the backend-v1 service.

```bash
fqdnIp=$(dig +short $fqdn)
curl -k --resolve fabrikam.com:80:$fqdnIp http://fabrikam.com
```

Via the response we should see:
```json
{
 "path": "/",
 "host": "fabrikam.com",
 "method": "GET",
 "proto": "HTTP/1.1",
 "headers": {
  "Accept": [
   "*/*"
  ],
  "User-Agent": [
   "curl/7.81.0"
  ],
  "X-Forwarded-For": [
   "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
  ],
  "X-Forwarded-Proto": [
   "http"
  ],
  "X-Request-Id": [
   "adae8cc1-8030-4d95-9e05-237dd4e3941b"
  ]
 },
 "namespace": "test-infra",
 "ingress": "",
 "service": "",
 "pod": "backend-v2-594bd59865-ppv9w"
}
```

Congratulations, you have installed ALB Controller, deployed a backend application and routed traffic to two different backend services via different hostnames via Gateway API on Application Gateway for Containers.
