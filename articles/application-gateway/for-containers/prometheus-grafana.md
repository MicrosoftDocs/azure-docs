# Configure Application Gateway for Containers for Prometheus and Grafana

Establishing monitoring for Application Gateway for Containers is crucial part of successful operations. Firstly, it allows you to visualize how traffic is controlled, providing actionable insights that help optimize performance and troubleshoot issues promptly. Secondly, monitoring enhances security measures by providing valuable insights during investigations, ensuring that your gateway remains secure and resilient against threats. Implementing monitoring for your Application Gateway for Containers not only supports ongoing performance optimization but also strengthens your overall security posture by enabling proactive detection and response capabilities.

You can monitor Azure Application Gateway for Containers resources in the following ways. Refer to the diagram.
- [Backend Health Metrics](../../application-gateway/for-containers/application-gateway-for-containers-metrics.md): ALB Controller's metric and backend health endpoints exposes several metrics and summary of backend health. The metrics endpoint enables exposure to Prometheus.
  
- [Metrics](../../application-gateway/for-containers/application-gateway-for-containers-metrics.md): Metrics and Activity Logs are exposed through Azure Monitor to monitor the performance of your Application Gateway for Containers deployments. The metrics contain numerical values in an ordered set of time-series data.
  
- [Diagnostic Logs](../../application-gateway/for-containers/diagnostics.md): Access Logs audit all requests made to Application Gateway for Containers. Logs can provide several characteristics, such as the client's IP, requested URL, request latencies, return code, and bytes in and out. An access log is collected every 60 seconds.

## Learn About the Services
- [What is Azure Managed Prometheus?](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)
   - Why use Prometheus:  Azure Prometheus offers native integration and management capabilities, simplifying the setup and management of monitoring infrastructure.
- [What is Azure Managed Grafana?](../../managed-grafana/overview.md)
   - Why use Grafana: Azure Managed Grafana lets you bring together all your telemetry data into one place and Built-in support for Azure Monitor and Azure Data Explorer using Microsoft Entra identities.
- [What is Azure Log Analytics Workspace?](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview)
   - Why use Log Analytics Workspace: Log Analytics workspace scales with your business needs, handling large volumes of log data efficiently and detects and diagnose issues quickly.

3. Expand **Monitoring**, select **Insights**, and select **Configure Monitoring**.
   
    [ ![A screenshot of monitoring metrics.](./media/prometheus-grafana/grafana-container.png) ](./media/prometheus-grafana/grafana-container.png#lightbox)

    Create new instances of Log analytics, Azure Monitor (Prometheus), and Managed Grafana to store current Kubernetes cluster metrics.
4. In **Search resources, service, and docs**, type **Managed Prometheus** and select.
   
   [ ![A screenshot of Prometheus Managed.](./media/prometheus-grafana/managed-prometheus.png) ](./media/prometheus-grafana/managed-prometheus.png#lightbox)
   
5.  Follow the steps to enable Azure Monitor to enable Managed Prometheus service by selecting **Create**.
6.  Create Azure Monitor Workspace Instance:
     1. In the **Create** an Azure Monitor Workspace page, select a subscription and resource group.
     2. Provide a name and a region for the workspace.
     3. Select **Review + create** to create the workspace.
7. Add Prometheus Config Map to your cluster:
   1. Copy this file to notepad or Visual Studio Code:  https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/blob/main/otelcollector/configmaps/ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml.
   2. Modify line 35 to set podannotationnamespaceregex  from “” to "azure-alb-system".
      ```Bash
      # Example Kusto Query
      podannotationnamespaceregex = "azure-alb-system"
      ```
    3. Save the file as configprometheus.yaml.
    4. Add file into CLI (command-line interfaces) under manage files.
    5. Run the following command:
      ```Bash
      # Run the Following Command in Bash
      kubectl apply -f configprometheus.yaml
      ```
8. [Create a managed Grafana](../../managed-grafana/quickstart-managed-grafana-portal.md).
    Link a Grafana Workspace:
    - In **Search resources, service, and docs**, type **Azure Monitor**.
    - Select your monitor workspace. 
    - Select **Linked Grafana Workspaces**.
     ![A screenshot of Grafana Link.](./media/prometheus-grafana/grafana-link.png)
9. Select a Grafana workspace.
10. Select **Link**.


## Configure Kubernetes cluster for logging
We created the resources and now we combine all resources and configure prometheus.

1. Cluster configuration 
   1. In **Search resources, service, and docs**, search for your kubernetes cluster.
   2. Search for insights and Select on **Configure Monitoring**.
2. Specify each instance: 
    - Log analytics workspace: Use the default new log analytics workspace created for you.
    - Managed Prometheus: Select on **“Enable Prometheus metrics”** checkbox.
        -   Select on advanced setting: specify the Azure monitor workspace recently created.
    - Grafana Workspace: Select on **Enable Grafana** checkbox.
        -   Select on advanced setting: specify the Grafana instance recently created. 
   - Select **“Configure”**.
