# URL Rewrite for Azure Application Gateway for Containers - Gateway API (preview)

Application Gateway for Containers allows you to rewrite the URL of a client request, including the requests' hostname and/or path.  When Application Gateway for Containers initiates the request to the backend target, the request contains the newly rewritten URL to initiate the request.


## Usage details

URL Rewrites take advantage of [filters](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1.HTTPURLRewriteFilter) as defined by Kubernetes Gateway API.

## Background
URL rewrite enables you to translate an incoming request to a different URL when initiated to a backend target.

See the following figure, which illustrates an example of a request destined for _contoso.com/shop_ being rewritten to _contoso.com/ecommerce_ when the request is initiated to the backend target by Application Gateway for Containers:

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Application Gateway for Containers is currently in PREVIEW.<br>
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

1. If following the BYO deployment strategy, ensure you have set up your Application Gateway for Containers resources and [ALB Controller](quickstart-deploy-application-gateway-for-containers-alb-controller.md)
2. If following the ALB managed deployment strategy, ensure you have provisioned your [ALB Controller](quickstart-deploy-application-gateway-for-containers-alb-controller.md) and provisioned the Application Gateway for Containers resources via the  [ApplicationLoadBalancer custom resource](quickstart-create-application-gateway-for-containers-managed-by-alb-controller.md).
3. Deploy sample HTTP application
  Apply the following deployment.yaml file on your cluster to create a sample web application to demonstrate path, query, and header based routing.  
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f https://trafficcontrollerdocs.blob.core.windows.net/examples/traffic-split-scenario/deployment.yaml
  ```
  
  This command creates the following on your cluster:
  - a namespace called `test-infra`
  - 2 services called `backend-v1` and `backend-v2` in the `test-infra` namespace
  - 2 deployments called `backend-v1` and `backend-v2` in the `test-infra` namespace

## Deploy the required Gateway API resources

# [ALB managed deployment](#tab/alb-managed)

1. Create a Gateway
```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-01
  namespace: test-infra
  annotations:
    alb.networking.azure.io/alb-namespace: alb-test-infra
    alb.networking.azure.io/alb-name: alb-test
spec:
  gatewayClassName: azure-alb-external
  listeners:
  - name: http-listener
    port: 80
    protocol: HTTP
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: Same
EOF
```

[!INCLUDE [application-gateway-for-containers-frontend-naming](../../../includes/application-gateway-for-containers-frontend-naming.md)]

# [Bring your own (BYO) deployment](#tab/byo)

1. Set the following environment variables

```bash
RESOURCE_GROUP='<resource group name of the Application Gateway For Containers resource>'
RESOURCE_NAME='alb-test'

RESOURCE_ID=$(az network alb show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $RESOURCE_NAME --query id -o tsv)
FRONTEND_NAME='frontend'
```

2. Create a Gateway
```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-01
  namespace: test-infra
  annotations:
    alb.networking.azure.io/alb-id: $RESOURCE_ID
spec:
  gatewayClassName: azure-alb-external
  listeners:
  - name: http-listener
    port: 80
    protocol: HTTP
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: Same
  addresses:
  - type: alb.networking.azure.io/alb-frontend
    value: $FRONTEND_NAME
EOF
```

---

Once the gateway resource has been created, ensure the status is valid, the listener is _Programmed_, and an address is assigned to the gateway.
```bash
kubectl get gateway gateway-01 -n test-infra -o yaml
```

Example output of successful gateway creation.
```yaml
status:
  addresses:
  - type: IPAddress
    value: xxxx.yyyy.alb.azure.com
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
    message: Valid Gateway
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Accepted
    status: "True"
    type: Accepted
  - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
    message: Application Gateway For Containers resource has been successfully updated.
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Programmed
    status: "True"
    type: Programmed
  listeners:
  - attachedRoutes: 0
    conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
      message: ""
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: ResolvedRefs
      status: "True"
      type: ResolvedRefs
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
      message: Listener is accepted
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Accepted
      status: "True"
      type: Accepted
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
      message: Application Gateway For Containers resource has been successfully updated.
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Programmed
      status: "True"
      type: Programmed
    name: https-listener
    supportedKinds:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: HTTPRoute
```

Once the gateway has been created, create an HTTPRoute resources for `contoso.com`.  This example ensures traffic sent to `contoso.com/shop` is initiated as `contoso.com/ecommerce` to the backend target.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: rewrite-example
  namespace: test-infra
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: gateway-01
  hostnames:
  - "contoso.com"
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /shop
    - filters:
      - type: URLRewrite
        urlRewrite:
          path:
            type: ReplacePrefixMatch
            replacePrefixMatch: /ecommerce
      backendRefs:
        - name: backend-v1
          port: 8080
    - backendRefs:
        - name: backend-v2
          port: 8080
EOF
```

Once the HTTPRoute resource has been created, ensure the HTTPRoute resource shows _Accepted_ and the Application Gateway for Containers resource has been _Programmed_.
```bash
kubectl get httproute rewrite-example -n test-infra -o yaml
```

Verify the status of the Application Gateway for Containers resource has been successfully updated for each HTTPRoute.

```yaml
status:
  parents:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T22:18:23Z"
      message: ""
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: ResolvedRefs
      status: "True"
      type: ResolvedRefs
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T22:18:23Z"
      message: Route is Accepted
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Accepted
      status: "True"
      type: Accepted
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T22:18:23Z"
      message: Application Gateway For Containers resource has been successfully updated.
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Programmed
      status: "True"
      type: Programmed
    controllerName: alb.networking.azure.io/alb-controller
    parentRef:
      group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
      name: gateway-01
      namespace: test-infra
  ```

## Test access to the application

Now we're ready to send some traffic to our sample application, via the FQDN assigned to the frontend. Use the following command to get the FQDN.

```bash
fqdn=$(kubectl get gateway gateway-01 -n test-infra -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
```

Specifying server name indicator using the curl command, `contoso.com/shop` should return a response from the backend-v1 service with the requested path to the backend target showing `contoso.com/ecommerce`.

```bash
fqdnIp=$(dig +short $fqdn)
curl -k --resolve contoso.com:80:$fqdnIp http://contoso.com/shop
```

Via the response we should see:
```json
{
 "path": "/ecommerce",
 "host": "contoso.com",
 "method": "GET",
 "proto": "HTTP/1.1",
 "headers": {
  "Accept": [
   "*/*"
  ],
  "User-Agent": [
   "curl/7.81.0"
  ],
  "X-Forwarded-For": [
   "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
  ],
  "X-Forwarded-Proto": [
   "http"
  ],
  "X-Request-Id": [
   "dcd4bcad-ea43-4fb6-948e-a906380dcd6d"
  ]
 },
 "namespace": "test-infra",
 "ingress": "",
 "service": "",
 "pod": "backend-v1-5b8fd96959-f59mm"
}
```

Specifying server name indicator using the curl command, `contoso.com` should return a response from the backend-v2 service.

```bash
fqdnIp=$(dig +short $fqdn)
curl -k --resolve contoso.com:80:$fqdnIp http://contoso.com
```

Via the response we should see:
```json
{
 "path": "/",
 "host": "contoso.com",
 "method": "GET",
 "proto": "HTTP/1.1",
 "headers": {
  "Accept": [
   "*/*"
  ],
  "User-Agent": [
   "curl/7.81.0"
  ],
  "X-Forwarded-For": [
   "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
  ],
  "X-Forwarded-Proto": [
   "http"
  ],
  "X-Request-Id": [
   "adae8cc1-8030-4d95-9e05-237dd4e3941b"
  ]
 },
 "namespace": "test-infra",
 "ingress": "",
 "service": "",
 "pod": "backend-v2-594bd59865-ppv9w"
}
```

Congratulations, you have installed ALB Controller, deployed a backend application and used filtering to rewrite the client requested URL, prior to traffic being set to the target on Application Gateway for Containers.
