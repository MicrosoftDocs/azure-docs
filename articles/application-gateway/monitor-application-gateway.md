# Monitoring Azure Application Gateway
<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order -->
<!-- Most services can use this section unchanged. Add to it if there are any unique charges if your service has significant monitoring beyond Azure Monitor. -->

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. 

This article describes the monitoring data generated by Azure Application Gateway. Azure Application Gateway uses  [Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/overview.md). If you're unfamiliar with the features of Azure Monitor common to all Azure services that use it, read [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md).


<!-- Optional diagram showing monitoring for your service. If you need help creating one, contact robb@microsoft.com -->

## Monitoring overview page in Azure portal
<!-- OPTIONAL. Please keep headings in this order -->
<!-- Most services can use this section unchanged. Edit it if there are any unique charges if your service has significant monitoring beyond Azure Monitor. -->

The **Overview** page in the Azure portal for each Application Gateway includes the following metrics:

- Sum Total Requests
- Sum Failed Requests
- Sum Response Status by HttpStatus
- Sum Throughput
- Sum CurrentConnections
- Avg Healthy Host Count By BackendPool HttpSettings
- Avg Unhealthy Host Count By BackendPool HttpSettings

This is just a subset of the metrics available for Application Gateway. For more information, see [Monitoring Azure Application Gateway data reference](monitor-application-gateway-reference.md).


## Azure Monitor Network Insights

Some services in Azure have a special focused pre-built monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These special dashboards are called "insights".

<!-- Give a quick outline of what your "insight page" provides and refer to another article that gives details -->

Azure Monitor Network Insights provides a comprehensive view of health and metrics for all deployed network resources (including Application Gateway), without requiring any configuration. For more information, see [Azure Monitor Network Insights](../network-watcher/network-insights-overview.md).

## Monitoring data 

<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order -->
Azure Application Gateway collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md#monitoring-data). 

See [Monitoring Azure Application Gateway data reference](monitor-application-gateway-reference.md) for detailed information on the metrics and logs metrics created by Azure Application Gateway.

<!-- If your service has additional non-Azure Monitor monitoring data then outline and refer to that here. Also include that information in the data reference as appropriate. -->

## Collection and routing

<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order -->

Platform metrics and the Activity log are collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.  

Resource Logs are not collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations.

<!-- Include any additional information on collecting logs.  The number of things that diagnostics settings control is expanding -->

See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](../azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings.md) for the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for Azure Application Gateway are listed in [Azure Application Gateway monitoring data reference](monitor-application-gateway-reference.md#resource-logs).

<!-- OPTIONAL: Add specific examples of configuration for this service. For example, CLI and PowerShell commands for creating diagnostic setting. Ideally, customers should set up a policy to automatically turn on collection for services. Azure monitor has Resource Manager template examples you can point to. See https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/samples/resource-manager-diagnostic-settings.  Contact azmondocs@microsoft.com if you have questions.   -->

The metrics and logs you can collect are discussed in the following sections.

## Analyzing metrics

<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order 
If you don't support metrics, say so. Some services may be only onboarded to logs -->

You can analyze metrics for Azure Application Gateway with metrics from other Azure services using metrics explorer by opening **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Analyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer](../azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics.md) for details on using this tool. 

<!-- Point to the list of metrics available in your monitor-service-reference article. -->
For a list of the platform metrics collected for Azure Application Gateway, see [Monitoring Application Gateway data reference metrics](monitor-application-gateway-reference.md#metrics).  


For reference, you can see a list of [all resource metrics supported in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md).

<!--  Optional: Call out additional information to help your customers. For example, you can include additional information here about how to use metrics explorer specifically for your service. Remember that the UI is subject to change quite often so you will need to maintain these screenshots yourself if you add them in. -->

## Analyzing logs

<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order
If you don't support resource logs, say so. Some services may be only onboarded to metrics and the activity log. -->

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.  

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Common and service-specific schema for Azure Resource Logs](../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema.md#top-level-common-schema). 

The [Activity log](../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log.md) is a platform login Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.  

For a list of the types of resource logs collected for Azure Application Gateway, see [Monitoring Azure Application Gateway data reference](monitor-application-gateway-reference.md#resource-logs).

For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs and queryable by Log Analytics, see [Monitoring Azure Application Gateway data reference](monitor-application-gateway-reference.md#azure-monitor-logs-tables).  

<!--  Optional: Call out additional information to help your customers. For example, you can include additional information here about log usage or what logs are most important. Remember that the UI is subject to change quite often so you will need to maintain these screenshots yourself if you add them in. -->

### Sample Kusto queries

<!-- REQUIRED if you support logs. Please keep headings in this order -->
<!-- Add sample Log Analytics Kusto queries for your service. -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the Application Gateway menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current Application Gateway. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other Application Gateways or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/scope/) for details.

<!-- REQUIRED: Include queries that are helpful for figuring out the health and state of your service. Ideally, use some of these queries in the alerts section. It's possible that some of your queries may be in the Log Analytics UI (sample or example queries). Check if so.  -->

You can use the following queries to help you monitor your Application Gateway resource. 

<!-- Put in a code section here. -->  
```Kusto
// Requests per hour 
// Count of the incoming requests on the Application Gateway. 
// To create an alert for this query, click '+ New alert rule'
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceType == "APPLICATIONGATEWAYS" and OperationName == "ApplicationGatewayAccess"
| summarize AggregatedValue = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), _ResourceId
| render timechart 
```

```kusto
// Failed requests per hour 
// Count of requests to which Application Gateway responded with an error. 
// To create an alert for this query, click '+ New alert rule'
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceType == "APPLICATIONGATEWAYS" and OperationName == "ApplicationGatewayAccess" and httpStatus_d > 399
| summarize AggregatedValue = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), _ResourceId
| render timechart
```

```kusto
// Top 10 Client IPs 
// Count of requests per client IP. 
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceType == "APPLICATIONGATEWAYS" and OperationName == "ApplicationGatewayAccess"
| summarize AggregatedValue = count() by clientIP_s
| top 10 by AggregatedValue
```

```kusto
// Errors by user agent 
// Number of errors by user agent. 
// To create an alert for this query, click '+ New alert rule'
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceType == "APPLICATIONGATEWAYS" and OperationName == "ApplicationGatewayAccess" and httpStatus_d > 399
| summarize AggregatedValue = count() by userAgent_s, _ResourceId
| sort by AggregatedValue desc
```

## Alerts

<!-- SUGGESTED: Include useful alerts on metrics, logs, log conditions or activity log. Ask your PMs if you don't know. 
This information is the BIGGEST request we get in Azure Monitor so do not avoid it long term. People don't know what to monitor for best results. Be prescriptive  
-->

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts on [metrics](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-metric-overview.md), [logs](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log.md), and the [activity log](../azure-monitor/alerts/activity-log-alerts.md). Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks

<!-- only include next line if applications run on your service and work with App Insights. --> 

If you're creating or running an application which use Application Gateway [Azure Monitor Application Insights](../azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview.md) may offer additional types of alerts.
<!-- end -->

The following tables list common and recommended alert rules for Application Gateway.

<!-- Fill in the table with metric and log alerts that would be valuable for your service. Change the format as necessary to make it more readable -->

**Application Gateway v1**

| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
|Metric|CPU utilization crosses 80%|Under normal conditions, CPU usage should not regularly exceed 90%, as this may cause latency in the websites hosted behind the Application Gateway and disrupt the client experience.|
|Metric|Unhealthy host count crosses threshold|Indicates the number of backend servers that Application Gateway is unable to probe successfully. This catches issues where the Application Gateway instances are unable to connect to the backend. Alert if this number goes above 20% of backend capacity.|
|Metric|Response status (4xx, 5xx) crosses threshold|When Application Gateway response status is 4xx or 5xx. There could be occasional 4xx or 5xx response seen due to transient issues. You should observe the gateway in production to determine static threshold or use dynamic threshold for the alert.|
|Metric|Failed requests crosses threshold|When failed requests metric crosses a threshold. You should observe the gateway in production to determine static threshold or use dynamic threshold for the alert.|


**Application Gateway v2**

| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
|Metric|Compute Unit utilization crosses 75% of average usage|Compute unit is the measure of compute utilization of your Application Gateway. Check your average compute unit usage in the last one month and set alert if it crosses 75% of it.|
|Metric|Capacity Unit utilization crosses 75% of peak usage|Capacity units represent overall gateway utilization in terms of throughput, compute, and connection count. Check your maximum capacity unit usage in the last one month and set alert if it crosses 75% of it.|
|Metric|Unhealthy host count crosses threshold|Indicates number of backend servers that application gateway is unable to probe successfully. This will catch issues where Application gateway instances are unable to connect to the backend. Alert if this number goes above 20% of backend capacity.|
|Metric|Response status (4xx, 5xx) crosses threshold|When Application Gateway response status is 4xx or 5xx. There could be occasional 4xx or 5xx response seen due to transient issues. You should observe the gateway in production to determine static threshold or use dynamic threshold for the alert.|
|Metric|Failed requests crosses threshold|When Failed requests metric crosses threshold. You should observe the gateway in production to determine static threshold or use dynamic threshold for the alert.|
|Metric|Backend last byte response time crosses threshold|Indicates the time interval between start of establishing a connection to backend server and receiving the last byte of the response body. Create an alert if the backend response latency is more that certain threshold from usual.|
|Metric|Application Gateway total time crosses threshold|This is the interval from the time when Application Gateway receives the first byte of the HTTP request to the time when the last response byte has been sent to the client. Should create an alert if the backend response latency is more that certain threshold from usual.|
