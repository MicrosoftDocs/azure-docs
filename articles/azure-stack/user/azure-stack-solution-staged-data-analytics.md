# Tutorial: Create a staged data analytics solution with Azure and Azure Stack 

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

Learn how to use both on-premises and public cloud environments to meet the demands of multi-facility enterprises. Azure Stack offers a rapid, secure, and flexible solution for collecting, processing, storing, and distributing local and remote data, particularly when security, confidentiality, corporate policy, and regulatory requirements may differ between locations and users.

In this pattern, your customers are collecting data that requires analysis at the point of collection so that quick decisions can be made. Often this data collection occurs with no Internet access. When connectivity is established, you may need to do a resource-intensive analysis of the data to gain additional insight. You can still analyze data when a public cloud is too late or unavailable.

In this tutorial, build a sample environment to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Create the raw data storage blob.
> - Create a New Azure Stack Function to move clean data from Azure Stack to Azure.
> - Create a Blob storage triggered function.
> - Create an Azure Stack storage account containing a blob and a queue.
> - Create a queue triggered function.
> - Test the queue triggered function.

> Microsoft Azure Stack is an extension of Azure. Azure Stack brings the agility and innovation of cloud computing to your on-premises environment and enabling the only hybrid cloud that allows you to build and deploy hybrid apps anywhere.  
> 
> The whitepaper [Design Considerations for Hybrid Applications](https://aka.ms/hybrid-cloud-applications-pillars) reviews pillars of software quality (placement, scalability, availability, resiliency, manageability and security) for designing, deploying, and operating hybrid applications. The design considerations assist in optimizing hybrid application design, minimizing challenges in production environments.

## Prerequisites

Some preparation is required to build this solution:

-   An installed and functioning Azure Stack (more information can be found here: [Azure Stack overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-storage-overview))

-   An Azure subscription. (Create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F))

-   Download and install the [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/).

-   You will need to provide your own data to be processed by the functions. Data must be generated and available to upload to the Azure Stack storage blob container.

## Issues and Considerations

### Scalability considerations

Azure functions and storage solutions scale to meet data volume and processing demands. For Azure scalability information and targets, see [Azure scalability documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-scalability-targets).

### Availability considerations

Storage is the primary availability consideration for this pattern. Connection via fast links is required for large data volume processing and distribution.

### Manageability considerations

Consider how your development tools and source control will enable you to manage your solution.

## Create the raw data storage blob

The storage account and blob container will hold all original data generated by on-premises activities, including machine and employee activity, facility data, production metrics, and other reporting.

1.  Sign in to the [*Azure Stack portal*](https://portal.local.azurestack.external/).

2.  In the Azure Stack portal, expand the menu on the left side to open the menu of services and choose **All Services**. Scroll down to **Storage** and choose **Storage accounts**. In the Storage Accounts window, choose **Add**.

3.  Use the following information for the account:

    a.  Name: **Your choice**

    b.  Deployment model: **Resource Manager**

    c.  Account kind: **Storage (general-purpose V1)**

    d.  Location: **West US**

    e.  Replication: **Locally redundant storage (LRS)**

    f.  Performance: **Standard**

    g.  Secure transfer required: **Disabled**

    h.  Subscription: Choose one

    i.  Resource group: Specify a new resource group or select an     existing resource group

    j.  Configure virtual networks: **Disabled**

4.  Select **Create to create the storage account**.

5.  Once created, select the name of the storage account.

6.  In the account blade, under the **BLOB SERVICE** heading, select **Containers**.

7.  At the top of the blade, select **+ Container.**and select **Container**.

    ![Alt text](media\azure-stack-solution-staged-data-analytics\image2.png)

8.  Name: **Your Choice**

9.  Public access level: **Container** (anonymous read access for containers and blobs)

10.  Select **OK**.

## Create an Azure Stack function

Create a new Azure Stack function to move clean data from Azure Stack to Azure.

### Create the Azure Stack function app

1. Sign into the [Azure Stack portal](https://portal.local.azurestack.external).
2. Select **All services**.
3. Select **Function Apps** in the **Web + Mobile** group.

4.  Create the function app using the settings specified in the table below the image.

    | Setting | Suggested value | Description |
    | ---- | ---- | ---- |
    | App name | Globally unique name | Name that identifies your new function app. Valid characters are `a`-`z`, `0``-9`, and `-`. |
    | Subscription | Your subscription | The subscription under which this new function app is created. |
    | **Resource Group** |  |  |
    | myResourceGroup | Name for the new resource group in which to create your function app. |  |
    | OS | Windows | Serverless hosting is currently only available when running on Windows. |
    | **Hosting plan** |  |  |
    | Consumption plan | Hosting plan that defines how resources are allocated to your function app. In the default Consumption Plan, resources are added dynamically as required by your functions. In this serverless hosting, you only pay for the time your functions run. |  |
    | Location | Region nearest you | Choose a region near you or near other services your functions access. |
    | **Storage account** |  |  |
    | \<storage account created above> | Name of the new storage account used by your function app. Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length. The name may only use numbers and lowercase letters. You can also use an existing account. |  |

    **Example:**
