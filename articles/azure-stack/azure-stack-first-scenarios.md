# First scenarios to try

The primary objects in Microsoft Azure Stack – plans, offers, and subscriptions – provide IaaS services to tenants, such as virtual machines, web sites, and so on. It is these services that provide value to your tenants. Below are four common tasks used by service administrators and tenants in this area (or something like that)

1.  [As a service administrator, create a plan (to provide compute, network, and storage services).](azure-stack-create-plan.md)

2.  [As a service administrator, create an offer (which contains the plan).](azure-stack-create-offer.md)

3.  [As a tenant, subscribe to the offer (which grants access to the offer’s plans).](azure-stack-subscribe-plan-provision-vm.md#subscribe-to-an-offer)

4.  [As a tenant, use the services provided by the offer’s plan to create a virtual machine.](azure-stack-subscribe-plan-provision-vm.md#provision-a-virtual-machine)
