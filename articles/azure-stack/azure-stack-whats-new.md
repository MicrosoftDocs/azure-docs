# What's new in Azure Stack
This release provides new features for both tenants and administrators.

## Content, services, and tools
* Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) support provides identity options for scenarios where network connectivity is limited or intermittent.
* You can use Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets to provide managed scale out of workloads.
* Use Azure D-Series VM sizes for increased performance and consistency.
* Deploy and create templates with Temp Disks that are consistent with Azure.
* Marketplace Syndication allows you to use content from the Azure Marketplace and make available in Azure Stack.

## Infrastructure and operations
* Isolated administrator and user portals and APIs provide enhanced security.
* Use enhanced infrastructure management functionality, such as improved alerting.
* Using the Windows Azure Pack connector, you can view and manage IaaS virtual machines that are hosted on a Cloud Platform System (CPS) stamp. For this preview release, you can try this only with a CPS environment and additional configuration is required.

## Next steps
* [Understand Azure Stack POC architecture](azure-stack-architecture.md)      
* [Understand deployment prerequisites](azure-stack-deploy.md)
* [Deploy Azure Stack](azure-stack-run-powershell-script.md)
