# Update the SQL resource provider

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems.*

A new SQL resource provider might be released when Azure Stack is updated to a new build. Although the existing adapter continues to work, we recommend updating to the latest build as soon as possible.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>You must install updates in the order they're released. You can't skip versions. Refer to the versions list in [Deploy the resource provider prerequisites](.\azure-stack-sql-resource-provider-deploy.md#prerequisites).

## Overview

To update the resource provider, use the *UpdateSQLProvider.ps1* script. This script is included with the download of the new SQL resource provider. The update process is similar to the process used to [Deploy the resource provider](.\azure-stack-sql-resource-provider-deploy.md). The update script uses the same arguments as the DeploySqlProvider.ps1 script, and you'll need to provide certificate information.

### Update script processes

The *UpdateSQLProvider.ps1* script creates a new virtual machine (VM) with the latest resource provider code.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you download the latest Windows Server 2016 Core image from Marketplace Management. If you need to install an update, you can place a **single** MSU package in the local dependency path. The script will fail if there's more than one MSU file in this location.

After the *UpdateSQLProvider.ps1* script creates a new VM, the script migrates the following settings from the old provider VM:

* database information
* hosting server information
* required DNS record

### Update script PowerShell example

You can edit and run the following script from an elevated PowerShell ISE. 

Remember to change the account information and passwords as needed for your environment.

> [!NOTE]
> This update process only applies to Azure Stack integrated systems.

```powershell
# Install the AzureRM.Bootstrapper module and set the profile.
Install-Module -Name AzureRm.BootStrapper -Force
Use-AzureRmProfile -Profile 2017-03-09-profile

# Use the NetBIOS name for the Azure Stack domain. On the Azure Stack SDK, the default is AzureStack but this might have been changed at installation.
$domain = "AzureStack"

# For integrated systems, use the IP address of one of the ERCS virtual machines.
$privilegedEndpoint = "AzS-ERCS01"

# Provide the Azure environment used for deploying Azure Stack. Required only for Azure AD deployments. Supported environment names are AzureCloud, AzureUSGovernment, or AzureChinaCloud. 
$AzureEnvironment = "<EnvironmentName>"

# Point to the directory where the resource provider installation files were extracted.
$tempDir = 'C:\TEMP\SQLRP'

# The service administrator account (this can be Azure AD or AD FS).
$serviceAdmin = "admin@mydomain.onmicrosoft.com"
$AdminPass = ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd1" -AsPlainText -Force
$AdminCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($serviceAdmin, $AdminPass)

# Set the credentials for the new resource provider VM.
$vmLocalAdminPass = ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd1" -AsPlainText -Force
$vmLocalAdminCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("sqlrpadmin", $vmLocalAdminPass)

# Add the cloudadmin credential required for privileged endpoint access.
$CloudAdminPass = ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd1" -AsPlainText -Force
$CloudAdminCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("$domain\cloudadmin", $CloudAdminPass)

# Change the following as appropriate.
$PfxPass = ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd1" -AsPlainText -Force

# Change directory to the folder where you extracted the installation files.
# Then adjust the endpoints.
. $tempDir\UpdateSQLProvider.ps1 -AzCredential $AdminCreds `
  -VMLocalCredential $vmLocalAdminCreds `
  -CloudAdminCredential $cloudAdminCreds `
  -PrivilegedEndpoint $privilegedEndpoint `
  -AzureEnvironment $AzureEnvironment `
  -DefaultSSLCertificatePassword $PfxPass `
  -DependencyFilesLocalPath $tempDir\cert `

 ```

## UpdateSQLProvider.ps1 parameters

You can specify the following parameters from the command line when you run the script. If you don't, or if any parameter validation fails, you're prompted to provide the required parameters.

| Parameter name | Description | Comment or default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CloudAdminCredential** | The credential for the cloud administrator, necessary for accessing the privileged endpoint. | _Required_ |
| **AzCredential** | The credentials for the Azure Stack service administrator account. Use the same credentials that you used for deploying Azure Stack. | _Required_ |
| **VMLocalCredential** | The credentials for the local administrator account of the SQL resource provider VM. | _Required_ |
| **PrivilegedEndpoint** | The IP address or DNS name of the privileged endpoint. |  _Required_ |
| **AzureEnvironment** | The Azure environment of the service admin account which you used for deploying Azure Stack. Required only for Azure AD deployments. Supported environment names are **AzureCloud**, **AzureUSGovernment**, or if using a China Azure AD, **AzureChinaCloud**. | AzureCloud |
| **DependencyFilesLocalPath** | You must also put your certificate .pfx file in this directory. | _Optional for single node, but mandatory for multi-node_ |
| **DefaultSSLCertificatePassword** | The password for the .pfx certificate. | _Required_ |
| **MaxRetryCount** | The number of times you want to retry each operation if there's a failure.| 2 |
