# Quickstart: Deploy an existing container image in the Azure portal

Azure Container Apps enables you to run microservices and containerized applications on a serverless platform. With Container Apps, you enjoy the benefits of running containers while leaving behind the concerns of manually configuring cloud infrastructure and complex container orchestrators.

This article demonstrates how to deploy an existing container to Azure Container Apps using the Azure portal.

> [!NOTE]
> Private registry authorization is supported via registry username and password.

## Prerequisites

- Azure account with an active subscription.
  - If you don't have one, you [can create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
## Setup

Begin by signing in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Create a container app

To create your container app, start at the Azure portal home page.

1. Search for **Container Apps** in the top search bar.
1. Select **Container Apps** in the search results.
1. Select the **Create** button.

### Basics tab

In the *Basics* tab, do the following actions.

#### Enter project details

| Setting | Action |
|---|---|
| Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
| Resource group | Select **Create new** and enter **my-container-apps**. |
| Container app name | Enter **my-container-app**. |

#### Create an environment

1. In the *Create Container App environment* field, select **Create new**.
1. In the *Create Container App Environment* page on the *Basics* tab, enter the following values:

    | Setting | Value |
    |---|---|
    | Environment name | Enter **my-environment**. |
    | Region | Select **Canada Central**. |

1. Select the **Monitoring** tab to create a Log Analytics workspace.
1. Select **Create new** in the *Log Analytics workspace* field.
1. Enter **my-container-apps-logs** in the *Name* field of the *Create new Log Analytics Workspace* dialog.
  
    The *Location* field is pre-filled with *Canada Central* for you.

1. Select **OK**.
1. Select the **Create** button at the bottom of the *Create Container App Environment* page.
1. Select the **Next: App settings** button at the bottom of the page.

### App settings tab

In the *App settings* tab, do the following actions:

::: zone pivot="container-apps-private-registry"
| Setting | Action |
|---|---|
| Use quickstart image | **Uncheck** the checkbox. |
| Name | Enter **my-portal-app**. |
| Image source | Select your container image repository source. If your container is hosted in a registry other than **Azure Container Registry**, select **Docker Hub or other registries**. |
| Image type | Select **Private**. |
| Registry login server | Enter the domain (including subdomain) of your container registry. |
| Registry user name | Enter your user name for the registry. |
| Registry password | Enter your password for the registry. |
| Image and tag | Enter the image name, including tag. |
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="container-apps-public-registry"
| Setting | Action |
|---|---|
| Use quickstart image | **Uncheck** the checkbox. |
| Name | Enter **my-portal-app**. |
| Image source | Select your container image repository source. If your container is hosted in a registry other than **Azure Container Registry**, select **Docker Hub or other registries**. |
| Registry login server | Enter the domain (including subdomain) of your container registry. |
| Image type | Select **Public**. |
| Image and tag | Enter the image name, including tag. |

#### Application ingress settings

| Setting | Action |
|---|---|
| Ingress | Select **Enabled** or **Disabled**. |

If you enabled ingress, configure the following settings:

| Setting | Action |
|---|---|
| Ingress visibility | Select **Internal** to only allow ingress from other apps in the same virtual network, and select **External** to publicly expose your container app. |
| Target port | Enter the port you want to expose your container app. |

### Deploy the container app

1. Select the **Review and create** button at the bottom of the page.  

    Next, the settings in the Container App are verified. If no errors are found, the *Create* button is enabled.  

    If there are errors, any tab containing errors is marked with a red dot. Navigate to the appropriate tab. Fields containing an error is highlighted in red. Once all errors are fixed, select **Review and create** again.

1. Select **Create**.

    A page with the message *Deployment is in progress* is displayed. Once the deployment is successfully completed, you see the message: *Your deployment is complete*.

### Verify deployment

You can verify your deployment is successful by querying the Log Analytics workspace. You might need to wait a 5 to 10 minutes for the analytics to arrive for the first time before you're able to query the logs.

After 5 to 10 minutes of creating the container app, follow these steps to view logged messages:

1. Select **Go to resource** to view your new container app.
1. Select **Logs** under the *Monitoring* header.
1. Select the **Load to editor** button from any of the cards.
1. Replace the generated code with the following query:

    ```text
    ContainerAppConsoleLogs_CL | where ContainerAppName_s == 'my-container-app' | project ContainerAppName_s, Log_s, TimeGenerated
    ```

1. Select the **Run** button.
1. Inspect the results in the table.

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this application, you can delete the Azure Container Apps instance and all the associated services by removing the resource group.

1. Select the **my-container-apps** resource group from the *Overview* section.
1. Select the **Delete resource group** button at the top of the resource group *Overview*.
1. Enter the resource group name **my-container-apps** in the *Are you sure you want to delete "my-container-apps"* confirmation dialog.
1. Select **Delete**.  
    The process to delete the resource group might take a few minutes to complete.
