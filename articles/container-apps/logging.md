# Application Logging in Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps provides two types of application logging categories:

- [Container console logs](#container-console-logs) stream from your container console.
- [System logs](#system-logs) are generated by the Azure Container Apps service.

You can view the [log streams](log-streaming.md) in near real-time in the Azure portal or CLI. For more options to store and monitor your logs, see [Logging options](log-options.md).

## Container console Logs

Console logs originate from the `stderr` and `stdout` messages from the containers in your container app and Dapr sidecars. When you implement logging in your application, you can troubleshoot problems and monitor the health of your app. 


> [!TIP]
> Instrumenting your code with well-defined log messages can help you to understand how your code is performing and to debug issues. To learn more about best practices refer to [Design for operations](/azure/architecture/guide/design-principles/design-for-operations).

## System logs

Azure Container Apps generates system logs to inform you about the status of service-level events. The log messages include the following information:

- Successfully created dapr component
- Successfully updated dapr component
- Error creating dapr component
- Successfully mounted volume
- Error mounting volume
- Successfully bound Domain
- Auth enabled on app
- Creating authentication config
- Auth config created successfully
- Setting a traffic weight
- Creating a new revision:
- Successfully provisioned revision
- Deactivating Old revisions
- Error provisioning revision

System logs emit the following messages:

| Source | Type | Message |
|---------|------|---------|
| Dapr | Info | Successfully created dapr component \<component-name\> with scope \<dapr-component-scope\> |
| Dapr | Info | Successfully updated dapr component \<component-name\> with scope \<component-type\> |
| Dapr | Error | Error creating dapr component \<component-name\> |
| Volume Mounts | Info | Successfully mounted volume \<volume-name\> for revision \<revision-scope\> |
| Volume Mounts | Error | Error mounting volume \<volume-name\> |
| Domain Binding | Info | Successfully bound Domain \<domain\> to the container app \<container app name\> |
| Authentication | Info | Auth enabled on app. Creating authentication config |
| Authentication | Info | Auth config created successfully |
| Traffic weight | Info | Setting a traffic weight of \<percentage>% for revision \<revision-name\\> |
| Revision Provisioning | Info | Creating a new revision: \<revision-name\> |
| Revision Provisioning | Info | Successfully provisioned revision \<name\> |
| Revision Provisioning | Info| Deactivating Old revisions since 'ActiveRevisionsMode=Single' |
| Revision Provisioning | Error | Error provisioning revision \<revision-name>. ErrorCode: \<[ErrImagePull]\|[Timeout]\|[ContainerCrashing]\> |
