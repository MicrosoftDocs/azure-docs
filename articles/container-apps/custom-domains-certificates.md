# Custom domain names and bring your own certificates in Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps allows you to bind one or more custom domains to a container app.

- Every domain name must be associated with a TLS/SSL certificate. You can upload your own certificate or use a [free managed certificate](custom-domains-managed-certificates.md).
- Certificates are applied to the container app environment and are bound to individual container apps. You must have role-based access to the environment to add certificates.
- [SNI (Server Name Identification) domain certificates](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) are required.
- Ingress must be enabled for the container app.

> [!NOTE]
> If you configure a [custom environment DNS (Domain Name System) suffix](environment-custom-dns-suffix.md), you can't add a custom domain that contains this suffix to your Container App.

## Add a custom domain and certificate

::: zone pivot="azure-portal"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using a new certificate, you must have an existing [SNI domain certificate](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) file available to upload to Azure.

1. Navigate to your container app in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)

1. Verify that your app has ingress enabled by selecting **Ingress** in the *Settings* section. If ingress isn't enabled, enable it with these steps:

   1. Set *HTTP Ingress* to **Enabled**.
   1. Select the desired *Ingress traffic* setting.
   1. Enter the *Target port*.
   1. Select **Save**.

1. Under the *Settings* section, select **Custom domains**.

1. Select the **Add custom domain** button.

1. In the *Add custom domain and certificate* window, in *TLS/SSL certificate*, select **Bring your own certificate**.

1. In *domain*, enter the domain you want to add.

1. Select **Add a certificate**.

1. In the *Add certificate* window, in *Certificate name*, enter a name for this certificate.

1. In *Certificate file* section, browse for the certificate file you want to upload.

1. Select **Validate**.

1. Once validation succeeds, select **Add**.

1. In the *Add custom domain and certificate* window, in *Certificate*, select the certificate you just added.

1. Select the *Hostname record type* based on the type of your domain.

    | Domain type | Record type | Notes |
    |--|--|--|
    | Apex domain | A record | An apex domain is a domain at the root level of your domain. For example, if your DNS (Domain Name System) zone is `contoso.com`, then `contoso.com` is the apex domain. |
    | Subdomain | CNAME | A subdomain is a domain that is part of another domain. For example, if your DNS zone is `contoso.com`, then `www.contoso.com` is an example of a subdomain that can be configured in the zone. |

1. Using the DNS provider that is hosting your domain, create DNS records based on the *Hostname record type* you selected using the values shown in the *Domain validation* section. The records point the domain to your container app and verify that you own it. The setup depends on whether you're using custom domains with the private endpoint (preview) feature:

    # [General](#tab/general)
    
    - If you selected *A record*, create the following DNS records:

        | Record type | Host | Value |
        |--|--|--|
        | A | `@` | The IP address of your Container Apps environment. |
        | TXT | `asuid` | The domain verification code. |

    - If you selected *CNAME*, create the following DNS records:

        | Record type | Host | Value |
        |--|--|--|
        | CNAME | The subdomain (for example, `www`) | The generated domain of your container app. |
        | TXT | `asuid.` followed by the subdomain (for example, `asuid.www`) | The domain verification code. |
    
    # [Private endpoint](#tab/private-endpoint)

    - If you selected *A record*, you need to have a private DNS zone which has the same DNS zone name as your public DNS. Create the following DNS record on your private DNS zone: 
    
        | Record type | Host | Value |
        |--|--|--|
        | A | `@` | The Private IP of your private endpoint on your container apps environment. |

        In addition, you'll need to add the following record to your public DNS zone.

        | Record type | Host | Value |
        |--|--|--|
        | TXT | `asuid` | The domain verification code. |

    - If you selected *CNAME*, create the following DNS records on your public DNS zone:

        | Record type | Host | Value |
        |--|--|--|
        | CNAME | The subdomain (for example, `www`) | The generated domain of your container app. |
        | TXT | `asuid.` followed by the subdomain (for example, `asuid.www`) | The domain verification code. |

    ---

1. Select the **Validate** button.

1. Once validation succeeds, select the **Add** button.

1. Once the operation is complete, you see your domain name in the list of custom domains with a status of *Secured*. Navigate to your domain to verify that it's accessible.

> [!NOTE]
> For container apps in internal Container Apps environments, [extra configuration](./networking.md#dns) is required to use custom domains with VNET-scope ingress.

::: zone pivot="azure-cli"

Container Apps supports apex domains and subdomains. Each domain type requires a different DNS record type and validation method.

| Domain type | Record type | Validation method | Notes |
|--|--|--|--|
| Apex domain | A record | HTTP | An apex domain is a domain at the root level of your domain. For example, if your DNS zone is `contoso.com`, then `contoso.com` is the apex domain. |
| Subdomain | CNAME | CNAME | A subdomain is a domain that is part of another domain. For example, if your DNS zone is `contoso.com`, then `www.contoso.com` is an example of a subdomain that can be configured in the zone. |

1. Log in to Azure with the Azure CLI.

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

1. Next, install the Azure Container Apps extension for the CLI.

    ```azurecli
    az extension add --name containerapp --upgrade
    ```

1. Set the following environment variables. Replace the `<PLACEHOLDERS>` with your values.

    ```azurecli
    RESOURCE_GROUP = "<RESOURCE_GROUP>"
    CONTAINER_APP = "<CONTAINER_APP>"
    ENVIRONMENT = "<ENVIRONMENT>"
    TARGET_PORT = "<TARGET_PORT>"
    DOMAIN_NAME = "<DOMAIN_NAME>"
    CERTIFICATE_LOWERCASE_NAME = "<CERTIFICATE_LOWERCASE_NAME>"
    CERTIFICATE_LOCAL_PATH = "<CERTIFICATE_LOCAL_PATH>"
    CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD = "<CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD>"
    ```

    - Replace `<CERTIFICATE_LOCAL_PATH>` with the local path of your certificate file.
    - Replace `<CERTIFICATE_LOWERCASE_NAME>` with a lowercase certificate name that is unique within the environment.
    - Replace `<TARGET_PORT>` with the port that your container app is listening on.

1. Verify that your container app has HTTP ingress enabled.

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp ingress show \
        -n $CONTAINER_APP \
        -g $RESOURCE_GROUP
    ```

    If ingress isn't enabled, enable it with these steps:

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp ingress enable \
        -n $CONTAINER_APP \
        -g $RESOURCE_GROUP \
        --type external \
        --target-port $TARGET_PORT \
        --transport auto
    ```

1. If you're configuring an apex domain, get the IP address of your Container Apps environment.

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp env show \
        -n $ENVIRONMENT \
        -g $RESOURCE_GROUP \
        -o tsv \
        --query "properties.staticIp"
    ```

1. If you're configuring a subdomain, get the automatically generated domain of your container app.

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp show \
        -n $CONTAINER_APP \
        -g $RESOURCE_GROUP \
        -o tsv \
        --query "properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn"
    ```

1. Get the domain verification code.

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp show \
        -n $CONTAINER_APP \
        -g $RESOURCE_GROUP \
        -o tsv \
        --query "properties.customDomainVerificationId"
    ```

1. Using the DNS provider that is hosting your domain, create DNS records based on the record type you selected using the values shown in the *Domain validation* section. The records point the domain to your container app and verify that you own it. The setup depends on whether you're using custom domains with the private endpoint (preview) feature:

    # [General](#tab/general)
    
    - If you selected *A record*, create the following DNS records:

        | Record type | Host | Value |
        |--|--|--|
        | A | `@` | The IP address of your Container Apps environment. |
        | TXT | `asuid` | The domain verification code. |

    - If you selected *CNAME*, create the following DNS records:

        | Record type | Host | Value |
        |--|--|--|
        | CNAME | The subdomain (for example, `www`) | The generated domain of your container app. |
        | TXT | `asuid.` followed by the subdomain (for example, `asuid.www`) | The domain verification code. |
    
    # [Private endpoint](#tab/private-endpoint)

    When using a private endpoint for your incoming traffic, you need to [create a private DNS zone](how-to-use-private-endpoint.md#configure-the-private-dns-zone).    

    - If you selected *A record*, create the following DNS records:

        | Record type | Host | Value |
        |--|--|--|
        | A | `@` | The Private IP of your private endpoint on your container apps environment. |
        | TXT | `asuid` | The domain verification code. |

    - If you selected *CNAME*, create the following DNS records:

        | Record type | Host | Value |
        |--|--|--|
        | CNAME | The subdomain (for example, `www`) | The generated domain of your container app. |
        | TXT | `asuid.` followed by the subdomain (for example, `asuid.www`) | The domain verification code. |

    ---

1. Upload the certificate to your environment.

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp env certificate upload \
        -g $RESOURCE_GROUP \
        --name $ENVIRONMENT \
        --certificate-file $CERTIFICATE_LOCAL_PATH \
        --password $CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD \
        --certificate-name $CERTIFICATE_LOWERCASE_NAME
    ```

1. Bind the certificate and domain to your container app.

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp hostname bind \
        --hostname $DOMAIN_NAME \
        -g $RESOURCE_GROUP \
        -n $CONTAINER_APP \
        --environment $ENVIRONMENT \
        --certificate $CERTIFICATE_LOWERCASE_NAME \
        --validation-method <VALIDATION_METHOD>
    ```

    - If you're configuring an *A record*, replace `<VALIDATION_METHOD>` with `HTTP`.

    - If you're configuring a *CNAME*, replace `<VALIDATION_METHOD>` with `CNAME`.

    It might take several minutes to issue the certificate and add the domain to your container app.

1. Once the operation is complete, navigate to your domain to verify that it's accessible.

## Managing certificates

You can manage certificates via the Container Apps environment or through an individual container app.

### Environment

The *Certificates* window of the Container Apps environment presents a table of all the certificates associated with the environment.

You can manage your certificates through the following actions:

| Action | Description |
|--|--|
| Add | Select the **Add certificate** link to add a new certificate. |
| Delete | Select the trash can icon to remove a certificate. |
| Renew | The *Health status* field of the table indicates that a certificate is expiring soon within 60 days of the expiration date. To renew a certificate, select the **Renew certificate** link to upload a new certificate. |

### Container app

The *Custom domains* window of the container app presents a list of custom domains associated with the container app.

You can manage your certificates for an individual domain name by selecting the ellipsis (**...**) button, which opens the certificate binding window. From the following window, you can select a certificate to bind to the selected domain name.
