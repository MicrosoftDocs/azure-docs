# Tutorial: Use Dapr Service Invocation for microservices communication 

In a microservice-based application, you can use Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr) for improved security and reliability in communication between microservices. To encrypt data in transit, the [Dapr Service Invocation API](dapr-overview.md#supported-dapr-apis-components-and-tooling) uses automatic mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS). For reliability, this API offers a resiliency feature that performs automatic retries after call failures and transient errors.

This tutorial uses a sample service invocation project that includes the following components:

- A `checkout` caller service that uses HTTP proxying on a loop to invoke a request on an `order-processor` service via the Dapr Service Invocation API
- An `order-processor` callee service that receives the request from the `checkout` service via the Dapr Service Invocation API

## Prerequisites

- The [Azure Developer CLI](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
- The Dapr CLI, [installed](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/) and [initialized](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-selfhost/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/install)

::: zone pivot="nodejs"

## Run the Node.js application locally

Before you deploy the application to Container Apps, take the steps in the following sections to run the `order-processor` and `checkout` services locally with Dapr.

### Prepare the project

1. Clone the [sample application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/svc-invoke-dapr-nodejs) to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/svc-invoke-dapr-nodejs.git
   ```

1. Go to the sample root directory.

   ```bash
   cd svc-invoke-dapr-nodejs
   ```

### Run the application by using the Dapr CLI

Run the `order-processor` service and the `checkout` service by taking the following steps.

1. From the sample root directory, go to the *order-processor* directory.

   ```bash
   cd order-processor
   ```
1. Install the dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. Run the `order-processor` service.

   ```bash
   dapr run --app-port 5001 --app-id order-processor --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3501 -- npm start
   ```

1. In a new terminal window, go to the sample root directory, and then go to the *checkout* directory.

   ```bash
   cd checkout
   ```

1. Install the dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. Run the `checkout` service.

   ```bash
   dapr run  --app-id checkout --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3500 -- npm start
   ```

#### Expected output

In the `checkout` terminal, the `checkout` service sends information about 20 orders to the `order-processor` service and then temporarily pauses.

```
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":1}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":2}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":3}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":4}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":5}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":6}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":7}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":8}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":9}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":10}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":11}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":12}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":13}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":14}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":15}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":16}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":17}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":18}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":19}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":20}
```

In the `order-processor` terminal, the `order-processor` service receives information about 20 orders and then temporarily pauses.

```
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 1 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 2 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 3 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 4 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 5 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 6 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 7 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 8 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 9 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 10 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 11 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 12 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 13 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 14 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 15 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 16 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 17 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 18 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 19 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 20 }
```

### Stop the application

Select **Cmd/Ctrl**+**C** in both terminals to stop the service-to-service invocation.

## Deploy the application template by using the Azure Developer CLI

To deploy the application to Container Apps by using [`azd`](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview) commands, take the steps in the following sections.

### Prepare the project

In a new terminal window, go to the [sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/svc-invoke-dapr-nodejs) root directory.

```bash
cd svc-invoke-dapr-nodejs
```

### Create and deploy by using the Azure Developer CLI

1. Run `azd init` to initialize the project.

   ```azdeveloper
   azd init
   ```

   When prompted in the terminal, enter a unique environment name. The command uses this name as a prefix for the resource group that it creates to hold all Azure resources.

1. Run `azd up` to prepare the infrastructure and deploy the application to Container Apps in a single command.

   ```azdeveloper
   azd up
   ```

   When prompted in the terminal, provide the following parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   | --------- | ----------- |
   | Azure location  | The Azure location for your resources |
   | Azure subscription | The Azure subscription for your resources |

   This process can take some time to run. While the `azd up` command runs, the output displays two Azure portal links that you can use to monitor the deployment progress. The output also demonstrates how `azd up`:

   - Creates and configures all necessary Azure resources via the Bicep files in the *./infra* directory by using `azd provision`. After the Azure Developer CLI deploys these resources, you can use the Azure portal to access them. The files that are used to configure the Azure resources include:
     - *main.parameters.json*.
     - *main.bicep*.
     - An *app* resources directory organized by functionality.
     - A *core* reference library that contains the Bicep modules used by the `azd` template.
   - Deploys the code using `azd deploy`.

   If this step causes [error BCP420](https://aka.ms/bicep/core-diagnostics#BCP420), go to your cloned repo, open the *svc-invoke-dapr-nodejs/infra/core/host/container-apps.bicep* file, and replace line 28 with the following line:

   ```bicep
   scope: resourceGroup(!empty(containerRegistryResourceGroupName) ? containerRegistryResourceGroupName : resourceGroup().name)
   ```

#### Expected output

The `azd init` command displays output that's similar to the following lines:

```azdeveloper
Initializing an app to run on Azure (azd init)

? Enter a unique environment name: [? for help] <environment-name>

? Enter a unique environment name: <environment-name>

SUCCESS: Initialized environment <environment-name>.
```

The `azd up` command displays output that's similar to the following lines:

```azdeveloper
? Select an Azure Subscription to use:  3. <subscription-name> (aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e)
? Enter a value for the 'location' infrastructure parameter: 51. (US) East US 2 (eastus2)

### Confirm successful deployment 

To verify that the `checkout` service is passing orders to the `order-processor` service, take the following steps.

1. In the terminal output, copy the `checkout` container app name.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and then search for the container app resource by name.

1. On the container app **Overview** page, select **Monitoring** > **Log stream**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/microservices-dapr-azd/log-streams-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal side panel. Under Monitoring, Log stream is highlighted.":::

1. On the **Log stream** page, next to **Container**, select **checkout**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/microservices-dapr-azd/select-checkout-container-logs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Log stream page for the checkout container app. In the Container list, checkout is highlighted." lightbox="media/microservices-dapr-azd/select-checkout-container-logs.png":::

1. Confirm the `checkout` container is logging the same output as in the terminal earlier.

## Understand azd up

When the `azd up` command runs successfully:

- The Azure Developer CLI creates the Azure resources referenced in the [sample project ./infra directory](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/svc-invoke-dapr-nodejs/tree/main/infra) in the Azure subscription you specify. You can find those Azure resources in the Azure portal.
- The app is deployed to Container Apps. In the Azure portal, you can access the fully functional app.

::: zone pivot="python"

## Run the Python application locally

Before you deploy the application to Container Apps, take the steps in the following sections to run the `order-processor` and `checkout` services locally with Dapr.

### Prepare the project

1. Clone the [sample application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/svc-invoke-dapr-python) to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/svc-invoke-dapr-python.git
   ```

1. Go to the sample root directory.

   ```bash
   cd svc-invoke-dapr-python
   ```

### Run the application by using the Dapr CLI

Run the `order-processor` service and the `checkout` service by taking the following steps.

1. From the sample root directory, go to the *order-processor* directory.

   ```bash
   cd order-processor
   ```
2. Install the dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the `order-processor` service.

   # [Windows](#tab/windows)
   
   ```bash
   dapr run --app-port 8001 --app-id order-processor --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3501 -- python app.py
   ```

   # [Linux](#tab/linux)
   
   ```bash
   dapr run --app-port 8001 --app-id order-processor --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3501 -- python3 app.py
   ```

   ---

4. In a new terminal window, go to the sample root directory, and then go to the *checkout* directory.

   ```bash
   cd checkout
   ```

5. Install the dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Run the `checkout` service.

   # [Windows](#tab/windows)
   
   ```bash
   dapr run  --app-id checkout --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3500 -- python app.py
   ```

   # [Linux](#tab/linux)
   
   ```bash
   dapr run  --app-id checkout --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3500 -- python3 app.py
   ```

   ---

#### Expected output

In the `checkout` terminal, the `checkout` service sends information about 19 orders to the `order-processor` service and then temporarily pauses.

```
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 1}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 2}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 3}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 4}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 5}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 6}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 7}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 8}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 9}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 10}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 11}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 12}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 13}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 14}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 15}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 16}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 17}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 18}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId": 19}
```

In the `order-processor` terminal, the `order-processor` service receives information about 19 orders and then temporarily pauses.

```

### Stop the application

Select **Cmd/Ctrl**+**C** in both terminals to stop the service-to-service invocation.

## Deploy the application template by using the Azure Developer CLI

To deploy the application to Container Apps by using [`azd`](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview) commands, take the steps in the following sections.

### Prepare the project

In a new terminal window, go to the [sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/svc-invoke-dapr-python) root directory.

```bash
cd svc-invoke-dapr-python
```

### Create and deploy by using the Azure Developer CLI

1. Run `azd init` to initialize the project.

   ```azdeveloper
   azd init
   ```

   When prompted in the terminal, enter a unique environment name. The command uses this name as a prefix for the resource group that it creates to hold all Azure resources.

1. Run `azd up` to prepare the infrastructure and deploy the application to Container Apps in a single command.

   ```azdeveloper
   azd up
   ```

   When prompted in the terminal, provide the following parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   | --------- | ----------- |
   | Azure location  | The Azure location for your resources |
   | Azure subscription | The Azure subscription for your resources |

   This process can take some time to run. While the `azd up` command runs, the output displays two Azure portal links that you can use to monitor the deployment progress. The output also demonstrates how `azd up`:

   - Creates and configures all necessary Azure resources via the Bicep files in the *./infra* directory by using `azd provision`. After the Azure Developer CLI deploys these resources, you can use the Azure portal to access them. The files that are used to configure the Azure resources include:
     - *main.parameters.json*.
     - *main.bicep*.
     - An *app* resources directory organized by functionality.
     - A *core* reference library that contains the Bicep modules used by the `azd` template.
   - Deploys the code using `azd deploy`.

#### Expected output

The `azd init` command displays output that's similar to the following lines:

```azdeveloper
Initializing an app to run on Azure (azd init)

? Enter a unique environment name: [? for help] <environment-name>

? Enter a unique environment name: <environment-name>

SUCCESS: Initialized environment <environment-name>.
```

The `azd up` command displays output that's similar to the following lines:

```azdeveloper
? Select an Azure Subscription to use:  3. <subscription-name> (aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e)
? Enter a value for the 'location' infrastructure parameter: 51. (US) East US 2 (eastus2)

### Confirm successful deployment 

To verify that the `checkout` service is passing orders to the `order-processor` service, take the following steps.

1. In the terminal output, copy the `checkout` container app name.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and then search for the container app resource by name.

1. On the container app **Overview** page, select **Monitoring** > **Log stream**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/microservices-dapr-azd/log-streams-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the side panel in the Azure portal. Under Monitoring, Log stream is highlighted.":::

1. On the **Log stream** page, next to **Container**, select **checkout**.

## Understand azd up

When the `azd up` command runs successfully:

- The Azure Developer CLI creates the Azure resources referenced in the [sample project ./infra directory](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/svc-invoke-dapr-python/tree/main/infra) in the Azure subscription you specify. You can find those Azure resources in the Azure portal.
- The app is deployed to Container Apps. In the Azure portal, you can access the fully functional app.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="csharp"

## Run the .NET application locally

Before you deploy the application to Container Apps, take the steps in the following sections to run the `order-processor` and `checkout` services locally with Dapr.

### Prepare the project

1. Clone the [sample application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/svc-invoke-dapr-csharp) to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/svc-invoke-dapr-csharp.git
   ```

1. Go to the sample root directory.

   ```bash
   cd svc-invoke-dapr-csharp
   ```

### Run the application by using the Dapr CLI

Run the `order-processor` service and the `checkout` service by taking the following steps.

1. From the sample root directory, go to the *order-processor* directory.

   ```bash
   cd order-processor
   ```
1. Install the dependencies.

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

1. Run the `order-processor` service.

   ```bash
   dapr run --app-port 7001 --app-id order-processor --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3501 -- dotnet run
   ```

1. In a new terminal window, go to the sample root directory, and then go to the *checkout* directory.

   ```bash
   cd checkout
   ```

1. Install the dependencies.

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

1. Run the `checkout` service.

   ```bash
   dapr run  --app-id checkout --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3500 -- dotnet run
   ```

#### Expected output

In the `checkout` terminal, the `checkout` service sends information about 20 orders to the `order-processor` service and then temporarily pauses.

```
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 1 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 2 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 3 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 4 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 5 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 6 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 7 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 8 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 9 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 10 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 11 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 12 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 13 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 14 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 15 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 16 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 17 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 18 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 19 }
== APP == Order passed: Order { OrderId = 20 }
```

In the `order-processor` terminal, the `order-processor` service receives information about 20 orders and then temporarily pauses.

```
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 1 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 2 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 3 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 4 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 5 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 6 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 7 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 8 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 9 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 10 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 11 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 12 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 13 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 14 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 15 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 16 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 17 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 18 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 19 }
== APP == Order received : Order { orderId = 20 }
```

### Stop the application

Select **Cmd/Ctrl**+**C** in both terminals to stop the service-to-service invocation.

## Deploy the application template by using the Azure Developer CLI

To deploy the application to Container Apps by using [`azd`](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview) commands, take the steps in the following sections.

### Prepare the project

In a new terminal window, go to the [sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/svc-invoke-dapr-csharp) root directory.

```bash
cd svc-invoke-dapr-csharp
```

### Create and deploy by using the Azure Developer CLI

1. Run `azd init` to initialize the project.

   ```azdeveloper
   azd init
   ```

   When prompted in the terminal, enter a unique environment name. The command uses this name as a prefix for the resource group that it creates to hold all Azure resources.

1. Run `azd up` to prepare the infrastructure and deploy the application to Container Apps in a single command.

   ```azdeveloper
   azd up
   ```

   When prompted in the terminal, provide the following parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   | --------- | ----------- |
   | Azure location  | The Azure location for your resources |
   | Azure subscription | The Azure subscription for your resources |

   This process can take some time to run. While the `azd up` command runs, the output displays two Azure portal links that you can use to monitor the deployment progress. The output also demonstrates how `azd up`:

   - Creates and configures all necessary Azure resources via the Bicep files in the *./infra* directory by using `azd provision`. After the Azure Developer CLI deploys these resources, you can use the Azure portal to access them. The files that are used to configure the Azure resources include:
     - *main.parameters.json*.
     - *main.bicep*.
     - An *app* resources directory organized by functionality.
     - A *core* reference library that contains the Bicep modules used by the `azd` template.
   - Deploys the code using `azd deploy`.

   If this step causes [error BCP420](https://aka.ms/bicep/core-diagnostics#BCP420), go to your cloned repo, open the *svc-invoke-dapr-csharp/infra/core/host/container-apps.bicep* file, and replace line 28 with the following line:

   ```bicep
   scope: resourceGroup(!empty(containerRegistryResourceGroupName) ? containerRegistryResourceGroupName : resourceGroup().name)
   ```

#### Expected output

The `azd init` command displays output that's similar to the following lines:

```azdeveloper
Initializing an app to run on Azure (azd init)

? Enter a unique environment name: [? for help] <environment-name>

? Enter a unique environment name: <environment-name>

SUCCESS: Initialized environment <environment-name>.
```

The `azd up` command displays output that's similar to the following lines:

```azdeveloper

### Confirm successful deployment

To verify that the `checkout` service is passing orders to the `order-processor` service, take the following steps.

1. In the terminal output, copy the `checkout` container app name.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and then search for the container app resource by name.

1. On the container app **Overview** page, select **Monitoring** > **Log stream**.

## Understand azd up

When the `azd up` command runs successfully:

- The Azure Developer CLI creates the Azure resources referenced in the [sample project ./infra directory](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/svc-invoke-dapr-csharp/tree/main/infra) in the Azure subscription you specify. You can find those Azure resources in the Azure portal.
- The app is deployed to Container Apps. In the Azure portal, you can access the fully functional app.

::: zone-end

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this application, run the following command to delete the Azure resources you created:

```azdeveloper
azd down
```
