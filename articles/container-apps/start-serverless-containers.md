# Use serverless containers on Azure

Serverless computing offers services that manage and maintain servers, which relieve you of the burden of physically operating servers yourself. Azure Container Apps is a serverless platform that handles scaling, security, and infrastructure management for you - all while reducing costs. Once freed from server-related concerns, you're able to spend your time focusing on your application code.

Container Apps make it easy to manage:

1. **Automatic scaling**: As requests for your applications fluctuate, Container Apps keeps your systems running even during seasons of high demand. Container Apps meets the demand for your app at any level by [automatically creating new copies](scale-app.md) (called replicas) of your container. As demand falls, the runtime removes unneeded replicas on your behalf.

1. **Security**: Application security is enforced throughout many layers. From [authentication and authorization](authentication.md) to [network-level security](networking.md), Container Apps allows you to be explicit about the users and requests allowed into your system.

1. **Monitoring**: Easily monitor your container app's health using [observability tools](observability.md) in Container Apps.

1. **Deployment flexibility**: You can deploy from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or from your local machine.

1. **Changes**: As your containers evolve, Container Apps catalogs changes as [revisions](revisions.md) to your containers. If you're experiencing a problem with a container, you can easily roll back to an older version.
