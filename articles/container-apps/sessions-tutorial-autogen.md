# Tutorial: Use code interpreter sessions in AutoGen with Azure Container Apps

[AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) is a framework for developing large language model (LLM) applications using multiple agents that converse with each other to solve tasks. Agents built with AutoGen can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools. One important type of tool for AutoGen agents is code executors. They enable agents to perform complex tasks by writing and executing code. By integrating Azure Container Apps dynamic sessions with AutoGen, you give the agent a [code interpreter](sessions-code-interpreter.md) to use to perform useful computations and take actions.

In this tutorial, you learn how to run an AI agent authored in AutoGen in a web API. The API accepts user input and returns a response generated by the AI agent. The agent uses a code interpreter in dynamic sessions to perform calculations.

## Run the sample app locally

Before you deploy the app to Azure Container Apps, you can run it locally to test it.

### Clone the app

1. Clone the [Azure Container Apps sessions samples repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/container-apps-dynamic-sessions-samples).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/container-apps-dynamic-sessions-samples.git
    ```

1. Change to the directory that contains the sample app:

    ```bash
    cd container-apps-dynamic-sessions-samples/autogen-python-webapi
    ```

[!INCLUDE [container-apps/sessions-tutorial-configure-local](../../includes/container-apps/sessions-tutorial-configure-local-autogen.md)]

### Run the app

Before running the sample app, open [*main.py*](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/container-apps-dynamic-sessions-samples/blob/main/autogen-python-webapi/main.py) in an editor and review the code. The app uses FastAPI to create a web API that accepts a user message in the query string.

The following lines of code instantiate a *ACASessionsExecutor* and provides it to the autogen agent:

```python
aca_sessions_executor = ACASessionsExecutor(aca_pool_management_endpoint)
code_executor_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="CodeExecutor",
    llm_config=False,
    code_execution_config={"executor": aca_sessions_executor},
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    is_termination_msg=lambda msg: "TERMINATE" in msg.get("content", "").strip().upper()
)
```

When it needs to perform calculations and tasks, the agent uses the code interpreter in *ACASessionsExecutor* to run the code. The code is executed in a session in the session pool. By default, a random session identifier is generated when you instantiate the tool. If the agent uses the same tool to run multiple Python code snippets, it uses the same session. To ensure each end user has a unique session, use a separate agent and tool for each user.

*ACASessionsExecutor* is implemented in [*aca_sessions_executor.py*](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/container-apps-dynamic-sessions-samples/blob/main/autogen-python-webapi/aca_sessions_executor.py).
