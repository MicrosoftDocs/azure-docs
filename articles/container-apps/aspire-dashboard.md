# Read real time app data with .NET Aspire Dashboard in Azure Container Apps (preview)

The [.NET Aspire Dashboard](/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard/overview) provides information on how your app is running both on the environment and individual app level, which can help you detect anomalies in real time and debug errors. The dashboard shows data for all Container Apps that is part of your project, regardless of language or runtime.

The following image is a screenshot of a trace visualization generated by the .NET Aspire Dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

Refer to the following items if you have issues enabling your dashboard:

- The portal can take up to two minutes for the dashboard to activate. If you try to go to the dashboard before it's ready, the server returns a `404` or `421` error.

- If you encounter a `421` "Misdirected Request" error, close the browser window, wait a few minutes, and try again.

- You might receive an authentication error when accessing the dashboard that reads, "Could not authenticate user with requested resource."

    To solve this problem, make sure you grant the *Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments/write*, *Contributor*, or *Owner* roles on your Container Apps environment.
