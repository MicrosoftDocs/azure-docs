# Log storage and monitoring options in Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps gives you options for storing and viewing your application logs. You can configure logging options at the Container Apps environment level. If you select Azure Monitor as your logs destination, you can configure diagnostic settings at both the environment level and the container app level.

Container Apps application logs consist of two different categories:

- Container console output (`stdout`/`stderr`) messages.
- System logs generated by Azure Container Apps.
- Spring App console logs.

You can choose between these logs destinations:

- **Log Analytics**: Azure Monitor Log Analytics is the default storage and viewing option. Your logs are stored in a Log Analytics workspace where they can be viewed and analyzed using Log Analytics queries. To learn more about Log Analytics, see [Azure Monitor Log Analytics](log-monitoring.md).
- **Azure Monitor**: Azure Monitor routes logs to one or more destinations:
    - Log Analytics workspace for viewing and analysis.
    - Azure storage account to archive.
    - Azure event hub for data ingestion and analytic services. For more information, see [Azure Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about.md).
    - An Azure partner monitoring solution such as Datadog, Elastic, Logz.io, and others. For more information, see [Partner solutions](../partner-solutions/overview.md). 
- **Don't save logs**: You can disable the storage of log data. When disabled, you can still view real-time container logs via the **Logs stream** feature in your container app. For more information, see [Log streaming](log-streaming.md).

When *Don't save logs* or the *Azure Monitor* destination is selected, the **Logs** menu item providing the Log Analytics query editor in the Azure portal is disabled.

## Configure logging options

Use these steps to configure the logging options for your environment in the Azure portal:

1. Browse to your Container Apps environment in the portal.

1. Select *Monitoring* > **Logging options**.

1. You can choose from the following **Logs Destination** options:
    - **Azure Log Analytics**: With this option, you select a Log Analytics workspace to store your log data. Your logs can be viewed through Log Analytics queries. To learn more about Log Analytics, see [Azure Monitor Log Analytics](log-monitoring.md).
    - **Azure Monitor**: Azure Monitor routes your logs to a destination. When you select this option, you must select **Diagnostic settings** to complete the configuration after you select **Save** on this page.
    - **Don't save logs**: This option disables the storage of log data.

1. Select **Save**.

### Diagnostic settings

If you selected **Azure Monitor** as your logs destination, you must also configure the diagnostic settings. You can configure the diagnostic settings at both the environment level and the container app level.

#### Configure diagnostic settings at the environment level

Use these steps to configure the diagnostic settings for your environment:

1. Browse to your environment in the portal.

1. Select *Monitoring* > **Diagnostic settings**. If you've just set your environment's logs destination to **Azure Monitor**, you might need to refresh the page for this configuration item to appear.

Destination details are saved as *diagnostic settings*. You can create up to five diagnostic settings for your environment. You can configure different log categories for each diagnostic setting. For example, create one diagnostic setting to send the system logs category to one destination, and another to send the container console logs category to another destination.

To create a new *diagnostic setting*:

1. Select **Add diagnostic setting**.

1. In *Diagnostic setting name*, enter a name for your diagnostic setting.

1. Select the log **Category groups** or **Categories** you want to send to this destination. You can select one or more categories. 

1. If you want to send app-level [metrics](metrics.md), select *Metrics* > **AllMetrics**.

1. Select one or more **Destination details**:
    - **Send to Log Analytics workspace**: Select from existing Log Analytics workspaces.
    - **Archive to a storage account**: Select from Azure storage accounts.
    - **Stream to an event hub**: Select from Azure event hubs.
    - **Send to a partner solution**: Select from Azure partner solutions. 

1. Select **Save**.

For more information about Diagnostic settings, see [Diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings).

#### Configure diagnostic settings at the container app level

Use these steps to configure the diagnostic settings for your container app:

1. Browse to your container app in the portal.

1. Select *Monitoring* > **Diagnostic settings**. If you've just set your container app environment's logs destination to **Azure Monitor**, you might need to refresh the page for this configuration item to appear.

1. Select **Add diagnostic setting**.

1. In **Diagnostic setting name**, enter a name for your diagnostic setting.

1. Under *Metrics*, select **AllMetrics**.

1. Select one or more **Destination details**:
    - **Send to Log Analytics workspace**: Select from existing Log Analytics workspaces.
    - **Archive to a storage account**: Select a storage account. 
    - **Stream to an event hub**: Select from Azure event hubs.
    - **Send to a partner solution**: Select from Azure partner solutions. 

1. Select **Save**.

## Configure logging options

Configure logs destination for your Container Apps environment using the Azure CLI `az containerapp create` and `az containerapp update` commands with the `--logs-destination` argument. 

First, register the `Microsoft.Insights` namespace.

```azurecli
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Insights
```

### Send to a Log Analytics workspace

To create a Container Apps environment using an existing Log Analytics workspace as the logs destination, run the following command. Replace the `<PLACEHOLDERS>` with your values. You can get the Log Analytics workspace resource ID from the Log Analytics workspace page in the Azure portal, or from the [`az monitor log-analytics workspace show`](/cli/azure/monitor/log-analytics/workspace#az-monitor-log-analytics-workspace-show) command.

```azurecli
az containerapp env create \
  --name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> \
  --logs-destination log-analytics \
  --logs-workspace-id <LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_ID>
```

The `--logs-destination` argument accepts the values `log-analytics`, `azure-monitor`, and `none`.

### Send to Azure Monitor

To update an existing Container Apps environment to use Azure Monitor as the logs destination, run the following command. Replace the `<PLACEHOLDERS>` with your values:

```azurecli
az containerapp env update \
  --name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> \
  --logs-destination azure-monitor
```

#### Configure diagnostic settings

When `--logs-destination` is set to `azure-monitor`, you must create diagnostic settings to configure the destination details for the log categories with the `az monitor diagnostics-settings` command. You can configure these diagnostic settings at both the environment level and the container app level.

To create diagnostic settings at the environment level, run the following command. Replace the `<PLACEHOLDERS>` with your values. You can get the environment ID from the Environment page in the Azure portal, or from the [`az containerapp env show`](/cli/azure/containerapp/env#az-containerapp-env-show) command.

```azurecli
az monitor diagnostic-settings create \
  --name "AllMetricsToLogAnalytics" \
  --resource <ENVIRONMENT_ID> \
  --logs '[{"categoryGroup":"allLogs","enabled":true}]' \
  --metrics '[{"category":"AllMetrics","enabled":true}]' \
  --workspace <LOG_ANALYTICS_RESOURCE_ID>
```

Ensure there are no spaces in the JSON values provided to the `--logs` and `--metrics` parameters.

For the `--logs` parameter, you can specify `category` or `categoryGroup`, but not both at once. For `categoryGroup`, the available values are `audit` and `allLogs`. For `category`, the available values are `ContainerAppConsoleLogs` and `ContainerAppSystemLogs`.

For the `--metrics` parameter, the only available category is `AllMetrics`.

For more information see [LogSettings](/rest/api/monitor/diagnostic-settings/create-or-update#logsettings) and [MetricSettings](/rest/api/monitor/diagnostic-settings/create-or-update#metricsettings).

To create diagnostic settings at the container app level, run the following command. Replace the `<PLACEHOLDERS>` with your values. You can get the container app ID from the Azure portal, or from the [`az containerapp show`](/cli/azure/containerapp#az-containerapp-show) command. 

When creating diagnostic settings at the container app level, the `--logs` parameter is not supported, and for the `--metrics` parameter, the only available category is `AllMetrics`.

```azurecli
az monitor diagnostic-settings create \
--name "AllMetricsToLogAnalytics" \
--resource <CONTAINER_APP_ID> \
--metrics '[{"category":"AllMetrics","enabled":true}]' \
--workspace <LOG_ANALYTICS_RESOURCE_ID>
```

For more information about Azure Monitor diagnostic settings commands, see [az monitor diagnostic-settings](/cli/azure/monitor/diagnostic-settings).

## Limitations

The following limitations apply as you set up your log options.

- **Private link**: Sending logs directly to a Log Analytics Workspace through Private Link isn't supported. However, you can use Azure Monitor and send your logs to the same Log Analytics Workspace. This indirection is required to prevent system log data loss.
