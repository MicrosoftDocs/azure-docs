# Log storage and monitoring options in Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps gives you options for storing and viewing your application logs. Logging options are configured in your Container Apps environment where you select the log destination.  

Container Apps application logs consist of two different categories:

- Container console output (`stdout`/`stderr`) messages.
- System logs generated by Azure Container Apps.
- Spring App console logs.

You can choose between these logs destinations:

- **Log Analytics**: Azure Monitor Log Analytics is the default storage and viewing option.  Your logs are stored in a Log Analytics workspace where they can be viewed and analyzed using Log Analytics queries.  To learn more about Log Analytics, see [Azure Monitor Log Analytics](log-monitoring.md).
- **Azure Monitor**: Azure Monitor routes logs to one or more destinations:
    - Log Analytics workspace for viewing and analysis.
    - Azure storage account to archive.
    - Azure event hub for data ingestion and analytic services. For more information, see [Azure Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about.md).
    - An Azure partner monitoring solution such as, Datadog, Elastic, Logz.io and others.  For more information, see [Partner solutions](../partner-solutions/overview.md).  
- **None**: You can disable the storage of log data. You'll still be able to view real-time container logs via the **Logs stream** feature in your container app.  For more information, see [Log streaming](log-streaming.md).

When *None* or the *Azure Monitor* destination is selected, the **Logs** menu item providing the Log Analytics query editor in the Azure portal is disabled.

## Configure options via the Azure portal

Use these steps to configure the logging options for your Container Apps environment in the Azure portal:

1. Go to the **Logging Options** on your Container Apps environment window in the portal.

1. You can choose from the following **Logs Destination** options:
    - **Log Analytics**: With this option, you select a Log Analytics workspace to store your log data.  Your logs can be viewed through Log Analytics queries.  To learn more about Log Analytics, see [Azure Monitor Log Analytics](log-monitoring.md).
    - **Azure Monitor**: Azure Monitor routes your logs to a destination. When you select this option, you must select **Diagnostic settings** to complete the configuration after you select **Save** on this page.
    - **None**:  This option disables the storage of log data.
1. Select **Save**.
    :::image type="content" source="media/observability/log-opts-screenshot-page-save-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot Logging options page.":::
1. If you have selected **Azure Monitor** as your logs destination, you must configure **Diagnostic settings**.  The **Diagnostic settings** item will appear below the **Logging options** menu item.

### Diagnostic settings

When you select **Azure Monitor** as your logs destination, you must configure the destination details. Select **Diagnostic settings** from the left side menu of the Container Apps Environment window in the portal.

:::image type="content" source="media/observability/log-opts-diag-setting-menu-item.png" alt-text="Screenshot Diagnostic setting menu item.":::

Destination details are saved as *diagnostic settings*.  You can create up to five diagnostic settings for your container app environment. You can configure different log categories for each diagnostic setting. For example, create one diagnostic setting to send the system logs category to one destination, and another to send the container console logs category to another destination.

To create a new *diagnostic setting*:

1. Select **Add diagnostic setting**.
    :::image type="content" source="media/observability/diag-setting-new-diag-setting.png" alt-text="Screenshot Diagnostic setting Add new diagnostic setting.":::
1. Enter a name for your diagnostic setting.
    :::image type="content" source="media/observability/diag-setting-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot Diagnostics settings dialog.":::
1. Select the log **Category groups** or **Categories** you want to send to this destination.  You can select one or more categories.  

1. Select one or more **Destination details**:
    - **Send to Log Analytics workspace**:  Select from existing Log Analytics workspaces.
    :::image type="content" source="media/observability/diag-setting-log-analytics-console-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot diagnostic settings Log Analytics destination.":::
    - **Archive to a storage account**:  You can choose from existing storage accounts.  When the individual log categories are selected, you can set the **Retention (days)** for each category.
    :::image type="content" source="media/observability/diag-setting-storage-acct.png" alt-text="Screenshot Diagnostic settings storage destination.":::
    - **Stream to an event hub**:  Select from Azure event hubs.  
    :::image type="content" source="media/observability/diag-settings-event-hub.png" alt-text="Screenshot Diagnostic settings event hub destination.":::
    - **Send to a partner solution**: Select from Azure partner solutions.  
1. Select **Save**.

For more information about Diagnostic settings, see [Diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings.md).

## Configure options using the Azure CLI

Configure logs destination for your Container Apps environment using the Azure CLI `az containerapp create` and `az containerapp update` commands with the `--logs-destination` argument.  

The destination values are: `log-analytics`, `azure-monitor`, and `none`.

For example, to create a Container Apps environment using an existing Log Analytics workspace as the logs destination, you must provide the `--logs-destination` argument with the value `log-analytics` and the `--logs-destination-id` argument with the value of the Log Analytics workspace resource ID.  You can get the resource ID from the Log Analytics workspace page in the Azure portal or from the ```az monitor log-analytics workspace show``` command.

Replace \<PLACEHOLDERS\> with your values:

```azurecli
az containerapp env create \
  --name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> \
  --logs-destination log-analytics \
  --logs-workspace-id <WORKSPACE_ID>
```

To update an existing Container Apps environment to use Azure Monitor as the logs destination:

Replace \<PLACEHOLDERS\> with your values:

```azurecli
az containerapp env update \
  --name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> \
  --logs-destination azure-monitor 
  
```

When  `--logs-destination` is set to `azure-monitor`, create diagnostic settings to configure the destination details for the log categories with the `az monitor diagnostics-settings` command.  

For more information about Azure Monitor diagnostic settings commands, see [az monitor diagnostic-settings](/cli/azure/monitor/diagnostic-settings).  Container Apps log categories are `ContainerAppConsoleLogs` and `ContainerAppSystemLogs`.
