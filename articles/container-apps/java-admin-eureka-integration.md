# Tutorial: Integrate Admin for Spring with Eureka Server for Spring in Azure Container Apps

This tutorial guides you through the process of integrating a managed Admin for Spring with a Eureka Server for Spring within Azure Container Apps.

This article contains some content similar to the "Connect to a managed Admin for Spring in Azure Container Apps" tutorial, but with Eureka Server for Spring, you can bind Admin for Spring to Eureka Server for Spring, so that it can get application information through Eureka, instead of having to bind individual applications to Admin for Spring.

By following this guide, you set up a Eureka Server for service discovery and then create an Admin for Spring to manage and monitor your Spring applications registered with the Eureka Server. This setup ensures that other applications only need to bind to the Eureka Server, simplifying the management of your microservices.

In this tutorial, you learn to:

1. Create a Eureka Server for Spring.
2. Create an Admin for Spring and link it to the Eureka Server.
3. Bind other applications to the Eureka Server for streamlined service discovery and management.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you can [can create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
* An existing Eureka Server for Spring Java component. If you don't have one, see [Create the Eureka Server for Spring](java-eureka-server.md#create-the-eureka-server-for-spring-java-component).

## Considerations

When running managed Java components in Azure Container Apps, be aware of the following details:

[!INCLUDE [container-apps/component-considerations.md](../../includes/container-apps/component-considerations.md)]

## Setup

Before you begin, create the necessary resources by executing the following commands.

1. Create variables to support your application configuration. These values are provided for you for the purposes of this lesson.

   ```bash
   export LOCATION=eastus
   export RESOURCE_GROUP=my-services-resource-group
   export ENVIRONMENT=my-environment
   export EUREKA_COMPONENT_NAME=eureka
   export ADMIN_COMPONENT_NAME=admin
   export CLIENT_APP_NAME=sample-service-eureka-client
   export CLIENT_IMAGE="mcr.microsoft.com/javacomponents/samples/sample-admin-for-spring-client:latest"
   ```

   | Variable                | Description                                                                        |
   |-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | `LOCATION`              | The Azure region location where you create your container app and Java components. |
   | `RESOURCE_GROUP`        | The Azure resource group name for your demo application.                           |
   | `ENVIRONMENT`           | The Azure Container Apps environment name for your demo application.               |
   | `EUREKA_COMPONENT_NAME` | The name of the Eureka Server Java component.                                      |
   | `ADMIN_COMPONENT_NAME`  | The name of the Admin for Spring Java component.                                   |
   | `CLIENT_APP_NAME`       | The name of the container app that binds to the Eureka Server.                     |
   | `CLIENT_IMAGE`          | The container image used in your Eureka Server container app.                      |

1. Log in to Azure with the Azure CLI.

   ```azurecli
   az login
   ```

1. Create a resource group.

   ```azurecli
   az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
   ```

1. Create your container apps environment.

   ```azurecli
   az containerapp env create \
       --name $ENVIRONMENT \
       --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --location $LOCATION \
       --query "properties.provisioningState"
   ```

    Using the `--query` parameter filters the response down to a simple success or failure message.

## Optional: Create the Eureka Server for Spring

If you don't have an existing Eureka Server for Spring, follow the command below to create the Eureka Server Java component. For more information, see [Create the Eureka Server for Spring](java-eureka-server.md#create-the-eureka-server-for-spring-java-component).

```azurecli
az containerapp env java-component eureka-server-for-spring create \
    --environment $ENVIRONMENT \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $EUREKA_COMPONENT_NAME
```

## Bind the components together

Create the Admin for Spring Java component.

```azurecli
az containerapp env java-component admin-for-spring create \
    --environment $ENVIRONMENT \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $ADMIN_COMPONENT_NAME \
    --min-replicas 1 \
    --max-replicas 1 \
    --bind $EUREKA_COMPONENT_NAME
```

## Bind other apps to the Eureka Server

With the Eureka Server set up, you can now bind other applications to it for service discovery. And you can also monitor and manage these applications in the dashboard of Admin for Spring. Use the following steps to create and bind a container app to the Eureka Server:

Create the container app and bind it to the Eureka Server.

```azurecli
az containerapp create \
    --name $CLIENT_APP_NAME \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --environment $ENVIRONMENT \
    --image $CLIENT_IMAGE \
    --min-replicas 1 \
    --max-replicas 1 \
    --ingress external \
    --target-port 8080 \
    --bind $EUREKA_COMPONENT_NAME 
```

> [!TIP]
> Since the previous steps bound the Admin for Spring component to the Eureka Server for Spring component, the Admin component enables service discovery and allows you to manage it through the Admin for Spring dashboard at the same time.

## View the dashboards

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To view the dashboard, you need to have at least the `Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments/write` role assigned to your account on the managed environment resource. You can either explicitly assign `Owner` or `Contributor` role on the resource or follow the steps to create a custom role definition and assign it to your account.

1. Create the custom role definition.

   ```azurecli
   az role definition create --role-definition '{
       "Name": "Java Component Dashboard Access",
       "IsCustom": true,
       "Description": "Can access managed Java Component dashboards in managed environments",
       "Actions": [
           "Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments/write"
       ],
       "AssignableScopes": ["/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"]
   }'
   ```

   Make sure to replace the `<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>` placeholder in the `AssignableScopes` value with your subscription ID.

1. Assign the custom role to your account on managed environment resource.

   Get the resource ID of the managed environment.

   ```azurecli
   export ENVIRONMENT_ID=$(az containerapp env show \
       --name $ENVIRONMENT --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --query id \
       --output tsv)
   ```

1. Assign the role to your account.

   Before running this command, replace the `<USER_OR_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID>` placeholder with your user or service principal ID.

   ```azurecli
   az role assignment create \
       --assignee <USER_OR_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID> \
       --role "Java Component Dashboard Access" \
       --scope $ENVIRONMENT_ID
   ```

1. Get the URL of the Admin for Spring dashboard.

   ```azurecli
   az containerapp env java-component admin-for-spring show \
       --environment $ENVIRONMENT \
       --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --name $ADMIN_COMPONENT_NAME \
       --query properties.ingress.fqdn \
       --output tsv
   ```

1. Get the URL of the Eureka Server for Spring dashboard.

   ```azurecli
   az containerapp env java-component eureka-server-for-spring show \
       --environment $ENVIRONMENT \
       --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --name $EUREKA_COMPONENT_NAME \
       --query properties.ingress.fqdn \
       --output tsv
   ```

   This command returns the URL you can use to access the Eureka Server for Spring dashboard. Through the dashboard, your container app is also to you as shown in the following screenshot.

   :::image type="content" source="media/java-components/spring-boot-admin.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Admin for Spring dashboard." lightbox="media/java-components/spring-boot-admin.png":::

   :::image type="content" source="media/java-components/eureka.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Eureka Server for Spring dashboard." lightbox="media/java-components/eureka.png":::

## Clean up resources

The resources created in this tutorial have an effect on your Azure bill. If you aren't going to use these services long-term, run the following command to remove everything created in this tutorial.

```azurecli
az group delete --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```
