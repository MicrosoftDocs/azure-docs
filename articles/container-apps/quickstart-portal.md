# Quickstart: Deploy your first container app using the Azure portal

Azure Container Apps enables you to run microservices and containerized applications on a serverless platform. With Container Apps, you enjoy the benefits of running containers while leaving behind the concerns of manually configuring cloud infrastructure and complex container orchestrators.

In this quickstart, you create a secure Container Apps environment and deploy your first container app using the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription is required. If you don't already have one, you can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- Register the `Microsoft.App` resource provider.

## Setup

Begin by signing in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Create a container app

To create your container app, start at the Azure portal home page.

1. Search for **Container Apps** in the top search bar.

1. Select **Container Apps** in the search results.

1. Select the **Create** button.

### Basics tab

In the *Basics* tab, do the following actions.

1. Enter the following values in the *Project details* section.

    | Setting | Action |
    |---|---|
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **Create new** and enter **my-container-apps**. |

1. Select the **Container** tab.

1. Select **Use quickstart image**.

<!-- Deploy the container app -->
[!INCLUDE [container-apps-create-portal-deploy.md](../../includes/container-apps-create-portal-deploy.md)]

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this application, you can delete the container app and all the associated services by removing the resource group.

1. Select the **my-container-apps** resource group from the *Overview* section.
1. Select the **Delete resource group** button at the top of the resource group *Overview*.
1. Enter the resource group name **my-container-apps** in the *Are you sure you want to delete "my-container-apps"* confirmation dialog.
1. Select **Delete**.

    The process to delete the resource group could take a few minutes to complete.
