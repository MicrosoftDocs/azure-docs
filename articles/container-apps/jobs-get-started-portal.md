# Create a job with Azure Container Apps using the Azure portal

Azure Container Apps [jobs](jobs.md) allow you to run containerized tasks that execute for a finite duration and exit. You can trigger a job manually, schedule their execution, or trigger their execution based on events.

Jobs are best suited to for tasks such as data processing, machine learning, or any scenario that requires on-demand processing.

In this quickstart, you create a scheduled job. To learn how to create an event-driven job, see [Deploy an event-driven job with Azure Container Apps](tutorial-event-driven-jobs.md).

## Prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription is required. If you don't already have one, you can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). Also, please make sure to have the Resource Provider "Microsoft.App" registered.

## Setup

Begin by signing in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Create a container app

To create your Container Apps job, start at the Azure portal home page.

1. Search for **Container App Jobs** in the top search bar.
1. Select **Container App Jobs** in the search results.
1. Select the **Create** button.

### Basics tab

In the *Basics* tab, do the following actions.

1. Enter the following values in the *Project details* section.

    | Setting | Action |
    |---|---|
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **Create new** and enter **jobs-quickstart**. |
    | Container job name |  Enter **my-job**. |

#### Create an environment

Next, create an environment for your container app.

1. Select the appropriate region.

    | Setting | Value |
    |--|--|
    | Region | Select **Central US**. |

1. In the *Create Container Apps environment* field, select the **Create new** link.
1. In the *Create Container Apps Environment* page, on the *Basics* tab, enter the following values:

    | Setting | Value |
    |--|--|
    | Environment name | Enter **my-environment**. |
    | Type | Enter **Workload Profile**. |
    | Zone redundancy | Select **Disabled** |

1. Select the **Create** button at the bottom of the *Create Container App Environment* page.

### Deploy the job

1. In *Job details*, select **Scheduled** for the *Trigger type*.

    In the *Cron expression* field, enter `*/1 * * * *`.

    This expression starts the job every minute.

1. Select the **Next: Container** button at the bottom of the page.

1. In the *Container* tab, enter the following values:

    | Setting | Value |
    |--|--|
    | Name | Enter **main-container**. |
    | Image source | Select **Docker Hub or other registries**. |
    | Image type | Select **Public**. |
    | Registry login server | Enter **mcr.microsoft.com**. |
    | Image and tag | Enter **k8se/quickstart-jobs:latest**. |
    | Workload profile | Select **Consumption**. |
    | CPU and memory | Select **0.25** and **0.5Gi**. |

1. Select the **Review and create** button at the bottom of the page.  

    As the settings in the job are verified, if no errors are found, the *Create* button is enabled.  

    Any errors appear on a tab marked with a red dot. If you encounter errors, navigate to the appropriate tab and you'll find fields containing errors highlighted in red. Once all errors are fixed, select **Review and create** again.

1. Select **Create**.

    A page with the message *Deployment is in progress* is displayed.  Once the deployment is successfully completed, you'll see the message: *Your deployment is complete*.

### Verify deployment

1. Select **Go to resource** to view your new Container Apps job.

1. Select the **Execution history** tab.

    The *Execution history* tab displays the status of each job execution. Select the **Refresh** button to update the list. Wait up to a minute for the scheduled job execution to start. Its status changes from *Pending* to *Running* to *Succeeded*.

1. Select **View logs**.

    The logs show the output of the job execution. It may take a few minutes for the logs to appear.

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this application, you can delete the Azure Container Apps instance and all the associated services by removing the resource group.

1. Select the **jobs-quickstart** resource group from the *Overview* section.
1. Select the **Delete resource group** button at the top of the resource group *Overview*.
1. Enter the resource group name **jobs-quickstart** in the *Are you sure you want to delete "jobs-quickstart"* confirmation dialog.
1. Select **Delete**.  
    The process to delete the resource group may take a few minutes to complete.
