  - name: Quotas
    questions:
      - question: |
          How can I request a quota increase?
        answer: |
          To request quota increase, [submit a support ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) with the following fields:

          | Property | Value |
          |--|--|
          | Issue Type | Technical |
          | Subscription | Your subscription |
          | Service | My Services |
          | Service Type | Container Apps |
          | Resource | maxoutquotas |
          | Summary | An explanation for your request, including:<br>• What quotas you want increased<br>• How much of an increase you would like<br>• Business reasons for the increase |
          | Problem Type | Configuration and Management |
          | Problem Subtype | Scaling |

          Keep in mind the following when it comes to quota increase requests: 

          - **Scaling apps vs environments**: There are many different quotas available to increase. Use these descriptions to help identify your needs:
            - **Increase apps and cores per environment**: Allows you to run more apps within an environment and/or more intensive apps. Recommended if your workloads can deploy within the same network and security boundaries.
            - **Increasing environments**: Recommended if your workloads need network or security boundaries. Note: A detailed business context might be required if your request involves increasing environment-level quotas.

          - **Regions**: Approvals for increase requests vary based on compute capacity available in Azure regions.

          - **Specific compute requirements**: The platform supports 4 GB per container app. Memory limits overrides are evaluated on a per-case basis.

          - **Business reasoning for scaling**: You might be eligible for a quota increase request if the platform limits are blocking your workload demands. Scale limits overrides are evaluated on a per-case basis.

    questions:
      - question: |
          Which JDK versions are supported?
        answer: |
          Container Apps supports four LTS JDK versions: JDK 8, JDK 11, JDK 17 and JDK 21. 
          For source code build, the default version is JDK 17.
          For a JAR file build, the JDK version is read from the file location *META-INF\MANIFEST.MF* in the JAR, but uses the default JDK version 17 if the specified version isn't available.
      - question: |
          Which Java build tools are supported?
        answer: |
          Maven
      - question: |
          Are build environment variables supported?
        answer: |
          No. Container Apps automatically selects the Maven version.
      - question: |
          How do I ensure the build and image of my Docker-less build are available in the same region as my app?
        answer: |
          When using `containerapp up` in combination with a Docker-less code base, use the `--location` parameter so that application runs in a location other than US East.
