  - name: Configuration
    questions:
      - question: |
          Can I set up GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy my code to Azure Container Apps?
        answer:
          Yes. Using Azure CLI, run `az containerapp github-action -h` to see the options. Using Azure portal, go to the "Continuous deployment" window under your container app.
      - question: |
          Why is the URL my app receives different than the URL specified in the request?
        answer:
          Azure Container Apps decodes the URL to protect your app against [URL confusion attacks](https://snyk.io/blog/url-confusion-vulnerabilities/). A request URL that has encoded portions, such as `http://mysite.com/archive/http%3A%2F%2Fmysite.com%2Farchive%2F123`, is sent to your app as `http://mysite.com/archive/http%3A/mysite.com/archive/123`.
      - question: |
          Do Consumption only environments support custom user-defined routes?
        answer:
          For Consumption only environments, express routes are unsupported, and limited UDR when configured as follows is supported. The UDR configuration must have a route configured for `Azure.<REGION_NAME>` Service tag with Next Hop = "Internet". In addition, the rules in the [NSG documentation](./firewall-integration.md?tabs=consumption-only) must be configured for the Consumption only environment to be operational. These limitations do not apply for workload profiles, and for full featured UDR and Express Route support, use workload profile environments.
  - name: Data management
    questions:
      - question: |
          Where does Azure Container Apps store customer data?
        answer: |
          Azure Container Apps doesn't move or store customer data out of the deployed region.

  - name: Quotas
    questions:
      - question: |
          How can I request a quota increase?
        answer: |
          [Request a quota increase in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/quotas/quickstart-increase-quota-portal) with **Azure Container Apps** selected as the provider.

          Keep in mind the following when it comes to quota increase requests: 

          - **Scaling apps vs environments**: There are many different quotas available to increase. Use these descriptions to help identify your needs:
            - **Increase apps and cores per environment**: Allows you to run more apps within an environment and/or more intensive apps. Recommended if your workloads can deploy within the same network and security boundaries.
            - **Increasing environments**: Recommended if your workloads need network or security boundaries. Note: A detailed business context might be required if your request involves increasing environment-level quotas. When you request a change to your regional environment quota, you should request a corresponding change to your global environment quota.

          - **Regions**: Approvals for increase requests vary based on compute capacity available in Azure regions.

          - **Specific compute requirements**: The platform supports 4 GB per container app. Memory limits overrides are evaluated on a per-case basis.

          - **Business reasoning for scaling**: You might be eligible for a quota increase request if the platform limits are blocking your workload demands. Scale limits overrides are evaluated on a per-case basis.

  - name: Microservice APIs powered by Dapr
    questions:
      - question: |
          What Dapr features and APIs are available in Azure Container Apps?
        answer: |
          Each Dapr capability undergoes thorough evaluation to ensure it positively impacts customers running microservices in the Azure Container Apps environment, while providing the best possible experience.

      - question: |
          Are alpha Dapr APIs and Tier 2 components supported or available in Azure Container Apps?
        answer: |
          The availability of Dapr's alpha APIs is not guaranteed or Microsoft-supported.
 
          While Tier 1 components are fully supported, Tier 2 components are supported with best effort. [Learn more.](./dapr-overview.md#supported-dapr-apis-components-and-tooling)

      - question: |
          How can I request a Dapr feature enhancement for Azure Container Apps?
        answer:

          You can submit a feature request via the [Azure Container Apps GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-container-apps/issues/new/choose). Make sure to include "Dapr" in the feature request title.

      - question: |
          Why do I see "-msft.<number>" version in my Container App Environment?
        answer: |
          As `1.13.6-msft.1` is being rolled out across production regions, you may still see earlier versions (like `1.12.5` or `1.12.5-msft.6`). The `-msft.<number>` suffix indicates the specific customizations made for Azure Container Apps to enhance your experience.

      - question: |
          How often are Dapr versions released for Azure Container Apps?
        answer: |
          Dapr versions are updated on a best-effort basis, with a strong focus on stability, thorough testing, and minimizing customer impact. The goal is to ensure updates are seamlessly integrated without introducing breaking changes.

          Since Dapr version updates are applied automatically, you always benefit from the most secure version. However, Dapr in Azure Container Apps doesn't follow a fixed release schedule for new features. Instead, the release of new Dapr versions for new functionality depends on the prioritization and stability of the Dapr binaries.

          Find updates and release announcments for Dapr in Azure Container Apps in [GitHub](https://aka.ms/dapr-aca-updates).

      - question: |
          Can I use a specific Dapr version for my environment?
        answer:
          Custom version selection is **not supported**. Instead, your environment is automatically upgraded, maintaining the integrity of Dapr's fully managed and serverless offering in Azure Container Apps.

  - name: Dockerless deployments
    questions:
     - question: |
         What is a Docker-less deployment?
       answer: |
         A Docker-less deployment allows you to deploy your application without defining a Dockerfile in your code. Instead, the Container Apps cloud build functionality uses Buildpacks to turn source code on your local machine into a container image. This option uses the Azure Container Apps default registry.
     - question: |
         During the deployment of my Docker-less application, messages about "ImagePullBackOff on legion", "Kubernetes error" or "Gateway error" appear and my application doesn't deploy successfully.
       answer: |
         You are experiencing a known issue with Docker-less deployments. Retrying might resolve this for you. If you run into this issue, open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-container-apps/issues) so our team can investigate.

  - name: Deploy .NET applications
    questions:
    - question: |
        What if my .NET application fails to scale?
      answer: |
        You need to enable data protection for all .NET apps on Azure Container Apps. See [Deploying and scaling an ASP.NET Core app on Azure Container Apps](/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/scaling-aspnet-apps/scaling-aspnet-apps) for details.        
        
  - name: Deploy Java applications
    questions:
      - question: |
          Which JDK versions are supported and how can I configure the JDK version?
        answer: |
          Container Apps supports four LTS JDK versions: JDK 8, JDK 11, JDK 17 and JDK 21. 
          For source code build, the default version is JDK 17.
          For a JAR file build, the JDK version is read from the file location *META-INF\MANIFEST.MF* in the JAR, but uses the default JDK version 17 if the specified version isn't available.

          You can configure JDK version to override the default version via [build environment variables](java-build-environment-variables.md).
      - question: |
          Which Java build tools are supported?
        answer: |
          Maven
      - question: |
          How can I customize a Java image build from source code?
        answer: |
          You can customize a Java image build via [build environment variables](java-build-environment-variables.md).
      - question: |
          How do I ensure the build and image of my Docker-less build are available in the same region as my app?
        answer: |
          When using `containerapp up` in combination with a Docker-less code base, use the `--location` parameter so that application runs in a location other than US East.
  - name: Tagging
    questions:
      - question: |
          How do I use `latest` or a static tag for my container image?
        answer: |
          Avoid using static tags like `latest` for container images. Using static tags can lead to caching problems and can make your app difficult to troubleshoot. Instead, use unique tags for each deployment, such as a Git hash or date and time to ensure that updates are properly tracked and deployed.
