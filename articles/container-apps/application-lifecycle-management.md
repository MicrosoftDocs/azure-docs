# Application lifecycle management in Azure Container Apps

The Azure Container Apps application lifecycle revolves around [revisions](revisions.md).

When you deploy a container app, the first revision is automatically created. [More revisions are created](revisions.md) as [containers](containers.md) change, or any adjustments are made to the `template` section of the configuration.

A container app flows through four phases: deployment, update, deactivation, and shut down.

> [!NOTE]
> [Azure Container Apps jobs](jobs.md) don't support revisions. Jobs are deployed and updated directly.

## Deployment

As a container app is deployed, the first revision is automatically created.

## Update

As a container app is updated with a [revision scope-change](revisions.md#revision-scope-changes), a new revision is created. You can [choose](revisions.md#revision-modes) whether to automatically deactivate old revisions (single revision mode), or allow them to remain available (multiple revision mode).

When in single revision mode, Container Apps handles the automatic switch between revisions to support [zero downtime deployment](revisions.md#zero-downtime-deployment).

## Deactivate

Once a revision is no longer needed, you can deactivate a revision with the option to reactivate later. During deactivation, containers in the revision are [shut down](#shutdown).

## Shutdown

The containers are shut down in the following situations:

- As a container app scales in
- As a container app is being deleted
- As a revision is being deactivated

When a shutdown is initiated, the container host sends a [SIGTERM message](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)) to your container. The code implemented in the container can respond to this operating system-level message to handle termination.

If your application doesn't respond within 30 seconds to the `SIGTERM` message, then [SIGKILL](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)) terminates your container.

Additionally, make sure your application can gracefully handle shutdowns. Containers restart regularly, so don't expect state to persist inside a container. Instead, use external caches for expensive in-memory cache requirements.
