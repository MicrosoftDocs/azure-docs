# Protect Azure Container Apps with Web Application Firewall on Application Gateway

When you host your apps or microservices in Azure Container Apps, you may not always want to publish them directly to the internet. Instead, you may want to expose them through a reverse proxy.

A reverse proxy is a service that sits in front of one or more services, intercepting and directing incoming traffic to the appropriate destination.

Reverse proxies allow you to place services in front of your apps that supports cross-cutting functionality including:

- Routing
- Caching
- Rate limiting
- Load balancing
- Security layers
- Request filtering

This article demonstrates how to protect your container apps using a [Web Application Firewall (WAF) on Azure Application Gateway](../web-application-firewall/ag/ag-overview.md) with an internal Container Apps environment.

For more information on networking concepts in Container Apps, see [Networking Environment in Azure Container Apps](./networking.md).

## Prerequisites

- **Internal environment with custom VNet**: Have a container app that is on an internal environment and integrated with a custom virtual network. For more information on how to create a custom virtual network integrated app, see [provide a virtual network to an Azure Container Apps environment](./vnet-custom.md).

- **Security certificates**: If you must use TLS/SSL encryption to the application gateway, a valid public certificate that's used to bind to your application gateway is required.

## Retrieve your container app's domain

Use the following steps to retrieve the values of the **default domain** and the **static IP** to set up your Private DNS Zone.

1. From the resource group's *Overview* window in the portal, select your container app.

1. On the *Overview* window for your container app resource, select the link for **Container Apps Environment**

1. On the *Overview* window for your container app environment resource, select **JSON View** in the upper right-hand corner of the page to view the JSON representation of the container apps environment.

1. Copy the values for the **defaultDomain** and **staticIp** properties and paste them into a text editor. You'll create a private DNS zone using these values for the default domain in the next section.

## Create and configure an Azure Private DNS zone

1. On the Azure portal menu or the *Home* page, select **Create a resource**.

1. Search for *Private DNS Zone*, and select **Private DNS Zone** from the search results.

1. Select the **Create** button.

1. Enter the following values:

    | Setting | Action |
    |---|---|
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select the resource group of your container app. |
    | Name | Enter the **defaultDomain** property of the Container Apps Environment from the previous section. |
    | Resource group location | Leave as the default. A value isn't needed as Private DNS Zones are global. |

1. Select **Review + create**. After validation finishes, select **Create**.

1. After the private DNS zone is created, select **Go to resource**.

1. In the *Overview* window, select **+Record set**, to add a new record set.

1. In the *Add record set* window, enter the following values:

    | Setting | Action |
    |---|---|
    | Name | Enter **\***. |
    | Type | Select **A-Address Record**. |
    | TTL | Keep the default values. |
    | TTL unit | Keep the default values. |
    | IP address | Enter the **staticIp** property of the Container Apps Environment from the previous section. |

1. Select **OK** to create the record set.

1. Select **+Record set** again, to add a second record set.

1. In the *Add record set* window, enter the following values:

    | Setting | Action |
    |---|---|
    | Name | Enter **@**. |
    | Type | Select **A-Address Record**. |
    | TTL | Keep the default values. |
    | TTL unit | Keep the default values. |
    | IP address | Enter the **staticIp** property of the Container Apps Environment from the previous section. |

1. Select **OK** to create the record set.

1. Select the **Virtual network links** window from the menu on the left side of the page.

1. Select **+Add** to create a new link with the following values:

    | Setting | Action |
    |---|---|
    | Link name | Enter **my-custom-vnet-pdns-link**. |
    | I know the resource ID of virtual network | Leave it unchecked. |
    | Virtual network | Select the virtual network your container app is integrated with. |
    | Enable auto registration | Leave it unchecked. |

1. Select **OK** to create the virtual network link.

    | Frontend IP Configuration | Select the frontend IP for your Application Gateway. |

1. Under **Private IP address settings** select **Add**.

1. Select **Add** at the bottom of the window.

## Verify the container app

# [Default domain](#tab/default-domain)

1. Find the public IP address for the application gateway on its *Overview* page, or you can search for the address. To search, select *All resources* and enter **my-container-apps-agw-pip** in the search box. Then, select the IP in the search results.

1. Navigate to the public IP address of the application gateway.

1. Your request is automatically routed to the container app, which  verifies the application gateway was successfully created.

# [Custom domain](#tab/custom-domain)

1. Find the public IP address for the application gateway on its *Overview* page, or you can search for the address.

    To search, select *All resources* and enter **my-container-apps-agw-pip** in the search box. Then, select the IP in the search results.

1. Next, you need to update your DNS records via your domain provider's website. Open a new browser window to add the DNS records. Set the A record type to point to the IP address of the application gateway.

1. In your browser, enter your domain. Make sure you use the https protocol.

1. Your request is automatically routed to the container app, which  verifies that the application gateway is successfully created.
