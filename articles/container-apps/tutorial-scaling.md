# Tutorial: Scale a container app

Azure Container Apps manages automatic horizontal scaling through a set of declarative scaling rules. As a container app scales out, new instances of the container app are created on-demand. These instances are known as replicas.

In this tutorial, you add an HTTP scale rule to your container app and observe how your application scales.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement  | Instructions |
|--|--|
| Azure account | If you don't have an Azure account, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). <br><br>You need the *Contributor* permission on the Azure subscription to proceed.

## Create and deploy the container app

Create and deploy your container app with the `containerapp up` command. This command creates a:

- Resource group
- Container Apps environment
- Log Analytics workspace

If any of these resources already exist, the command uses the existing resources rather than creating new ones.

Lastly, the command creates and deploys the container app using a public container image.

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```azurecli
az containerapp up \
  --name my-container-app \
  --resource-group my-container-apps \
  --location centralus \
  --environment 'my-container-apps' \
  --image mcr.microsoft.com/k8se/quickstart:latest \
  --target-port 8080 \
  --ingress external \
  --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn \
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
az containerapp up `
  --name my-container-app `
  --resource-group my-container-apps `
  --location centralus `
  --environment my-container-apps `
  --image mcr.microsoft.com/k8se/quickstart:latest `
  --target-port 8080 `
  --ingress external `
  --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn `
```

---

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the value for the `--image` parameter is in lower case.

By setting `--ingress` to `external`, you make the container app available to public requests.

The `up` command returns the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the container app. Copy this FQDN to a text file. You'll use it in the [Send requests](#send-requests) section. Your FQDN looks like the following example:

```text
https://my-container-app.icydune-96848328.centralus.azurecontainerapps.io
```

## Add scale rule

Add an HTTP scale rule to your container app by running the `az containerapp update` command.

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```azurecli
az containerapp update \
	--name my-container-app \
	--resource-group my-container-apps \
    --scale-rule-name my-http-scale-rule \
    --scale-rule-http-concurrency 1
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
az containerapp update `
	--name my-container-app `
	--resource-group my-container-apps `
    --scale-rule-name my-http-scale-rule `
    --scale-rule-http-concurrency 1
```

---

This command adds an HTTP scale rule to your container app with the name `my-http-scale-rule` and a concurrency setting of `1`. If your app receives more than one concurrent HTTP request, the runtime creates replicas of your app to handle the requests.

The `update` command returns the new configuration as a JSON response to verify your request was a success.

## Start log output

You can observe the effects of your application scaling by viewing the logs generated by the Container Apps runtime. Use the `az containerapp logs show` command to start listening for log entries.

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```azurecli
az containerapp logs show \
	--name my-container-app \
	--resource-group my-container-apps \
	--type=system \
	--follow=true
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
az containerapp logs show `
	--name my-container-app `
	--resource-group my-container-apps `
	--type=system `
	--follow=true
```

---

The `show` command returns entries from the system logs for your container app in real time. You can expect a response like the following example:

```json
{
	"TimeStamp":"2023-08-01T16:49:03.02752",
	"Log":"Connecting to the container 'my-container-app'..."
}
{
	"TimeStamp":"2023-08-01T16:49:03.04437",
	"Log":"Successfully Connected to container:
	'my-container-app' [Revision: 'my-container-app--9uj51l6',
	Replica: 'my-container-app--9uj51l6-5f96557ffb-5khg9']"
}
{
	"TimeStamp":"2023-08-01T16:47:31.9480811+00:00",
	"Log":"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]"
}
{
	"TimeStamp":"2023-08-01T16:47:31.9481264+00:00",
	"Log":"Now listening on: http://[::]:8080"
}
{
	"TimeStamp":"2023-08-01T16:47:31.9490917+00:00",
	"Log":"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]"
}
{
	"TimeStamp":"2023-08-01T16:47:31.9491036+00:00",
	"Log":"Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down."
}
{
	"TimeStamp":"2023-08-01T16:47:31.949723+00:00",
	"Log":"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]"
}
{
	"TimeStamp":"2023-08-01T16:47:31.9497292+00:00",
	"Log":"Hosting environment: Production"
}
{
	"TimeStamp":"2023-08-01T16:47:31.9497325+00:00",
	"Log":"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]"
}
{
	"TimeStamp":"2023-08-01T16:47:31.9497367+00:00",
	"Log":"Content root path: /app/"
}
```

For more information, see [az containerapp logs](/cli/azure/containerapp/logs).

## Send requests

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

Open a new bash shell. Run the following command, replacing `<YOUR_CONTAINER_APP_FQDN>` with the fully qualified domain name for your container app that you saved from the [Create and deploy the container app](#create-and-deploy-the-container-app) section.

```bash
seq 1 50 | xargs -Iname -P10 curl "<YOUR_CONTAINER_APP_FQDN>"
```

These commands send 50 requests to your container app in concurrent batches of 10 requests each.

| Command or argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `seq 1 50` | Generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 50. |
| `|` | The pipe operator sends the sequence to the `xargs` command. |
| `xargs` | Runs `curl` with the specified URL |
| `-Iname` | Acts as a placeholder for the output of `seq`. This argument prevents the return value from being sent to the `curl` command. |
| `curl` | Calls the given URL. |
| `-P10` | Instructs `xargs` to run up to 10 processes at a time. |

For more information, see the documentation for:
- [seq](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/seq.1.html)
- [xargs](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/xargs.1.html)
- [curl](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/curl.1.html)

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Open a new command prompt and enter PowerShell. Run the following commands, replacing `<YOUR_CONTAINER_APP_FQDN>` with the fully qualified domain name for your container app that you saved from the [Create and deploy the container app](#create-and-deploy-the-container-app) section.

```powershell
$url="<YOUR_CONTAINER_APP_FQDN>"
$Runspace = [runspacefactory]::CreateRunspacePool(1,10)
$Runspace.Open()
1..50 | % {
    $ps = [powershell]::Create()
    $ps.RunspacePool = $Runspace
    [void]$ps.AddCommand("Invoke-WebRequest").AddParameter("UseBasicParsing",$true).AddParameter("Uri",$url)
    [void]$ps.BeginInvoke()
}
```

These commands send 50 requests to your container app in asynchronous batches of 10 requests each.

| Command or argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `[runspacefactory]::CreateRunspacePool(1,10)` |  Creates a `RunspacePool` that allows up to 10 runspaces to run concurrently. |
| `1..50 | % {  }` | Runs the code enclosed in the curly braces 50 times. |
| `$ps = [powershell]::Create()` | Creates a new PowerShell instance. |
| `$ps.RunspacePool = $Runspace` | Tells the PowerShell instance to run in the `RunspacePool`. |
| `[void]$ps.AddCommand("Invoke-WebRequest")` | Sends a request to your container app. |
| `.AddParameter("UseBasicParsing", $true)` | Sends a request to your container app. |
| `.AddParameter("Uri", $url)` | Sends a request to your container app. |
| `[void]$ps.BeginInvoke()` | Tells the PowerShell instance to run asynchronously. |

For more information, see [Beginning Use of PowerShell Runspaces](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/beginning-use-of-powershell-runspaces-part-3/)

---

In the first shell, where you ran the `az containerapp logs show` command, the output now contains one or more log entries like the following.

```json
{
	"TimeStamp":"2023-08-01 18:09:52 +0000 UTC",
	"Type":"Normal",
	"ContainerAppName":"my-container-app",
	"RevisionName":"my-container-app--9uj51l6",
	"ReplicaName":"my-container-app--9uj51l6-5f96557ffb-f795d",
	"Msg":"Replica 'my-container-app--9uj51l6-5f96557ffb-f795d' has been scheduled to run on a node.",
	"Reason":"AssigningReplica",
	"EventSource":"ContainerAppController",
	"Count":0
}
```
