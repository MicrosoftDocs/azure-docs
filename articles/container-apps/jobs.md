# Jobs in Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps jobs enable you to run containerized tasks that execute for a finite duration and exit. You can use jobs to perform tasks such as data processing, machine learning, or any scenario where on-demand processing is required.

Container apps and jobs run in the same [environment](environment.md), allowing them to share capabilities such as networking and logging.

## Compare container apps and jobs

There are two types of compute resources in Azure Container Apps: apps and jobs.

Apps are services that run continuously. If a container in an app fails, it restarts automatically. Examples of apps include HTTP APIs, web apps, and background services that continuously process input.

Jobs are tasks that start, run for a finite duration, and exit when finished. Each execution of a job typically performs a single unit of work. Job executions start manually, on a schedule, or in response to events. Examples of jobs include batch processes that run on demand and scheduled tasks.

### Example scenarios

The following table compares common scenarios for apps and jobs:

| Container | Compute resource | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| An HTTP server that serves web content and API requests | App | Configure an [HTTP scale rule](scale-app.md#http). |
| A process that generates financial reports nightly | Job | Use the [*Schedule* job type](#scheduled-jobs) and configure a cron expression. |
| A continuously running service that processes messages from an Azure Service Bus queue | App | Configure a [custom scale rule](scale-app.md#custom). |
| A job that processes a single message or a small batch of messages from an Azure queue and exits | Job | Use the *Event* job type and [configure a custom scale rule](tutorial-event-driven-jobs.md) to trigger job executions when there are messages in the queue. |
| A background task that's triggered on-demand and exits when finished | Job | Use the *Manual* job type and [start executions](#start-a-job-execution-on-demand) manually or programmatically using an API. |
| A self-hosted GitHub Actions runner or Azure Pipelines agent | Job | Use the *Event* job type and configure a [GitHub Actions](tutorial-ci-cd-runners-jobs.md?pivots=container-apps-jobs-self-hosted-ci-cd-github-actions) or [Azure Pipelines](tutorial-ci-cd-runners-jobs.md?pivots=container-apps-jobs-self-hosted-ci-cd-azure-pipelines) scale rule. |
| An Azure Functions app | App | [Deploy Azure Functions to Container Apps](../azure-functions/functions-container-apps-hosting.md). |
| An event-driven app using the Azure WebJobs SDK | App | [Configure a scale rule](scale-app.md#custom) for each event source. |

## Concepts

A Container Apps environment is a secure boundary around one or more container apps and jobs. Jobs involve a few key concepts:

* **Job:** A job defines the default configuration that is used for each job execution. The configuration includes the container image to use, the resources to allocate, and the command to run.
* **Job execution:** A job execution is a single run of a job that is triggered manually, on a schedule, or in response to an event.
* **Job replica:** A typical job execution runs one replica defined by the job's configuration. In advanced scenarios, a job execution can run multiple replicas.

## Permissions

To start a container app job, the appropriate permissions are required. Ensure that your user account or service principal has the following roles assigned:

* **Azure Container Apps Contributor:** Allows permissions to create and manage container apps and jobs.
* **Azure Monitor Reader (optional):** Enables viewing monitoring data for jobs.
* **Custom Role:** For more granular permissions, you can create a custom role with the following actions:

- Microsoft.App/containerApps/jobs/start/action
- Microsoft.App/containerApps/jobs/read
- Microsoft.App/containerApps/jobs/executions/read

For more information about assigning roles and permissions, see [Azure Role-Based Access Control](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview).

## Job trigger types

A job's trigger type determines how the job is started. The following trigger types are available:

- **Manual**: Manual jobs are triggered on-demand.
- **Schedule**: Scheduled jobs are triggered at specific times and can run repeatedly.
- **Event**: Events, such as a message arriving in a queue, trigger event-driven jobs.

### Manual jobs

Manual jobs are triggered on-demand using the Azure CLI, Azure portal, or a request to the Azure Resource Manager API.

Examples of manual jobs include:

- One time processing tasks such as migrating data from one system to another.
- An e-commerce site running as container app starts a job execution to process inventory when an order is placed.

To create a manual job, use the job type `Manual`.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To create a manual job using the Azure CLI, use the `az containerapp job create` command. The following example creates a manual job named `my-job` in a resource group named `my-resource-group` and a Container Apps environment named `my-environment`:

```azurecli
az containerapp job create \
    --name "my-job" --resource-group "my-resource-group"  --environment "my-environment" \
    --trigger-type "Manual" \
    --replica-timeout 1800 \
    --image "mcr.microsoft.com/k8se/quickstart-jobs:latest" \
    --cpu "0.25" --memory "0.5Gi"
```

# [Azure Resource Manager](#tab/azure-resource-manager)

The following example Azure Resource Manager template creates a manual job named `my-job` in a resource group named `my-resource-group` and a Container Apps environment named `my-environment`:

```json
{
    "location": "North Central US",
    "name": "my-job",
    "properties": {
        "configuration": {
            "manualTriggerConfig": {
                "parallelism": 1,
                "replicaCompletionCount": 1
            },
            "replicaRetryLimit": 0,
            "replicaTimeout": 1800,
            "triggerType": "Manual"
        },
        "environmentId": "/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments/my-environment",
        "template": {
            "containers": [
                {
                    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/k8se/quickstart-jobs:latest",
                    "name": "main",
                    "resources": {
                        "cpu": 0.25,
                        "memory": "0.5Gi"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To create a manual job using the Azure portal, search for *Container App Jobs* in the Azure portal and select *Create*. Specify *Manual* as the trigger type.

To use a sample container image, enter the following values in the *Containers* tab:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | *main* |
| Image source | *Docker Hub or other registries* |
| Image type | *Public* |
| Registry login server | *mcr.microsoft.com* |
| Image and tag | *k8se/quickstart-jobs:latest* |
| CPU and memory | *0.25 CPU cores, 0.5 Gi memory*, or higher |

---

The `mcr.microsoft.com/k8se/quickstart-jobs:latest` image is a public sample container image that runs a job that waits a few seconds, prints a message to the console, and then exits. To authenticate and use a private container image, see [Containers](containers.md#container-registries).

The above command only creates the job. To start a job execution, see [Start a job execution on demand](#start-a-job-execution-on-demand).

### Scheduled jobs

To create a scheduled job, use the job type `Schedule`.

Container Apps jobs use cron expressions to define schedules. It supports the standard [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) expression format with five fields for minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week. The following are examples of cron expressions:

| Expression | Description |
|---|---|
| `*/5 * * * *` | Runs every 5 minutes. |
| `0 */2 * * *` | Runs every two hours. |
| `0 0 * * *` | Runs every day at midnight. |
| `0 0 * * 0` | Runs every Sunday at midnight. |
| `0 0 1 * *` | Runs on the first day of every month at midnight. |

Cron expressions in scheduled jobs are evaluated in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To create a scheduled job using the Azure CLI, use the `az containerapp job create` command. The following example creates a scheduled job named `my-job` in a resource group named `my-resource-group` and a Container Apps environment named `my-environment`:

```azurecli
az containerapp job create \
    --name "my-job" --resource-group "my-resource-group"  --environment "my-environment" \
    --trigger-type "Schedule" \
    --replica-timeout 1800 \
    --image "mcr.microsoft.com/k8se/quickstart-jobs:latest" \
    --cpu "0.25" --memory "0.5Gi" \
    --cron-expression "*/1 * * * *"
```

# [Azure Resource Manager](#tab/azure-resource-manager)

The following example Azure Resource Manager template creates a manual job named `my-job` in a resource group named `my-resource-group` and a Container Apps environment named `my-environment`:

```json
{
    "location": "North Central US",
    "name": "my-job",
    "properties": {
        "configuration": {
            "scheduleTriggerConfig": {
                "cronExpression": "*/1 * * * *",
                "parallelism": 1,
                "replicaCompletionCount": 1
            },
            "replicaRetryLimit": 0,
            "replicaTimeout": 1800,
            "triggerType": "Schedule"
        },
        "environmentId": "/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments/my-environment",
        "template": {
            "containers": [
                {
                    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/k8se/quickstart-jobs:latest",
                    "name": "main",
                    "resources": {
                        "cpu": 0.25,
                        "memory": "0.5Gi"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To create a scheduled job using the Azure portal, search for *Container App Jobs* in the Azure portal and select *Create*. Specify *Schedule* as the trigger type and define the schedule with a cron expression, such as `*/1 * * * *` to run every minute.

To use a sample container image, enter the following values in the *Containers* tab:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | *main* |
| Image source | *Docker Hub or other registries* |
| Image type | *Public* |
| Registry login server | *mcr.microsoft.com* |
| Image and tag | *k8se/quickstart-jobs:latest* |
| CPU and memory | *0.25 CPU cores, 0.5 Gi memory*, or higher |

---

The `mcr.microsoft.com/k8se/quickstart-jobs:latest` image is a public sample container image that runs a job that waits a few seconds, prints a message to the console, and then exits. To authenticate and use a private container image, see [Containers](containers.md#container-registries).

The cron expression `*/1 * * * *` runs the job every minute.

### Event-driven jobs

 Events from supported [custom scalers](scale-app.md#custom) trigger event-driven jobs. Examples of event-driven jobs include:

- A job that runs when a new message is added to a queue such as Azure Service Bus, Kafka, or RabbitMQ.
- A self-hosted [GitHub Actions runner](tutorial-ci-cd-runners-jobs.md?pivots=container-apps-jobs-self-hosted-ci-cd-github-actions) or [Azure DevOps agent](tutorial-ci-cd-runners-jobs.md?pivots=container-apps-jobs-self-hosted-ci-cd-azure-pipelines) that runs when a new job is queued in a workflow or pipeline.

Container apps and event-driven jobs use [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) scalers. They both evaluate scaling rules on a polling interval to measure the volume of events for an event source, but the way they use the results is different.

In an app, each replica continuously processes events and a scaling rule determines the number of replicas to run to meet demand. In event-driven jobs, each job execution typically processes a single event, and a scaling rule determines the number of job executions to run.

Use jobs when each event requires a new instance of the container with dedicated resources or needs to run for a long time. Event-driven jobs are conceptually similar to [KEDA scaling jobs](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/concepts/scaling-jobs/).

To create an event-driven job, use the job type `Event`.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To create an event-driven job using the Azure CLI, use the `az containerapp job create` command. The following example creates an event-driven job named `my-job` in a resource group named `my-resource-group` and a Container Apps environment named `my-environment`:

```azurecli
az containerapp job create \
    --name "my-job" --resource-group "my-resource-group"  --environment "my-environment" \
    --trigger-type "Event" \
    --replica-timeout 1800 \
    --image "docker.io/myuser/my-event-driven-job:latest" \
    --cpu "0.25" --memory "0.5Gi" \
    --min-executions "0" \
    --max-executions "10" \
    --scale-rule-name "queue" \
    --scale-rule-type "azure-queue" \
    --scale-rule-metadata "accountName=mystorage" "queueName=myqueue" "queueLength=1" \
    --scale-rule-auth "connection=connection-string-secret" \
    --secrets "connection-string-secret=<QUEUE_CONNECTION_STRING>"
```

The example configures an Azure Storage queue scale rule.

# [Azure Resource Manager](#tab/azure-resource-manager)

The following example Azure Resource Manager template creates an event-driven job named `my-job` in a resource group named `my-resource-group` and a Container Apps environment named `my-environment`:

```json
{
    "location": "North Central US",
    "name": "my-job",
    "properties": {
        "configuration": {
            "eventTriggerConfig": {
                "scale": {
                    "maxExecutions": 10,
                    "minExecutions": 0,
                    "pollingInterval": 15,
                    "rules": [
                        {
                            "auth": [
                                {
                                    "triggerParameter": "connection",
                                    "secretRef": "connection-string-secret"
                                }
                            ],
                            "metadata": {
                                "accountName": "mystorage",
                                "queueLength": 1,
                                "queueName": "myqueue"
                            },
                            "name": "queue",
                            "type": "azure-queue"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            "replicaRetryLimit": 0,
            "replicaTimeout": 1800,
            "triggerType": "Event",
            "secrets": [
                {
                    "name": "connection-string-secret",
                    "value": "<QUEUE_CONNECTION_STRING>"
                }
            ]
        },
        "environmentId": "/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments/my-environment",
        "template": {
            "containers": [
                {
                    "image": "docker.io/myuser/my-event-driven-job:latest",
                    "name": "main",
                    "resources": {
                        "cpu": 0.25,
                        "memory": "0.5Gi"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

The example configures an Azure Storage queue scale rule.

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To create an event-driven job using the Azure portal, search for *Container App Jobs* in the Azure portal and select *Create*. Specify *Event* as the trigger type and configure the scaling rule.

---

For a complete tutorial, see [Deploy an event-driven job](tutorial-event-driven-jobs.md).

## Start a job execution on demand

For any job type, you can start a job execution on demand.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To start a job execution using the Azure CLI, use the `az containerapp job start` command. The following example starts an execution of a job named `my-job` in a resource group named `my-resource-group`:

```azurecli
az containerapp job start --name "my-job" --resource-group "my-resource-group"
```

# [Azure Resource Manager](#tab/azure-resource-manager)

To start a job execution using the Azure Resource Manager REST API, make a `POST` request to the job's `start` operation.

The following example starts an execution of a job named `my-job` in a resource group named `my-resource-group`:

```http
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.App/jobs/my-job/start?api-version=2023-05-01
Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
```

Replace `<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>` with your subscription ID.

To authenticate the request, replace `<TOKEN>` in the `Authorization` header with a valid bearer token. The identity used to generate the token must have `Contributor` permission to the Container Apps job resource. For more information, see [Azure REST API reference](/rest/api/azure).

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To start a job execution in the Azure portal, select **Run now** in the job's overview page.

---

When you start a job execution, you can choose to override the job's configuration. For example, you can override an environment variable or the startup command to run the same job with different inputs. The overridden configuration is only used for the current execution and doesn't change the job's configuration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When overriding the configuration, the job's entire template configuration is replaced with the new configuration. Ensure that the new configuration includes all required settings.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To override the job's configuration while starting an execution, use the `az containerapp job start` command and pass a YAML file containing the template to use for the execution. The following example starts an execution of a job named `my-job` in a resource group named `my-resource-group`.

Retrieve the job's current configuration with the `az containerapp job show` command and save the template to a file named `my-job-template.yaml`:

```azurecli
az containerapp job show --name "my-job" --resource-group "my-resource-group" --query "properties.template" --output yaml > my-job-template.yaml
```

The `--query "properties.template"` option returns only the job's template configuration.

Edit the `my-job-template.yaml` file to override the job's configuration. For example, to override the environment variables, modify the `env` section:

```yaml
containers:
- name: print-hello
  image: ubuntu
  resources:
    cpu: 1
    memory: 2Gi
  env:
  - name: MY_NAME
    value: Azure Container Apps jobs
  args:
  - /bin/bash
  - -c
  - echo "Hello, $MY_NAME!"
```

Start the job using the template:

```azurecli
az containerapp job start --name "my-job" --resource-group "my-resource-group" \
    --yaml my-job-template.yaml
```

# [Azure Resource Manager](#tab/azure-resource-manager)

To override the job's configuration, include a template in the request body. The following example overrides the startup command to run a different command:

```http
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.App/jobs/my-job/start?api-version=2023-05-01
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>

{
    "containers": [
        {
            "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/k8se/quickstart-jobs:latest",
            "name": "main",
            "resources": {
                "cpu": 0.25,
                "memory": "0.5Gi"
            },
            "command": [
                "echo",
                "Hello, Azure Container Apps jobs!"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Replace `<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>` with your subscription ID and `<TOKEN>` in the `Authorization` header with a valid bearer token. The identity used to generate the token must have `Contributor` permission to the Container Apps job resource. For more information, see [Azure REST API reference](/rest/api/azure).

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Starting a job execution with an overridden configuration isn't supported in the Azure portal.

---

## Get job execution history

Each Container Apps job maintains a history of recent job executions.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To get the statuses of job executions using the Azure CLI, use the `az containerapp job execution list` command. The following example returns the status of the most recent execution of a job named `my-job` in a resource group named `my-resource-group`:

```azurecli
az containerapp job execution list --name "my-job" --resource-group "my-resource-group"
```

# [Azure Resource Manager](#tab/azure-resource-manager)

To get the status of job executions using the Azure Resource Manager REST API, make a `GET` request to the job's `executions` operation. The following example returns the status of the most recent execution of a job named `my-job` in a resource group named `my-resource-group`:

```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.App/jobs/my-job/executions?api-version=2023-05-01
```

Replace `<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>` with your subscription ID.

To authenticate the request, add an `Authorization` header with a valid bearer token. For more information, see [Azure REST API reference](/rest/api/azure).

# [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

To view the status of job executions using the Azure portal, search for *Container App Jobs* in the Azure portal and select the job. The *Execution history* tab displays the status of recent executions.

---

The execution history for scheduled and event-based jobs is limited to the most recent 100 successful and failed job executions.

To list all executions of a job or to get detailed output from a job, query the logs provider configured for your Container Apps environment.

## Advanced job configuration

Container Apps jobs support advanced configuration options such as container settings, retries, timeouts, and parallelism.

### Container settings

Container settings define the containers to run in each replica of a job execution. They include environment variables, secrets, and resource limits. For more information, see [Containers](containers.md). Running multiple containers in a single job is an advanced scenario. Most jobs run a single container.

### Job settings

The following table includes the job settings that you can configure:

| Setting | Azure Resource Manager property | CLI parameter| Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Job type | `triggerType` | `--trigger-type` | The type of job. (`Manual`, `Schedule`, or `Event`) |
| Replica timeout | `replicaTimeout` | `--replica-timeout` | The maximum time in seconds to wait for a replica to complete. |
| Polling interval | `pollingInterval` | `--polling-interval` | The time in seconds to wait between polling for events. Default is 30 seconds. |
| Replica retry limit | `replicaRetryLimit` | `--replica-retry-limit` | The maximum number of times to retry a failed replica. To fail a replica without retrying, set the value to `0`. |
| Parallelism | `parallelism` | `--parallelism` | The number of replicas to run per execution. For most jobs, set the value to `1`. |
| Replica completion count | `replicaCompletionCount` | `--replica-completion-count` | The number of replicas to complete successfully for the execution to succeed. Most be equal or less than the parallelism. For most jobs, set the value to `1`. |

### Example

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

The following example creates a job with advanced configuration options:

```azurecli
az containerapp job create \
    --name "my-job" --resource-group "my-resource-group"  --environment "my-environment" \
