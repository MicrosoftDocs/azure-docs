# Set up IP ingress restrictions in Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps allows you to limit inbound traffic to your container app by configuring IP ingress restrictions via ingress configuration.

There are two types of restrictions:

* *Allow*: Allow inbound traffic only from address ranges you specify in allow rules.
* *Deny*: Deny all inbound traffic only from address ranges you specify in deny rules.

when no IP restriction rules are defined, all inbound traffic is allowed.

IP restrictions rules contain the following properties:

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| name | string | The name of the rule. |
| description | string | A description of the rule. |
| ipAddressRange | IP address range in CIDR format | The IP address range in CIDR notation. |
| action | Allow or Deny | The action to take for the rule. |

The `ipAddressRange` parameter accepts IPv4 addresses. Define each IPv4 address block in [Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) notation.  

> [!NOTE]
> All rules must be the same type. You cannot combine allow rules and deny rules.

## Manage IP ingress restrictions

You can manage IP access restrictions rules through the Azure portal or Azure CLI.

::: zone pivot="azure-portal"

### Add rules

1. Go to your container app in the Azure portal.
1. Select **Ingress** from the left side menu.
1. Select the **IP Security Restrictions Mode** toggle to enable IP restrictions.  You can choose to allow or deny traffic from the specified IP address ranges.
1. Select **Add** to create the rule.

    :::image type="content" source="media/ingress/screenshot-ingress-page-ip-restrictions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of IP restriction settings on container app Ingress page.":::

1. Enter values in the following fields:

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    |**IPv4 address or range**|Enter the IP address or range of IP addresses in CIDR notation. For example, to allow access from a single IP address, use the following format: *10.200.10.2/32*.|
    |**Name**|Enter a name for the rule.|
    |**Description**|Enter a description for the rule.|
  
1. Select **Add**.
1. Repeat steps 4-6 to add more rules.
1. When you have finished adding rules, select **Save**.

### Update a rule

1. Go to your container app in the Azure portal.
1. Select **Ingress** from the left side menu.
1. Select the rule you want to update.
1. Change the rule settings.
1. Select **Save** to save the updates.
1. Select **Save** on the Ingress page to save the updated rules.

### Delete a rule

1. Go to your container app in the Azure portal.
1. Select **Ingress** from the left side menu.
1. Select the delete icon next to the rule you want to delete.
1. Select **Save**.

::: zone pivot="azure-cli"

You can manage IP Access Restrictions using the `az containerapp ingress access-restriction` command group.  This command group has the options to:

- `set`: Create or update a rule.
- `remove`: Delete a rule.
- `list`: List all rules.

### Create or update rules

You can create or update IP restrictions using the `az containerapp ingress access-restriction set` command.  

The `az containerapp ingress access-restriction set` command group uses the following parameters.

| Argument | Values | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `--rule-name` (required) | String | Specifies the name of the access restriction rule. |
| `--description` | String | Specifies a description for the access restriction rule. |
| `--action` (required) | Allow, Deny | Specifies whether to allow or deny access from the specified IP address range. |
| `--ip-address` (required) | IP address or range of IP addresses in CIDR notation | Specifies the IP address range to allow or deny. |

Add more rules by repeating the command with a different `--rule-name` and -`--ip-address` values.



#### Create allow rules

The following example `az containerapp access-restriction set` command creates a rule to restrict inbound access to an IP address range.  You must delete any existing deny rules before you can add any allow rules.

Replace the values in the following example with your own values.

```azurecli
az containerapp ingress access-restriction set \
   --name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> \
   --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> \
   --rule-name "my allow rule" \
   --description "example of rule allowing access" \
   --ip-address 192.168.0.1/28 \
   --action Allow
```

You can add to the allow rules by repeating the command with a different `--ip-address` and `--rule-name` values.

#### Create deny rules

The following example of the `az containerapp access-restriction set` command creates an access rule to deny inbound traffic from a specified IP range.  You must delete any existing allow rules before you can add deny rules.

Replace the placeholders in the following example with your own values.

```azurecli
az containerapp ingress access-restriction set \
  --name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> \
  --rule-name "my deny rule" \
  --description "example of rule denying access" \
  --ip-address 192.168.0.100/28 \
  --action Deny
```

You can add to the deny rules by repeating the command with a different `--ip-address` and `--rule-name` values.  If you use a rule name that already exists, the existing rule is updated.

### Update a rule

You can update a rule using the `az containerapp ingress access-restriction set` command.  You can change the IP address range and the rule description, but not the rule name or action.

The `--action` parameter is required, but you can't change the action from Allow to Deny or vice versa.  
If you omit the `---description` parameter, the description is deleted.

The following example updates the ip address range.

```azurecli
az containerapp ingress access-restriction set \
  --name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> \
  --rule-name "my deny rule" \
  --ip-address 192.168.0.1/24 \
  --description "example of rule denying access" \
  --action Deny
```

### Remove access restrictions

The following example `az containerapp ingress access-restriction remove` command removes a rule.

```azurecli
az containerapp ingress access-restriction list
  --name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> \
  --rule-name "<your rule name>"
```

### List access restrictions

The following example `az containerapp ingress access-restriction list` command lists the IP restriction rules for the container app.

```azurecli
az containerapp ingress access-restriction list
  --name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP>
```
