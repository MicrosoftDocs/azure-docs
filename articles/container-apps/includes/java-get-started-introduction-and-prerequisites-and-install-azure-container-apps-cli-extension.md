There are several options available for deploying Java applications, including the following options:

- Deployment from a local file system or from a code repository.
- Deployment using Maven or an IDE.
- Deployment using a WAR file, a JAR file, or directly from source code.

By the end of this tutorial, you deploy a web application that you can manage through the Azure portal. The following screenshot shows the home page of the PetClinic application deployed to Azure Container Apps:
