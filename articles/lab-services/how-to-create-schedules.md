# Create and manage schedules for labs in Azure Lab Services

[!INCLUDE [Retirement guide](./includes/retirement-banner.md)]

Schedules allow you to configure a lab such that VMs in the lab automatically start and shut down at a specified time. You can define a one-time schedule or a recurring schedule. The following procedures give you steps to create and manage schedules for a lab:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The scheduled running time of VMs does not count against the [quota allotted to a user](how-to-manage-lab-users.md#set-quotas-for-users). The quota is for the time outside of schedule hours that a student spends on VMs.

## Set a schedule for the lab

Create a scheduled event for the lab so that VMs in the lab are automatically started/stopped at specific times. The user quota you specified earlier is the additional time assigned to each user outside this scheduled time.

> [!NOTE]
> Before we get started, here's how schedules affect lab virtual machines:
>
>- Only assigned virtual machines are started. If a machine is not claimed by an end user (student), then the machine will not start on the scheduled hours. Schedules also don't start template VMs.
>- All virtual machines (whether claimed or unclaimed, template or non template) are stopped based on the lab schedule.

1. Switch to the **Schedules** page, and select **Add scheduled event** on the toolbar.

7. In the **Repeat** section, select the current schedule.
