# Create a lab in Azure Lab Services using a Bicep file

[!INCLUDE [Retirement guide](./includes/retirement-banner.md)]

In this article, you learn how to create a lab using a Bicep file.  For a detailed overview of Azure Lab Services, see [An introduction to Azure Lab Services](lab-services-overview.md).

[!INCLUDE [About Bicep](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/resource-manager-quickstart-bicep-introduction.md)]

[!INCLUDE [About Azure Resource Manager](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/resource-manager-quickstart-introduction.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Azure subscription](./includes/lab-services-prerequisite-subscription.md)]
[!INCLUDE [Create and manage labs](./includes/lab-services-prerequisite-create-lab.md)]
[!INCLUDE [Existing lab plan](./includes/lab-services-prerequisite-lab-plan.md)]

## Review the code

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

[!INCLUDE [Retirement guide](./includes/retirement-banner.md)]

The Bicep file used in this article is from [Azure Quickstart Templates](/samples/azure/azure-quickstart-templates/lab/).

:::code language="bicep" source="~/quickstart-templates/quickstarts/microsoft.labservices/lab/main.bicep":::

# [ARM](#tab/arm)

[!INCLUDE [Retirement guide](./includes/retirement-banner.md)]

The template used in this article is from [Azure Quickstart Templates](/samples/azure/azure-quickstart-templates/lab/).

:::code language="json" source="~/quickstart-templates/quickstarts/microsoft.labservices/lab-using-lab-plan/azuredeploy.json":::

One Azure resource is defined in the template:

- **[Microsoft.LabServices/labs](/azure/templates/microsoft.labservices/labs)**: resource type description.

More Azure Lab Services template samples can be found in [Azure Quickstart Templates](/samples/browse/?expanded=azure&products=azure-resource-manager&terms=lab%20services).  For more information how to create a lab without a lab plan using automation, see [Create Azure LabServices lab template](/samples/azure/azure-quickstart-templates/lab/).

## Deploy the resources

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

[!INCLUDE [Retirement guide](./includes/retirement-banner.md)]

1. Save the Bicep file as **main.bicep** to your local computer.
1. Deploy the Bicep file using either Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell.

    # [CLI](#tab/CLI)

    ```azurecli
    az group create --name exampleRG --location eastus
    az deployment group create --resource-group exampleRG --template-file main.bicep --parameters adminUsername=<admin-username>
    ```

    # [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

    ```azurepowershell
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name exampleRG -Location eastus
    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName exampleRG -TemplateFile ./main.bicep -adminUsername "<admin-username>"
    ```

    ---

  > [!NOTE]
  > Replace **\<admin-username\>** with a unique username. You'll also be prompted to enter adminPassword. The minimum password length is 12 characters.

  When the deployment finishes, you should see a messaged indicating the deployment succeeded.

# [ARM](#tab/arm)

[!INCLUDE [Retirement guide](./includes/retirement-banner.md)]

1. Select the following link to sign in to Azure and open a template. The template creates a lab.

    :::image type="content" source="~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/media/template-deployments/deploy-to-azure-button.svg" alt-text="Button to deploy the Resource Manager template to Azure." border="false" link="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3a%2f%2fraw.githubusercontent.com%2fAzure%2fazure-quickstart-templates%2fmaster%2fquickstarts%2fmicrosoft.labservices%2flab-using-lab-plan%2fazuredeploy.json":::

2. Optionally, change the name of the lab.
3. Select the **resource group** the lab plan you're going to use.
4. Enter the required values for the template:

    1. **adminUser**. The name of the user that will be added as an administrator for the lab VM.
    2. **adminPassword**.  The password for the administrator user for the lab VM.
    3. **labPlanId**.  The resource ID for the lab plan to be used.  The **Id** is listed in the **Properties** page of the lab plan resource in Azure.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-create-lab-template/lab-plan-properties-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of properties page for lab plan in Azure Lab Services with ID property highlighted.":::

5. Select **Review + create**.
6. Select **Create**.

The Azure portal is used here to deploy the template. You can also use Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or the REST API. To learn other deployment methods, see [Deploy resources with ARM templates](../azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-powershell.md).

## Review deployed resources

Use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell to list the deployed resources in the resource group.

To use Azure PowerShell, first verify the Az.LabServices module is installed. Then use the **Get-AzLabServicesLab** cmdlet.

# [CLI](#tab/CLI)

[!INCLUDE [Retirement guide](./includes/retirement-banner.md)]

```azurecli-interactive
az resource list --resource-group exampleRG
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

[!INCLUDE [Retirement guide](./includes/retirement-banner.md)]

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName exampleRG
```

---

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell to delete the VM and all of the resources in the resource group.

# [CLI](#tab/CLI)

[!INCLUDE [Retirement guide](./includes/retirement-banner.md)]

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name exampleRG
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

[!INCLUDE [Retirement guide](./includes/retirement-banner.md)]

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name exampleRG
```
