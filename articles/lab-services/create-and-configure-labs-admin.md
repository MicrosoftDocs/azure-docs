# Configure regions for labs

[!INCLUDE [Retirement guide](./includes/retirement-banner.md)]

This article shows you how to configure the locations where you can create labs by enabling or disabling regions associated with the lab plan. Enabling a region allows lab creators to create labs within that region. You cannot create labs in disabled regions. 

When you create a lab plan, you have to set an initial region for the labs, but you can enable or disable more regions for your lab at any time. If you create a lab plan by using the Azure portal, enable regions initially includes the same region as the location of the lab plan. If you create a lab plan by using the API or SDKs, you must set the AllowedRegion property when you create the lab plan. 

You might need to change the region for your labs in these circumstances:
- Regulatory compliance. Choosing where your data resides, such as organizations choosing specific regions to help ensure that they are compliant with local regulations. 
- Service availability. Providing the optimal lab experience for your students by ensuring the Azure Lab Service is available in the region closest to them. For more information about service availability, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=lab-services).
- New region. You may acquire quota in a region different than the regions already enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> The default limit for the total number of regions you can use for creating labs varies by offer category type. If you have reached the Azure regions limit for your subscription, you can only create labs in regions that you're already using.
