# Tutorial: Create a lab with the Azure Lab Services app in Teams or Canvas

[!INCLUDE [Retirement guide](./includes/retirement-banner.md)]

With Azure Lab Services, you can create labs directly from within Microsoft Teams or Canvas. In this tutorial, you use the Azure Lab Services app for Microsoft Teams or Canvas to create and publish a lab. After you complete this tutorial, lab users can directly access their lab virtual machine from Teams or Canvas.

With the Azure Lab Services app for Teams or Canvas you can create and manage labs without having to leave the Teams or Canvas environment and lab user management is synchronized based team or course membership. Lab users are automatically registered for a lab and have a lab VM assigned to them. They can also access their lab VM directly from within Teams or Canvas.

## Create a new lab

A lab contains the configuration and settings for creating lab VMs. All lab VMs within a lab are identical. You use the Azure Lab Services app to create a lab in the lab plan.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can only see labs in Teams or Canvas that you created with the Azure Lab Services app. If you created a lab in the Azure Lab Services website, it is not visible in Teams or Canvas.

1. Select **Create lab** to start creating a new lab.

1. On the **New Lab** page, enter the following information, and then select **Next**:

    | Field        | Description                |
    | ------------ | -------------------------- |
    | **Name** | Enter *programming-101*. |
    | **Virtual machine image** | Select *Windows Server 2022 Datacenter*. |
    | **Virtual machine size** | Select *Small*. |
    | **Location** | Leave the default value. |

    Some virtual machine sizes might not be available depending on the lab plan region and your subscription core limit. Learn more about [virtual machine sizes in the administrator's guide](./administrator-guide.md#vm-sizing) and how to [request additional capacity](./how-to-request-capacity-increase.md).

    You can [enable or disable specific virtual machine images](./specify-marketplace-images.md#enable-and-disable-images) by configuring the lab plan.

1. On the **Virtual machine credentials** page, specify a default **username** and **password**, and then select **Next**.

    By default, all the lab VMs use the same credentials.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Make a note of username and password. They won't be shown again.

1. On the **Lab policies** page, leave the default values and select **Next**.

    The default settings enable secure shell (SSH) access to the lab virtual machine, provide users with 10 quota hours, and shuts down the lab VMs when there's no activity.

1. On the **Template virtual machine settings** page, select **Use virtual machine image without customization**.

    In this tutorial, you use the VM image as-is, known as a *templateless VM*. Azure Lab Services also supports creating a *template VM*, which lets you make configuration changes or install software on top of the VM image.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-lab-teams-canvas/templateless-virtual-machine-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Template virtual machine settings page, with the option selected to create a templateless VM."::: 

1. Select **Finish** to start the lab creation. It might take several minutes for the lab creation to finish.

1. When the lab creation finishes, you can see the lab details in the **Template** page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-lab-teams-canvas/templateless-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Template page for a templateless lab.":::

## Publish the lab

Azure Lab Services doesn't create the lab virtual machines until you publish the lab. When you publish the lab, the lab virtual machines are created, and assigned to the individual lab users.

To publish the lab:

1. On the **Template** page, select **Publish** on the toolbar.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-lab-teams-canvas/templateless-template-publish.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Lab Services template page, highlighting the Publish button.":::

1. On the **Publish** page, select **Publish** to start publishing the lab.

   > [!WARNING]
   > Publishing is an irreversible action, and can't be undone.

1. Wait until the publishing process finishes. You can track the publishing status on the **Template** page.

1. On the **Virtual machine pool** page, confirm that there's a lab VM for each lab user. The lab VMs are in the *Stopped* state.

    When you create a lab in Teams or Canvas, Azure Lab Services automatically manages the lab user list based on the team or course membership. When you add or remove users in Teams or Canvas, Azure Lab Services automatically assigns or withdraws access to the lab.
    
    Azure Lab Services also automatically manages the lab capacity (the number of lab virtual machines) and assigns the lab virtual machines to lab users. You can view the lab virtual machines and their assignments in the **Virtual machine pool** page:

## Troubleshooting

This section outlines common error messages that you might see, along with the steps to resolve them.

- Insufficient permissions to create lab.

  In Canvas, an educator will see a message indicating that they don't have sufficient permission. Educators should contact their Azure admin so they can be [added as a **Lab Creator**](quick-create-resources.md#add-a-user-to-the-lab-creator-role). For example, educators can be added as a **Lab Creator** to the resource group that contains their lab.

- Message that there isn't enough capacity to create lab VMs.

  [Request a limit increase](capacity-limits.md#request-a-limit-increase) which needs to be done by an Azure Labs Services administrator.

- Lab users see a warning that the lab isn't available yet.

  In Canvas, you'll see the following message if the educator hasn't published the lab yet. Educators must [publish the lab](tutorial-setup-lab.md#publish-lab) and [sync users](how-to-manage-user-lists-within-canvas.md#sync-users) for students to have access to a lab.

  :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-lab-teams-canvas/troubleshooting-lab-isnt-available-yet.png" alt-text="Troubleshooting -> This lab is not available yet.":::

- Lab users or educators are prompted to grant access.

  Before a lab user or educator can first access their lab, some browsers require that they first grant Azure Lab Services access to the browser's local storage. To grant access, educators and students should select the **Grant access** button when they're prompted:

  :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-lab-teams-canvas/canvas-grant-access-prompt.png" alt-text="Screenshot of page to grant Azure Lab Services access to use local storage for the browser.":::

  Educators and students see the message **Access granted** when access is successfully granted to Azure Lab Services. The educator or student should then reload the browser window to start using Azure Lab Services.

  :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-setup-lab-teams-canvas/canvas-access-granted-success.png" alt-text="Screenshot of access granted page in Azure Lab Services.":::

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Ensure that students and educators are using an up-to-date version of their browser. For older browser versions, students and educators might experience issues with being able to successfully grant access to Azure Lab Services.

  - Educator isn't prompted for their credentials after they select sign-in.
  
  When an educator accesses Azure Lab Services within their course, they might be prompted to sign in. Ensure that the browser's settings allow popups from the url of your Canvas instance, otherwise the popup might be blocked by default.
