### Lab creation fails with `Subscription has labs in 2 regions, and the regional limit for this subscription is 2`

The default limit for the total number of regions you can use for creating labs varies by offer category type. If you have reached the Azure regions limit for your subscription, you can only create labs in regions that you're already using.

Learn more about [how to resolve region restrictions](../capacity-limits.md#azure-region-restrictions).
