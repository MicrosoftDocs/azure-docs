You can use non-Microsoft email accounts to register and sign in to a lab. However, the registration requires that you first create a Microsoft account that's linked to your non-Microsoft email address.

You might already have a Microsoft account that's linked to your non-Microsoft email address. For example, users already have a Microsoft account if you used this email address with other Microsoft products or services, such as Office, Skype, OneDrive, or Windows.

When you use the lab registration link to sign into a lab, you're prompted for your email address and password. If you sign in with a non-Microsoft account that's not linked to a Microsoft account, you receive the following error message:

Follow these steps to [sign up for a new Microsoft account](https://signup.live.com).
