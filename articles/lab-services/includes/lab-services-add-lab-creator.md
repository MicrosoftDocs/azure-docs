To create or edit a lab in the Azure Lab Services website ([https://labs.azure.com](https://labs.azure.com)), your Azure account must be assigned the [Lab Creator role](../concept-lab-services-role-based-access-control.md#lab-creator-role) in Azure RBAC. If you assign the Lab Creator role to a user on the lab plan's resource group, that user can create labs for all lab plans in the resource group. Learn more about [Azure Lab Services built-in roles](../concept-lab-services-role-based-access-control.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Owners of a lab plan can automatically create labs and do not need to be assigned the Lab Creator role.

1. Select the resource group that contains the lab plan.

1. From the **Access control (IAM)** page, select **Add** > **Add role assignment**.

1. On the **Members** tab, select the user you want to add to the *Lab Creators* role.

1. On the **Review + assign** tab, select **Review + assign** to assign the role.

> [!WARNING]
> When you create a lab, you are automatically granted Owner permissions of the lab. If you have the Lab Creator role on the lab plan level, you may notice a short delay in being able to access the newly created lab. This delay is because the Owner permissions need to propagate. To overcome this issue, you might assign a role that allows you to view labs, such as Lab Creator, on the resource group that contains the lab plan.
