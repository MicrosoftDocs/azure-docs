When a creator invites you to a lab based by using your email address, you need to register for the lab by using the registration link. You receive this link from the lab creator. You only need to register once. After you register for the lab, you can then access the lab details in the [Azure Lab Services website](https://labs.azure.com).

When you access a lab through Teams or Canvas, or if the lab creator added you based on your Microsoft Entra group membership, you're automatically registered for the lab.

Register for each lab that you want to access. After you complete the lab registration, you no longer need the registration link to access the lab in the Azure Lab Services website.

To register for a lab by using the registration link:

1. Open the registration URL that you received from the lab creator in a web browser.

1. Sign in with the email address to which the registration link was sent.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You need a Microsoft account to use Azure Lab Services, unless you're using Canvas. Follow these steps to [use a non-Microsoft account](../how-to-access-lab-virtual-machine.md#use-a-non-microsoft-email-account), such as a Yahoo or Google account, to sign in to the Azure Lab Services website.
