You can use an existing GitHub account to register and sign into a lab. If you already have a Microsoft account that's linked to your GitHub account, you can sign in and continue the lab registration process.

To link your GitHub account to a Microsoft account:

1. Select the **Sign-in options** link:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/lab-services-github-account/signin-github.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Microsoft sign-in options window, highlighting the option to sign in with GitHub.":::

    At the prompt, you then create a Microsoft account that's linked to your GitHub account. The linking happens automatically when you select **Next**. You're then immediately signed in and connected to the lab.
