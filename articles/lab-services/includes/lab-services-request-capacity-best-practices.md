The time it takes to assign capacity varies depending on the VM size, region, and number of cores requested. You don't need to go through the process of requesting extra capacity often. To ensure that you have the resources you require when you need them, you should:

- Request capacity as far in advance as possible.
- Be flexible on the region where you're requesting capacity, if possible.
- Recognize that capacity remains assigned for the lifetime of a subscription. When lab plans or labs are deleted, the capacity remains assigned to the subscription.
- Request extra capacity only if you need more than is already assigned to your subscription.
- Make incremental requests for VM cores rather than making large, bulk requests. Break requests for large numbers of cores into smaller requests for extra flexibility in how those requests are fulfilled.
