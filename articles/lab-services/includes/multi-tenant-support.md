If you are an admin or a lab owner who is part of multiple Azure AD tenants, you can navigate between tenants in [Azure Lab Services portal](https://labs.azure.com) (from the top-right corner).

Once you pick a tenant, select from a list of lab accounts within your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant in the top-right corner. 

Lab users only see a single list of the virtual machines that they have access to inside the selected Azure Lab Services.
