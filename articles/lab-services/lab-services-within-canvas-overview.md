# Overview of Lab Services within Canvas

Azure Lab Services now provides an integrated experience for using labs with the Canvas. Canvas LMS is a cloud-based learning management system that provides once place for course content, quizzes, and grades for both instructors and students. Now instructors can create labs from within Canvas and students will see their lab virtual machines alongside their other material for a course.

## Benefits

Azure Lab Service’s integration with Canvas LMS includes the following key capabilities:

- Labs are created and managed inside a course in Canvas.
- Each lab automatically pulls and updates the list of students based on the latest Canvas’s course roster.
- Virtual machines are added and deleted automatically based on changes to Canvas’s course roster.
- Students access their labs directly inside a course in Canvas.
