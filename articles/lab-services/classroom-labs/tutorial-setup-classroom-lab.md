# Tutorial: Set up a classroom lab 
In this tutorial, you set up a classroom lab with virtual machines that are used by students in the classroom.  

In this tutorial, you do the following actions:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a classroom lab
> * Configure the classroom lab
> * Send registration link to students

## Prerequisites
To set up a classroom lab in a lab account, you must be a member of the **Lab Creator** role in the lab account. The account you used to create a lab account is automatically added to this role. A lab owner can add other users to the Lab Creator role by using steps in the following article: [Add a user to the Lab Creator role](tutorial-setup-lab-account.md#add-a-user-to-the-lab-creator-role).


## Create a classroom lab

1. Navigate to [Azure Lab Services website](https://labs.azure.com). 
2. Select **Sign in** and enter your credentials. Azure Lab Services supports organizational accounts and Microsoft accounts. 
3. In the **New Lab** window, do the following actions: 
    1. Specify a **name** for your lab. 
    2. Specify the maximum **number of users** allowed into the lab. 
    6. Select **Save**.

        ![Create a classroom lab](../media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/new-lab-window.png)
4. On the **Select virtual machine specifications** page, do the following steps:
    1. Select a **size** for virtual machines (VMs) created in the lab. 
    2. Select the **region** in which you want the VMs to be created. 
    3. Select the **VM image** to be used to create VMs in the lab. 
    4. Select **Next**.

        ![Specify VM specifications](../media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/select-vm-specifications.png)    
5. On the **Set credentials** page, specify default credentials for all VMs in the lab. 
    1. Specify the **name of the user** for all VMs in the lab.
    2. Specify the **password** for the user. 

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Make a note of user name and password. They won't be shown again.
    3. Select **Create**. 

        ![Set credentials](../media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/set-credentials.png)
6. On the **Configure template** page, you see the status of lab creation process. The creation of the template in the lab takes up to 20 minutes. 

    ![Configure template](../media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/configure-template.png)
7. After the configuration of the template is complete, you see the following page: 

    ![Configure template page after it's done](../media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/configure-template-after-complete.png)
8. The following steps are optional steps in this tutorial: 
    1. Start the template VM by selecting **Start**.
    2. Connect to the template VM by selecting **Connect**. 
    3. Install and configure software on your template VM. 
    4. **Stop** the VM.  
    5. Enter a **description** for the template

        ![Next on Configure template page](../media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/configure-template-next.png)
9. Select **Next** on the template page. 
10. On **Publish the template** page, do the following actions. 
    1. To publish the template immediately, select the checkbox for *I understand I can't modify the template after publishing. This process can only be done once and can take up to an hour*, and select **Publish**.  

        > [!WARNING]
        > Once you publish, you can't unpublish. 
    2. To publish later, select **Save for later**. You can publish the template VM after the wizard completes. For details on how to configure and publish after the wizard completes, see [Publish the template](how-to-create-manage-template.md#publish-the-template-vm) section in the [How to manage classroom labs](how-to-manage-classroom-labs.md) article.

        ![Publish template](../media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/publish-template.png)
11. You see the **progress of publishing** the template. This process can take up to an hour. 

    ![Publish template - progress](../media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/publish-template-progress.png)
12. You see the following page when the template is published successfully. Select **Done**.

    ![Publish template - success](../media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/publish-success.png)
1. You see the **dashboard** for the lab. 
    
    ![Classroom lab dashboard](../media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/classroom-lab-home-page.png)
4. Switch to the **Virtual machines** page, and confirm that you see virtual machines that are in **Unassigned** state. These VMs are not assigned to students yet. They should be in **Stopped** state. You can start a student VM, connect to the VM, stop the VM, and delete the VM on this page. You can start them in this page or let your students start the VMs. 

    ![Virtual machines in stopped state](../media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/virtual-machines-stopped.png)

## Add users to the lab

1. Select **Users** on the left menu. By default, the **Restrict access** option is enabled. When this setting is on, a user can't register with the lab even if the user has the registration link unless the user is in the list of users. Only users in the list can register with the lab by using the registration link you send. In this procedure, you add users to the list. Alternatively, you can turn off **Restrict access**, which allows users to register with the lab as long as they have the registration link. 
2. Select **Add users** on the toolbar. 
3. On the **Add users** page, enter email addresses of users in separate lines or in a single line separated by semicolons. 

    ![Add user email addresses](../media/how-to-configure-student-usage/add-users-email-addresses.png)
4. Select **Save**. You see the email addresses of users and their statuses (registered or not) in the list. 

    ![Users list](../media/how-to-configure-student-usage/users-list-new.png)


## Send registration link to students

1. Switch to the **Users** view if you are not on the page already. 
2. Select **Get registration link** tile.

    ![Student registration link](../media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/dashboard-user-registration-link.png)
1. In the **User registration** dialog box, select the **Copy** button. The link is copied to the clipboard. 

    ![Student registration link](../media/tutorial-setup-classroom-lab/registration-link.png)
2. On the **User registration** dialog box, select **Close**. 
4. Share the registration link with a student so that the student can register for the class. If you have the **Restrict option** setting enabled and have a list of users in the list, do the following actions:
    1. Select the **email address** of the user in the list. 
    2. You see a window from your default email program with the **TO** address filled in. 
    3. Paste the **registration URL** you copied earlier. 
    4. Send the **email**.


## Next steps
In this tutorial, you created a classroom lab, and configured the lab. To learn how a student can access a VM in the lab using the registration link, advance to the next tutorial:
