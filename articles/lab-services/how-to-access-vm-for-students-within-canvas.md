# Access a VM (student view) in Azure Lab Services from Canvas

When a lab is created within [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas), students can view and access all the VMs provisioned by the course educator. Once the lab is published and VMs are created, students will be automatically assigned a VM. Students can view and access the VMs assigned to them by selecting the tab containing **Azure Lab Services** app.

Students must access their VMs through Canvas.  Their Canvas credentials will be used to log into Azure Lab Services.  

Azure Lab Services supports test users in Canvas and the ability for the instructor to act as another user.

## Lab unavailable

If the lab hasn't been published or a synced in a while, students may see a message indicating the lab isn't available yet. Educators should [publish](how-to-manage-labs.md#publish-the-lab) and [sync users](how-to-manage-user-lists-within-canvas.md#sync-users) to solve the problem.
