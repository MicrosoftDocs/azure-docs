# Create and manage lab plans in Azure Lab Services

[!INCLUDE [Retirement guide](./includes/retirement-banner.md)]

[!INCLUDE [preview note](./includes/lab-services-new-update-focused-article.md)]

In Azure Lab Services, a lab plan is a container for managed lab types such as labs. An administrator sets up a lab plan with Azure Lab Services and provides access to lab owners who can create labs in the plan. This article describes how to create a lab plan, view all lab plans, or delete a lab plan.
