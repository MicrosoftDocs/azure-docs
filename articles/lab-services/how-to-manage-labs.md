## Use a non-organizational account as a lab creator

You can access the Azure Lab Services website to create and manage labs without an organizational account (a guest account). In this case, you need a Microsoft account, or a GitHub or non-Microsoft email account that is linked to a Microsoft account.

### Use a non-Microsoft email account

[!INCLUDE [Use non-Microsoft account](./includes/lab-services-non-microsoft-account.md)]

### Use a GitHub Account

[!INCLUDE [Use GitHub account](./includes/lab-services-github-account.md)]

## Delete a lab

1. On the tile for the lab, select three dots (...) in the corner, and then select **Delete**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-labs/delete-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the list of labs in the Azure Lab Services website, highlighting the Delete button.":::

1. On the **Delete lab** dialog box, select **Delete** to continue with the deletion.

## Switch to another lab

To switch to another lab from the current, select the drop-down list of labs at the top.
