# Migrate lab account role assignments to lab plans in Azure Lab Services

[!INCLUDE [Retirement guide](./includes/retirement-banner.md)]

Lab plans have a different Azure management hierarchy than lab accounts in Azure Lab Services. Role assignments on lab accounts behave differently and influence lab permissions. This article discusses the authorization differences between lab accounts and lab plans. Learn how you should update role assignments when transitioning from lab accounts to lab plans.

## Differences between lab accounts and lab plans

Lab accounts are a parent Azure resource to labs. When you assign a role on a lab account, the associated labs automatically inherit this role and permissions. 

On the other hand, lab plans and labs are sibling resources in Azure, which means that labs *don’t inherit* roles and permissions from the associated lab plan.

For example, assume that you assign the Contributor role for users on the lab account. To achieve the same permissions with a lab plan, you should instead assign the Contributor role on the lab plan's *resource group*. When you assign the role on the resource group, all labs within that resource group are also assigned this role.

## Recommendations

The following table shows recommendations for mapping role assignments from lab accounts to lab plans in Azure Lab Services.

| Role type | Lab account role | Lab account assignment | Lab plan role | Lab plan assignment |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Administrator | Owner | Lab account | Owner | Resource group |
| Administrator | Contributor | Lab account | Contributor | Resource group |
| Lab management | Lab Creator | Lab account | Lab Creator | Lab plan |
| Lab management | Owner** | Lab | Owner | Resource group or lab |
| Lab management | Contributor** | Lab | Lab Contributor | Lab |

** For lab accounts, the lab’s Contributor and Owner roles require that you also assign the Reader role on the lab account. For lab plans, you don't have to assign the Reader role on the lab plan or resource group.
