# Tutorial: Track usage of a lab in Azure Lab Service

[!INCLUDE [Retirement guide](./includes/retirement-banner.md)]

This tutorial shows you how a lab creator/owner can track usage of a lab.

In this tutorial, you do the following actions:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * View users registered with your lab
> * View the usage of VMs in the lab
> * Manage lab VMs

## View registered users

1. Navigate to Lab Services web portal ([https://labs.azure.com](https://labs.azure.com)).
2. Select **Sign in** and enter your credentials. Azure Lab Services supports organizational accounts and Microsoft accounts.
3. On the **My labs** page, select the lab for which you want to track the usage.
4. Select **Users** on the left menu or **Users** tile. You see the list of lab users who have registered with your lab.

    For more information about adding and managing users for the lab, see [Add and manage lab users](how-to-manage-lab-users.md).

## View the usage of VMs

1. Select **Virtual machines** on menu to the left.
2. Confirm that you see the status of VMs and the number of hours the VMs have been running. The time that a lab owner spends on a lab VM doesn't count against the usage time shown in the last column.

## Manage lab VMs

On this page, you can start, stop, or reimage lab user's VMs by using controls in the **State** column or on the toolbar.

For more information about managing virtual machine pool for the lab, see [Set up and manage virtual machine pool](how-to-set-virtual-machine-passwords.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When an educator turns on a lab user's VM, quota for the lab user isn't affected. Quota for a user specifies the number of lab hours available to the user outside of the scheduled class time. For more information on quotas, see [Set quotas for users](how-to-manage-lab-users.md?#set-quotas-for-users).
