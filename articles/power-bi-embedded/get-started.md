Power BI Embedded has benefits for an ISV, their developers, and customers. For exampke, an ISV can start creating visuals for free with Power BI Desktop. ISVs can achieve faster time to market by minimizing visual analytic development efforts and stand out among the compeition ewith differentiated data experiences. ISVs also can opt to charge a premium for the additional value created with embedded analytics.

Developers can spend time focused on building the core competency of their application rather than spending time developing visuals and analytics. Developers can rapidly meet customer report and dashboard demands and can embed easily with fully documented APIs and SDKs. Lastly, by enabling easy-to-navigate data exploration in their apps, ISVs allow their customers to make quick, data-driven decisions in context and with confidence from any device.
