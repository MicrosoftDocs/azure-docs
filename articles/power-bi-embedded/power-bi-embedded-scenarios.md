# Common Power BI Embedded scenarios
**Microsoft Power BI Embedded** is focused on exposing the majority of existing Power BI API functionality as part of an Azure service for you to develop your applications with.  Additionally, you will be able to programmatically provision, develop and deploy the necessary resources and Power BI content. To learn more, see [Get started with Microsoft Power BI Embedded](power-bi-embedded-get-started.md).

Here are some scenarios for using **Power BI Embedded** in your applications.

* Fully interactive reports that were authored in the Power BI Desktop can be embedded within your own application using a new application token authentication model.
* Independent software vendors and customers building customer facing applications can use the **Power BI Embedded** service, and the Power BI SDK, to embed interactive reports. To learn how, see [Get started with Microsoft Power BI Embedded](power-bi-embedded-get-started.md).
* As a developer, you can use the Power BI visualization framework to create custom visualizations that can be used in your own app. See [Extend Power BI with custom visuals](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/custom-visuals/).
