# Quickstart: Publish Ubuntu Virtual Machine (VM) as Virtual Network Function (VNF)

This quickstart describes how to use the `az aosm` Azure CLI extension to create and publish a basic Network Function Definition. Its purpose is to demonstrate the workflow of the Publisher Azure Operator Service Manager (AOSM) resources. The basic concepts presented here are meant to prepare users to build more exciting services.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription is required. If you don't have an Azure subscription, follow the instructions here [Start free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) to create an account before you begin.

- Complete the [Quickstart: Complete the prerequisites to deploy a Virtualized Network Function in Azure Operator Service Manager](quickstart-virtualized-network-function-prerequisites.md)

- An existing Resource Group where you have the Contributor role, or the Contributor role over this subscription so that the AOSM CLI extension can create the resource group.

## Create input file

Execute the following command to generate the input configuration file for the Network Function Definition (NFD).

```azurecli
az aosm nfd generate-config --definition-type vnf
```

Once you execute this command, a vnf-input.jsonc file is generated.

> [!NOTE]
> Edit the vnf-input.jsonc file, replacing it with the values shown in the sample. Save the file as **input-vnf-nfd.jsonc**.
>
> If you are using an existing resource group, change the `publisher_resource_group_name` field to match it.

Here is a sample input-vnf-nfd.jsonc file:

```json
{
  // Azure location to use when creating resources e.g uksouth
  "location": "uksouth",
  // Name of the Publisher resource you want your definition published to.
  // Will be created if it does not exist.

    }
  ],

## Build the Network Function Definition (NFD)

To construct the Network Function Definition (NFD), initiate the build process.

```azurecli
az aosm nfd build --config-file input-vnf-nfd.jsonc --definition-type vnf
```

Once the build is complete, examine the generated files to better understand the Network Function Definition (NFD) structure.

These files are created in a subdirectory called **vnf-cli-output**:

## Publish the Network Function Definition and upload artifacts

Execute the following command to publish the Network Function Definition (NFD) and upload the associated artifacts:

> [!NOTE]
> Publisher names must be unique within a region. It is quite likely that the 'ubuntu-publisher' defined in the example config file already exists.
>
>If you get an error saying "**A private publisher resource with the name 'ubuntu-publisher' already exists in the provided region**", edit the `publisher_name` field in the config file so that it is unique (e.g. add a random string suffix), re-run the `build` command (above), and then re-run this `publish` command.
>
>If you go on to create a network service design, you will need to use this new publisher name in the `resource_element_templates` array.

```azurecli
az aosm nfd publish --build-output-folder vnf-cli-output --definition-type vnf
```

When the command completes, inspect the resources within your Publisher Resource Group to observe the created components and artifacts.

These resources are created:

| Resource Name                    | Resource Type                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **ubuntu-vm**                    | Network Function Definition.         |
| **1.0.0**                        | Network Function Definition Version. |
| **ubuntu-publisher**             | Publisher.                           |
| **ubuntu-vm-acr-manifest-1-0-0** | Publisher Artifact Manifest.         |
| **ubuntu-vm-sa-manifest-1-0-0**  | Publisher Artifact Manifest.         |
| **ubuntu-acr**                   | Publisher Artifact Store.            |
| **ubuntu-blob-store**            | Publisher Artifact Store.            |
