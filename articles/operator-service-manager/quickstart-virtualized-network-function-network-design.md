# Quickstart: Design a Network Service Design (NSD) for Ubuntu Virtual Machine (VM) as a Virtualized Network Function (VNF)

This quickstart describes how to use the `az aosm` Azure CLI extension to create and publish a basic Network Service Design.

## Prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription is required. If you don't have an Azure subscription, follow the instructions here [Start free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) to create an account before you begin.

You must follow the prerequisites in [Quickstart: Publish Ubuntu Virtual Machine (VM) as Virtual Network Function (VNF)](quickstart-publish-virtualized-network-function-definition.md).

## Create input file

Create an input file for publishing the Network Service Design. Execute the following command to generate the input configuration file for the Network Service Design (NSD).

```azurecli
az aosm nsd generate-config
```

An `nsd-input.jsonc` file is generated when you run this command.

> [!NOTE]
> Edit the nsd-input.jsonc file, replacing it with the values shown in the sample. Remove the section where resource_element_type is set to ArmTemplate. This is for adding infrastructure (such as VNets) to more complicated NSDs, which is not needed in this quickstart. Save the file as **input-vnf-nsd.jsonc**.
>
> If you changed the name of the publisher when publishing the NFDV, use your publisher name for both the `publisher_name` and `publisher` fields (the latter is within the `resource_element_templates` array).
>
> If you have used a different resource group name, update both the `publisher_resource_group_name` and `publisher_resource_group` fields (the latter is within the `resource_element_templates` array).

## Build the Network Service Design (NSD)

Initiate the build process for the Network Service Design (NSD) using the following command:

```azurecli
az aosm nsd build --config-file input-vnf-nsd.jsonc
```

After the build process completes, review the following generated files to gain insights into the NSD's architecture and structure.

These files are created in a subdirectory called **nsd-cli-output**:

## Publish the Network Service Design (NSD)

To publish the Network Service Design (NSD) and its associated artifacts, issue the following command:

```azurecli
az aosm nsd publish --build-output-folder nsd-cli-output
```

Navigate to your Publisher Resource Group to observe and review the resources and artifacts that were produced.

These resources are created:

| Resource Name                     | Resource Type                       |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **ubuntu-nsd**                    | The Network Service Design.         |
| **1.0.0 (ubuntu-nsd/1.0.0)**      | The Network Service Design Version. |
| **ubuntu-nsd-nsd-manifest-1-0-0** | Publisher Artifact Manifest.        |
| **ConfigGroupSchema**             | The Configuration Group Schema.     |
