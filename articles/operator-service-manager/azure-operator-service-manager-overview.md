## Product features

### Unified service orchestration

Consolidate service management tasks into a single set of end-to-end Azure operations to seamlessly manage infrastructure, software and configuration for complex multi-vendor multi-region services. Model network services using Azure Resource Manager (ARM), just like other Azure resources and drive run-time operations via any Azure interfaces, such as portal, CLI, API, or SDK.

### Hybrid operations at scale

Azure Operator Service Manager is built to scale using the same underlying databases, analytics and cloud-native foundational engineering as Azure itself. Core and edge workloads can be managed together, as complete network deployments ranging in scale from private 5G to national networks. Alternatively use Azure subscription or role-based separation of different parts of your network to segregate management by operational team or service type.

### Operator grade security

Azure Operator Service Manager works seamlessly with Azure security features including Private Link, embedded registries, artifact stores and secret management options to ensure that the operator has confidence that what is deployed matches what was on-boarded by each publisher.

### Automation and AI

Accelerate your journey towards autonomous operations using Azure Operator Service Manager in combination with Azure DevOps for Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CICD) automation.  Go further with data-driven insights and actions derived from any Azure analytics and AI services, including Azure Operator Insights, Fabric, Azure Data Explorer (ADX), LogicApps, and Copilot.

## Conclusion

By unifying service management, facilitating deployments at fleet-wide scale and ensuring service consistency, operators can achieve accelerated service velocity, improved service reliability, and optimize service cost. Harness the power of Microsoft Azure through Azure Operator Service Manager to drive network services forward.
