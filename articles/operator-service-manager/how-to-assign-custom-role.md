# Assign a custom role

In this how-to guide, you learn how to assign a custom role for Service Operators to Azure Operator Service Manager Publisher resources. The permissions in this role are required for deploying a Site Network Service.

## Prerequisites

- You must have created a custom role via [Create a custom role](how-to-create-custom-role.md).  This article assumes that you named the custom role 'Custom Role - AOSM Service Operator access to Publisher.'

- To perform the tasks in this article, you need either the 'Owner' or 'User Access Administrator' role in your chosen scope.

- You must have identified the users who you want to perform the Service Operator role and deploy Site Network Services.

## Choose scope(s) for assigning custom role

The publisher resources that you need to assign the custom role to are:

- The Network Function Definition Versions (NFDVs).

- The Network Service Design Versions (NSDVs).

- The Configuration Group Schemas (CGSs) for the Network Service Design (NSD).

You must decide if you want to assign the custom role individually to each resource, or to a parent resource such as the publisher resource group.

Applying to a parent resource grants access over all child resources. For example, applying to the whole publisher resource group gives the operator access to:

- All the Network Function Definition Groups and Versions.

- All the Network Service Design Groups and Versions.

- All the Configuration Group Schemas.

The custom role permissions limit access to the list of the permissions shown here:

- Microsoft.HybridNetwork/Publishers/NetworkFunctionDefinitionGroups/NetworkFunctionDefinitionVersions/**use**/**action**

- Microsoft.HybridNetwork/Publishers/NetworkFunctionDefinitionGroups/NetworkFunctionDefinitionVersions/**read**

- Microsoft.HybridNetwork/Publishers/NetworkServiceDesignGroups/NetworkServiceDesignVersions/**use**/**action**

- Microsoft.HybridNetwork/Publishers/NetworkServiceDesignGroups/NetworkServiceDesignVersions/**read**

- Microsoft.HybridNetwork/Publishers/ConfigurationGroupSchemas/**read**

> [!NOTE]
> Do not provide write or delete access to any of these publisher resources.
