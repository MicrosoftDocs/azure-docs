# Create and assign a User Assigned Managed Identity

In this how-to guide, you learn how to:
- Create a User Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI) for your Site Network Service (SNS).
- Assign that User Assigned Managed Identity permissions for use by Azure Operator Service Manager (AOSM)

> [!WARNING]
> UAMI is required where an expected SNS operation may run for four or more hours. If UAMI isn't used during long running SNS operations, the SNS may report a false failed status before component operations complete.

## Prerequisites

- You must create a custom role via [Create a custom role](how-to-create-custom-role.md). This article assumes that you named the custom role 'Custom Role - AOSM Service Operator access to Publisher.'

- You must work with your Network Service Designer to understand the permissions your Managed Identity requires and which Network Function Definition Version (NFDV) your SNS uses.

- You need either the 'Owner' or 'User Access Administrator' role over the Network Function Definition Version resource from your chosen Publisher. You also must have a Resource Group over which you have the 'Owner' or 'User Access Administrator' role assignment.

## Create a UAMI

First, create a UAMI. Refer to [Create a User Assigned Managed Identity for your SNS](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities?pivots=identity-mi-methods-azp) for details.

## Assign custom role to UAMI

Next, assign a custom role to your new UAMI. Choose a scope-based approach and then allow the proper permission across that scope.

### Choose scope for assigning custom role

Either assign the custom role individually to a child resource, like an NFDV, or to a parent resource, such as the publisher resource group or Network Function Definition Group (NFDG). Assigning the role to a parent resource grants equal access over all child resources. For proper SNS operations, either the parent resource must include all below resources, or the following resources must be assigned the custom role individually:

- All the Network Function Definition Versions (NSDV).
- All the Network Function Definition Groups (NFDG) and Versions 
- All the Network Service Design Groups (NSD) and Versions.
- All the Configuration Group Schemas (CGS).
- All the custom locations.

### Allow proper permissions for the chosen scope

The UAMI needs the following individual permissions to execute required SNS operations:

- On the NFDV
  - Microsoft.HybridNetwork/publishers/networkFunctionDefinitionGroups/networkFunctionDefinitionVersions/use/**action**
  - Microsoft.HybridNetwork/Publishers/NetworkFunctionDefinitionGroups/NetworkFunctionDefinitionVersions/**read**
- On the NSDV
  - Microsoft.HybridNetwork/publishers/networkServiceDesignGroups/networkServiceDesignVersions/use/action
  - Microsoft.HybridNetwork/publishers/networkServiceDesignGroups/networkServiceDesignVersions/**read**
- On the CGS
  - Microsoft.HybridNetwork/Publishers/ConfigurationGroupSchemas/**read**
- On the custom location
  - Microsoft.ExtendedLocation/customLocations/deploy/**action**
  - Microsoft.ExtendedLocation/customLocations/**read** 
- In addition, the UAMI need access on itself
  - Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/assign/**action**

If using a parent resource scope approach, then the required permissions would be applied to the parent resource.  

> [!NOTE]
> Don't provide write or delete access to any of these publisher resources.

### Assign custom role

1. Access the Azure portal and open your chosen resource scope; for example, Publisher Resource Group or Network Function Definition Version.

2. In the side menu of this item, select **Access Control (IAM)**.

3. Choose **Add Role Assignment**.

4. Under **Job function roles** find your Custom Role in the list then proceed with *Next*.

5. Select **Managed Identity**, then Choose **+ Select Members** then find and choose your new managed identity. Choose **Select**.

6. Select **Review and assign**.

### Repeat the role assignment

Repeat the role assignment process for any remaining resources given the chosen scope approach.

## Assign Managed Identity Operator role to the Managed Identity itself

1. Go to the Azure portal and search for **Managed Identities**.
2. Select *your-identity* from the list of **Managed Identities**.
3. On the side menu, select **Access Control (IAM)**.
4. Choose **Add Role Assignment** and select the **Managed Identity Operator** role.

5. Select the **Managed Identity Operator** role.

6. Select **Managed identity**.
7. Select **+ Select members** and navigate to the user-assigned managed identity and proceed with the assignment.

Completion of all the tasks outlined in this article ensures that the Site Network Service (SNS) has the necessary permissions to function effectively within the specified Azure environment.

## Assign other required permissions to the Managed Identity

Repeat this process to assign any other permissions to the Managed Identity that your Network Service Designer identified.
