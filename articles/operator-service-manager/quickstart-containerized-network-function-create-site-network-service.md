# Quickstart: Create a Containerized Network Function (CNF) Site Network Service (SNS) with Nginx

 This article walks you through the process of creating a Site Network Service (SNS) using the Azure portal. Site Networks Services is an essential part of a Network Service Instance and is associated with a specific site. Each Site Network Service instance references a particular version of a Network Service Design (NSD).

## Prerequisites

- Complete the [Quickstart: Complete the prerequisites to deploy a Containerized Network Function in Azure Operator Service Manager](quickstart-containerized-network-function-prerequisites.md)
- Complete the [Quickstart: Create a Containerized Network Functions site with Nginx](quickstart-containerized-network-function-create-site.md)

## Create the site network service

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).
1. Select **Create a resource**.
1. Search for **Site network service**, then select **Create**.

        "deployParameters": [{}],
        "customLocationId": "<resource id of your custom location>",
        "nfdv": "1.0.0",
        "managedIdentityId": "<managed-identity-resource-id>"
    },

    }
    ```

   > [!TIP]

1. Select **Review + Create** then **Create**.
1. Allow the deployment state to reach a state of **Succeeded**. This status indicates your CNF is up and running.
1. Access your CNF by navigating to the **Site Network Service Object** in the Azure portal. Select the **Current State -> Resources** to view the managed resource group created by Azure Operator Service Manager (AOSM).

You have successfully created a Site Network Service for a Nginx Container as a CNF in Azure. You can now manage and monitor your CNF through the Azure portal.

When you have finished, remember to delete the resources. To do this:

1. Delete the Operator Resource Group.
1. When step 1 is complete, delete the Publisher Resource Group.
