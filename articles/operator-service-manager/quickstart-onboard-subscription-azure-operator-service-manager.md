## Register and verify required resource providers

```azurecli
# Register Resource Provider
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.HybridNetwork
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerRegistry
```

Verify the registration status of the resource providers. Execute the following commands.

```azurecli
# Query the Resource Provider
az provider show -n Microsoft.HybridNetwork --query "{RegistrationState: registrationState, ProviderName: namespace}"
az provider show -n Microsoft.ContainerRegistry --query "{RegistrationState: registrationState, ProviderName: namespace}"
```

> [!NOTE]
> It may take a few minutes for the resource provider registration to complete. Once the registration is successful, you can proceed with using the Azure Operator Service Manager (AOSM).
