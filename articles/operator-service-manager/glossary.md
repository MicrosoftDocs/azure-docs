# Glossary: Azure Operator Service Manager
The following article contains terms used throughout the Azure Operator Service Manager documentation.

## A

### Active
Active refers to a versionState of Network Function Definition or Network Service Design such that it's ready for use. An Active resource is immutable and can be deployed cross-subscription.

### Artifact
An artifact refers to a deployable component, such as a container image, Helm chart, Virtual Machine image or ARM template that is used in the deployment process. Artifacts are essential building blocks for deploying applications and services, providing the necessary files required for successful deployment.

### Artifact Manifest
The Artifact Manifest contains a dictionary of artifacts, in a given artifact store, together with type and version. A Publisher only uploads artifacts that are listed in the manifest.  The Artifact Manifest also handles credential generation for push access to the Artifact Store. The Artifact Manifest verifies if all the artifacts referenced by NSDVersions or NFDVersions are uploaded.

### Artifact Store
The Artifact Store serves as the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) resource responsible for housing all the resources needed to create Network Functions and Network Services. The Artifact Store acts as a centralized repository for various components, including:
- Helm charts.
- Docker images for Containerized Network Functions (CNF).
- Virtual Machine (VM) images for Virtualized Network Functions (VNF).
- Other assets like ARM templates required throughout the Network Function creation process.

It ensures proper storage and prevents accidental mismanagement like deleting images still in use by operators.

Artifact Store comes in two flavors:
1. Azure Storage Account for storing VM images.
1. Azure Container Registry for storing all other artifact types.

### Azure CLI
Azure CLI (Command-Line Interface) is a command-line tool provided by Azure that enables you to manage Azure resources and services. With Azure CLI, you can interact with Azure through commands automating tasks and managing resources efficiently.

### Azure Cloud Shell
Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive, browser-based shell environment provided by Azure. Azure Cloud Shell allows you to manage Azure resources using the CLI or PowerShell, without the need to install any more software. Azure Cloud Shell provides a convenient and accessible way to work with Azure resources from anywhere.

### Azure Container Registry (ACR)
Azure Container Registry (ACR) is a managed, private registry service provided by Azure for storing and managing container images.

### Azure Operator Service Manager (AOSM)
Azure Operator Service Manager is a service provided by Azure for managing and operating network functions and services. Azure Operator Service Manager (AOSM) provides a centralized platform for operators to deploy, monitor, and manage network functions. Azure Operator Service Manager (AOSM) simplifies the management and operation of complex network infrastructures.

### Azure portal
Azure portal is a web-based interface provided by Azure for managing and monitoring Azure resources and services. Azure portal provides a unified and intuitive user experience, allowing users to easily navigate and interact with their Azure resources.

## B

### Bicep
Bicep is a domain-specific language (DSL) provided by Azure for deploying Azure resources using declarative syntax. Bicep files are easier to write than Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. It's possible to convert Bicep files to Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and vice-versa.

## C

### Configuration Group Schema (CGS)
Configuration Groups are partitions of the Site Network Service (SNS) configuration defined by each Network Service Design Version (NSDV). The Configuration Group Schema (CSG) is a json schema, defining the format of these inputs. The Service Designer creates one or more Configuration Group Schemas (CSGs) in the process of creating a Network Service Design Version (NSDV).

### Configuration Group Values (CGV)
Configuration Group Values (CGV) are json blobs that define the inputs parameters for the Site Network Service (SNS).  There are one or more Configuration Group Values (CGVs) associated with each Site Network Service (SNS).  The contents of a Configuration Group Value (CGV) must adhere to the Configuration Group Schema (CGS) associated with the Network Service Design Version (NSDV) selected for the Site Network Service (SNS).

### Containerized Network Function (CNF)
A Containerized Network Function (CNF) is a network function described by Helm charts and delivered as container images. Azure Operator Service Manager (AOSM) supports CNFs on Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters and AKS.

### Contributor Role
Contributor Role is a role in Azure that grants users permissions to manage and make changes to Azure resources within a subscription. Users with the Contributor Role have the ability to create, modify, and delete resources, providing them with the necessary permissions to effectively manage Azure resources.

### Custom Location ID
Custom Location ID is a unique identifier used to specify a custom location for deploying resources in Azure. Custom Location ID allows users to define and deploy resources in specific locations not predefined by Azure, providing flexibility and customization options.

## D

### Network Function (NF)
Network Functions (NFs) come in two flavors: Containerized Network Function (CNFs) and Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs).  Network Functions are units of function that can be combined together into a service.

### Network Function Definition (NFD) / Network Function Definition Version (NFDV)
Network Function Definitions (NFDs) have multiple versions known as NetworkFunctionDefinitionVersions (NFDV). A NetworkFunctionDefinitionVersion is a template for deploying a network function on a particular version. Network Function Definitions and Network Function Definition Versions become immutable once set to 'Active. The Network Function (NF) Publisher on-boards a NetworkFunctionDefinitionVersion resource by providing binaries, configuration, and mapping rules.

The collection of all Network Function Definition Version (NFDVs) for a given Network Function (NF) is known as a Network Function Definition Group (NFDG).

### Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI)
A Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI) represents a location where a Network Function (NF) can be instantiated, such as a Custom location of an Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster or an Azure region.

The name of the Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI) defined in a Network Service Design (NSD) must match that of the Site used when deploying a Site Network Service (SNS).

### Network Function Manager (NFM)
Network Function Manager (NFM) is an Azure service responsible for managing and operating network functions in Azure. Azure Operator Service Manager uses Network Function Manager (NFM); NFM is opaque to the Publisher, Designer and Operator.  

### Network Service Design (NSD) / Network Service Design Group (NSDG) / Network Service Design Version (NSDV)
A Network Service Design (NSD) describes a network service of a specific type, created and uploaded by the Designer. A Network Service Design (NSD) is a composite of one or more Network Function Definitions (NFD) and any infrastructure components deployed at the same time. Network Service Designs (NSDs) have multiple versions (NSDVs). The Network Service Design Versions (NSDVs) include mapping rules, references to Config Group Schemas (CGS), resource element templates and Site information.

The collection of all Network Service Design Versions (NSDVs) for a given Network Service Design (NSD) is known as a Network Service Design Group (NSDG).

### Nginx Container (NC)
Nginx Container (NC) refers to a container that runs the Nginx web server, which is commonly used for serving web content. In the Azure Operator Service Manager (AOSM) Quickstart guides Nginx is used as an example of a Containerized Network Function (CNF).
