# Tutorial: Configure BGP peering between Azure Route Server and network virtual appliance (NVA)

This tutorial shows you how to deploy an Azure Route Server and a Windows Server network virtual appliance (NVA) into a virtual network and establish a BGP peering connection between them. 

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Deploy an Azure Route Server
> - Deploy a virtual machine
> - Configure BGP on the virtual machine
> - Configure BGP peering between the Route Server and the NVA
> - Check learned routes

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

- An active Azure subscription.

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Create a route server

In this section, you create a route server.

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter ***route server***, and select **Route Server** from the search results. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/route-server-portal-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot of searching for Route Server in the Azure portal." lightbox="./media/route-server-portal-search.png":::

1. On the **Route Servers** page, select **+ Create**. 

1. On the **Basics** tab of **Create a Route Server**, enter, or select the following information:

    | Settings | Value |
    |----------|-------|
    | **Project details** |  |
    | Subscription | Select the Azure subscription that you want to use to deploy the route server. |
    | Resource group | Select **Create new**. <br>In **Name**, enter ***myResourceGroup***. <br>Select **OK**. |
    | **Instance details** |  |
    | Name | Enter ***myRouteServer***. |
    | Region | Select **East US** or any region you prefer to create the route server in. |
    | Routing Preference | Select **ExpressRoute**. Other available options: **VPN** and **ASPath**. |
    | **Configure virtual networks** |  |
    | Virtual network | Select **Create new**. <br>In **Name**, enter ***myVirtualNetwork***. <br>In **Address range**, enter ***10.0.0.0/16***. <br>In **Subnet name** and **Address range**, enter ***RouteServerSubnet*** and ***10.0.1.0/26*** respectively. <br>Select **OK**. |
    | Subnet | Once you created the virtual network and subnet, the **RouteServerSubnet** will populate. <br>- The subnet must be named *RouteServerSubnet*.<br>- The subnet must be a minimum of /26 or larger. |
    | **Public IP address** |  |
    | Public IP address | Select **Create new**. or select an existing Standard public IP resource to assign to the Route Server. To ensure connectivity to the backend service that manages the Route Server configuration, a public IP address is required. |
    | Public IP address name | Enter ***myVirtualNetwork-ip***. A Standard public IP address is required to ensure connectivity to the backend service that manages the route server. |

    :::image type="content" source="./media/create-route-server.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Basics tab or creating a route server." lightbox="./media/create-route-server.png":::     

1. Select **Review + create** and then select **Create** after the validation passes.

    [!INCLUDE [Deployment note](../../includes/route-server-note-creation-time.md)]

1. Once the deployment is complete, select **Go to resource** to go to the **Overview** page of **myRouteServer**.  

1. Take a note of the **ASN** and **Route Server IP addresses** in the **Overview** page. You need this information to configure the NVA in the next section.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/route-server-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Route Server ASN and Peer IPs in the Overview page." lightbox="./media/route-server-overview.png":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > - The ASN of Azure Route Server is always 65515.
    > - The Peer IPs are the private IP addresses of the Route Server in the RouteServerSubnet.
 
## Create a network virtual appliance (NVA)

In this section, you create a Windows Server NVA that communicates and exchanges routes with the Route Server over a BGP peering connection.

### Create a virtual machine (VM)

In this section, you create a Windows Server VM in the virtual network you created earlier to act as a network virtual appliance.

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter ***virtual machine***, and select **Virtual machines** from the search results.

1. Select **Create**, then select **Azure virtual machine**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of **Create a virtual machine**, enter, or select the following information:

    | Settings | Value |
    | -------- | ----- |
    | **Project details** |  |
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription that you used for the virtual network. |
    | Resource group | Select **myResourceGroup**. |
    | **Instance details** |  |
    | Virtual machine name | Enter ***myNVA***. |
    | Region | Select **(US) East US**. |
    | Availability options | Select **No infrastructure required**. |
    | Security type | Select a security type. This tutorial uses **Standard**. |
    | Image | Select a **Windows Server** image. This tutorial uses **Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition - x64 Gen2** image. |
    | Size | Choose a size or leave the default setting. |
    | **Administrator account** |  |
    | Username | Enter a username. |
    | Password | Enter a password. |
    | Confirm password | Reenter the password. |

1. Select **Networking** tab or **Next: Disks >** then **Next: Networking >**.

1. On the **Networking** tab, select the following network settings:

    | Settings | Value |
    | -------- | ----- |
    | Virtual network | Select **myVirtualNetwork**. |
    | Subnet | Select **mySubnet (10.0.0.0/24)**. |
    | Public IP | Leave as default. |
    | NIC network security group | Select **Basic**. |
    | Public inbound ports | Select **Allow selected ports**. |
    | Select inbound ports | Select **RDP (3389)**. |

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Leaving the RDP port open to the internet isn't recommended. Restrict access to the RDP port to a specific IP address or range of IP addresses. For production environments, it's recommended to block internet access to the RDP port and use [Azure Bastion](../bastion/bastion-overview.md?toc=/azure/route-server/toc.json) to securely connect to your virtual machine from the Azure portal.

1. Select **Review + create** and then **Create** after validation passes.

### Configure BGP on the virtual machine

In this section, you configure BGP settings on the VM so it acts as an NVA and can exchange routes with the Route Server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) isn't supported in Azure. However, in this tutorial, it's used to simulate an NVA and demonstrate how to peer a route server with it. For more information, see [Remote access overview](/windows-server/remote/remote-access/remote-access).
 
1. Go to **myNVA** virtual machine and select **Connect**.

1. On the **Connect** page, select **Download RDP file** under **Native RDP**.

1. Open the downloaded file.

1. Select **Connect** and then enter the username and password that you created in the previous steps. Accept the certificate if prompted.

1. Run PowerShell as an administrator.

1. In PowerShell, execute the following cmdlets:

    ```powershell
    # Install required Windows features.
    Install-WindowsFeature RemoteAccess
    Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-RemoteAccess-PowerShell
    Install-WindowsFeature Routing
    Install-RemoteAccess -VpnType RoutingOnly
    
    # Configure BGP & Router ID on the Windows Server
    Add-BgpRouter -BgpIdentifier 10.0.0.4 -LocalASN 65001
     
    # Configure Azure Route Server as a BGP Peer.
    Add-BgpPeer -LocalIPAddress 10.0.0.4 -PeerIPAddress 10.0.1.4 -PeerASN 65515 -Name RS_IP1
    Add-BgpPeer -LocalIPAddress 10.0.0.4 -PeerIPAddress 10.0.1.5 -PeerASN 65515 -Name RS_IP2
    
    # Originate and announce BGP routes.
    Add-BgpCustomRoute -network 172.16.1.0/24
    Add-BgpCustomRoute -network 172.16.2.0/24
    ```

## Configure Route Server peering

1. Go to the Route Server you created in the previous steps.

1. Select **Peers** under **Settings**. Then, select **+ Add** to add a new peer.

1. On the **Add Peer** page, enter the following information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Name | Enter ***myNVA***. Use this name to identify the peer. It doesn't have to be the same name of the VM that you configured as an NVA. |
    | ASN | Enter ***65001***. This is the ASN of the NVA. You configured it in the previous section. |
    | IPv4 Address | Enter ***10.0.0.4***. This is the private IP address of the NVA. |

1. Select **Add** to save the configuration.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/add-peer.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to add the NVA to the Route Server as a peer." lightbox="./media/add-peer.png":::

1. Once you add the NVA as a peer, the **Peers** page shows the **myNVA** as a peer:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/peer-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the peers of a Route Server." lightbox="./media/peer-list.png":::

 > [!NOTE]
> Azure Route Server supports BGP peering with NVAs that are deployed in the same virtual network or a directly peered virtual network. Configuring BGP peering between an on-premises NVA and Azure Route Server isn't supported.
    
## Check learned routes

Use [Get-AzRouteServerPeerLearnedRoute](/powershell/module/az.network/get-azrouteserverpeerlearnedroute) cmdlet to check the routes learned by the Route Server.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzRouteServerPeerLearnedRoute -ResourceGroupName 'myResourceGroup' -RouteServerName 'myRouteServer' -PeerName 'myNVA'
```

The output should look like the following example. The output shows the two learned routes from the NVA: 

```output
LocalAddress Network       NextHop  SourcePeer Origin AsPath Weight
------------ -------       -------  ---------- ------ ------ ------
10.0.1.5     172.16.1.0/24 10.0.0.4 10.0.0.4   EBgp   65001  32768
10.0.1.5     172.16.2.0/24 10.0.0.4 10.0.0.4   EBgp   65001  32768
10.0.1.4     172.16.1.0/24 10.0.0.4 10.0.0.4   EBgp   65001  32768
10.0.1.4     172.16.2.0/24 10.0.0.4 10.0.0.4   EBgp   65001  32768
```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can delete all resources created in this tutorial by deleting **myResourceGroup** resource group:

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter ***myResourceGroup***. Select **myResourceGroup** from the search results.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. In **Delete a resource group**, select **Apply force delete for selected Virtual machines and Virtual machine scale sets**.

1. Enter ***myResourceGroup***, and then select **Delete**.

1. Select **Delete** to confirm the deletion of the resource group and all its resources.
