# Default route injection in spoke virtual networks

One of the most common architectures in Azure is the hub and spoke design, where workloads deployed in a spoke virtual network (VNet) send traffic through shared network devices that exist in the hub VNet. User-defined routes (UDR) typically need to be configured in the spoke VNets to steer traffic towards security devices in the hub. However, this design requires administrators to manage these routes across many spokes. 

Azure Route Server offers a centralized point where network virtual appliances (NVAs) can advertise routes that it injects in the spoke VNets. This way, administrators donâ€™t have to create and update route tables in spoke VNets. 

## Topology

The following diagram depicts a simple hub and spoke design with a hub VNet and two spoke VNets. In the hub, a network virtual appliance and a Route Server have been deployed. Without the Route Server, user-defined routes would have to be configured in every spoke. These UDRs would usually contain a default route for 0.0.0.0/0 that sends all traffic from the spoke VNets through the NVA. This scenario can be used, for example, to inspect the traffic for security purposes.

In this scenario with the Route Server in the hub VNet, there's no need to use user-defined routes. The NVA advertises network prefixes to the Route Server, which injects them so they appear in the effective routes of any virtual machine deployed in the hub VNet or spoke VNets that are peered with the hub VNet with the setting ***Use the remote virtual network's gateway or Route Server***.

## Connectivity to on-premises through the NVA

If the NVA is used to provide connectivity to on-premises network via IPsec VPNs or SD-WAN technologies, the same mechanism can be used to attract traffic from the spokes to the NVA. Additionally, the NVA can dynamically learn the Azure prefixes from the Azure Route Server, and advertise them with a dynamic routing protocol to on-premises. The following diagram describes this setup:

## Inspecting private traffic through the NVA

The previous sections depict the traffic being inspected by the network virtual appliance (NVA) by injecting a `0.0.0.0/0` default route from the NVA to the Route Server. However, if you wish to only inspect spoke-to-spoke and spoke-to-on-premises traffic through the NVA, you should consider that Azure Route Server doesn't advertise a route that is the same or longer prefix than the virtual network address space learned from the NVA. In other words, Azure Route Server won't inject these prefixes into the virtual network and they won't be programmed on the NICs of virtual machines in the hub or spoke VNets. 

Azure Route Server, however, will advertise a larger subnet than the VNet address space that is learned from the NVA. It's possible to advertise from the NVA a supernet of what you have in your virtual network. For example, if your virtual network uses the RFC 1918 address space `10.0.0.0/16`, your NVA can advertise `10.0.0.0/8` to the Azure Route Server and these prefixes will be injected into the hub and spoke VNets. This VNet behavior is referenced in [About BGP with VPN Gateway](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-vpn-faq.md#advertise-exact-prefixes).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have a scenario where prefixes with the same length are being advertised from ExpressRoute and the NVA, Azure will prefer and program the routes learned from ExpressRoute. For more information, see [Routing preference](hub-routing-preference.md).

## Connectivity to on-premises through virtual network gateways

If a VPN or an ExpressRoute gateway exists in the same virtual network as the Route Server and NVA to provide connectivity to on-premises networks, routes learned by these gateways will be programmed as well in the spoke VNets. These routes override the default route (`0.0.0.0/0`) injected by the Route Server, since they would be more specific (longer network masks). The following diagram describes the previous design, where an ExpressRoute gateway has been added.

:::image type="content" source="./media/route-injection-in-spokes/route-injection-vpn-and-expressroute.png" alt-text="Diagram showing a basic hub and spoke topology with on-premises connectivity via an NVA and ExpressRoute.":::

To prevent your spoke VNets from being programmed with the on-premises prefixes learned by the VPN and ExpressRoute gateway, you can disable "Propagate gateway routes" on the spoke subnets' route tables. To ensure VNet to on-premises traffic is inspected by the NVA, you can configure a 0.0.0.0/0 UDR (user-defined route) on the spoke subnets' route tables with next hop as the NVA/Firewall in the hub VNet. Please note that disabling "Propagate gateway routes" will prevent these spoke subnets from dynamically learning routes from Route Server. 

By default, the Route Server advertises all prefixes learned from the NVA to ExpressRoute too. This might not be desired, for example because of the route limits of ExpressRoute. In that case, the NVA can announce its routes to the Route Server including the BGP community `no-advertise` (with value `65535:65282`). When Route Server receives routes with this BGP community, it injects them to the subnets, but it will not advertise them to any other BGP peers (like ExpressRoute or VPN gateways, or other NVAs).

## SDWAN coexistence with ExpressRoute and Azure Firewall

A particular case of the previous design is when customers insert the Azure Firewall in the traffic flow to inspect all traffic going to on-premises networks, either via ExpressRoute or via SD-WAN/VPN appliances. In this situation, all spoke subnets have route tables that prevent the spokes from learning any route from ExpressRoute or the Route Server, and have default routes (0.0.0.0/0) with the Azure Firewall as next hop, as the following diagram shows:

:::image type="content" source="./media/route-injection-in-spokes/route-injection-vpn-expressroute-firewall.png" alt-text="Diagram showing hub and spoke topology with on-premises connectivity via NVA for VPN and ExpressRoute where Azure Firewall does the breakout.":::

The Azure Firewall subnet learns the routes coming from both ExpressRoute and the VPN/SDWAN NVA, and decides whether sending traffic one way or the other. As described in the previous section, if the NVA appliance advertises more than 1000 routes to the Route Server, it should send its BGP routes marked with the BGP community `no-advertise`. This way, the SDWAN prefixes won't be injected back to on-premises via Express-Route.


> [!NOTE]
> For any traffic from on-premises destined for Private Endpoints, this traffic will bypass the Firewall NVA or Azure Firewall in the hub. However, this results in asymmetric routing (which can lead to loss of connectivity between on-premises and Private Endpoints) as Private Endpoints forward on-premises traffic to the Firewall. To ensure routing symmetry, enable [Route Table network policies for private endpoints](../private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy.md) on the subnets where Private Endpoints are deployed.

## Traffic symmetry

If multiple NVA instances are used in active/active scenario for better resiliency or scalability, traffic symmetry is a requirement if the NVAs need to keep the state of the connections. This is, for example, the case of Next Generation Firewalls.

- For connectivity from the Azure virtual machines to the public internet, the NVA uses source network address translation (SNAT) so that the egress traffic will be sourced from the NVA's public IP address, hence achieving traffic symmetry.
- For inbound traffic from the internet to workloads running in virtual machines, additional to destination network address translation (DNAT), the NVAs will require to do source network address translation (SNAT), to make sure that the return traffic from the virtual machines lands at the same NVA instance that processed the first packet.
- For Azure-to-Azure connectivity, since the source virtual machine will take the routing decision independently of the destination, SNAT is required today to achieve traffic symmetry.

Multiple NVA instances can be deployed in an active/passive setup as well, for example if one of them advertises worse routes (with a longer AS path) than the other. In this case, Azure Route Server will only inject the preferred route in the VNet virtual machines, and the less preferred route will only be used when the primary NVA instance stops advertising over BGP.

It is also important to note that Route Server does not support datapath traffic. When advertising routes to Route Server, the NVA needs to advertise routes with next hop as itself, a load balancer in front of the NVA, or an NVA/Firewall in the same VNet as the NVA.
