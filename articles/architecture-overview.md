#Architecture
Resources for building applications that use Microsoft Azure.

##Microsoft Architecture Blueprints

Microsoft is now publishing a set of high level architecture blueprints showing how to build specific types of systems using Microsoft Azure services. Each blueprint includes a 2D Visio based file that you can download and modify, a more colorful 3D PDF file to introduce the blueprint and a video that walks through the 3D PDF. See 
[Microsoft Architecture Blueprints](http://msdn.microsoft.com/dn630664).

##Azure Symbol/Icon set

[Download the Azure Symbol/Icon set](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41937) to create technical materials that describe (or use) Azure—things like architecture diagrams, training materials, presentations, datasheets, infographics, and whitepapers. You can download the symbols in PPT, Visio, or PNG formats. We’d like to know what you think, so there are instructions for providing feedback in the download.

The 2D diagrams in the [Microsoft Architecture Blueprints](http://msdn.microsoft.com/dn630664) use these symbols. 

The symbol set is being expanded to include Cloud and Enterprise symbols in the next release. Often new Azure services will release before the download is updated. If you want a preview of the new set or symbols for new Azure services, email [AzureSymbols@microsoft.com](mailto:AzureSymbols@microsoft.com).  

If you've used the symbols, be sure to fill out the short 5 question [survey](http://aka.ms/azuresymbolssurveyv1) to let us know if they are useful and how you use them.

##Design patterns
Microsoft Patterns and Practices has published the book [Cloud Design Patterns](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn568099.aspx) which is available both on MSDN and in PDF download. There is also a large format poster available which lists all the patterns.

##Architecture Infographics
Microsoft publishes several architecture related posters/infographics. They include [Building Real-World Cloud Applications](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/infographics/building-real-world-cloud-apps/) and [Scaling with Cloud Services](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/infographics/cloud-services/) .
