# Configure USB redirection on Windows over the Remote Desktop Protocol

[!INCLUDE [include-rdp-shared-article](includes/include-rdp-shared-article.md)]

You can configure the redirection of certain USB peripherals between a local Windows device and a remote session over the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article covers USB devices that use opaque low-level redirection only. USB devices that use high-level redirection are covered by the article for the specific device type. You should use high-level redirection methods where possible.
>
> For a list of which device type uses which redirection method, see [Supported resources and peripherals](redirection-remote-desktop-protocol.md#supported-resources-and-peripherals). Peripherals redirected using opaque low-level redirection require drivers installed in the remote session.

::: zone pivot="azure-virtual-desktop"
 For Azure Virtual Desktop, USB redirection must be configured at the following points. If any of these components aren't configured correctly, USB redirection won't work as expected. You can use Microsoft Intune or Group Policy to configure your session hosts and the local device.

 - Session host
 - Host pool RDP property
 - Local device

By default, the host pool RDP property will redirect all supported USB peripherals, but you can also specify individual USB peripherals to redirect or exclude from redirection, and redirect an entire device setup class, such as multimedia peripherals. Take care when configuring redirection settings as the most restrictive setting is the resultant behavior.

Some USB peripherals might have functions that use opaque low-level USB redirection or high-level redirection. By default, these peripherals are redirected using high-level redirection. You can force these peripherals to use opaque low-level USB redirection also by following the steps in this article.
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="windows-365"
 For Windows 365, USB redirection must be configured on the Cloud PC and the local device. If either of these components aren't configured correctly, USB redirection won't work as expected. You can use Microsoft Intune or Group Policy to configure your Cloud PC and the local device. Once configured, Windows 365 redirects all supported USB peripherals.
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="dev-box"
 For Microsoft Dev Box, USB redirection must be configured on the dev box and the local device. If either of these components aren't configured correctly, USB redirection won't work as expected. You can use Microsoft Intune or Group Policy to configure your dev box and the local device. Once configured, Microsoft Dev Box redirects all supported USB peripherals.

- You need to connect to a remote session from a supported app and platform. To view redirection support in Windows App and the Remote Desktop app, see [Compare Windows App features across platforms and devices](/windows-app/compare-platforms-features#redirection) and [Compare Remote Desktop app features across platforms and devices](compare-remote-desktop-clients.md#redirection).

::: zone pivot="azure-virtual-desktop"
## Session host configuration

To configure a session host for USB redirection using opaque low-level redirection, you need to enable Plug and Play redirection. You can do this using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy.
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="windows-365"
## Cloud PC configuration

To configure a Cloud PC for USB redirection using opaque low-level redirection, you need to enable Plug and Play redirection. You can do this using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy.
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="dev-box"
## Dev box configuration

To configure a dev box for USB redirection using opaque low-level redirection, you need to enable Plug and Play redirection. You can do this using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy.
::: zone-end

The default configuration is:

- **Windows operating system**: USB redirection isn't allowed.

Select the relevant tab for your scenario.

# [Microsoft Intune](#tab/intune)

To enable Plug and Play redirection using Microsoft Intune:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/).

1. [Create or edit a configuration profile](/mem/intune/configuration/administrative-templates-windows) for **Windows 10 and later** devices, with the **Settings catalog** profile type.

1. In the settings picker, browse to **Administrative templates** > **Windows Components** > **Remote Desktop Services** > **Remote Desktop Session Host** > **Device and Resource Redirection**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/redirection-remote-desktop-protocol/redirection-configuration-intune.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the device and resource redirection options in the Microsoft Intune portal." lightbox="media/redirection-remote-desktop-protocol/redirection-configuration-intune.png":::

1. Check the box for **Do not allow supported Plug and Play device redirection**, then close the settings picker.

1. Expand the **Administrative templates** category, then set toggle the switch for **Do not allow supported Plug and Play device redirection** to **Disabled**.

1. Select **Next**.

1. *Optional*: On the **Scope tags** tab, select a scope tag to filter the profile. For more information about scope tags, see [Use role-based access control (RBAC) and scope tags for distributed IT](/mem/intune/fundamentals/scope-tags).

1. On the **Assignments** tab, select the group containing the computers providing a remote session you want to configure, then select **Next**.

1. On the **Review + create** tab, review the settings, then select **Create**.

1. Once the policy applies to the computers providing a remote session, restart them for the settings to take effect.

# [Group Policy](#tab/group-policy)

To allow or disable video capture redirection, which includes cameras and webcams, using Group Policy:

1. Open the **Group Policy Management** console on a device you use to manage the Active Directory domain.

1. Create or edit a policy that targets the computers providing a remote session you want to configure.

1. Navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Remote Desktop Services** > **Remote Desktop Session Host** > **Device and Resource Redirection**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/redirection-remote-desktop-protocol/redirection-configuration-group-policy.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the device and resource redirection options in the Group Policy editor." lightbox="media/redirection-remote-desktop-protocol/redirection-configuration-group-policy.png":::

1. Double-click the policy setting **Do not allow supported Plug and Play device redirection** to open it. Select **Disabled**, then select **OK**. 

1. Ensure the policy is applied to the computers providing a remote session, then restart them for the settings to take effect.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With opaque low-level USB redirection, drivers for redirected USB peripherals will be installed in the remote session by using the same process that a physical Windows computer uses when a device is plugged in. Please ensure that Windows Update is enabled in the remote session, or that drivers are available for the USB peripheral being redirected.

## Local Windows device configuration

To configure a local Windows device for USB redirection using opaque low-level redirection, you need to allow RDP redirection of other supported USB peripherals for users and administrators. You can do this using Group Policy.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although the setting **Allow RDP redirection of other supported RemoteFX USB devices from this computer** is available in Microsoft Intune, it doesn't currently work as expected. You must use Group Policy to configure this setting.

The default configuration is:

- **Windows operating system**: other supported USB peripherals aren't available for RDP redirection by using any user account.

To allow RDP redirection of other supported USB peripherals using Group Policy:

1. Open the **Group Policy Management** console on a device you use to manage the Active Directory domain.

1. Create or edit a policy that targets the computers providing a remote session you want to configure.

1. Navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Remote Desktop Services** > **Remote Desktop Connection Client** > **RemoteFX USB Device Redirection**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/redirection-remote-desktop-protocol/redirection-remotefx-usb-device-redirection-group-policy.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the client USB device redirection options in Group Policy editor." lightbox="media/redirection-remote-desktop-protocol/redirection-remotefx-usb-device-redirection-group-policy.png":::

1. Double-click the policy setting **Allow RDP redirection of other supported RemoteFX USB devices from this computer** to open it. Select **Enabled**

1. For the drop-down list for **RemoteFX USB Redirection Access Rights**, select **Administrators and Users**, then select **OK**. 

1. Ensure the policy is applied to the local Windows devices, then you must restart them for USB redirection to work.

1. Select **OK** to close **Local devices and resources**.

1. Select the **General** tab, then select **Save As...** and save the `.rdp` file.

1. Open a PowerShell prompt on the local device.

1. Run the following commands to match each supported USB device name with the USB instance ID. You need to replace the `<placeholder>` value for the `.rdp` file you saved previously.

   ```powershell
   $rdpFile = "<RDP file path>"
   
   $testPath = Test-Path $rdpFile
   If ($testPath) {
   
      # Function used for recursively getting all child devices of a parent device
      Function Lookup-Device-Children {
          [CmdletBinding()]
          Param(
              [Parameter(Mandatory, ValueFromPipeline)]
              [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
              [object] 
              $ChildDeviceIds
          )
      
          foreach ($childDeviceId in $childDeviceIds) { 
              $pnpDeviceProperties = Get-PnpDeviceProperty -InstanceId $childDeviceId
          
              [string]$childDevice = ($pnpDeviceProperties | ? KeyName -eq DEVPKEY_NAME).Data
              Write-Output "    $childDevice"
      
              If ($pnpDeviceProperties.KeyName -contains "DEVPKEY_Device_Children") {
                  $pnpChildDeviceIds = ($pnpDeviceProperties | ? KeyName -eq DEVPKEY_Device_Children).Data
                  Lookup-Device-Children -ChildDeviceIds $pnpChildDeviceIds
              }
          }
      }
      
      # Get a list of the supported devices from the .rdp file and store them in an array
      [string]$usb = Get-Content -Path $rdpFile | Select-String USB
      $devices = @($usb.Replace("usbdevicestoredirect:s:","").Replace("-","").Split(";"))
      
      # Get the devices
      foreach ($device in $devices) {
          $pnpDeviceProperties = Get-PnpDeviceProperty -InstanceId $device
          
          [string]$parentDevice = ($pnpDeviceProperties | ? KeyName -eq DEVPKEY_NAME).Data
          Write-Output "`n-------------------`n`nParent device name: $parentDevice`nUSB device ID: $device`n"
      
          If ($pnpDeviceProperties.KeyName -contains "DEVPKEY_Device_Children") {
              $pnpChildDeviceIds = ($pnpDeviceProperties | ? KeyName -eq DEVPKEY_Device_Children).Data
              Write-Output "This parent device has the following child devices:"
              Lookup-Device-Children -ChildDeviceIds $pnpChildDeviceIds
          }
      }

   } else {
       Write-Output "Error: file doesn't exist. Please check the file path and try again."
   }
   ```

   The output is similar to the following example:

   ```output

       HID-compliant vendor-defined device
   ```

::: zone pivot="azure-virtual-desktop"
1. Make a note of the device instance ID of any of the parent devices you want to use for redirection. Only the parent device instance ID is applicable for USB redirection.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="azure-virtual-desktop"
### Optional: Discover peripherals matching a device setup class

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="azure-virtual-desktop"
For Azure Virtual Desktop, you can enter a device class GUID in the host pool properties so that only the devices that match that device class are redirected. To retrieve a list of the devices that match a specific device class GUID on a local device:
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="azure-virtual-desktop"
1. On the local device, open a PowerShell prompt.

1. Run the following command, replacing `<device class GUID>` with the device class GUID you want to search for and list the matching devices. For a list of device class GUID values, see [System-Defined Device Setup Classes Available to Vendors](/windows-hardware/drivers/install/system-defined-device-setup-classes-available-to-vendors).

   ```powershell
   $deviceClassGuid = "<device class GUID>"
   Get-PnpDevice | Where-Object {$_.ClassGuid -like "*$deviceClassGuid*" -and $_.InstanceId -like "USB\*" -and $_.Present -like "True"} | FT -AutoSize
   ```

   For example, using the device class GUID `4d36e96c-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318` for multimedia devices, The output is similar to the following example:

   ```output
   Status Class FriendlyName              InstanceId
   ------ ----- ------------              ----------
   OK     MEDIA USB Advanced Audio Device USB\VID_0D8C&PID_0147&MI_00\B&35486F89&0&0000
   OK     MEDIA AKG C44-USB Microphone    USB\VID_0ECB&PID_1F58&MI_00\A&250837E1&0&0000
   OK     MEDIA Logitech StreamCam        USB\VID_046D&PID_0893&MI_02\6&4886529&0&0002

::: zone pivot="azure-virtual-desktop"
## Host pool configuration

The Azure Virtual Desktop host pool setting *USB device redirection* determines which supported USB devices connected to the local device are available in the remote session. The corresponding RDP property is `usbdevicestoredirect:s:<value>`. For more information, see [Supported RDP properties](rdp-properties.md#device-redirection).

To configure USB redirection using host pool RDP properties:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. In the search bar, type *Azure Virtual Desktop* and select the matching service entry.

1. Select **Host pools**, then select the host pool you want to configure.

1. Select **RDP Properties**, then select **Device redirection**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/redirection-remote-desktop-protocol/redirection-configuration-host-pool.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the host pool device redirection tab in the Azure portal." lightbox="media/redirection-remote-desktop-protocol/redirection-configuration-host-pool.png":::

1. For **USB device redirection**, select the drop-down list, then select one of the following options:

   - **Redirect all USB devices that are not already redirected by another high-level redirection** (*default*)
   - **Redirect all devices that are members of the specified device setup class or devices defined by specific instance ID**

1. If you select **Redirect all devices that are members of the specified device setup class or devices defined by specific instance ID**, an extra box shows. You need to enter the device setup class or specific device instance path for the devices you want to redirect, separated by a semicolon. For more information, see [Controlling opaque low-level USB redirection](redirection-remote-desktop-protocol.md#controlling-opaque-low-level-usb-redirection). To get the values for supported devices, see [Optional: Retrieve specific device instance IDs](#optional-retrieve-specific-usb-device-instance-ids-to-use-with-opaque-low-level-redirection), and for device class GUIDs, see [Optional: Discover peripherals matching a device setup class](#optional-discover-peripherals-matching-a-device-setup-class). For Azure Virtual Desktop, the characters `\`, `:`, and `;` must be escaped using a backslash character.

   Here are some examples:

   - To redirect a specific peripheral where it's only redirected when based on whole device instance path (that is, it's connected to a particular USB port), enter the device instance path using double backslash characters, such as `USB\\VID_045E&PID_0779\\5&21F6DCD1&0&5`. For multiple devices, separate them with a semicolon, such as `USB\\VID_045E&PID_0779\\5&21F6DCD1&0&5;USB\\VID_0ECB&PID_1F58\\9&2E5F6FA0&0&1`.

   - To redirect all peripherals that are members of a specific device setup class (that is, all supported multimedia devices), enter the device class GUID, including braces. For example, to redirect all multimedia devices, enter `{4d36e96c-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}`. For multiple device class IDs, separate them with a semicolon, such as `{4d36e96c-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318};{6bdd1fc6-810f-11d0-bec7-08002be2092f}`.

   > [!TIP]
   > You can create advanced configurations by combining device instance paths and device class GUIDs, and you enter the configuration on the **Advanced** tab of **RDP Properties**. For more examples, see [usbdevicestoredirect RDP property](#usbdevicestoredirect-rdp-property).

1. Select **Save**. You can now test the USB redirection configuration.

## Test USB redirection

::: zone pivot="azure-virtual-desktop"
Once you configure your session hosts, host pool RDP property, and local devices, you can test USB redirection. Consider the following behavior:
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="windows-365"
Once you configure your Cloud PCs and local devices, you can test USB redirection. Consider the following behavior:
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="dev-box"
Once you configure your dev boxes and local devices, you can test USB redirection. Consider the following behavior:
::: zone-end

- Drivers for redirected USB peripherals are installed in the remote session using the same process as the local device. Ensure that Windows Update is enabled in the remote session, or that drivers are available for the peripheral.

- Opaque low-level USB redirection is designed for LAN connections (< 20 ms latency); with higher latency, some USB peripherals might not function properly, or the user experience might not suitable.

- USB peripherals aren't available on the local device locally while it's redirected to the remote session.

- USB peripherals can only be used in one remote session at a time.

- USB redirection is only available from a local Windows device.

To test USB redirection:

1. Plug in the supported USB peripherals you want to use in a remote session.

1. Connect to a remote session using Window App or the Remote Desktop app on a platform that supports USB redirection. For more information, see [Compare Windows App features across platforms and devices](/windows-app/compare-platforms-features#redirection) and [Compare Remote Desktop app features across platforms and devices](compare-remote-desktop-clients.md#redirection).

1. Check the peripherals are connected to the remote session. With the display in full screen, on the status bar select the icon to select devices to use. This icon only shows when USB redirection is correctly configured.

   :::image type="content" source="media/redirection-remote-desktop-protocol/windows-app-status-bar-device-redirection.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the status bar of Windows App with a red box around the select devices to use icon.":::

1. Check the box for each USB peripheral you want to redirect to the remote session, and uncheck the box for those peripherals you don't want to redirect. Some devices might appear in this list as **Remote Desktop Generic USB Device** once directed.

   :::image type="content" source="media/redirection-remote-desktop-protocol/windows-app-connected-local-devices-resources.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the local devices and resources dialog box of Windows App when connected to a remote session.":::

1. Check the device is functioning correctly in the remote session. The correct driver needs to be installed in the remote session. Here are some ways to check the USB peripherals are available in the remote session, depending on the permission you have in the remote session:

   1. Open Device Manager in the remote session from the start menu, or run `devmgmt.msc` from the command line. Check the redirected peripherals appear in the expected device category and don't show any errors.

      :::image type="content" source="media/redirection-remote-desktop-protocol/remote-session-device-manager.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing device manager in a remote session.":::

   1. Open a PowerShell prompt in the remote session and run the following command:

      ```powershell
      Get-PnPDevice | Where-Object {$_.InstanceId -like "*TSUSB*" -and $_.Present -eq "true"} | FT -AutoSize
      ```
      
      The output is similar to the following example. Check the status column for any entries that show **Error**. If there are any entries with an error, troubleshoot the device according to the manufacturer's instructions.

      ```output
      Status Class FriendlyName                   InstanceId
      ------ ----- ------------                   ----------
      OK     USB   USB Composite Device           USB\VID_0D8C&PID_0147&REV_0109\3&2DCEE32&0&TSUSB-SESSION4...
      OK     Ports USB-to-Serial Comm Port (COM6) USB\VID_012A&PID_0123&REV_0202\3&2DCEE32&0&TSUSB-SESSION4...
      ```

1. Once the peripherals are redirected and functioning correctly, you can use them as you would on a local device.

## usbdevicestoredirect RDP property

The `usbdevicestoredirect` RDP property is used to specify which USB devices are redirected to the remote session and its syntax `usbdevicestoredirect:s:<value>` provides flexibility when redirecting USB peripherals using opaque low-level redirection. Valid values for the property are shown in the following table. Values can be used on their own, or a combination of these values can be used with each other when separated with a semicolon, subject to a processing order. For more information, see [Controlling opaque low-level USB redirection](redirection-remote-desktop-protocol.md#controlling-opaque-low-level-usb-redirection).

| Processing order | Value | Description |
|:--:|:--:|--|
| N/A | *No value specified* | Don't redirect any supported USB peripherals using opaque low-level redirection. |
| 1 | `*` | Redirect all peripherals that aren't using high-level redirection. |
| 2 | `{<DeviceClassGUID>}` | Redirect all peripherals that are members of the specified device setup class. For a list of device class GUID values, see [System-Defined Device Setup Classes Available to Vendors](/windows-hardware/drivers/install/system-defined-device-setup-classes-available-to-vendors). |
| 3 | `<USBInstanceID>` | Redirect a USB peripheral specified by the given device instance path. |
| 4 | `<-USBInstanceID>` | Don't redirect a peripheral specified by the given device instance path. |

When constructed as a string in the correct processing order, the syntax is:

```uri
usbdevicestoredirect:s:*;{<DeviceClassGUID>};<USBInstanceID>;<-USBInstanceID>`
```

Here are some examples of using the `usbdevicestoredirect` RDP property:

- To redirect all supported USB peripherals that high-level redirection doesn't redirect, use:

   ```uri
   usbdevicestoredirect:s:*
   ```

- To redirect all supported USB peripherals with a device class GUID of `{6bdd1fc6-810f-11d0-bec7-08002be2092f}` (imaging), use:

   ```uri
   usbdevicestoredirect:s:{6bdd1fc6-810f-11d0-bec7-08002be2092f}
   ```

- To redirect all supported USB peripherals that high-level redirection doesn't redirect and USB peripherals with a device class GUIDs of `{6bdd1fc6-810f-11d0-bec7-08002be2092f}` (imaging) and `{4d36e96c-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}` (multimedia), use:

   ```uri
   usbdevicestoredirect:s:*;{6bdd1fc6-810f-11d0-bec7-08002be2092f};{4d36e96c-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}
   ```

- To redirect a supported a USB peripheral with instance IDs `USB\VID_095D&PID_9208\5&23639F31&0&2` and `USB\VID_045E&PID_076F\5&14D1A39&0&7`, use:

   ```uri
   usbdevicestoredirect:s:USB\VID_095D&PID_9208\5&23639F31&0&2;USB\VID_045E&PID_076F\5&14D1A39&0&7
   ```

- To redirect all supported USB peripherals that high-level redirection doesn't redirect, except for a device with an instance ID of `USB\VID_045E&PID_076F\5&14D1A39&0&7`, use:

   ```uri
   usbdevicestoredirect:s:*;-USB\VID_045E&PID_076F\5&14D1A39&0&7
   ```

- Use the following syntax to achieve the following scenario:
   - Redirect all supported USB peripherals that high-level redirection doesn't redirect.
   - Redirect all supported USB peripherals with a device setup class GUID of `{6bdd1fc6-810f-11d0-bec7-08002be2092f}` (imaging).
   - Redirect a supported a USB peripheral with instance ID `USB\VID_095D&PID_9208\5&23639F31&0&2`.
   - Don't redirect a supported USB peripheral with an instance ID of `USB\VID_045E&PID_076F\5&14D1A39&0&7`.

   ```uri
   usbdevicestoredirect:s:*;{6bdd1fc6-810f-11d0-bec7-08002be2092f};USB\VID_095D&PID_9208\5&23639F31&0&2;-USB\VID_045E&PID_076F\5&14D1A39&0&7
   ```

> [!TIP]
> For Azure Virtual Desktop, the characters `\`, `:`, and `;` must be escaped using a backslash character. This includes any device instance paths, such as `USB\\VID_045E&PID_0779\\5&21F6DCD1&0&5`. It doesn't affect the redirection behavior.
