# Monitor Autoscale operations with Insights in Azure Virtual Desktop

Autoscale lets you scale your session host virtual machines (VMs) in a host pool up or down according to schedule to optimize deployment costs. Autoscale diagnostic data, integrated with Insights in Azure Virtual Desktop, enables you to monitor scaling operations, identify issues that need to be fixed, and recognize opportunities to optimize your scaling plan configuration to save cost.

To learn more about autoscale, see [Autoscale scaling plans and example scenarios](autoscale-scenarios.md), and for Insights in Azure Virtual Desktop, see [Enable Insights to monitor Azure Virtual Desktop](insights.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can only monitor Autoscale operations with Insights with pooled host pools. For personal host pools you can send diagnostic logs for Autoscale to a storage account or an Event Hub. For more information, see [Set up diagnostics for Autoscale in Azure Virtual Desktop](autoscale-diagnostics.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you can monitor Autoscale operations with Insights, you need:

- A pooled host pool with a [scaling plan assigned](autoscale-scaling-plan.md). Personal host pools aren't supported.

- Insights configured for your host pool and its related workspace. To learn how to configure Insights, see [Enable Insights to monitor Azure Virtual Desktop](insights.md).

- An Azure account that is assigned the following role-based access control (RBAC) roles, depending on your scenario:

   | Scenario | RBAC roles | Scope |
   |--|--|--|
   | Configure diagnostic settings | [Desktop Virtualization Contributor](rbac.md#desktop-virtualization-contributor) | Assigned on the resource group or subscription for your host pools, workspaces, and session hosts. |
   | View and query data | [Desktop Virtualization Reader](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#desktop-virtualization-reader)<br /><br />[Log Analytics Reader](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#log-analytics-reader) | - Desktop Virtualization Reader assigned on the resource group or subscription where the host pools, workspaces, and session hosts are.<br /><br />- Log Analytics Reader assigned on any Log Analytics workspace used for Azure Virtual Desktop Insights.<sup>1</sup>|

   <sup>1. You can also create a custom role to reduce the scope of assignment on the Log Analytics workspace. For more information, see [Manage access to Log Analytics workspaces](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access).</sup>

## Configure diagnostic settings and verify Insights workbook configuration

First, you need to make sure that diagnostic settings are configured to send the necessary logs from your host pool and workspace to your Log Analytics workspace.

### Enable Autoscale logs for a host pool

In addition to existing host pool logs that you're already sending to a Log Analytics workspace, you also need to send Autoscale logs for a host pool:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search bar, type *Azure Virtual Desktop* and select the matching service entry.

1. From the Azure Virtual Desktop overview page, select **Host pools**, then select the pooled host pool for which you want to enable Autoscale logs.

1. From the host pool overview page, select **Diagnostic settings**.

1. Select **Add diagnostic setting**, or select an existing diagnostic setting to edit.

1. Select the following categories as a minimum. If you already have some of these categories selected for this host pool as part of this diagnostic setting or an existing one, don't select them again, otherwise you get an error when you save the diagnostic setting.

   - **Checkpoint**
   - **Error**
   - **Management**
   - **Connection**
   - **HostRegistration**
   - **AgentHealthStatus**
   - **Autoscale logs for pooled host pools**

1. For **Destination details**, select **Send to Log Analytics workspace**.

1. Select **Save**.

### Verify workspace logs

Verify that you're already sending the required logs for a workspace to a Log Analytics workspace:

1. From the Azure Virtual Desktop overview page, select **Workspaces**, then select the related workspace for the host pool you're monitoring.

1. From the workspace overview page, select **Diagnostic settings**.

1. Select **Edit setting**.

1. Make sure the following categories are enabled.

   - **Checkpoint**
   - **Error**
   - **Management**
   - **Feed**

1. For **Destination details**, ensure you're sending data to the same Log Analytics workspace as the host pool.

1. If you made changes, select **Save**.

### Verify Insights workbook configuration

You need to verify that your Insights workbook is configured correctly for your host pool:

1. From the Azure Virtual Desktop overview page, select **Host pools**, then select the pooled host pool you're monitoring.

1. From the host pool overview page, select **Insights** if you're using the Azure Monitor Agent on your session hosts, or **Insights (Legacy)** if you're using the Log Analytics Agent on your session hosts.

1. Ensure there aren't outstanding configuration issues. If there are, you see messages such as:

   - **Azure Monitor is not configured for session hosts**.
   - **Azure Monitor is not configured for the selected AVD host pool**.
   - **There are session hosts not sending data to the expected Log Analytics workspace**.

   You need to complete the configuration in the relevant workbook to resolve these issues. For more information, see [Enable Insights to monitor Azure Virtual Desktop](insights.md). When there are no configuration issues, Insights should look similar to the following image:

## View Autoscale insights

After you configured your diagnostic settings and verified your Insights workbook configuration, you can view Autoscale insights:

1. From the Azure Virtual Desktop overview page, select **Host pools**, then select the pooled host pool for which you want to view Autoscale insights.

1. From the host pool overview page, select **Insights** if you're using the Azure Monitor Agent on your session hosts, or **Insights (Legacy)** if you're using the Log Analytics Agent on your session hosts.

1. Select **Autoscale** from the row of tabs. Depending on your display's width, you might need to select the ellipses **...** button to show the full list with **Autoscale**.

## Queries for Autoscale data in Log Analytics

For additional information about Autoscale operations, you can use run queries against the data in Log Analytics. The data is written to the `WVDAutoscaleEvaluationPooled` table. The following sections contain the schema and some example queries. To learn how to run queries in Log Analytics, see [Log Analytics tutorial](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial).

### WVDAutoscaleEvaluationPooled Schema

The following table details the schema for the `WVDAutoscaleEvaluationPooled` table, which contains the results of an Autoscale scaling plan evaluation on a host pool. The information includes the actions Autoscale took on the session hosts, such as starting or deallocating them, and why it took those actions. The entries that start with `Config` contain the scaling plan configuration values for an Autoscale schedule phase. If the `ResultType` value is *Failed*, join to the `WVDErrors` table using the `CorrelationId` to get more details.

| Name | Type | Description |
|--|:-:|--|
| `ActiveSessionHostCount` | Int | Number of session hosts accepting user connections. |
| `ActiveSessionHostsPercent` | Double | Percent of session hosts in the host pool considered active by Autoscale. |
| `ConfigCapacityThresholdPercent` | Double | Capacity threshold percent. |
| `ConfigMinActiveSessionHostsPercent` | Double | Minimum percent of session hosts that should be active. |
| `ConfigScheduleName` | String | Name of schedule used in the evaluation. |
| `ConfigSchedulePhase` | String | Schedule phase at the time of evaluation. |
| `CorrelationId` | String | A GUID generated for this Autoscale evaluation. |
| `ExcludedSessionHostCount` | Int | Number of session hosts excluded from Autoscale management. |
| `MaxSessionLimitPerSessionHost` | Int | The MaxSessionLimit value defined on the host pool. This value is the maximum number of user sessions allowed per session host. |
| `Properties` | Dynamic | Additional information. |
| `ResultType` | String | Status of this evaluation event. |
| `ScalingEvaluationStartTime` | DateTime | The timestamp (UTC) when the Autoscale evaluation started. |
| `ScalingPlanResourceId` | String | Resource ID of the Autoscale scaling plan. |
| `ScalingReasonMessage` | String | The actions Autoscale decided to perform and why it took those actions. |
| `SessionCount` | Int | Number of user sessions; only the user sessions from session hosts that are considered active by Autoscale are included. |
| `SessionOccupancyPercent` | Double | Percent of session host capacity occupied by user sessions. |
| `TimeGenerated` | DateTime | The timestamp (UTC) this event was generated. |
| `TotalSessionHostCount` | Int | Number of session hosts in the host pool. |
| `UnhealthySessionHostCount` | Int | Number of session hosts in a faulty state. |

### Sample of data

The following query returns the 10 most recent rows of data for Autoscale:

```kusto
WVDAutoscaleEvaluationPooled
| take 10
```

### Failed evaluations with WVDErrors

The following query correlates the tables `WVDAutoscaleEvaluationPooled` and `WVDErrors` and returns entries where the `ServiceError` column in `WVDErrors` is false:

The following query returns Autoscale evaluations that failed, including those that partially failed. The query also joins to `WVDErrors` to provide more failure details where available. The corresponding entries in `WVDErrors` only contain results where `ServiceError` is false:

```kusto
WVDAutoscaleEvaluationPooled
| where ResultType != "Succeeded"
| join kind=leftouter WVDErrors
    on CorrelationId
| order by _ResourceId asc, TimeGenerated asc, CorrelationId, TimeGenerated1 asc
```

### Start, deallocate, and force logoff operations

The following query returns the number of attempted operations of session host start, session host deallocate, and user session force logoff per host pool, schedule name, schedule phase, and day:

```kusto
WVDAutoscaleEvaluationPooled
| where ResultType == "Succeeded"
| extend properties = parse_json(Properties)
| extend BeganStartVmCount = toint(properties.BeganStartVmCount)
| extend BeganDeallocateVmCount = toint(properties.BeganDeallocateVmCount)
| extend BeganForceLogoffOnSessionHostCount = toint(properties.BeganForceLogoffOnSessionHostCount)
| summarize sum(BeganStartVmCount), sum(BeganDeallocateVmCount), sum(BeganForceLogoffOnSessionHostCount) by _ResourceId, bin(TimeGenerated, 1d), ConfigScheduleName, ConfigSchedulePhase
| order by _ResourceId asc, TimeGenerated asc, ConfigScheduleName, ConfigSchedulePhase asc
```

### Maximum session occupancy and active session hosts

The following query returns the maximum session occupancy percent, session count, active session hosts percent, and active session host count per host pool, schedule name, schedule phase, and day:

```kusto
WVDAutoscaleEvaluationPooled
| where ResultType == "Succeeded"
| summarize max(SessionOccupancyPercent), max(SessionCount), max(ActiveSessionHostsPercent), max(ActiveSessionHostCount) by _ResourceId, bin(TimeGenerated, 1d), ConfigScheduleName, ConfigSchedulePhase
| order by _ResourceId asc, TimeGenerated asc, ConfigScheduleName, ConfigSchedulePhase asc
```
