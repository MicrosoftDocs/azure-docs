# Configure smart card redirection over the Remote Desktop Protocol

[!INCLUDE [include-rdp-shared-article](includes/include-rdp-shared-article.md)]

You can configure the redirection behavior of smart card devices from a local device to a remote session over the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

::: zone pivot="azure-virtual-desktop"
For Azure Virtual Desktop, we recommend you enable smart card redirection on your session hosts using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy, then control redirection using the host pool RDP properties.
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="windows-365"
For Windows 365, you can configure your Cloud PCs using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy.
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="dev-box"
For Microsoft Dev Box, you can configure your dev boxes using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy.
::: zone-end

This article provides information about the supported redirection methods and how to configure the redirection behavior for smart card devices. To learn more about how redirection works, see [Redirection over the Remote Desktop Protocol](redirection-remote-desktop-protocol.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you can configure smart card redirection, you need:

::: zone pivot="azure-virtual-desktop"
- An existing host pool with session hosts.

- A Microsoft Entra ID account that is assigned the [Desktop Virtualization Host Pool Contributor](rbac.md#desktop-virtualization-host-pool-contributor) built-in role-based access control (RBAC) roles on the host pool as a minimum. 
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="windows-365"
- An existing Cloud PC.
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="dev-box"
- An existing dev box.
::: zone-end

- A smart card device available on your local device.

- To configure Microsoft Intune, you need:

   - Microsoft Entra ID account that is assigned the [Policy and Profile manager](/mem/intune/fundamentals/role-based-access-control-reference#policy-and-profile-manager) built-in RBAC role.
   - A group containing the devices you want to configure.

- To configure Group Policy, you need:

   - A domain account that has permission to create or edit Group Policy objects.
   - A security group or organizational unit (OU) containing the devices you want to configure.

- You need to connect to a remote session from a supported app and platform. To view redirection support in Windows App and the Remote Desktop app, see [Compare Windows App features across platforms and devices](/windows-app/compare-platforms-features#redirection) and [Compare Remote Desktop app features across platforms and devices](compare-remote-desktop-clients.md#redirection).

## Smart card redirection

::: zone pivot="azure-virtual-desktop"
Configuration of a session host using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy, or setting an RDP property on a host pool governs the ability to redirect smart card devices from a local device to a remote session, which is subject to a priority order.

The default configuration is:

- **Windows operating system**: Smart card redirection isn't blocked.
- **Azure Virtual Desktop host pool RDP properties**: Smart card devices are redirected from the local device to the remote session.
- **Resultant default behavior**: Smart card devices are redirected from the local device to the remote session.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Take care when configuring redirection settings as the most restrictive setting is the resultant behavior. For example, if you disable smart card redirection on a session host with Microsoft Intune or Group Policy, but enable it with the host pool RDP property, redirection is disabled.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="windows-365"
Configuration of a Cloud PC governs the ability to redirect smart card devices from a local device to a remote session, and is set using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy.

The default configuration is:

- **Windows operating system**: Smart card redirection isn't blocked.
- **Windows 365**: Smart card redirection is enabled.
- **Resultant default behavior**: Smart card devices are redirected from the local device to the remote session.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="dev-box"
Configuration of a dev box governs the ability to redirect smart card devices from a local device to a remote session, and is set using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy.

The default configuration is:

- **Windows operating system**: Smart card redirection isn't blocked.
- **Microsoft Dev Box**: Smart card redirection is enabled.
- **Resultant default behavior**: Smart card devices are redirected from the local device to the remote session.

### Configure smart card device redirection using host pool RDP properties

The Azure Virtual Desktop host pool setting *smart card redirection* controls whether to redirect smart card from a local device to a remote session. The corresponding RDP property is `redirectsmartcards:i:<value>`. For more information, see [Supported RDP properties](rdp-properties.md#device-redirection).

To configure smart card redirection using host pool RDP properties:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. In the search bar, type *Azure Virtual Desktop* and select the matching service entry.

1. Select **Host pools**, then select the host pool you want to configure.

1. Select **RDP Properties**, then select **Device redirection**.

1. For **Smart card redirection**, select the drop-down list, then select one of the following options:

   - **The smart card device on the local computer is not available in remote session**
   - **The smart card device on the local computer is available in remote session** (*default*)
   - **Not configured**

1. Select **Save**.

1. To test the configuration, connect to a remote session, then use an application or website that requires your smart card. Verify that the smart card is available and works as expected.

## Test smart card redirection

To test smart card redirection:

1. Connect to a remote session using Window App or the Remote Desktop app on a platform that supports smart card redirection. For more information, see [Compare Windows App features across platforms and devices](/windows-app/compare-platforms-features#redirection) and [Compare Remote Desktop app features across platforms and devices](compare-remote-desktop-clients.md#redirection).

1. Check your smart cards are available in the remote session. Run the following command in the remote session in Command Prompt or from a PowerShell prompt.

   ```cmd
   certutil -scinfo
   ```

   If smart card redirection is working, the output starts similar to the following output:

   ```output
   The Microsoft Smart Card Resource Manager is running.
