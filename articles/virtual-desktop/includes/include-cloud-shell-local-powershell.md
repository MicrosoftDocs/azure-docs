1. Open [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview) in the Azure portal with the *PowerShell* terminal type, or run PowerShell on your local device.

   - If you're using PowerShell locally, first [sign in with Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/authenticate-azureps), and then make sure your [Azure context is set to the subscription that you want to use](/powershell/azure/context-persistence).
