# Get started with the Remote Desktop client

> [!TIP]
> To ensure a seamless experience, users are encouraged to download Windows App. Windows App is the gateway to securely connect to any devices or apps across Azure Virtual Desktop, Windows 365, and Microsoft Dev Box. For more information, see [What is Windows App](/windows-app/overview).

The Microsoft Remote Desktop client is used to connect to Azure Virtual Desktop to access your desktops and applications. This article shows you how to connect to Azure Virtual Desktop with the Remote Desktop client.

You can find a list of all the Remote Desktop clients at [Remote Desktop clients overview](remote-desktop-clients-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

Select a tab for the platform you're using.

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

Before you can connect to your devices and apps from Windows, you need:

- Internet access.

- A device running one of the following supported versions of Windows:
  - Windows 11
  - Windows 10
  - Windows Server 2022
  - Windows Server 2019
  - Windows Server 2016
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > - Support for Windows 7 ended on January 10, 2023.
   > - Support for Windows Server 2012 R2 ended on October 10, 2023.

- .NET Framework 4.6.2 or later. You may need to install this on Windows Server 2016, and some versions of Windows 10. To download the latest version, see [Download .NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework).

- [Download and install the Remote Desktop client](#download-and-install-the-remote-desktop-client-for-windows-msi) using the MSI installer.

### Download and install the Remote Desktop client for Windows (MSI)

Here's how to install the Remote Desktop client for Windows using the MSI installer. If you want to deploy the Remote Desktop client in an enterprise, you can use `msiexec` from the command line to install the MSI file. For more information, see [Enterprise deployment](client-features-windows.md#enterprise-deployment).

1. Download the Remote Desktop client installer, choosing the correct version for your device:

   - [Windows 64-bit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2139369) *(most common)*
   - [Windows 32-bit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2139456)
   - [Windows ARM64](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2139370)

1. Run the installer by double-clicking the file you downloaded.

1. On the welcome screen, select **Next**.

1. To accept the end-user license agreement, check the box for **I accept the terms in the License Agreement**, then select **Next**.

1. For the Installation Scope, select one of the following options:

   - **Install just for you**: Remote Desktop will be installed in a per-user folder and be available just for your user account. You don't need local Administrator privileges.
   - **Install for all users of this machine**: Remote Desktop will be installed in a per-machine folder and be available for all users. You must have local Administrator privileges

1. Select **Install**.

1. Once installation has completed, select **Finish**.

1. If you left the box for **Launch Remote Desktop when setup exits** selected, the Remote Desktop client will automatically open. Alternatively to launch the client after installation, use the Start menu to search for and select **Remote Desktop**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have the Remote Desktop client (MSI) and the Azure Virtual Desktop app from the Microsoft Store installed on the same device, you may see the message that begins **A version of this application called Azure Virtual Desktop was installed from the Microsoft Store**. Both apps are supported, and you have the option to choose **Continue anyway**, however it could be confusing to use the same remote resource across both apps. We recommend using only one version of the app at a time.

# [macOS](#tab/macos)

Before you can connect to your devices and apps from macOS, you need:
