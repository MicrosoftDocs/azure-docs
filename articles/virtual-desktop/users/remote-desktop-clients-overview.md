# Remote Desktop clients for Azure Virtual Desktop

With Microsoft Remote Desktop clients, you can connect to Azure Virtual Desktop and use and control desktops and apps that your admin has made available to you. There are clients available for many different types of devices on different platforms and form factors, such as desktops and laptops, tablets, smartphones, and through a web browser. Using your web browser on desktops and laptops, you can connect without having to download and install any software.

There are many features you can use to enhance your remote experience, such as:

- Multiple monitor support.
- Custom display resolutions.
- Dynamic display resolutions and scaling.
- Device redirection, such as webcams, storage devices, and printers.
- Microsoft Teams optimizations.

Some features are only available with certain clients, so it's important to check [Compare the features of the Remote Desktop clients](../compare-remote-desktop-clients.md?toc=%2Fazure%2Fvirtual-desktop%2Fusers%2Ftoc.json) to understand the differences when connecting to Azure Virtual Desktop.

> [!TIP]
> You can also use most versions of the Remote Desktop client to also connect to [Remote Desktop Services](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/welcome-to-rds) in Windows Server or to a remote PC, as well as to Azure Virtual Desktop. If you want information on Remote Desktop Services instead, see [Remote Desktop clients for Remote Desktop Services](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients).
