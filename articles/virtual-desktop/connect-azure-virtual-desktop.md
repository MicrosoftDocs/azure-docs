# Connect to Azure Virtual Desktop

Users can connect to their remote desktops and apps running in Azure Virtual Desktop using Windows App or the Remote Desktop client. Windows App and the Remote Desktop client are available on many different types of devices on different platforms and form factors, such as desktops and laptops, tablets, smartphones, through a web browser, and virtual reality headsets. This choice providing flexibility and convenience for users to access their resources from anywhere.

To connect to Azure Virtual Desktop, first users need to download and install Windows App or the Remote Desktop client on their device, then sign in with their user account for Azure Virtual Desktop. An administrator must have set up the resources and made them available to users.

Here's an introductory video for Windows App showing remote desktops and apps. It combines resources from Azure Virtual Desktop, Windows 365, and Microsoft Dev Box.<br /><br />
