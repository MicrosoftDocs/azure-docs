>If you encounter an issue when trying to deliver applications to Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts, you must verify whether it's unique to your approved partner. You can verify whether this is a unique issue by trying to reproduce it on [App attach overview](app-attach-overview.md). If you can't reproduce the issue on first-party app attach, then you must contact your client's provider for support.
