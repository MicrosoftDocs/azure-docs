# What's new in the Azure Virtual Desktop SxS Network Stack?

The Azure Virtual Desktop agent links your session hosts with the Azure Virtual Desktop service. It also includes a component called the SxS Network Stack. The Azure Virtual Desktop agent acts as the intermediate communicator between the service and the virtual machines, enabling connectivity. The SxS Network Stack component is required for users to securely establish reverse server-to-client connections.

The Azure Virtual Desktop SxS Network Stack is updated regularly. New versions of the Azure Virtual Desktop SxS Network Stack are installed automatically. When new versions are released, they're rolled out progressively to session hosts. This process is called *flighting* and it enables Microsoft to monitor the rollout in [validation environments](create-validation-host-pool.md) first.

A rollout might take several weeks before the agent is available in all environments. Some agent versions might not reach nonvalidation environments, so you might see multiple versions of the agent deployed across your environments.
