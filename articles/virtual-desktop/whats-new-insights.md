# What's new in Azure Virtual Desktop Insights?

This article describes the changes we make to each new version of Azure Virtual Desktop Insights.

If you're not sure which version of Azure Virtual Desktop Insights you're currently using, you can find it in the bottom-right corner of your **Insights** page or configuration workbook. To access your workbook, go to [https://aka.ms/azmonwvdi](https://aka.ms/azmonwvdi).

## Latest available version

The following table shows the latest available version of Azure Virtual Desktop Insights.

| Release | Latest version | Setup instructions |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Public | 4.3.1 | [Use Azure Virtual Desktop Insights to monitor your deployment](insights.md) |

## How to read version numbers

There are three numbers in each version of Azure Virtual Desktop Insights. Here's what each number means:

- The first number is the major version, and is usually used for major releases.

- The second number is the minor version. Minor versions are for backwards-compatible changes such as new features and deprecation notices.

- The third number is the patch version, which is used for small changes that fix incorrect behavior or bugs.

For example, a release with a version number of 1.2.31 is on the first major release, the second minor release, and patch number 31.

When one of the numbers is increased, all numbers after it must change, too. One release has one version number. However, not all version numbers track releases. Patch numbers can be somewhat arbitrary, for example.
