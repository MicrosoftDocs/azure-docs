# Configure audio and video redirection over the Remote Desktop Protocol

[!INCLUDE [include-rdp-shared-article](includes/include-rdp-shared-article.md)]

You can configure the redirection behavior of audio peripherals, such as microphones and speakers, between a local device and a remote session over the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

::: zone pivot="azure-virtual-desktop"
For Azure Virtual Desktop, we recommend you enable audio and video redirection on your session hosts using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy, then control redirection using the host pool RDP properties.
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="windows-365"
For Windows 365, you can configure your Cloud PCs using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy.
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="dev-box"
For Microsoft Dev Box, you can configure your dev boxes using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy.
::: zone-end

This article provides information about the supported redirection methods and how to configure the redirection behavior for audio and video peripherals. To learn more about how redirection works, see [Redirection over the Remote Desktop Protocol](redirection-remote-desktop-protocol.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you can configure audio and video redirection, you need:

::: zone pivot="azure-virtual-desktop"
- An existing host pool with session hosts.

- A Microsoft Entra ID account that is assigned the [Desktop Virtualization Host Pool Contributor](rbac.md#desktop-virtualization-host-pool-contributor) built-in role-based access control (RBAC) roles on the host pool as a minimum. 
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="windows-365"
- An existing Cloud PC.
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="dev-box"
- An existing dev box.
::: zone-end

- An audio device you can use to test the redirection configuration.

- To configure Microsoft Intune, you need:

   - Microsoft Entra ID account that is assigned the [Policy and Profile manager](/mem/intune/fundamentals/role-based-access-control-reference#policy-and-profile-manager) built-in RBAC role.
   - A group containing the devices you want to configure.

- To configure Group Policy, you need:

   - A domain account that has permission to create or edit Group Policy objects.
   - A security group or organizational unit (OU) containing the devices you want to configure.

- You need to connect to a remote session from a supported app and platform. To view redirection support in Windows App and the Remote Desktop app, see [Compare Windows App features across platforms and devices](/windows-app/compare-platforms-features#redirection) and [Compare Remote Desktop app features across platforms and devices](compare-remote-desktop-clients.md#redirection).

## Configure audio output redirection

::: zone pivot="azure-virtual-desktop"
Audio output redirection controls where audio signals from the remote session are played. Configuration of a session host or setting an RDP property on a host pool governs the ability to play audio from a remote session, which is subject to a priority order.

Session host configuration controls whether audio and video playback redirection is enabled together with the audio playback quality and is set using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy. A host pool RDP property controls whether to play audio and the audio output location over the Remote Desktop Protocol.

The default configuration is:

- **Windows operating system**: Audio and video playback redirection isn't blocked.
- **Azure Virtual Desktop host pool RDP properties**: Play sounds on the local computer.
- **Resultant default behavior**: Audio is redirected to the local computer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Take care when configuring redirection settings as the most restrictive setting is the resultant behavior. For example, if you disable audio and video playback redirection on a session host with Microsoft Intune or Group Policy, but enable it with the host pool RDP property, redirection is disabled. 

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="windows-365"
Audio output redirection controls where audio signals from the remote session are played. Configuration of a Cloud PC governs the ability to play audio from a remote session and controls the audio playback quality. You can configure audio output redirection using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy.

The default configuration is:

- **Windows operating system**: Audio and video playback redirection isn't blocked.
- **Windows 365**: Audio and video playback redirection is enabled.
- **Resultant default behavior**: Audio is redirected to the local computer.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="dev-box"
Audio output redirection controls where audio signals from the remote session are played. Configuration of a dev box governs the ability to play audio from a remote session and controls the audio playback quality. You can configure audio output redirection using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy.

The default configuration is:

- **Windows operating system**: Audio and video playback redirection isn't blocked.
- **Microsoft Dev Box**: Audio and video playback redirection is enabled.
- **Resultant default behavior**: Audio is redirected to the local computer.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="azure-virtual-desktop"
### Configure the audio output location using host pool RDP properties

The Azure Virtual Desktop host pool setting *audio output location* controls whether to play audio from remote session in the remote session, redirected to the local device, or disable audio. The corresponding RDP property is `audiomode:i:<value>`. For more information, see [Supported RDP properties](rdp-properties.md#device-redirection).

To configure the audio output location using host pool RDP properties:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. In the search bar, type *Azure Virtual Desktop* and select the matching service entry.

1. Select **Host pools**, then select the host pool you want to configure.

1. Select **RDP Properties**, then select **Device redirection**.

1. For **Audio output location**, select the drop-down list, then select one of the following options:

   - **Play sounds on the local computer** (*default*)
   - **Play sounds on the remote computer**
   - **Do not play sounds**
   - **Not configured**

1. Select **Save**.

1. To test the configuration, connect to a remote session and play audio. Verify that you can hear audio as expected. Make sure you're not using Microsoft Teams or a web page that's redirected with [multimedia redirection](multimedia-redirection-video-playback-calls.md) for this test.

## Configure audio capture redirection

::: zone pivot="azure-virtual-desktop"
Audio recording redirection controls whether you want to allow peripherals such as a microphone to be accessible in the remote session.

The default configuration is:

- **Windows operating system**: Audio recording redirection isn't blocked.
- **Azure Virtual Desktop host pool RDP properties**: Not configured.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Take care when configuring redirection settings as the most restrictive setting is the resultant behavior. For example, if you disable audio recording redirection on a session host with Microsoft Intune or Group Policy, but enable it with the host pool RDP property, redirection is disabled.

### Optional: Disable audio input redirection on a local device

You can disable audio input redirection on a local device to prevent audio input from being redirected from a local device to a remote session. This method is useful if you want to enable audio input redirection for most users, but disable it for specific devices.

For iOS/iPadOS and Android devices, you can disable audio input redirection using Intune. For more information, see [Configure client device redirection settings for Windows App and the Remote Desktop app using Microsoft Intune](client-device-redirection-intune.md).
