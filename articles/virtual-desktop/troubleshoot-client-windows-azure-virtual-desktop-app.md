## Azure Virtual Desktop Store app is not updating

The Azure Virtual Desktop Store app is downloaded and automatically updated through the Microsoft Store.

You can go to the [Microsoft Store to check for updates](https://aka.ms/AVDStoreClient), or you can also manually search for new updates from the app. For more information, see [Update the Azure Virtual Desktop app](users/client-features-windows-azure-virtual-desktop-app.md#update-the-azure-virtual-desktop-app).
