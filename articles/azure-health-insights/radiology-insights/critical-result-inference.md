# CriticalResultInference


[Back to overview of RI Inferences](inferences.md)


The `kind` is `criticalResult`. This inference is created for a new medical problem that requires attention within a specific time frame.

Example of a critical result, without token extensions:

```json
{
	"kind": "criticalResult",
	"result": {
		"description": "MALIGNANCY",
		"finding": {
			"id": "2428",
			"code": {

					}
				]
			},

The `result.description` field provides a description of the medical problem, for example, "MALIGNANCY". The possible values of `result.description` are listed in the [Appendix](#appendix-possible-values-of-resultdescription).
The `result.finding` field, if set, contains the same information as the `finding` field in a finding inference (see [finding inference](finding-inference.md).)  
In addition to token extensions, there can be an extension for a section. It represents the most specific section that contains the first token of the critical result (or, more precisely, the first token that is in a section). The section is in the same format as a finding section (see [finding inference](finding-inference.md)).
