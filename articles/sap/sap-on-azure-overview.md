# What SAP on Azure offerings are available?

There are multiple Microsoft Azure offerings for running and managing your SAP systems. These offerings range from traditional Azure virtual machine (VM) offerings, to top-level Azure services, to tools that integrate with other Azure services or external products.

## SAP on Azure VM workloads

You can run SAP workloads on the Azure platform using different Azure Virtual Machines (Azure VMs) offerings. Azure is [certified for multiple SAP products](workloads/certifications.md), including SAP HANA and SAP NetWeaver products. 

For more information, see the [SAP on Azure VM workloads](workloads/get-started.md) documentation.

### SAP Integration with Microsoft Services

In addition to the capabilities to run SAP IaaS and SaaS workloads on Azure, Microsoft offers various capabilities, scenarios, best-practice guides, and tutorials to integrate SAP workloads running anywhere with other Microsoft products and services. Among them are popular services such as Microsoft Entra ID, Exchange Online, Power Platform and Power BI, Azure Integration Services, Excel, SAP Business Technology Platform, SAP Analytics Cloud, SAP Data Warehouse Cloud, and SAP Success Factors to name a few.
