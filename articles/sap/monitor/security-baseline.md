# Security baseline for Azure Monitor for SAP solutions

This security baseline applies guidance from the Microsoft cloud security benchmark version 1.0. The Microsoft cloud security benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. 

You can monitor this security baseline and its recommendations using Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Azure Policy definitions are listed in the Regulatory Compliance section of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud dashboard.

When a feature has relevant Azure Policy Definitions, they're listed in this baseline to help you measure compliance with the Microsoft cloud security benchmark controls and recommendations. Some recommendations can require a paid Microsoft Defender plan to enable certain security scenarios.

When Azure Monitor for SAP solutions is deployed, a managed resource group is deployed with it. 
This managed resource group contains services such as Azure Log Analytics, Azure Functions, Azure Storage, and Azure Key Vault.
