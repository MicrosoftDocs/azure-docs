## Open a Windows port

Open the Windows port in the local firewall of SQL Server and the network security group where SQL Server and Azure Monitor for SAP solutions exist. The default port is 1433.

## Configure SQL Server

Configure SQL Server to accept sign-ins from Windows and SQL Server:

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio.
1. Open **Server Properties** > **Security** > **Authentication**.
1. Select **SQL Server and Windows authentication mode**.
1. Select **OK** to save your changes.
1. Restart SQL Server to complete the changes.

## Create Azure Monitor for SAP solutions user for SQL Server

Create a user for Azure Monitor for SAP solutions to sign in to SQL Server by using the following script. Make sure to replace:

You can replace the example information for the Azure Monitor for SAP solutions user with any other SQL username.

```sql
USE [<Database to monitor>]
DROP USER [AMS]
GO
USE [master]
DROP USER [AMS]
DROP LOGIN [AMS]
GO
CREATE LOGIN [AMS] WITH 
    PASSWORD=N'<password>', 
    DEFAULT_DATABASE=[<Database to monitor>], 
    DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=[us_english], 
    CHECK_EXPIRATION=OFF, 
    CHECK_POLICY=OFF
CREATE USER AMS FOR LOGIN AMS
ALTER ROLE [db_datareader] ADD MEMBER [AMS]
ALTER ROLE [db_denydatawriter] ADD MEMBER [AMS]
GRANT CONNECT TO AMS
GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO AMS
GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO AMS
GRANT EXEC ON xp_readerrorlog TO AMS
GO
USE [<Database to monitor>]
CREATE USER [AMS] FOR LOGIN [AMS]
ALTER ROLE [db_datareader] ADD MEMBER [AMS]
ALTER ROLE [db_denydatawriter] ADD MEMBER [AMS]
GO
```
