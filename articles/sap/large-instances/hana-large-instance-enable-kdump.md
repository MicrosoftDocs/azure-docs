# kdump for SAP HANA on Azure Large Instances

In this article, we'll walk through enabling the kdump service on Azure HANA Large
Instances (HLI) **Type I and Type II**.

Configuring and enabling kdump is needed to troubleshoot system crashes that don't have a clear cause. Sometimes a system crash cannot be explained by a hardware or infrastructure problem. In such cases, an operating system or application may have caused the problem. kdump will allow SUSE to determine the reason for the system crash.

## Prerequisites

- The kdump service uses the `/var/crash` directory to write dumps. Make sure the partition corresponding to this directory has sufficient space to accommodate dumps.

## Setup details

- The script to enable kdump can be found in the [Azure sap-hana-tools on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/sap-hana-tools/blob/master/tools/enable-kdump.sh)

> [!NOTE]
> This script is made based on our lab setup. You will need to contact your OS vendor for any further tuning.
> A separate logical unit number (LUN) will be provisioned for new and existing servers for saving the dumps. A script will take care of configuring the file system out of the LUN.
> Microsoft won't be responsible for analyzing the dump. You will need to open a ticket with your OS vendor to have it analyzed.

- Run this script on your HANA Large Instance by using the following command:

    > [!NOTE]
    > Sudo privileges are needed to run this command.

    ```bash
    sudo bash enable-kdump.sh
    ```

- If the command's output shows kdump is successfully enabled, reboot the system to apply the changes.

- If the command's output shows an operation failed, then the kdump service isn't enabled. Refer to a following section, [Support issues](#support-issues).

## Test kdump

> [!NOTE]
>  The following operation will trigger a kernel crash and system reboot.

- Trigger a kernel crash

    ```bash
    echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
    ```

- After the system reboots successfully, check the `/var/crash` directory for kernel crash logs.

- If the `/var/crash` has a directory with the current date, kdump is successfully enabled.

## Support issues

If the script fails with an error, or kdump isn't enabled, raise a service request with the Microsoft support team. Include the following details:

* HLI subscription ID

* Server name

* OS vendor

* OS version

* Kernel version
