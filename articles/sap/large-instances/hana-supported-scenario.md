# Supported scenarios for HANA Large Instances
This article describes the supported scenarios and architectural details for HANA Large Instances (HLI).

>[!NOTE]
>If your scenario isn't mentioned in this article, contact the Microsoft Service Management team to assess your requirements.
Before you set up the HLI unit, validate the design with SAP or your service implementation partner.

## Terms and definitions
Let's understand the terms and definitions used in this article:

- **SID**: A system identifier for the HANA system.
- **HLI**: Hana Large Instances.
- **DR**: Disaster recovery (DR).
- **Normal DR**: A system setup with a dedicated resource for DR purposes only.
- **Multipurpose DR**: A DR site system that's configured to use a non-production environment alongside a production instance that's configured for a DR event. 
- **Single-SID**: A system with one instance installed.
- **Multi-SID**: A system with multiple instances configured; also called an MCOS environment.
- **HSR**: SAP HANA system replication.

## Overview
HANA Large Instances support various architectures to help you accomplish your business requirements. The following sections cover the architectural scenarios and their configuration details. 

The derived architectural designs are purely from an infrastructure perspective. Consult SAP or your implementation partners for the HANA deployment. If your scenarios aren't listed in this article, contact the Microsoft account team to review the architecture and derive a solution for you.

> [!NOTE]
> These architectures are fully compliant with Tailored Data Integration (TDI) design and are supported by SAP.

This article describes the details of the two components in each supported architecture:

- Ethernet
- Storage

### Ethernet

Each provisioned server comes preconfigured with sets of Ethernet interfaces. The Ethernet interfaces configured on each HLI unit are categorized into four types:

- **A**: Used for or by client access.
- **B**: Used for node-to-node communication. This interface is configured on all servers no matter what topology you request. However, it's used only for scale-out scenarios.
- **C**: Used for node-to-storage connectivity.
- **D**: Used for node-to-iSCSI device connection for fencing setup. This interface is configured only when an HSR setup is requested.  

| NIC logical interface | SKU type | Name with SUSE OS | Name with RHEL OS | Use case|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | TYPE I | eth0.tenant | eno1.tenant | Client-to-HLI |
| B | TYPE I | eth2.tenant | eno3.tenant | Node-to-node|
| C | TYPE I | eth1.tenant | eno2.tenant | Node-to-storage |
| D | TYPE I | eth4.tenant | eno4.tenant | Fencing |
| A | TYPE II | vlan\<tenantNo> | team0.tenant | Client-to-HLI |
| B | TYPE II | vlan\<tenantNo+2> | team0.tenant+2 | Node-to-node|
| C | TYPE II | vlan\<tenantNo+1> | team0.tenant+1 | Node-to-storage |
| D | TYPE II | vlan\<tenantNo+3> | team0.tenant+3 | Fencing |

You choose the interface based on the topology that's configured on the HLI unit. For example, interface “B” is set up for node-to-node communication, which is useful when you have a scale-out topology configured. This interface isn't used for single node scale-up configurations. For more information about interface usage, review your required scenarios (later in this article). 

If necessary, you can define more NIC cards on your own. However, the configurations of existing NICs *can't* be changed.

>[!NOTE]
>You might find additional interfaces that are physical interfaces or bonding. 
Consider only the previously mentioned interfaces for your use case. Ignore any others.

The distribution for units with two assigned IP addresses should look as follows:

- Ethernet “A” should have an assigned IP address that's within the server IP pool address range that you submitted to Microsoft. This IP address should be maintained in the */etc/hosts* directory of the operating system (OS).

- Ethernet “C” should have an assigned IP address that's used for communication to NFS. You *don't* need to maintain this address in the *etc/hosts* directory to allow instance-to-instance traffic within the tenant.

For HANA system replication or HANA scale-out deployment, a blade configuration with two assigned IP addresses isn't suitable. If you have only two assigned IP addresses, and you want to deploy such a configuration, contact SAP HANA on Azure Service Management. They can assign you a third IP address in a third VLAN. For HANA Large Instances with three assigned IP addresses on three NIC ports, the following usage rules apply:

- Ethernet “A” should have an assigned IP address that's outside of the server IP pool address range that you submitted to Microsoft. This IP address shouldn't be maintained in the *etc/hosts* directory of the OS.

- Ethernet “B” should be maintained exclusively in the *etc/hosts* directory for communication between the various instances. Maintain these IP addresses in scale-out HANA configurations as the IP addresses that HANA uses for the inter-node configuration.

- Ethernet “C” should have an assigned IP address that's used for communication to NFS storage. This type of address shouldn't be maintained in the *etc/hosts* directory.

- Ethernet “D” should be used exclusively for access to fencing devices for Pacemaker. This interface is required when you configure HANA system replication and want to achieve auto failover of the operating system by using an SBD-based device.


### Storage
Storage is preconfigured based on the requested topology. The volume sizes and mount points vary depending on the number of servers and SKUs, and the configured topology. For more information, review your required scenarios (later in this article). If you require more storage, you can purchase it in 1-TB increments.

>[!NOTE]
>The mount point /usr/sap/\<SID> is a symbolic link to the /hana/shared mount point.

### Storage
The following mount points are preconfigured:

| Mount point | Use case | 
| --- | --- |
|**On the primary node**|
|/hana/shared | HANA installation for production SID | 
|/hana/data/SID/mnt00001 | Data files installation for production SID | 
|/hana/log/SID/mnt00001 | Log files installation for production SID | 
|/hana/logbackups/SID | Redo logs for production SID |
|**On the DR node**|
|/hana/shared | HANA installation for production SID | 
|/hana/data/SID/mnt00001 | Data files installation for production SID | 
|/hana/log/SID/mnt00001 | Log files installation for production SID | 


### Key considerations
- /usr/sap/SID is a symbolic link to /hana/shared/SID.
-  At the DR site: The volumes and mount points are configured (marked as “Required for HANA installation”) for the production HANA instance installation at the DR HLI unit. 
- At the DR site: The data, log backups, and shared volumes (marked as “Storage Replication”) are replicated via snapshot from the production site. These volumes are mounted during failover only. For more information, see [Disaster recovery failover procedure](./hana-overview-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md). 
- The boot volume for *SKU Type I class* is replicated to the DR node.


## Single node with DR using HSR
 
This topology supports one node in a scale-up configuration with one SID, with HANA system replication to the DR site for a primary SID. In the diagram, only a single-SID system is shown at the primary site, but multi-SID (MCOS) systems are supported as well.

### Architecture diagram

|/hana/log/SID/mnt00001 | Log files installation for SID | 
|/hana/logbackups/SID | Redo logs for SID |


### Key considerations
- /usr/sap/SID is a symbolic link to /hana/shared/SID.
- For MCOS: Volume size distribution is based on the database size in memory. To learn what database sizes in memory are supported in a multi-SID environment, see [Overview and architecture](./hana-overview-architecture.md).
- The primary node syncs with the DR node by using HANA system replication. 
- [Global Reach](../../expressroute/expressroute-global-reach.md) is used to link the ExpressRoute circuits together to make a private network between your regional networks.



## Single node HSR to DR (cost optimized) 
 
 This topology supports one node in a scale-up configuration with one SID. HANA system replication to the DR site is used for a primary SID. In the diagram, only a single-SID system is shown at the primary site, but multi-SID (MCOS) systems are supported as well. At the DR site, an HLI unit is used for the QA instance. Production operations run from the primary site. During DR failover (or failover test), the QA instance at the DR site is taken down.
