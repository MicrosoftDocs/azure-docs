# Monitor SAP system from Azure portal 



In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to monitor the health and status of your SAP system with *Azure Center for SAP solutions* through the Azure portal. The following capabilities are available for your *Virtual Instance for SAP solutions* resource:

- Monitor your SAP system, along with its instances and VMs.
- Analyze important SAP infrastructure metrics.
- Create and/or register an instance of Azure Monitor for SAP solutions to monitor SAP platform metrics.

## System health

The *health* of an SAP system within Azure Center for SAP solutions is based on the status of its underlying instances. Codes for health are also determined by the collective impact of these instances on the performance of the SAP system.

Possible values for health are:

- **Healthy**: the system is healthy.
- **Unhealthy**: the system is unhealthy.
- **Degraded**: the system shows signs of degradation and possible failure.
- **Unknown**: the health of the system is unknown.

## System status

The *status* of an SAP system within Azure Center for SAP solutions indicates the current state of the system. 

Possible values for status are:

- **Running**: the system is running.
- **Offline**: the system is offline.
- **Partially running**: the system is partially running.
- **Unavailable**: the system is unavailable.

## Instance properties

When you [check the health or status of your SAP system in the Azure portal](#check-health-and-status), the results for each instance are listed and color-coded.

### Color-coding for states

For ASCS and application server instances:

| Color code   | Status      | Health      |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Green        | Running     | Healthy     |
| Yellow       | Running     | Degraded    |
| Red          | Running     | Unhealthy   | 
| Gray         | Unavailable | Unknown     |

For database instances:

| Color code      | Status      |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Green           | Running     |
| Yellow          | Unavailable |
| Red             | Unavailable |
| Gray            | Unavailable |

### Example scenarios

The following are different scenarios with the corresponding status and health values.

| Application instance state | ASCS instance state     | System status | System health |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Running and healthy        | Running and healthy     | Running       | Healthy       |
| Running and degraded       | Running and healthy     | Running       | Degraded      |
| Running and unhealthy      | Running and healthy     | Running       | Unhealthy     |

## Health and status codes

When you [check the health or status of your SAP system in the Azure portal](#check-health-and-status), these values are displayed with corresponding symbols.

Depending on the type of instance, there are different color-coded scenarios with different status and health outcomes.

For ASCS and application server instances, the following color-coding applies:

## Troubleshooting issues with Health and Status on VIS
If an error appears on a successfully registered or deployed Virtual Instance for SAP solutions resource indicating that service is unable to fetch health and status data, then use the guidance provided here to fix problem.

### Error - Unable to fetch health and status data from primary SAP Central services VM
**Possible causes:** 
1. The SAP central services VM might not be running.
2. The monitoring VM extension might not be running or encountered an unexpected failure on the central services VM.
3. The storage account in the managed resource group isn't reachable from the Central service VM(s) or the storage account or underlying container/blob required by the monitoring service may have been deleted.
4. The Central Service VM(s) system assigned managed identity doesn't have ‘Storage Blob Data Owner’ access on the managed RG or this managed identity may have been disabled.
5. The sapstartsrv process might not be running for the SAP instance or for SAP hostctrl agent on the primary Central service VM.
6. The monitoring VM extension couldn't execute the script to fetch health and status information due to policies or restrictions in place on the VM.

**Solution:** 
1. If the SAP Central services VM is not running, then bring up the virtual machine and SAP services on the VM. Once this is done, wait for a few minutes and check if the Health and Status shows up on the VIS resource.
2. Navigate to the SAP Central Services VM on Azure Portal and check if the status of **Microsoft.Workloads.MonitoringExtension** on the Extensions + applications tab shows **Provisioning Succeeded**. If not, raise a support ticket.
3. Navigate to the VIS resource and go to the Managed Resource Group from the Essentials section on Overview. Check if a Storage Account exists in this resource group. If it exists, then check if your virtual network allows connectivity from the SAP central services VM to this storage account. Enable connectivity if needed. If the storage account doesn't exist, then you will have to delete the VIS resource and register the system again.
4. Check if the SAP central services VM system assigned managed identity has the ‘Storage Blob Data Owner’ access on the managed resource group of the VIS. If not, provide the necessary access. If the system assigned managed identity doesn't exist, then you will have to delete the VIS and re-register the system.
5. Ensure sapstartsrv process for the SAP instance and SAP Hostctrl is running on the Central Services VM.
6. If everything mentioned above is in place, then log a support ticket.

### Error - Database status showed **unavailable** on the Azure portal. 
**Possible causes:** 
The database list has not been passed on to the HnS script args. This results in the database status to be shown as unavailable.  

This can happen in 2 scenarios: 
- SID of Database and HANA instance is not same. This would lead to db details not being discovered in the Discovery Workflow. 
- You have multi-db cluster which will also result in this error.

**Solution:**

- Ensure HANA instance and its database mapped to same SID
