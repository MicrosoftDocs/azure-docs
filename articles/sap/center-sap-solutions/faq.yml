  This article answers commonly asked questions about Azure Center for SAP solutions.

sections: 
  - name: General 
    questions: 
      - question:  What capabilities do you gain with Azure Center for SAP solutions?
        answer: | 
                Before the availability of Azure Center for SAP solutions, customers relied on documentation and frameworks to help them set up system architecture. 
                Then they had to figure out how to access the VMs to install SAP. With Azure Center for SAP solutions, customers can deploy SAP by using a 
                guided experience that streamlines their ability to select and configure resources. When a customer deploys or 
                registers an existing SAP system, Azure Center for SAP solutions creates a logical representation of the system, or a Virtual Instance for SAP solutions (VIS). 
                The VIS unlocks management capabilities, such as the ability to run quality checks and to manage and monitor the 
                system at the SAP layer as well as the virtual machine (VM) layer.

      - question:  Will Azure Center for SAP solutions replace other services such as Azure Monitor for SAP solutions?
        answer: | 
                No. Azure Center for SAP solutions brings Azure services together into a unified experience for deploying 
                and managing SAP workloads on Azure. Customers can choose to use other Azure services, such as Azure 
                Monitor for SAP solutions, independently or in an integrated manner with Azure Center for SAP solutions.
                Azure Monitor for SAP solutions is an Azure-native monitoring product for customers running SAP 
                landscapes on Azure. This product helps you collect data from Azure infrastructure and databases in one 
                central location and visually correlate the data for faster troubleshooting.

      - question:  What are the pricing and licensing implications?

        answer: |
                Here are the pre-requisites for registering existing SAP systems as a Virtual Instance for SAP (VIS) resource. More details can be found in the [product documentation](/azure/sap/center-sap-solutions/register-existing-system#prerequisites).

                - Appropriate role access on the Azure subscription or resource groups where you have the SAP system resources.  
                    - *Azure Center for SAP solutions administrator* and *Managed Identity Operator* or equivalent role access. 
                    - A *User-assigned managed identity* that has *Azure Center for SAP solutions service role* access on the Compute and Storage resource groups and *Reader role* access on the Virtual Network resource group of the SAP system. Azure Center for SAP solutions service uses this identity to discover your SAP system resources and register the system as a VIS resource. 
                - Make sure ASCS, Application Server, and Database virtual machines of the SAP system are in Running state. 
                - sapcontrol and saphostctrl exe files on ASCS, App server and Database.  
                - Confirm the sapstartsrv process is running on all SAP instances and for SAP hostctrl agent on all the VMs in the SAP system.

  - name: Deploying New SAP System Questions
    questions: 

      - question:  What are the prerequisites to deploy a new SAP system with Azure Center for SAP solutions?
        answer: |
                Here are prerequisites to deploy a new SAP system with Azure Center for SAP solutions and create a VIS. For more information, see the [deployment guide](deploy-s4hana.md).

                - Appropriate role access.  
                    - You need an Azure account with *Azure Center for SAP solutions administrator* and *Managed Identity Operator* or equivalent role access to the subscription in which you'll deploy the new system. 
                - A *User-assigned managed identity* which has *Azure Center for SAP solutions service role* access on the Subscription or all resource groups (Compute, Network, Storage). If you wish to install SAP Software through Azure Center for SAP solutions, provide *Reader and Data Access role* to the identity on SAP software storage account where you would store the SAP Media. 
                - An existing virtual network that allows outbound internet connectivity from the Virtual Machines even when they are behind a standard Azure load balancer, where you will deploy your new SAP system.  
                - Register Appropriate resource providers that you have registered. (Compute, Network, Storage, Workloads, Capacity). 
                - Sufficient virtual machine quota in the region(s) used for the deployment. Additionally, minimum 4 cores of Standard_D4ds_v4 or Standard_E4s_v3 SKU are required for the deployment to succeed. 
                
      - question:  What resources are created in customer’s subscription when you deploy an SAP S/4/HANA system through Azure Center for SAP solutions?
        answer: | 
                When you deploy and install an SAP S/4/HANA system with ACSS, ACSS creates the following logical Azure resources: 
                - Virtual Instance for SAP solutions                
                - Central service instance for SAP solutions
                - App server instance for SAP solutions
                - Database for SAP solutions
                
                ACSS also creates Azure resources that are required to run the SAP S/4HANA system in the application resource group. These include virtual machines and storage. Customers can create a separate transport resource group if required. 
                
                Along with these resources, ACSS creates a Managed resource group containing a storage account and key vault. ACSS uses the Managed resource group to enable the SAP management capabilities. 

      - question:  How do I log on to an SAP system after deploying it from ACSS? 
        answer: | 
                Once you have deployed and installed an SAP S/4/HANA system through ACSS, you can use the [SAP master password](/azure/sap/center-sap-solutions/manage-virtual-instance#find-sap-and-hana-passwords) and HANA database [username](/azure/sap/center-sap-solutions/manage-virtual-instance#connect-to-hana-database) and password available in the Managed resource group key vault to log on to the SAP GUI or and connect to the SAP HANA database.  

      - question:  How do I find the instance number(s) for SAP instances deployed through ACSS? 
        answer: | 
                Please refer to [the documentation here](/azure/sap/center-sap-solutions/manage-virtual-instance#default-instance-numbers) to understand the instance numbers configured through ACSS. Please note instance numbers are currently not configurable. 

  - name: Management and Miscellaneous Questions 
    questions: 

      - question:  Do Start and Stop operations on Virtual Instance for SAP solutions resource also start or stop the underlying virtual machines?
        answer: | 
                No. Start and Stop operations on the Virtual Instance for SAP solutions resource do not impact the virtual machine running state. The same is true for Start and Stop on the underlying child resources, such as the Central service instance and Application server instance. To start SAP, the underlying VMs for that SAP system must be running. 

      - question:  What resources are available to learn more? 
        answer: | 
                Customers and partners can find more information at Microsoft Learn: https://learn.microsoft.com and [SAP on Azure Resources page](/users/lannateh-3810/collections/7rysj5w2007dn?wt.mc_id=saponazurecta_collections_webpage_azuremktg_csainfra)


      - question:  What is the SLA for this service?
        answer: | 
                Because ACSS is available at no additional cost, it is not eligible for an SLA. Standard SLAs apply to any other services that are deployed or enabled through Azure Center for SAP solutions.
