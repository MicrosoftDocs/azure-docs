# Get quality checks and insights for a Virtual Instance for SAP solutions



The *Quality Insights* Azure workbook in *Azure Center for SAP solutions* provides insights about the SAP system resources as a result of running *more than 100 quality checks on the VIS*. The feature is part of the monitoring capabilities built in to the *Virtual Instance for SAP solutions (VIS)*. These quality checks make sure that your SAP system uses Azure and SAP best practices for reliability and performance. 

In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to use quality checks and insights to get more information about various configurations within your SAP system.

## Prerequisites

- An SAP system that you've [created with Azure Center for SAP solutions](deploy-s4hana.md) or [registered with Azure Center for SAP solutions](register-existing-system.md). 

## Open Quality Insights workbook

To open the workbook:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for and select **Azure Center for SAP solutions** in the Azure portal search bar.
1. On the **Azure Center for SAP solutions** page's sidebar menu, select **Virtual Instances for SAP solutions**.
1. On the **Virtual Instances for SAP solutions** page, select the VIS that you want to get insights about.

1. On the sidebar menu for the VIS, under **Monitoring** select **Quality Insights**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/get-quality-checks-insights/quality-insights.png" lightbox="media/get-quality-checks-insights/quality-insights.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal, showing the Quality Insights workbook page selected in the sidebar menu for a virtual Instance for SAP solutions.":::

There are multiple sections in the workbook:
- Select the default **Advisor Recommendations** tab to [see the list of recommendations made by Azure Center for SAP solutions for the different instances in your VIS](#get-advisor-recommendations)
- Select the **Virtual Machine** tab to [find information about the VMs in your VIS](#get-vm-information)
- Select the **Configuration Checks** tab to [see configuration checks for your VIS](#run-configuration-checks)

## Get Advisor Recommendations

The **Quality checks** feature in Azure Center for SAP solutions runs validation checks for all VIS resources. These quality checks validate the SAP system configurations follow the best practices recommended for SAP on Azure. If a VIS doesn't follow these best practices, you receive a recommendation from Azure Advisor.
Azure Center for SAP solutions runs more than 100 quality checks on all VIS resources. These checks span across the following categories: 

- Azure Infrastructure checks
- OS parameter checks.
- High availability (HA) Load Balancer checks
- HANA DB file system checks.
- OS parameter checks for ANF file system.
- Pacemaker configuration checks for HANA DB and ASCS Instance for SUSE and Red Hat 
- OS Configuration checks for Application Instances

The table in the **Advisor Recommendations** tab shows all the recommendations for ASCS, Application, and Database instances in the VIS.

Select an instance name to see all recommendations, including which action to take to resolve an issue.

:::image type="content" source="media/get-quality-checks-insights/recommendation-detail.png" lightbox="media/get-quality-checks-insights/recommendation-detail.png" alt-text="Screenshot of detailed advisor recommendations for an instance and which actions to take to resolve each issue.":::

### Set Alerts for Quality check recommendations
As the Quality checks recommendations in Azure Center for SAP solutions are integrated with *Azure Advisor*, you can set alerts for the recommendations. See how to [Configure alerts for recommendations.](/azure/advisor/advisor-alerts-portal)

> [!NOTE]
> These quality checks run on all VIS instances at a regular frequency of once every 1 hour. The corresponding recommendations in Azure Advisor also refresh at the same 1-hour frequency.If you take action on one or more recommendations from Azure Center for SAP solutions, wait for the next refresh to see any new recommendations from Azure Advisor.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Advisor filters out recommendations for Deleted Azure resources for 7 days. Therefore, if you delete a VIS and then re-register it, you will be able to see Advisor recommendations after 7 days of re-registration. 



## Get VM information

The **Virtual Machine** tab provides insights about the VMs in your VIS. There are multiple subsections:

- [Azure Compute](#azure-compute)
- [Compute List](#compute-list)
- [Compute Extensions](#compute-extensions)
- [Compute + OS Disk](#compute--os-disk)
- [Compute + Data Disks](#compute--data-disks)

### Azure Compute

The **Azure Compute** tab shows summarized information regarding the virtual machines inside the VIS. It starts with a visual signifying the VM running status for all VMs.

It also shows the current availability state of VMs along with corresponding reasons for unavailability. This visual is followed by a list of key health events that occurred in the last 14 days in any of the VMs of the VIS. 

### Compute List

The **Compute List** tab shows a table of information about the VMs inside the VIS. This information includes the VM's name and state, SKU, OS, publisher, image version and SKU, offer, Azure region, resource group, tags, and more.

You can toggle **Show Help** to see more information about the table data. 

Select a VM name to see its overview page, and change settings like **Boot Diagnostic**.
