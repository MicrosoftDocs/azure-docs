# Manage a Virtual Instance for SAP solutions



In this article, you'll learn how to view the *Virtual Instance for SAP solutions (VIS)* resource created in *Azure Center for SAP solutions* through the Azure portal. You can use these steps to find your SAP system's properties and connect parts of the VIS to other resources like databases.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription in which you have a successfully created Virtual Instance for SAP solutions(VIS) resource.
- An Azure account with **Azure Center for SAP solutions administrator** role access to the subscription or resource groups where you have the VIS resources.

## Open VIS in portal

To configure your VIS in the Azure portal:

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) in a browser.
1. Sign in with your Azure account that has the necessary role access as described in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).
1. In the search field in the navigation menu, enter and select **Azure Center for SAP solutions**.
1. On the **Azure Center for SAP solutions** overview page, search for and select **Virtual Instances for SAP solutions** in the sidebar menu.
1. On the **Virtual Instances for SAP solutions** page, select the VIS that you want to view.

> [!Important]
> Each VIS resource has a unique Managed Resource Group associated with. This Resource Group contains resources like Storage Account, Keyvault etc. which are critical for Azure Center for SAP solutions service to provide capabilities like deployment of infrastructure for a new system, installation of SAP software, registration of existing systems and all other SAP system management functions. Please do not delete this RG or any resources within it. If they are deleted, you will have to re-register the VIS to use any capabilities of ACSS.


## Monitor VIS

To see infrastructure-based metrics for the VIS, [open the VIS in the Azure portal](#open-vis-in-portal). On the **Overview** pane, select the **Monitoring** tab. You can see the following metrics:

- VM utilization by ASCS and Application Server instances. The graph shows CPU usage percentage for all VMs that support the ASCS and Application Server instances.
- VM utilization by the database instance. The graph shows CPU usage percentage for all VMs that support the database instance.
- IOPS consumed by the database instance's data disk. The graph shows the percentage of disk utilization by all VMs that support the database instance.

## View instance properties

To view properties for the instances within your VIS, first [open the VIS in the Azure portal](#open-vis-in-portal). 

In the sidebar menu, look under the section **SAP resources**:

- To see properties of ASCS instances, select **Central service instances**.
- To see properties of application server instances, select **App server instances**.
- To see properties of database instances, select **Databases**.
