#Customer intent: As a developer, I want to start and stop SAP systems in Azure Center for SAP solutions so that I can control instances through the Virtual Instance for SAP resource.
# Customer intent: As an SAP system administrator, I want to start and stop SAP systems using the Azure CLI, so that I can efficiently manage system resources and ensure optimal performance of my applications.

# Quickstart: Start and stop SAP systems from Azure Center for SAP solutions with CLI

The Azure CLI is used to create and manage Azure resources from the command line or in scripts. 

In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to start and stop your SAP systems through the *Virtual Instance for SAP solutions (VIS)* resource in *Azure Center for SAP solutions* using the Azure CLI. 

Through the Azure CLI, you can start and stop:

- The entire SAP Application tier, which includes ABAP SAP Central Services (ASCS) and Application Server instances.
- Individual SAP instances, which include Central Services and Application server instances.
- HANA Database
- You can start and stop instances in the following types of deployments:
    - Single-Server
    - High Availability (HA)
    - Distributed Non-HA
- SAP systems that run on Windows and, RHEL and SUSE Linux operating systems.
- SAP HA systems that use SUSE and RHEL Pacemaker clustering software and Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC). Other certified cluster software isn't currently supported.

## Prerequisites
- An SAP system that you've [created in Azure Center for SAP solutions](prepare-network.md) or [registered with Azure Center for SAP solutions](register-existing-system.md) as a *Virtual Instance for SAP solutions* resource.
- Check that your Azure account has **Azure Center for SAP solutions administrator** or equivalent role access on the Virtual Instance for SAP solutions resources. You can learn more about the granular permissions that govern Start and Stop actions on the VIS, individual SAP instances and HANA Database [in this article](manage-with-azure-rbac.md#start-sap-system).
- For the start operation to work, the underlying virtual machines (VMs) of the SAP instances must be running. This capability starts or stops the SAP application instances, not the VMs that make up the SAP system resources.
- The `sapstartsrv` service must be running on all VMs related to the SAP system.
- For HA deployments, the HA interface cluster connector for SAP (`sap_vendor_cluster_connector`) must be installed on the ASCS instance. For more information, see the [SUSE connector specifications](https://www.suse.com/c/sap-netweaver-suse-cluster-integration-new-sap_suse_cluster_connector-version-3-0-0/) and [RHEL connector specifications](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3606101).
- The Stop operation function for the HANA Database can only be initiated when the cluster maintenance mode is in **Disabled** status. Similarly,  the Start operation function can only be initiated when the cluster maintenance mode is in **Enabled** status.

## Start SAP system
To Start an SAP system represented as a *Virtual Instance for SAP solutions* resource:

Use the [az workloads sap-virtual-instance start](/cli/azure/workloads/sap-virtual-instance#az-workloads-sap-virtual-instance-start) command:

Option 1:

Use the Virtual Instance for SAP solutions resource Name and ResourceGroupName to identify the system you intend to start.

```azurecli-interactive
     az workloads sap-virtual-instance start -g <Resource-group-name> -n <ResourceName>
```
Option 2:

Use the `id` parameter and pass the resource ID of the Virtual Instance for SAP solutions resource you intend to start.
     
```azurecli-interactive
     az workloads sap-virtual-instance start --id <ResourceID>
```

## Stop SAP system

To stop an SAP system represented as a *Virtual Instance for SAP solutions* resource:

Use the [az workloads sap-virtual-instance stop](/cli/azure/workloads/sap-virtual-instance#az-workloads-sap-virtual-instance-stop) command:

Option 1:

Use the Virtual Instance for SAP solutions resource Name and ResourceGroupName to identify the system you intend to stop.

```azurecli-interactive
     az workloads sap-virtual-instance stop -g <Resource-group-name> -n <ResourceName>
```
Option 2:

Use the `id` parameter and pass the resource ID of the Virtual Instance for SAP solutions resource you intend to stop.
     
```azurecli-interactive
     az workloads sap-virtual-instance stop --id <ResourceID>
```
