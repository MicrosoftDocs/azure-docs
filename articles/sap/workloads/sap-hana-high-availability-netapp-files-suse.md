# High availability of SAP HANA scale-up with Azure NetApp Files on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server

This article describes how to configure SAP HANA system replication in scale-up deployment when the HANA file systems are mounted via NFS by using Azure NetApp Files. In the example configurations and installation commands, instance number 03 and HANA System ID HN1 are used. SAP HANA replication consists of one primary node and at least one secondary node.

When steps in this document are marked with the following prefixes, they mean:

- [A]: The step applies to all nodes.
- [1]: The step applies to node1 only.
- [2]: The step applies to node2 only.

## Overview

Traditionally, in a scale-up environment, all file systems for SAP HANA are mounted from local storage. Setting up HA of SAP HANA system replication on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is published in [Set up SAP HANA system replication on SLES](./sap-hana-high-availability.md).

To achieve SAP HANA HA of a scale-up system on Azure NetApp Files NFS shares, we need extra resource configuration in the cluster. This configuration is needed so that HANA resources can recover when one node loses access to the NFS shares on Azure NetApp Files.

![Diagram that shows SAP HANA HA scale-up on Azure NetApp Files.](./media/sap-hana-high-availability-sles/sap-hana-scale-up-netapp-files-suse.png)

SAP HANA file systems are mounted on NFS shares by using Azure NetApp Files on each node. The file systems /hana/data, /hana/log, and /hana/shared are unique to each node.

Mounted on node1 (**hanadb1**):

- 10.3.1.4:/**hanadb1**-data-mnt00001 on /hana/data
- 10.3.1.4:/**hanadb1**-log-mnt00001 on /hana/log
- 10.3.1.4:/**hanadb1**-shared-mnt00001 on /hana/shared

Mounted on node2 (**hanadb2**):

- 10.3.1.4:/**hanadb2**-data-mnt00001 on /hana/data
- 10.3.1.4:/**hanadb2**-log-mnt00001 on /hana/log
- 10.3.1.4:/**hanadb2**-shared-mnt0001 on /hana/shared

> [!NOTE]
> The file systems /hana/shared, /hana/data, and /hana/log aren't shared between the two nodes. Each cluster node has its own separate file systems.

SAP HA HANA system replication configuration uses a dedicated virtual hostname and virtual IP addresses. On Azure, a load balancer is required to use a virtual IP address. The presented configuration shows a load balancer with:

- **Front-end configuration IP address**: 10.3.0.50 for hn1-db
- **Probe port**: 62503

## Set up the Azure NetApp Files infrastructure

Before you continue with the setup for Azure NetApp Files infrastructure, familiarize yourself with the [Azure NetApp Files documentation](../../azure-netapp-files/index.yml).

Azure NetApp Files is available in several [Azure regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=netapp). Check to see whether your selected Azure region offers Azure NetApp Files.

For information about the availability of Azure NetApp Files by Azure region, see [Azure NetApp Files availability by Azure region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=netapp&regions=all).

### Important considerations

As you create your Azure NetApp Files for SAP HANA scale-up systems, be aware of the important considerations documented in [NFS v4.1 volumes on Azure NetApp Files for SAP HANA](./hana-vm-operations-netapp.md#important-considerations).

### Sizing of HANA database on Azure NetApp Files

The throughput of an Azure NetApp Files volume is a function of the volume size and service level, as documented in [Service level for Azure NetApp Files](../../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-service-levels.md).

While you design the infrastructure for SAP HANA on Azure with Azure NetApp Files, be aware of the recommendations in [NFS v4.1 volumes on Azure NetApp Files for SAP HANA](./hana-vm-operations-netapp.md#sizing-for-hana-database-on-azure-netapp-files).

The configuration in this article is presented with simple Azure NetApp Files volumes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production systems, where performance is key, we recommend that you evaluate and consider using [Azure NetApp Files application volume group for SAP HANA](hana-vm-operations-netapp.md#deployment-through-azure-netapp-files-application-volume-group-for-sap-hana-avg).

All commands to mount /hana/shared in this article are presented for NFSv4.1 /hana/shared volumes. If you deployed the /hana/shared volumes as NFSv3 volumes, don't forget to adjust the mount commands for /hana/shared for NFSv3.

### Deploy Azure NetApp Files resources

The following instructions assume that you already deployed your [Azure virtual network](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md). The Azure NetApp Files resources and VMs, where the Azure NetApp Files resources are mounted, must be deployed in the same Azure virtual network or in peered Azure virtual networks.

1. Create a NetApp account in your selected Azure region by following the instructions in [Create a NetApp account](../../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-create-netapp-account.md).
1. Set up an Azure NetApp Files capacity pool by following the instructions in [Set up an Azure NetApp Files capacity pool](../../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-set-up-capacity-pool.md).

   The HANA architecture presented in this article uses a single Azure NetApp Files capacity pool at the Ultra service level. For HANA workloads on Azure, we recommend using the Azure NetApp Files Ultra or Premium [service Level](../../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-service-levels.md).
1. Delegate a subnet to Azure NetApp Files, as described in the instructions in [Delegate a subnet to Azure NetApp Files](../../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-delegate-subnet.md).
1. Deploy Azure NetApp Files volumes by following the instructions in [Create an NFS volume for Azure NetApp Files](../../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-create-volumes.md).

   As you deploy the volumes, be sure to select the NFSv4.1 version. Deploy the volumes in the designated Azure NetApp Files subnet. The IP addresses of the Azure NetApp Files volumes are assigned automatically.

   The Azure NetApp Files resources and the Azure VMs must be in the same Azure virtual network or in peered Azure virtual networks. For example, hanadb1-data-mnt00001, hanadb1-log-mnt00001, and so on are the volume names, and nfs://10.3.1.4/hanadb1-data-mnt00001, nfs://10.3.1.4/hanadb1-log-mnt00001, and so on are the file paths for the Azure NetApp Files volumes.

   On **hanadb1**:
   - Volume hanadb1-data-mnt00001 (nfs://10.3.1.4:/hanadb1-data-mnt00001)
   - Volume hanadb1-log-mnt00001 (nfs://10.3.1.4:/hanadb1-log-mnt00001)
   - Volume hanadb1-shared-mnt00001 (nfs://10.3.1.4:/hanadb1-shared-mnt00001)

   On **hanadb2**:
   - Volume hanadb2-data-mnt00001 (nfs://10.3.1.4:/hanadb2-data-mnt00001)
   - Volume hanadb2-log-mnt00001 (nfs://10.3.1.4:/hanadb2-log-mnt00001)
   - Volume hanadb2-shared-mnt00001 (nfs://10.3.1.4:/hanadb2-shared-mnt00001)

## Prepare the infrastructure

The resource agent for SAP HANA is included in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications. An image for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 12 or 15 is available in Azure Marketplace. You can use the image to deploy new VMs.

### Deploy Linux VMs manually via the Azure portal

This document assumes that you already deployed a resource group, [Azure Virtual Network](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md), and subnet.

Deploy VMs for SAP HANA. Choose a suitable SLES image that's supported for the HANA system. You can deploy a VM in any one of the availability options: virtual machine scale set, availability zone, or availability set.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that the OS you select is SAP certified for SAP HANA on the specific VM types that you plan to use in your deployment. You can look up SAP HANA-certified VM types and their OS releases in [SAP HANA Certified IaaS Platforms](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/#/solutions?filters=v:deCertified;ve:24;iaas;v:125;v:105;v:99;v:120). Make sure that you look at the details of the VM type to get the complete list of SAP HANA-supported OS releases for the specific VM type.

### Configure Azure Load Balancer

During VM configuration, you have an option to create or select the existing load balancer in the networking section. Follow the next steps to set up a standard load balancer for HA setup of the HANA database.

For more information about the required ports for SAP HANA, read the chapter [Connections to Tenant Databases](https://help.sap.com/viewer/78209c1d3a9b41cd8624338e42a12bf6/latest/en-US/7a9343c9f2a2436faa3cfdb5ca00c052.html) in the [SAP HANA Tenant Databases](https://help.sap.com/viewer/78209c1d3a9b41cd8624338e42a12bf6) guide or SAP Note [2388694](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2388694).  

When VMs without public IP addresses are placed in the back-end pool of internal (no public IP address) Standard Azure Load Balancer, there's no outbound internet connectivity unless more configuration is performed to allow routing to public endpoints. For more information on how to achieve outbound connectivity, see [Public endpoint connectivity for VMs using Azure Standard Load Balancer in SAP high-availability scenarios](./high-availability-guide-standard-load-balancer-outbound-connections.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Don't enable TCP timestamps on Azure VMs placed behind Load Balancer. Enabling TCP timestamps causes the health probes to fail. Set the parameter `net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps` to `0`. For more information, see [Load Balancer health probes](../../load-balancer/load-balancer-custom-probe-overview.md) and SAP Note [2382421](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2382421).
> - To prevent saptune from changing the manually set `net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps` value from `0` back to `1`, update the saptune version to 3.1.1 or higher. For more information, see [saptune 3.1.1 – Do I Need to Update?](https://www.suse.com/c/saptune-3-1-1-do-i-need-to-update/).

## Mount the Azure NetApp Files volume

1. **[A]** Create mount points for the HANA database volumes.

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /hana/data/HN1/mnt00001
   sudo mkdir -p /hana/log/HN1/mnt00001
   sudo mkdir -p /hana/shared/HN1
   ```

1. **[A]** Verify the NFS domain setting. Make sure that the domain is configured as the default Azure NetApp Files domain, that is, **defaultv4iddomain.com**, and the mapping is set to **nobody**.

   ```bash
   sudo cat /etc/idmapd.conf
   ```

   Example output:

   ```bash
   [General]
   Domain = defaultv4iddomain.com
   [Mapping]
   Nobody-User = nobody
   Nobody-Group = nobody
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Make sure to set the NFS domain in /etc/idmapd.conf on the VM to match the default domain configuration on Azure NetApp Files: **defaultv4iddomain.com**. If there's a mismatch between the domain configuration on the NFS client (that is, the VM) and the NFS server (that is, the Azure NetApp Files configuration), the permissions for files on Azure NetApp Files volumes that are mounted on the VMs display as **nobody**.

1. **[A]** Edit `/etc/fstab` on both nodes to permanently mount the volumes relevant to each node. The following example shows how you mount the volumes permanently.

   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/fstab
   ```

   Add the following entries in `/etc/fstab` on both nodes.

   Example for hanadb1:

   ```example
   10.3.1.4:/hanadb1-data-mnt00001 /hana/data/HN1/mnt00001  nfs   rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys  0  0
   10.3.1.4:/hanadb1-log-mnt00001 /hana/log/HN1/mnt00001  nfs   rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys  0  0
   10.3.1.4:/hanadb1-shared-mnt00001 /hana/shared/HN1  nfs   rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys  0  0
   ```

   Example for hanadb2:

   ```example
   10.3.1.4:/hanadb2-data-mnt00001 /hana/data/HN1/mnt00001  nfs   rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys  0  0
   10.3.1.4:/hanadb2-log-mnt00001 /hana/log/HN1/mnt00001  nfs   rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys  0  0
   10.3.1.4:/hanadb2-shared-mnt00001 /hana/shared/HN1  nfs   rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys  0  0
   ```

   Mount all volumes.

   ```bash
   sudo mount -a
   ```

   For workloads that require higher throughput, consider using the `nconnect` mount option, as described in [NFS v4.1 volumes on Azure NetApp Files for SAP HANA](./hana-vm-operations-netapp.md#nconnect-mount-option). Check if `nconnect` is [supported by Azure NetApp Files](../../azure-netapp-files/performance-linux-mount-options.md#nconnect) on your Linux release.

1. **[A]** Verify that all HANA volumes are mounted with NFS protocol version NFSv4.

   ```bash
   sudo nfsstat -m
   ```

   Verify that flag `vers` is set to **4.1**.

   Example from hanadb1:

   ```example
   /hana/log/HN1/mnt00001 from 10.3.1.4:/hanadb1-log-mnt00001
   Flags: rw,noatime,vers=4.1,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=10.3.0.4,local_lock=none,addr=10.3.1.4
   /hana/data/HN1/mnt00001 from 10.3.1.4:/hanadb1-data-mnt00001
   Flags: rw,noatime,vers=4.1,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=10.3.0.4,local_lock=none,addr=10.3.1.4
   /hana/shared/HN1 from 10.3.1.4:/hanadb1-shared-mnt00001
   Flags: rw,noatime,vers=4.1,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=10.3.0.4,local_lock=none,addr=10.3.1.4
   ```

1. **[A]** Verify **nfs4_disable_idmapping**. It should be set to **Y**. To create the directory structure where **nfs4_disable_idmapping** is located, run the mount command. You won't be able to manually create the directory under `/sys/modules` because access is reserved for the kernel/drivers.

   ```bash
   #Check nfs4_disable_idmapping
   sudo cat /sys/module/nfs/parameters/nfs4_disable_idmapping

   #If you need to set nfs4_disable_idmapping to Y
   sudo echo "Y" > /sys/module/nfs/parameters/nfs4_disable_idmapping

   #Make the configuration permanent
   sudo echo "options nfs nfs4_disable_idmapping=Y" >> /etc/modprobe.d/nfs.conf
   ```

## SAP HANA installation

1. **[A]** Set up host name resolution for all hosts.

   You can either use a DNS server or modify the `/etc/hosts` file on all nodes. This example shows how to use the `/etc/hosts` file. Replace the IP address and the host name in the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/hosts
   ```

   Insert the following lines in the `/etc/hosts` file. Change the IP address and host name to match your environment.

   ```example
   10.3.0.4   hanadb1
   10.3.0.5   hanadb2
   ```

1. **[A]** Prepare the OS for running SAP HANA on Azure NetApp with NFS, as described in SAP Note [3024346 - Linux Kernel Settings for NetApp NFS](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3024346). Create the configuration file `/etc/sysctl.d/91-NetApp-HANA.conf` for the NetApp configuration settings.

   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/sysctl.d/91-NetApp-HANA.conf
   ```

   Add the following entries in the configuration file:

   ```parameters
   net.core.rmem_max = 16777216
   net.core.wmem_max = 16777216
   net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 131072 16777216
   net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 16384 16777216
   net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 300000
   net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle=0
   net.ipv4.tcp_no_metrics_save = 1
   net.ipv4.tcp_moderate_rcvbuf = 1
   net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 1
   net.ipv4.tcp_sack = 1
   ```

1. **[A]** Create the configuration file `/etc/sysctl.d/ms-az.conf` with more optimization settings.

   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/sysctl.d/ms-az.conf
   ```

   Add the following entries in the configuration file:

   ```parameters
   net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
   net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 16348
   net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 0
   sunrpc.tcp_slot_table_entries = 128
   vm.swappiness=10
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > Avoid setting `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range` and `net.ipv4.ip_local_reserved_ports` explicitly in the sysctl configuration files to allow the SAP Host Agent to manage the port ranges. For more information, see SAP Note [2382421](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2382421).

1. **[A]** Adjust the `sunrpc` settings, as recommended in SAP Note [3024346 - Linux Kernel Settings for NetApp NFS](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3024346).

   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/sunrpc.conf
   ```

   Insert the following line:

   ```parameter
   options sunrpc tcp_max_slot_table_entries=128
   ```

1. **[A]** Configure SLES for HANA.

   Configure SLES as described in the following SAP Notes based on your SLES version:

   - [2684254 Recommended OS settings for SLES 15 / SLES for SAP Applications 15](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2684254)
   - [2205917 Recommended OS settings for SLES 12 / SLES for SAP Applications 12](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2205917)

1. **[A]** Install the SAP HANA.

   Starting with HANA 2.0 SPS 01, Multitenant Database Containers (MDC) is the default option. When you install the HANA system, SYSTEMDB and a tenant with the same SID are created together. In some cases, you don't want the default tenant. If you don't want to create the initial tenant along with the installation, follow the instructions in SAP Note [2629711](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2629711).

   1. Start the `hdblcm` program from the HANA installation software directory.

      ```bash
      ./hdblcm
      ```

   1. At the prompt, enter the following values:
      - For **Choose installation**: Enter **1** (for install).
      - For **Select additional components for installation**: Enter **1**.
      - For **Enter Installation Path [/hana/shared]**: Press Enter to accept the default.
      - For **Enter Local Host Name [..]**: Press Enter to accept the default.
      - Under **Do you want to add additional hosts to the system? (y/n) [n]**: Select **n**.
      - For **Enter SAP HANA System ID**: Enter **HN1**.
      - For **Enter Instance Number [00]**: Enter **03**.
      - For **Select Database Mode / Enter Index [1]**: Press Enter to accept the default.
      - For **Select System Usage / Enter Index [4]**: Enter **4** (for custom).
      - For **Enter Location of Data Volumes [/hana/data]**: Press Enter to accept the default.

1. **[A]** Upgrade the SAP Host Agent.

   Download the latest SAP Host Agent archive from the [SAP Software Center](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/softwarecenter) and run the following command to upgrade the agent. Replace the path to the archive to point to the file that you downloaded.

   ```bash
   sudo /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/saphostexec -upgrade -archive <path to SAP Host Agent SAR>
   ```

## Configure SAP HANA system replication

Follow the steps in [SAP HANA system replication](./sap-hana-high-availability.md#configure-sap-hana-20-system-replication) to configure SAP HANA system replication.

## Cluster configuration

This section describes the necessary steps that are required for the cluster to operate seamlessly when SAP HANA is installed on NFS shares by using Azure NetApp Files.

### Create a Pacemaker cluster

Follow the steps in [Setting up Pacemaker on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server](./high-availability-guide-suse-pacemaker.md) in Azure to create a basic Pacemaker cluster for this HANA server.

## Implement HANA hooks SAPHanaSR and susChkSrv

This important step optimizes the integration with the cluster and improves the detection when a cluster failover is needed. We highly recommend that you configure both SAPHanaSR and susChkSrv Python hooks. Follow the steps in [Implement the Python system replication hooks SAPHanaSR/SAPHanaSR-angi and susChkSrv](./sap-hana-high-availability.md#implement-hana-resource-agents).

## Configure SAP HANA cluster resources

This section describes the necessary steps that are required to configure the SAP HANA cluster resources.

### Create SAP HANA cluster resources

Follow the steps in [Creating SAP HANA cluster resources](./sap-hana-high-availability.md#create-sap-hana-cluster-resources) to create the cluster resources for the HANA server. After the resources are created, you should see the status of the cluster with the following command:

```bash
sudo crm_mon -r
```

Example output:

```output
# Online: [ hn1-db-0 hn1-db-1 ]
# Full list of resources:
# stonith-sbd     (stonith:external/sbd): Started hn1-db-0
# Clone Set: cln_SAPHanaTopology_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_SAPHanaTopology_HN1_HDB03]
#     Started: [ hn1-db-0 hn1-db-1 ]
# Master/Slave Set: msl_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03]
#     Masters: [ hn1-db-0 ]
#     Slaves: [ hn1-db-1 ]
# Resource Group: g_ip_HN1_HDB03
#     rsc_ip_HN1_HDB03   (ocf::heartbeat:IPaddr2):       Started hn1-db-0
#     rsc_nc_HN1_HDB03   (ocf::heartbeat:azure-lb):      Started hn1-db-0
```

### Create file system resources

File system /hana/shared/SID is necessary for both HANA operation and also for Pacemaker monitoring actions that determine HANA's state. Implement resource agents to monitor and act in case of failures. The section contains two options, one for `SAPHanaSR` and another for `SAPHanaSR-angi`.

#### [SAPHanaSR](#tab/saphanasr)

Create a dummy file system cluster resource. It monitors and reports failures if there's a problem accessing the NFS-mounted file system /hana/shared. That allows the cluster to trigger failover if there's a problem accessing /hana/shared. For more information, see [Handling failed NFS share in SUSE HA cluster for HANA system replication](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000019904).

1. **[A]** Create the directory structure on both nodes.

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /hana/shared/HN1/check
   sudo mkdir -p /hana/shared/check
   ```

1. **[1]** Configure the cluster to add the directory structure for monitoring.

   ```bash
   sudo crm configure primitive rsc_fs_check_HN1_HDB03 Filesystem params \
       device="/hana/shared/HN1/check/" \
       directory="/hana/shared/check/" fstype=nfs  \
       options="bind,defaults,rw,hard,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,proto=tcp,noatime,_netdev,nfsvers=4.1,lock,sec=sys" \
       op monitor interval=120 timeout=120 on-fail=fence \
       op_params OCF_CHECK_LEVEL=20 \
       op start interval=0 timeout=120 \
       op stop interval=0 timeout=120
   ```

1. **[1]** Clone and check the newly configured volume in the cluster.

   ```bash
   sudo crm configure clone cln_fs_check_HN1_HDB03 rsc_fs_check_HN1_HDB03 meta clone-node-max=1 interleave=true
   ```

   Example output:

   ```bash
   sudo crm status

   # Cluster Summary:
   # Stack: corosync
   # Current DC: hanadb1 (version 2.0.5+20201202.ba59be712-4.9.1-2.0.5+20201202.ba59be712) - partition with quorum
   # Last updated: Tue Nov  2 17:57:39 2021
   # Last change:  Tue Nov  2 17:57:38 2021 by root via crm_attribute on hanadb1
   # 2 nodes configured
   # 11 resource instances configured

   # Node List:
   # Online: [ hanadb1 hanadb2 ]

   # Full List of Resources:

   #  rsc_SAPHanaTopology_HN1_HDB03     (ocf::suse:SAPHanaTopology):     Started hanadb1 (Monitoring)
   #  rsc_SAPHanaTopology_HN1_HDB03     (ocf::suse:SAPHanaTopology):     Started hanadb2 (Monitoring)
   # Clone Set: msl_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03] (promotable):
   #  rsc_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03     (ocf::suse:SAPHana):     Master hanadb1 (Monitoring)
   #  Slaves: [ hanadb2 ]
   # Resource Group: g_ip_HN1_HDB03:
   #  rsc_ip_HN1_HDB03  (ocf::heartbeat:IPaddr2):        Started hanadb1
   #  rsc_nc_HN1_HDB03  (ocf::heartbeat:azure-lb):       Started hanadb1
   # rsc_st_azure        (stonith:fence_azure_arm):       Started hanadb2
   # Clone Set: cln_fs_check_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_fs_check_HN1_HDB03]:
   #  Started: [ hanadb1 hanadb2 ]
   ```

   The `OCF_CHECK_LEVEL=20` attribute is added to the monitor operation so that monitor operations perform a read/write test on the file system. Without this attribute, the monitor operation only verifies that the file system is mounted. This can be a problem because when connectivity is lost, the file system might remain mounted, despite being inaccessible.

   The `on-fail=fence` attribute is also added to the monitor operation. With this option, if the monitor operation fails on a node, that node is immediately fenced.

#### [SAPHanaSR-angi](#tab/saphanasr-angi)

When using SAPHanaSR-angi package and resource agent, it adds a new agent SAPHanaFilesystem to monitor read/write access to /hana/shared/SID. Filesystem /hana/shared is already mounted with entries in /etc/fstab on each host. SAPHanaFilesystem and Pacemaker doesn't mount the filesystem for HANA and doesn't need any additional mount or subdirectory pre-created.

1. **[1]** Configure SAPHanaFilesystem agent

```bash
# Replace <placeholders> with your instance number and HANA system ID. 
sudo crm configure primitive rsc_SAPHanaFil_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> ocf:suse:SAPHanaFilesystem \
  op start interval="0" timeout="10" \
  op stop interval="0" timeout="20" \
  op monitor interval="120" timeout="120" \
  params SID="<HANA SID>" InstanceNumber="<instance number>" ON_FAIL_ACTION="fence"

sudo crm configure clone cln_SAPHanaFil_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> rsc_SAPHanaFil_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> \
  meta clone-node-max="1" interleave="true"
```

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Timeouts in the preceding configuration might need to be adapted to the specific HANA setup to avoid unnecessary fence actions. Don't set the timeout values too low. Be aware that the file system monitor isn't related to the HANA system replication. For more information, see the [SUSE documentation](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000019904).

## Test the cluster setup

This section describes how you can test your setup.

1. Before you start a test, make sure that Pacemaker doesn't have any failed action (via crm status) and no unexpected location constraints (for example, leftovers of a migration test). Also, ensure that HANA system replication is in sync state, for example, with `systemReplicationStatus`.

   ```bash
   sudo su - hn1adm -c "python /usr/sap/HN1/HDB03/exe/python_support/systemReplicationStatus.py"
   ```

1. Verify the status of the HANA resources by using this command:

   ```bash
   SAPHanaSR-showAttr

   # You should see something like below
   # hanadb1:~ SAPHanaSR-showAttr
   # Global cib-time                 maintenance
   # --------------------------------------------
   # global Mon Nov  8 22:50:30 2021 false
   # Sites srHook

   # SITE2 SOK
   # Site2 SOK
   # Hosts   clone_state lpa_hn1_lpt node_state op_mode   remoteHost roles                            score site  srmode sync_state version                vhost
   # --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   # hanadb2 DEMOTED     30          online     logreplay hanadb1    4:S:master1:master:worker:master 100   SITE2 sync   SOK        2.00.058.00.1634122452 hanadb2
   ```

1. Verify the cluster configuration for a failure scenario when a node is shut down. The following example shows shutting down node 1:

   ```bash
   sudo crm status
   sudo crm resource move msl_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03 hanadb2 force
   sudo crm resource cleanup
   ```

   Example output:

   ```bash
   sudo crm status

   #Cluster Summary:
   # Stack: corosync
   # Current DC: hanadb2 (version 2.0.5+20201202.ba59be712-4.9.1-2.0.5+20201202.ba59be712) - partition with quorum
   # Last updated: Mon Nov  8 23:25:36 2021
   # Last change:  Mon Nov  8 23:25:19 2021 by root via crm_attribute on hanadb2
   # 2 nodes configured
   # 11 resource instances configured

   # Node List:

   #  Started: [ hanadb1 hanadb2 ]
   # Clone Set: msl_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03] (promotable):
   #  Masters: [ hanadb2 ]
   #  Stopped: [ hanadb1 ]
   # Resource Group: g_ip_HN1_HDB03:
   #  rsc_ip_HN1_HDB03  (ocf::heartbeat:IPaddr2):        Started hanadb2
   #  rsc_nc_HN1_HDB03  (ocf::heartbeat:azure-lb):       Started hanadb2
   # rsc_st_azure        (stonith:fence_azure_arm):       Started hanadb2
   # Clone Set: cln_fs_check_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_fs_check_HN1_HDB03]:
   #  Started: [ hanadb1 hanadb2 ]
   ```

   Stop the HANA on Node1:

   ```bash
   sudo su - hn1adm
   sapcontrol -nr 03 -function StopWait 600 10
   ```

   Register Node 1 as the Secondary Node and check status:

   ```bash
   hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost=hanadb2 --remoteInstance=03 --replicationMode=sync --name=SITE1 --operationMode=logreplay
   ```

   Example output:

   ```example
   #adding site ...
   #nameserver hanadb1:30301 not responding.
   #collecting information ...
   #updating local ini files ...
   #done.
   ```

   ```bash
   sudo crm status
   ```

   ```bash
   sudo SAPHanaSR-showAttr
   ```

1. Verify the cluster configuration for a failure scenario when a node loses access to the NFS share (/hana/shared).

   The SAP HANA resource agents depend on binaries stored on /hana/shared to perform operations during failover. File system /hana/shared is mounted over NFS in the presented scenario.

   It's difficult to simulate a failure, where one of the servers loses access to the NFS share. As a test, you can remount the file system as read-only. This approach validates that the cluster can fail over if access to /hana/shared is lost on the active node.

   **Expected result:** On making /hana/shared as a read-only file system, the `OCF_CHECK_LEVEL` attribute of the resource `hana_shared1`, which performs read/write operations on the file system, fails. It fails because it can't write anything on the file system and performs a HANA resource failover. The same result is expected when your HANA node loses access to the NFS shares.

   Resource state before starting the test:

   ```bash
   sudo crm  status

   #Cluster Summary:
    # Stack: corosync
    # Current DC: hanadb2 (version 2.0.5+20201202.ba59be712-4.9.1-2.0.5+20201202.ba59be712) - partition with quorum
    # Last updated: Mon Nov  8 23:01:27 2021
    # Last change:  Mon Nov  8 23:00:46 2021 by root via crm_attribute on hanadb1
    # 2 nodes configured
    # 11 resource instances configured

    #Node List:
    # Online: [ hanadb1 hanadb2 ]

    #Full List of Resources:
    # Clone Set: cln_azure-events [rsc_azure-events]:
      # Started: [ hanadb1 hanadb2 ]
    # Clone Set: cln_SAPHanaTopology_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_SAPHanaTopology_HN1_HDB03]:
      # Started: [ hanadb1 hanadb2 ]
    # Clone Set: msl_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03] (promotable):
      # Masters: [ hanadb1 ]
      # Slaves: [ hanadb2 ]
    # Resource Group: g_ip_HN1_HDB03:
      # rsc_ip_HN1_HDB03  (ocf::heartbeat:IPaddr2):        Started hanadb1
      # rsc_nc_HN1_HDB03  (ocf::heartbeat:azure-lb):       Started hanadb1
    # rsc_st_azure        (stonith:fence_azure_arm):       Started hanadb2
    # Clone Set: cln_fs_check_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_fs_check_HN1_HDB03]:
      # Started: [ hanadb1 hanadb2 ]
   ```

   You can place /hana/shared in read-only mode on the active cluster node by using this command:

   ```bash
   sudo mount -o ro 10.3.1.4:/hanadb1-shared-mnt00001 /hana/sharedb
   ```

   The server `hanadb1` either reboots or powers off based on the action set. After the server `hanadb1` is down, the HANA resource moves to `hanadb2`. You can check the status of the cluster from `hanadb2`.

   ```bash
   sudo crm status

   #Cluster Summary:
    # Stack: corosync
    # Current DC: hanadb2 (version 2.0.5+20201202.ba59be712-4.9.1-2.0.5+20201202.ba59be712) - partition with quorum

   ```

   We recommend testing the SAP HANA cluster configuration thoroughly by doing the tests described in [SAP HANA system replication](./sap-hana-high-availability.md#test-the-cluster-setup).
