# Get started with SAP and Microsoft integration scenarios

[According to SAP over 87% of total global commerce is generated by SAP customers](https://www.sap.com/documents/2017/04/4666ecdd-b67c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html) and more SAP systems are running in the cloud each year. The SAP platform provides a foundation for innovation for many companies and can handle various workloads natively. Explore our integration section further to learn how you can combine the Microsoft Azure ecosystem with your SAP workload to accelerate your business outcomes. Among the scenarios are extensions with Power Platform ("keep the ABAP core clean"), secured APIs with Azure API Management, automated business processes with Logic Apps, enriched experiences with SAP Business Technology Platform, native Microsoft integrations using ABAP Cloud, uniform data blending dashboards with the Azure Data Platform and more.

For the latest news from the SAP and  Azure world, follow the [SAP on Microsoft TechCommunity section](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sap-on-microsoft/ct-p/SAPonMicrosoft) and the relevant Azure tags on the [SAP Community](https://community.sap.com/search/?ct=blog&q=Azure).

To learn more about the opportunities of extending SAP applications with Azure services, see this Azure Friday episode:

### Microsoft Security for SAP

Protect your data, apps, and infrastructure against rapidly evolving cyber threats with cloud security services from Microsoft. Artificial intelligence (AI) and device learning (ML) backed capabilities are required to keep up with the pace.

Use [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction.md) to secure your cloud-infrastructure surrounding the SAP system including automated responses.

Complimenting that, use the [SAP certified](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2013_09_adpd/enEN/#/solutions?id=s:33db1376-91ae-4f36-a435-aafa892a88d8) solution [Microsoft Sentinel](../../sentinel/sap/sap-solution-security-content.md) to protect your SAP system and [SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)](../../sentinel/sap/sap-btp-solution-overview.md) instance from within using signals from the SAP Audit Log among others.

Learn more about identity focused integration capabilities that power the analysis on Defender and Sentinel via the [Microsoft Entra ID section](#microsoft-entra-id-formerly-azure-ad).

Leverage the [immutable vault for Azure Backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-immutable-vault-concept) to protect your SAP data from ransomware attacks.

See the Microsoft Security Copilot working with an SAP Incident in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snV2joMnSlc&t=234s).

#### Microsoft Sentinel for SAP

#### Microsoft Defender for Cloud

The [Defender product family](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction.md) consist of multiple products tailored to provide "cloud security posture management" (CSPM) and "cloud workload protection" (CWPP) for the various workload types. Below excerpt serves as entry point to start securing your SAP system.

- Defender for Servers (SAP hosts)
    - [Protect your SAP hosts with Defender](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-servers-introduction.md) including OS specific Endpoint protection with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
    - [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/mde-linux-deployment-on-sap)
    - [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Windows](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint)
    - [Enable Defender for Servers](../../defender-for-cloud/tutorial-enable-servers-plan.md#enable-the-defender-for-servers-plan)
- Defender for Storage (SAP SMB file shares on Azure)
    - [Protect your SAP SMB file shares with Defender](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-introduction.md)
    - [Enable Defender for Storage](../../defender-for-cloud/tutorial-enable-storage-plan.md)
- Defender for APIs (SAP Gateway, SAP Business Technology Platform, SAP SaaS)
    - [Protect your OpenAPI APIs with Defender for APIs](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-apis-introduction.md)
    - [Enable the Defender for APIs](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-apis-deploy.md)

See SAP's recommendation to use AntiVirus software for SAP hosts and systems on both Linux and Windows based platforms [here](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/Basis/Protecting+SAP+systems+using+antivirus+softwares). Be aware that the threat landscape has evolved from file-based attacks to file-less attacks. Therefore, the protection approach has to evolve beyond pure AntiVirus capabilities too.

For more information about using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) via Microsoft Defender for Server for SAP applications regarding `Next-generation protection` (AntiVirus) and `Endpoint Detection and Response` (EDR) see the following Microsoft resources:

- [SAP Applications and Microsoft Defender for Linux | Microsoft TechCommunity](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/running-sap-applications-on-the/sap-applications-and-microsoft-defender-for-linux/ba-p/3675480)
- [SAP Applications and Microsoft Defender for Windows Server | Microsoft TechCommunity](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/running-sap-applications-on-the/microsoft-defender-endpoint-mde-for-sap-applications-on-windows/ba-p/3912268)
- [Enable the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration](../../defender-for-cloud/enable-defender-for-endpoint.md)
- [Common mistakes to avoid when defining exclusions](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/common-exclusion-mistakes-microsoft-defender-antivirus)

Also see the following SAP resources:

- [3356389 - Antivirus or other security software affecting SAP operations](https://me.sap.com/notes/3356389)
- [2808515 - Installing security software on SAP servers running on Linux](https://me.sap.com/notes/2808515)
- [1730997 - Unrecommended versions of antivirus software](https://me.sap.com/notes/1730997)

> [!Note]
> It is **not recommended** to exclude files, paths or processes from EDR because it creates blind spots for Defender. If exclusions are required nevertheless, open a support case with Microsoft Support via the Defender365 Portal specifying executables and/or paths to exclude. Follow the same process for tuning of real-time scans.

> [!Note]
> Certification for the SAP Virus Scan Interface (NW-VSI) doesn't apply to MDE, because it operates outside of the SAP system. It complements Microsoft Sentinel for SAP, which interacts with the SAP system directly. See more details and the SAP certification note for Sentinel below.

> [!Tip]
> MDE was formerly called Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP). Older articles or SAP notes still refer to that name.

> [!Tip]
> Microsoft Defender for Server includes Endpoint detection and response (EDR) features that are provided by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2.
