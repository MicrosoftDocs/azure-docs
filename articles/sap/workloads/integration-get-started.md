# Get started with SAP and Microsoft integration scenarios

[According to SAP over 87% of total global commerce is generated by SAP customers](https://www.sap.com/documents/2017/04/4666ecdd-b67c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html) and more SAP systems are running in the cloud each year. The SAP platform provides a foundation for innovation for many companies and can handle various workloads natively. Explore our integration section further to learn how you can combine the Microsoft Azure ecosystem with your SAP workload to accelerate your business outcomes. Among the scenarios are extensions with Power Platform ("keep the ABAP core clean"), secured APIs with Azure API Management, automated business processes with Logic Apps, enriched experiences with SAP Business Technology Platform, native Microsoft integrations using ABAP Cloud, uniform data blending dashboards with the Azure Data Platform and more.

For the latest news from the SAP and  Azure world, follow the [SAP on Microsoft TechCommunity section](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sap-on-microsoft/ct-p/SAPonMicrosoft) and the relevant Azure tags on the [SAP Community](https://community.sap.com/search/?ct=blog&q=Azure).

To learn more about the opportunities of extending SAP applications with Azure services, see this Azure Friday episode:

### Microsoft Security for SAP

Protect your data, apps, and infrastructure against rapidly evolving cyber threats with cloud security services from Microsoft. Artificial intelligence (AI) and device learning (ML) backed capabilities are required to keep up with the pace.

Use [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction) to secure your cloud-infrastructure surrounding the SAP system including automated responses.

Complimenting that, use the [SAP certified](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2013_09_adpd/enEN/#/solutions?id=s:33db1376-91ae-4f36-a435-aafa892a88d8) solution [Microsoft Sentinel for SAP](../../sentinel/sap/sap-solution-security-content.md) to protect your SAP system and [SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)](../../sentinel/sap/sap-btp-solution-overview.md) instance from within using signals from the SAP Audit Log among others.

Unify all your security solutions for Microsoft 365, cloud-infrastructure, and SAP in one portal experience with [Microsoft Defender XDR](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-defender). Profit from the correlation of signals across the Microsoft ecosystem and connected third parties to detect and respond to threats in real-time.

Learn more about identity focused integration capabilities that power the analysis on Defender and Microsoft Sentinel via the [Microsoft Entra ID section](#microsoft-entra-id-formerly-azure-ad).

Use the [immutable vault for Azure Backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-immutable-vault-concept) to protect your SAP data from ransomware attacks.

See the Microsoft Security Copilot working with an SAP Incident in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snV2joMnSlc&t=234s).

Discover partner offerings for SAP security on the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/consulting-services?search=Sentinel%20for%20SAP&page=1).

#### Microsoft Sentinel for SAP

Microsoft Sentinel integrates natively with Microsoft Defender XDR. See the integration in action with [Automatic attack disruption for SAP](../../sentinel/sap/deployment-attack-disrupt.md).

For more information about [SAP certified](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2013_09_adpd/enEN/#/solutions?id=s:33db1376-91ae-4f36-a435-aafa892a88d8) threat monitoring with Microsoft Sentinel for SAP, see the following Microsoft resources:

#### Microsoft Defender XDR and Defender for Cloud

The [Defender product family](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction) consist of multiple products tailored to provide "cloud security posture management" (CSPM) and "cloud workload protection" (CWPP) for the various workload types. Below excerpt serves as entry point to start securing your SAP system.

- Defender XDR (integration with Microsoft Sentinel for SAP)
    - [Automatic attack disruption for SAP](../../sentinel/sap/deployment-attack-disrupt.md)

- Defender for Servers (SAP hosts)

    - [Protect your OpenAPI APIs with Defender for APIs](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-apis-introduction)
    - [Enable the Defender for APIs](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-apis-deploy)

See SAP's recommendation to use AntiVirus software for SAP hosts and systems on both Linux and Windows based platforms [here](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/Basis/Protecting+SAP+systems+using+antivirus+softwares). The threat landscape has evolved from file-based attacks to file-less attacks, and the protection approach has to evolve beyond pure AntiVirus capabilities too.

For more information about using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) via Microsoft Defender for Server for SAP applications regarding `Next-generation protection` (AntiVirus) and `Endpoint Detection and Response` (EDR) see the following Microsoft resources:

- [SAP Applications and Microsoft Defender for Linux | Microsoft TechCommunity](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/running-sap-applications-on-the/sap-applications-and-microsoft-defender-for-linux/ba-p/3675480)
- [SAP Applications and Microsoft Defender for Windows Server | Microsoft TechCommunity](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/running-sap-applications-on-the/microsoft-defender-endpoint-mde-for-sap-applications-on-windows/ba-p/3912268)

Also see the following SAP resources:

- [2808515 - Installing security software on SAP servers running on Linux](https://me.sap.com/notes/2808515)
- [1730997 - Unrecommended versions of antivirus software](https://me.sap.com/notes/1730997)

> [!Note]
> It is **not recommended** to exclude files, paths or processes from EDR because it creates blind spots for Defender. If exclusions are required nevertheless, open a support case with Microsoft Support via the Defender365 Portal specifying executables and/or paths to exclude. Follow the same process for tuning of real-time scans.

> [!Note]
> Certification for the SAP Virus Scan Interface (NW-VSI) doesn't apply to MDE, because it operates outside of the SAP system. It complements Microsoft Sentinel for SAP, which interacts with the SAP system directly. See more details and the SAP certification note for Sentinel below.

> [!Tip]
> MDE was formerly called Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP). Older articles or SAP notes still refer to that name.

> [!Tip]
> Microsoft Defender for Server includes Endpoint detection and response (EDR) features that are provided by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2.
