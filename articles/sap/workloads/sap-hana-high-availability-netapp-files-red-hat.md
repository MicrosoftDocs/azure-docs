# High availability of SAP HANA scale-up with Azure NetApp Files on RHEL

[dbms-guide]:dbms-guide-general.md
[deployment-guide]:deployment-guide.md
[planning-guide]:planning-guide.md

This article describes how to configure SAP HANA System Replication in scale-up deployment, when the HANA file systems are mounted via NFS, by using Azure NetApp Files. In the example configurations and installation commands, instance number **03** and HANA System ID **HN1** are used. SAP HANA System Replication consists of one primary node and at least one secondary node.

When steps in this document are marked with the following prefixes, the meaning is as follows:

- **[A]**: The step applies to all nodes
- **[1]**: The step applies to node1 only
- **[2]**: The step applies to node2 only

## Overview

Traditionally in a scale-up environment, all file systems for SAP HANA are mounted from local storage. Setting up high availability (HA) of SAP HANA System Replication on Red Hat Enterprise Linux is published in [Set up SAP HANA System Replication on RHEL](./sap-hana-high-availability-rhel.md).

To achieve SAP HANA HA of a scale-up system on [Azure NetApp Files](../../azure-netapp-files/index.yml) NFS shares, we need some more resource configuration in the cluster, in order for HANA resources to recover, when one node loses access to the NFS shares on Azure NetApp Files. The cluster manages the NFS mounts, allowing it to monitor the health of the resources. The dependencies between the file system mounts and the SAP HANA resources are enforced.

![Diagram that shows SAP HANA HA scale-up on Azure NetApp Files](./media/sap-hana-high-availability-rhel/sap-hana-scale-up-netapp-files-red-hat.png).

SAP HANA file systems are mounted on NFS shares by using Azure NetApp Files on each node. File systems `/hana/data`, `/hana/log`, and `/hana/shared` are unique to each node.

Mounted on node1 (**hanadb1**):

- 10.32.2.4:/**hanadb1**-data-mnt00001 on /hana/data
- 10.32.2.4:/**hanadb1**-log-mnt00001 on /hana/log
- 10.32.2.4:/**hanadb1**-shared-mnt00001 on /hana/shared

Mounted on node2 (**hanadb2**):

- 10.32.2.4:/**hanadb2**-data-mnt00001 on /hana/data
- 10.32.2.4:/**hanadb2**-log-mnt00001 on /hana/log
- 10.32.2.4:/**hanadb2**-shared-mnt00001 on /hana/shared

> [!NOTE]
> File systems `/hana/shared`, `/hana/data`, and `/hana/log` aren't shared between the two nodes. Each cluster node has its own separate file systems.

The SAP HANA System Replication configuration uses a dedicated virtual hostname and virtual IP addresses. On Azure, a load balancer is required to use a virtual IP address. The configuration shown here has a load balancer with:

- Front-end IP address: 10.32.0.10 for hn1-db
- Probe port: 62503

## Set up the Azure NetApp Files infrastructure

Before you proceed with the setup for Azure NetApp Files infrastructure, familiarize yourself with the Azure [NetApp Files documentation](../../azure-netapp-files/index.yml).

Azure NetApp Files is available in several [Azure regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=netapp). Check to see whether your selected Azure region offers Azure NetApp Files.

For information about the availability of Azure NetApp Files by Azure region, see [Azure NetApp Files availability by Azure region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=netapp&regions=all).

### Important considerations

As you're creating your Azure NetApp Files volumes for SAP HANA scale-up systems, be aware of the important considerations documented in [NFS v4.1 volumes on Azure NetApp Files for SAP HANA](./hana-vm-operations-netapp.md#important-considerations).

### Sizing of HANA database on Azure NetApp Files

The throughput of an Azure NetApp Files volume is a function of the volume size and service level, as documented in [Service level for Azure NetApp Files](../../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-service-levels.md).

While you're designing the infrastructure for SAP HANA on Azure with Azure NetApp Files, be aware of the recommendations in [NFS v4.1 volumes on Azure NetApp Files for SAP HANA](./hana-vm-operations-netapp.md#sizing-for-hana-database-on-azure-netapp-files).

The configuration in this article is presented with simple Azure NetApp Files volumes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production systems, where performance is a key, we recommend that you evaluate and consider using [Azure NetApp Files application volume group for SAP HANA](hana-vm-operations-netapp.md#deployment-through-azure-netapp-files-application-volume-group-for-sap-hana-avg).

### Deploy Azure NetApp Files resources

The following instructions assume that you already deployed your [Azure virtual network](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md). The Azure NetApp Files resources and VMs, where the Azure NetApp Files resources will be mounted, must be deployed in the same Azure virtual network or in peered Azure virtual networks.

1. Create a NetApp account in your selected Azure region by following the instructions in [Create a NetApp account](../../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-create-netapp-account.md).

1. Set up an Azure NetApp Files capacity pool by following the instructions in [Set up an Azure NetApp Files capacity pool](../../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-set-up-capacity-pool.md).

   The HANA architecture shown in this article uses a single Azure NetApp Files capacity pool at the *Ultra* service level. For HANA workloads on Azure, we recommend using an Azure NetApp Files *Ultra* or *Premium* [service Level](../../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-service-levels.md).

1. Delegate a subnet to Azure NetApp Files, as described in the instructions in [Delegate a subnet to Azure NetApp Files](../../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-delegate-subnet.md).

1. Deploy Azure NetApp Files volumes by following the instructions in [Create an NFS volume for Azure NetApp Files](../../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-create-volumes.md).

   As you're deploying the volumes, be sure to select the NFSv4.1 version. Deploy the volumes in the designated Azure NetApp Files subnet. The IP addresses of the Azure NetApp volumes are assigned automatically.

   Keep in mind that the Azure NetApp Files resources and the Azure VMs must be in the same Azure virtual network or in peered Azure virtual networks. For example, `hanadb1-data-mnt00001` and `hanadb1-log-mnt00001` are the volume names and `nfs://10.32.2.4/hanadb1-data-mnt00001` and `nfs://10.32.2.4/hanadb1-log-mnt00001` are the file paths for the Azure NetApp Files volumes.

   On **hanadb1**:

   - Volume hanadb1-data-mnt00001 (nfs://10.32.2.4:/hanadb1-data-mnt00001)
   - Volume hanadb1-log-mnt00001 (nfs://10.32.2.4:/hanadb1-log-mnt00001)
   - Volume hanadb1-shared-mnt00001 (nfs://10.32.2.4:/hanadb1-shared-mnt00001)

   On **hanadb2**:

   - Volume hanadb2-data-mnt00001 (nfs://10.32.2.4:/hanadb2-data-mnt00001)
   - Volume hanadb2-log-mnt00001 (nfs://10.32.2.4:/hanadb2-log-mnt00001)
   - Volume hanadb2-shared-mnt00001 (nfs://10.32.2.4:/hanadb2-shared-mnt00001)

> [!NOTE]
> All commands to mount `/hana/shared` in this article are presented for NFSv4.1 `/hana/shared` volumes.
> If you deployed the `/hana/shared` volumes as NFSv3 volumes, don't forget to adjust the mount commands for `/hana/shared` for NFSv3.

## Prepare the infrastructure

Azure Marketplace contains images qualified for SAP HANA with the High Availability add-on, which you can use to deploy new VMs by using various versions of Red Hat.

### Deploy Linux VMs manually via the Azure portal

This document assumes that you've already deployed a resource group, an [Azure virtual network](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md), and a subnet.

Deploy VMs for SAP HANA. Choose a suitable RHEL image that's supported for the HANA system. You can deploy a VM in any one of the availability options: virtual machine scale set, availability zone, or availability set.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Make sure that the OS you select is SAP certified for SAP HANA on the specific VM types that you plan to use in your deployment. You can look up SAP HANA-certified VM types and their OS releases in [SAP HANA Certified IaaS Platforms](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/#/solutions?filters=v:deCertified;ve:24;iaas;v:125;v:105;v:99;v:120). Make sure that you look at the details of the VM type to get the complete list of SAP HANA-supported OS releases for the specific VM type.

### Configure Azure load balancer

During VM configuration, you have an option to create or select exiting load balancer in networking section. Follow below steps, to setup standard load balancer for high availability setup of HANA database.

For more information about the required ports for SAP HANA, read the chapter [Connections to Tenant Databases](https://help.sap.com/viewer/78209c1d3a9b41cd8624338e42a12bf6/latest/en-US/7a9343c9f2a2436faa3cfdb5ca00c052.html) in the [SAP HANA Tenant Databases](https://help.sap.com/viewer/78209c1d3a9b41cd8624338e42a12bf6) guide or SAP Note [2388694](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2388694).  

> [!NOTE]
> When VMs without public IP addresses are placed in the back-end pool of an internal (no public IP address) instance of Standard Azure Load Balancer, there's no outbound internet connectivity, unless more configuration is performed to allow routing to public endpoints. For more information on how to achieve outbound connectivity, see [Public endpoint connectivity for virtual machines using Standard Azure Load Balancer in SAP high-availability scenarios](./high-availability-guide-standard-load-balancer-outbound-connections.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't enable TCP timestamps on Azure VMs placed behind Azure Load Balancer. Enabling TCP timestamps could cause the health probes to fail. Set the parameter **net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps** to **0**. For more information, see [Load Balancer health probes](../../load-balancer/load-balancer-custom-probe-overview.md) and SAP Note [2382421](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2382421).

## Mount the Azure NetApp Files volume

1. **[A]** Create mount points for the HANA database volumes.

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /hana/data
    sudo mkdir -p /hana/log
    sudo mkdir -p /hana/shared
    ```

1. **[A]** Verify the NFS domain setting. Make sure that the domain is configured as the default Azure NetApp Files domain, that is, **defaultv4iddomain.com**, and the mapping is set to **nobody**.

    ```bash
    sudo cat /etc/idmapd.conf
    ```

    Example output:

    ```output
    [General]
    Domain = defaultv4iddomain.com
    [Mapping]
    Nobody-User = nobody
    Nobody-Group = nobody
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Make sure to set the NFS domain in `/etc/idmapd.conf` on the VM to match the default domain configuration on Azure NetApp Files: **defaultv4iddomain.com**. If there's a mismatch between the domain configuration on the NFS client (that is, the VM) and the NFS server (that is, the Azure NetApp Files configuration), then the permissions for files on Azure NetApp Files volumes that are mounted on the VMs display as `nobody`.

1. **[1]** Mount the node-specific volumes on node1 (**hanadb1**).

    ```bash
    sudo mount -o rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys 10.32.2.4:/hanadb1-shared-mnt00001 /hana/shared
    sudo mount -o rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys 10.32.2.4:/hanadb1-log-mnt00001 /hana/log
    sudo mount -o rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys 10.32.2.4:/hanadb1-data-mnt00001 /hana/data
    ```

1. **[2]** Mount the node-specific volumes on node2 (**hanadb2**).

    ```bash
    sudo mount -o rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys 10.32.2.4:/hanadb2-shared-mnt00001 /hana/shared
    sudo mount -o rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys 10.32.2.4:/hanadb2-log-mnt00001 /hana/log
    sudo mount -o rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys 10.32.2.4:/hanadb2-data-mnt00001 /hana/data
    ```

1. **[A]** Verify that all HANA volumes are mounted with NFS protocol version NFSv4.

    ```bash
    sudo nfsstat -m
    ```

    Verify that the flag `vers` is set to **4.1**.
    Example from hanadb1:

    ```output
    /hana/log from 10.32.2.4:/hanadb1-log-mnt00001
    Flags: rw,noatime,vers=4.1,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=10.32.0.4,local_lock=none,addr=10.32.2.4
    /hana/data from 10.32.2.4:/hanadb1-data-mnt00001
    Flags: rw,noatime,vers=4.1,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=10.32.0.4,local_lock=none,addr=10.32.2.4
    /hana/shared from 10.32.2.4:/hanadb1-shared-mnt00001
    Flags: rw,noatime,vers=4.1,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=10.32.0.4,local_lock=none,addr=10.32.2.4
    ```

1. **[A]** Verify **nfs4_disable_idmapping**. It should be set to **Y**. To create the directory structure where **nfs4_disable_idmapping** is located, run the mount command. You can't manually create the directory under `/sys/modules` because access is reserved for the kernel and drivers.

    Check `nfs4_disable_idmapping`.

    ```bash
    sudo cat /sys/module/nfs/parameters/nfs4_disable_idmapping
    ```

    If you need to set `nfs4_disable_idmapping` to:

    ```bash
    sudo echo "Y" > /sys/module/nfs/parameters/nfs4_disable_idmapping
    ```

    Make the configuration permanent.

    ```bash
    sudo echo "options nfs nfs4_disable_idmapping=Y" >> /etc/modprobe.d/nfs.conf
    ```

   For more information on how to change the `nfs_disable_idmapping` parameter, see the [Red Hat Knowledge Base](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1749883).

## SAP HANA installation

1. **[A]** Set up hostname resolution for all hosts.

   You can either use a DNS server or modify the `/etc/hosts` file on all nodes. This example shows you how to use the `/etc/hosts` file. Replace the IP address and the hostname in the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/hosts
   ```

   Insert the following lines in the `/etc/hosts` file. Change the IP address and hostname to match your environment.

   ```output
   10.32.0.4   hanadb1
   10.32.0.5   hanadb2
   ```

1. **[A]** Prepare the OS for running SAP HANA on Azure NetApp with NFS, as described in SAP Note [3024346 - Linux Kernel Settings for NetApp NFS](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3024346). Create configuration file `/etc/sysctl.d/91-NetApp-HANA.conf` for the NetApp configuration settings.  

    ```bash
    sudo vi /etc/sysctl.d/91-NetApp-HANA.conf
    ```

    Add the following entries in the configuration file.

    ```output
    net.core.rmem_max = 16777216
    net.core.wmem_max = 16777216
    net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 131072 16777216
    net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 16384 16777216
    net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 300000 
    net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle=0 
    net.ipv4.tcp_no_metrics_save = 1
    net.ipv4.tcp_moderate_rcvbuf = 1
    net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 1    
    net.ipv4.tcp_sack = 1
    ```

1. **[A]** Create the configuration file `/etc/sysctl.d/ms-az.conf` with more optimization settings.  

    ```bash
    sudo vi /etc/sysctl.d/ms-az.conf
    ```

    Add the following entries in the configuration file.

    ```output
    net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
    net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 16348
    net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 0
    sunrpc.tcp_slot_table_entries = 128
    vm.swappiness=10
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > Avoid setting `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range` and `net.ipv4.ip_local_reserved_ports` explicitly in the `sysctl` configuration files to allow the SAP Host Agent to manage the port ranges. For more information, see SAP Note [2382421](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2382421).

1. **[A]** Adjust the `sunrpc` settings, as recommended in SAP Note [3024346 - Linux Kernel Settings for NetApp NFS](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3024346).

    ```bash
    sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/sunrpc.conf
    ```

    Insert the following line:

    ```output
    options sunrpc tcp_max_slot_table_entries=128
    ```

1. **[A]** Perform RHEL OS configuration for HANA.

   Configure the OS as described in the following SAP Notes based on your RHEL version:

   - [2292690 - SAP HANA DB: Recommended OS settings for RHEL 7](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2292690)

   ```bash
   sudo /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/saphostexec -upgrade -archive <path to SAP Host Agent SAR>
   ```

1. **[A]** Configure a firewall.

   Create the firewall rule for the Azure Load Balancer probe port.

   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=62503/tcp
   sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=62503/tcp –permanent
   ```

## Configure SAP HANA System Replication

Follow the steps in [Set up SAP HANA System Replication](./sap-hana-high-availability-rhel.md#configure-sap-hana-20-system-replication) to configure SAP HANA System Replication.

## Cluster configuration

This section describes the steps required for a cluster to operate seamlessly when SAP HANA is installed on NFS shares by using Azure NetApp Files.

### Create a Pacemaker cluster

Follow the steps in [Set up Pacemaker on Red Hat Enterprise Linux](./high-availability-guide-rhel-pacemaker.md) in Azure to create a basic Pacemaker cluster for this HANA server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With the systemd based SAP Startup Framework, SAP HANA instances can now be managed by systemd. The minimum required Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version is RHEL 8 for SAP. As outlined in SAP Note [3189534](https://me.sap.com/notes/3189534), any new installations of SAP HANA SPS07 revision 70 or above, or updates to HANA systems to HANA 2.0 SPS07 revision 70 or above, SAP Startup framework will be automatically registered with systemd.
>
> When using HA solutions to manage SAP HANA system replication in combination with systemd-enabled SAP HANA instances (refer to SAP Note [3189534](https://me.sap.com/notes/3189534)), additional steps are necessary to ensure that the HA cluster can manage the SAP instance without systemd interference. So, for SAP HANA system integrated with systemd, additional steps outlined in [Red Hat KBA 7029705](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7029705) must be followed on all cluster nodes.

### Implement the Python system replication hook SAPHanaSR

This step is an important one to optimize the integration with the cluster and improve the detection when a cluster failover is needed. We highly recommend that you configure the SAPHanaSR Python hook. Follow the steps in [Implement the Python system replication hook SAPHanaSR](sap-hana-high-availability-rhel.md#implement-sap-hana-system-replication-hooks).

### Configure file system resources

In this example, each cluster node has its own HANA NFS file systems `/hana/shared`, `/hana/data`, and `/hana/log`.

1. **[1]** Put the cluster in maintenance mode.

   ```bash
   sudo pcs property set maintenance-mode=true
   ```

1. **[1]** Create the file system resources for the **hanadb1** mounts.

    ```bash
    sudo pcs resource create hana_data1 ocf:heartbeat:Filesystem device=10.32.2.4:/hanadb1-data-mnt00001 directory=/hana/data fstype=nfs options=rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys op monitor interval=20s on-fail=fence timeout=120s OCF_CHECK_LEVEL=20 --group hanadb1_nfs
    sudo pcs resource create hana_log1 ocf:heartbeat:Filesystem device=10.32.2.4:/hanadb1-log-mnt00001 directory=/hana/log fstype=nfs options=rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys op monitor interval=20s on-fail=fence timeout=120s OCF_CHECK_LEVEL=20 --group hanadb1_nfs
    sudo pcs resource create hana_shared1 ocf:heartbeat:Filesystem device=10.32.2.4:/hanadb1-shared-mnt00001 directory=/hana/shared fstype=nfs options=rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys op monitor interval=20s on-fail=fence timeout=120s OCF_CHECK_LEVEL=20 --group hanadb1_nfs
    ```

1. **[2]** Create the file system resources for the **hanadb2** mounts.

    ```bash
    sudo pcs resource create hana_data2 ocf:heartbeat:Filesystem device=10.32.2.4:/hanadb2-data-mnt00001 directory=/hana/data fstype=nfs options=rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys op monitor interval=20s on-fail=fence timeout=120s OCF_CHECK_LEVEL=20 --group hanadb2_nfs
    sudo pcs resource create hana_log2 ocf:heartbeat:Filesystem device=10.32.2.4:/hanadb2-log-mnt00001 directory=/hana/log fstype=nfs options=rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys op monitor interval=20s on-fail=fence timeout=120s OCF_CHECK_LEVEL=20 --group hanadb2_nfs
    sudo pcs resource create hana_shared2 ocf:heartbeat:Filesystem device=10.32.2.4:/hanadb2-shared-mnt00001 directory=/hana/shared fstype=nfs options=rw,nfsvers=4.1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=262144,wsize=262144,noatime,lock,_netdev,sec=sys op monitor interval=20s on-fail=fence timeout=120s OCF_CHECK_LEVEL=20 --group hanadb2_nfs
    ```

   The `OCF_CHECK_LEVEL=20` attribute is added to the monitor operation so that each monitor performs a read/write test on the file system. Without this attribute, the monitor operation only verifies that the file system is mounted. This can be a problem because when connectivity is lost, the file system might remain mounted despite being inaccessible.

   The `on-fail=fence` attribute is also added to the monitor operation. With this option, if the monitor operation fails on a node, that node is immediately fenced. Without this option, the default behavior is to stop all resources that depend on the failed resource, restart the failed resource, and then start all the resources that depend on the failed resource.

    Not only can this behavior take a long time when an SAPHana resource depends on the failed resource, but it also can fail altogether. The SAPHana resource can't stop successfully if the NFS server holding the HANA executables is inaccessible.

   The suggested timeout values allow the cluster resources to withstand protocol-specific pause, related to NFSv4.1 lease renewals. For more information, see [NFS in NetApp Best practice](https://www.netapp.com/media/10720-tr-4067.pdf). The timeouts in the preceding configuration might need to be adapted to the specific SAP setup.

   For workloads that require higher throughput, consider using the `nconnect` mount option, as described in [NFS v4.1 volumes on Azure NetApp Files for SAP HANA](./hana-vm-operations-netapp.md#nconnect-mount-option). Check if `nconnect` is [supported by Azure NetApp Files](../../azure-netapp-files/performance-linux-mount-options.md#nconnect) on your Linux release.

1. **[1]** Configure location constraints.

   Configure location constraints to ensure that the resources that manage hanadb1 unique mounts can never run on hanadb2, and vice versa.

    ```bash
    sudo pcs constraint location hanadb1_nfs rule score=-INFINITY resource-discovery=never \#uname eq hanadb2
    sudo pcs constraint location hanadb2_nfs rule score=-INFINITY resource-discovery=never \#uname eq hanadb1
    ```

    The `resource-discovery=never` option is set because the unique mounts for each node share the same mount point. For example, `hana_data1` uses mount point `/hana/data`, and `hana_data2` also uses mount point `/hana/data`. Sharing the same mount point can cause a false positive for a probe operation, when resource state is checked at cluster startup, and it can in turn cause unnecessary recovery behavior. To avoid this scenario, set `resource-discovery=never`.

1. **[1]** Configure attribute resources.

   Configure attribute resources. These attributes are set to true if all of a node's NFS mounts (`/hana/data`, `/hana/log`, and `/hana/data`) are mounted. Otherwise, they're set to false.

   ```bash
   sudo pcs resource create hana_nfs1_active ocf:pacemaker:attribute active_value=true inactive_value=false name=hana_nfs1_active
   sudo pcs resource create hana_nfs2_active ocf:pacemaker:attribute active_value=true inactive_value=false name=hana_nfs2_active
   ```

1. **[1]** Configure location constraints.

   Configure location constraints to ensure that hanadb1's attribute resource never runs on hanadb2, and vice versa.

   ```bash
   sudo pcs constraint location hana_nfs1_active avoids hanadb2
   sudo pcs constraint location hana_nfs2_active avoids hanadb1
   ```

1. **[1]** Create ordering constraints.

   Configure ordering constraints so that a node's attribute resources start only after all of the node's NFS mounts are mounted.

    ```bash
    sudo pcs constraint order hanadb1_nfs then hana_nfs1_active
    sudo pcs constraint order hanadb2_nfs then hana_nfs2_active
    ```

   > [!TIP]
   > If your configuration includes file systems, outside of group `hanadb1_nfs` or `hanadb2_nfs`, include the `sequential=false` option so that there are no ordering dependencies among the file systems. All file systems must start before `hana_nfs1_active`, but they don't need to start in any order relative to each other. For more information, see [How do I configure SAP HANA System Replication in Scale-Up in a Pacemaker cluster when the HANA file systems are on NFS shares](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5156571)

### Configure SAP HANA cluster resources

1. Follow the steps in [Create SAP HANA cluster resources](./sap-hana-high-availability-rhel.md#create-sap-hana-cluster-resources) to create the SAP HANA resources in the cluster. After SAP HANA resources are created, you need to create a location rule constraint between SAP HANA resources and file systems (NFS mounts).

1. **[1]** Configure constraints between the SAP HANA resources and the NFS mounts.

   Location rule constraints are set so that the SAP HANA resources can run on a node only if all of the node's NFS mounts are mounted.

    ```bash
   sudo pcs constraint location SAPHanaTopology_HN1_03-clone rule score=-INFINITY hana_nfs1_active ne true and hana_nfs2_active ne true
    ```

    On RHEL 7.x:

    ```bash
   sudo pcs constraint location SAPHana_HN1_03-master rule score=-INFINITY hana_nfs1_active ne true and hana_nfs2_active ne true
    ```

    On RHEL 8.x/9.x:

    ```bash
   sudo pcs constraint location SAPHana_HN1_03-clone rule score=-INFINITY hana_nfs1_active ne true and hana_nfs2_active ne true
    ```

1. **[1]** Configure ordering constraints so that the SAP resources on a node will stop ahead of a stop for any of the NFS mounts.

   ```bash
   pcs constraint order stop SAPHanaTopology_HN1_03-clone then stop hanadb1_nfs
   pcs constraint order stop SAPHanaTopology_HN1_03-clone then stop hanadb2_nfs
   ```

   On RHEL 7.x:

   ```bash
   pcs constraint order stop SAPHana_HN1_03-master then stop hanadb1_nfs
   pcs constraint order stop SAPHana_HN1_03-master then stop hanadb2_nfs
   ```

   On RHEL 8.x/9.x:

   ```bash
   pcs constraint order stop SAPHana_HN1_03-clone then stop hanadb1_nfs
   pcs constraint order stop SAPHana_HN1_03-clone then stop hanadb2_nfs
   ```

   Take the cluster out of maintenance mode.

    ```bash
    sudo pcs property set maintenance-mode=false
    ```

   Check the status of the cluster and all the resources.

    ```

    Example output:

    ```output
    Online: [ hanadb1 hanadb2 ]
    
    Full list of resources:

    ```

## Configure HANA active/read-enabled system replication in Pacemaker cluster

Starting with SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 01, SAP allows active/read-enabled setups for SAP HANA System Replication, where the secondary systems of SAP HANA System Replication can be used actively for read-intense workloads. To support such a setup in a cluster, a second virtual IP address is required, which allows clients to access the secondary read-enabled SAP HANA database.

To ensure that the secondary replication site can still be accessed after a takeover has occurred, the cluster needs to move the virtual IP address around with the secondary of the SAPHana resource.

The extra configuration, which is required to manage HANA active/read-enabled System Replication in a Red Hat HA cluster with a second virtual IP, is described in [Configure HANA Active/Read-Enabled System Replication in Pacemaker cluster](./sap-hana-high-availability-rhel.md#configure-hana-activeread-enabled-system-replication-in-pacemaker-cluster).  

Before you proceed further, make sure you've fully configured Red Hat High Availability Cluster managing SAP HANA database as described in the preceding sections of the documentation.

## Test the cluster setup

This section describes how you can test your setup.

1. Before you start a test, make sure that Pacemaker doesn't have any failed action (via pcs status), there are no unexpected location constraints (for example, leftovers of a migration test), and that HANA system replication is in sync state, for example, with `systemReplicationStatus`:

    ```bash
    sudo su - hn1adm -c "python /usr/sap/HN1/HDB03/exe/python_support/systemReplicationStatus.py"
    ```

1. Verify the cluster configuration for a failure scenario when a node loses access to the NFS share (`/hana/shared`).

   The SAP HANA resource agents depend on binaries stored on `/hana/shared` to perform operations during failover. File system `/hana/shared` is mounted over NFS in the presented scenario.  

   It's difficult to simulate a failure where one of the servers loses access to the NFS share. As a test, you can remount the file system as read-only. This approach validates that the cluster can fail over, if access to `/hana/shared` is lost on the active node.

   **Expected result:** On making `/hana/shared` as a read-only file system, the `OCF_CHECK_LEVEL` attribute of the resource `hana_shared1`, which performs read/write operations on file systems, fails. It isn't able to write anything on the file system and performs HANA resource failover. The same result is expected when your HANA node loses access to the NFS shares.

   Resource state before starting the test:

    ```bash
    sudo pcs status
    ```

    Example output:

    ```output
    Full list of resources:
     rsc_hdb_azr_agt        (stonith:fence_azure_arm):      Started hanadb1
   
     Resource Group: hanadb1_nfs
         hana_data1 (ocf::heartbeat:Filesystem):    Started hanadb1
         hana_log1  (ocf::heartbeat:Filesystem):    Started hanadb1
         hana_shared1       (ocf::heartbeat:Filesystem):    Started hanadb1
   
    Resource Group: hanadb2_nfs
         hana_data2 (ocf::heartbeat:Filesystem):    Started hanadb2
         hana_log2  (ocf::heartbeat:Filesystem):    Started hanadb2
         hana_shared2       (ocf::heartbeat:Filesystem):    Started hanadb2
   
     hana_nfs1_active       (ocf::pacemaker:attribute):     Started hanadb1
     hana_nfs2_active       (ocf::pacemaker:attribute):     Started hanadb2
   
     Clone Set: SAPHanaTopology_HN1_03-clone [SAPHanaTopology_HN1_03]
         Started: [ hanadb1 hanadb2 ]
   
     Master/Slave Set: SAPHana_HN1_03-master [SAPHana_HN1_03]
         Masters: [ hanadb1 ]
         Slaves: [ hanadb2 ]
   
     Resource Group: g_ip_HN1_03
         nc_HN1_03  (ocf::heartbeat:azure-lb):      Started hanadb1
         vip_HN1_03 (ocf::heartbeat:IPaddr2):       Started hanadb1
    ```

   You can place `/hana/shared` in read-only mode on the active cluster node by using this command:

    ```bash
    sudo mount -o ro 10.32.2.4:/hanadb1-shared-mnt00001 /hana/shared
    ```

   `hanadb` will either reboot or power off based on the action set on `stonith` (`pcs property show stonith-action`). Once the server (`hanadb1`) is down, the HANA resource moves to `hanadb2`. You can check the status of the cluster from `hanadb2`.

    ```bash
    sudo pcs status
    ```

    Example output:

    ```output
    Full list of resources:
   
     rsc_hdb_azr_agt        (stonith:fence_azure_arm):      Started hanadb2
   
     Resource Group: hanadb1_nfs
         hana_data1 (ocf::heartbeat:Filesystem):    Stopped
         hana_log1  (ocf::heartbeat:Filesystem):    Stopped
         hana_shared1       (ocf::heartbeat:Filesystem):    Stopped
   
     Resource Group: hanadb2_nfs
         hana_data2 (ocf::heartbeat:Filesystem):    Started hanadb2
         hana_log2  (ocf::heartbeat:Filesystem):    Started hanadb2
         hana_shared2       (ocf::heartbeat:Filesystem):    Started hanadb2
   
     hana_nfs1_active       (ocf::pacemaker:attribute):     Stopped
     hana_nfs2_active       (ocf::pacemaker:attribute):     Started hanadb2
   
     Clone Set: SAPHanaTopology_HN1_03-clone [SAPHanaTopology_HN1_03]
         Started: [ hanadb2 ]
         Stopped: [ hanadb1 ]
   
     Master/Slave Set: SAPHana_HN1_03-master [SAPHana_HN1_03]
         Masters: [ hanadb2 ]
         Stopped: [ hanadb1 ]
   
     Resource Group: g_ip_HN1_03
         nc_HN1_03  (ocf::heartbeat:azure-lb):      Started hanadb2
         vip_HN1_03 (ocf::heartbeat:IPaddr2):       Started hanadb2
    ```

   We recommend that you thoroughly test the SAP HANA cluster configuration by also performing the tests described in [Set up SAP HANA System Replication on RHEL](./sap-hana-high-availability-rhel.md#test-the-cluster-setup).
