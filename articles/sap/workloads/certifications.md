# SAP certifications and configurations running on Microsoft Azure

SAP and Microsoft have a long history of working together in a strong partnership that has mutual benefits for their customers. Microsoft is constantly updating its platform and submitting new certification details to SAP in order to ensure Microsoft Azure is the best platform on which to run your SAP workloads. The following tables outline Azure supported configurations and list of growing SAP certifications. This list is an overview list that might deviate here and there from the official SAP lists. How to get to the detailed data is documented in the article [What SAP software is supported for Azure deployments](./supported-product-on-azure.md)
