# SAP Business One on Azure Virtual Machines

This document provides guidance to deploy SAP Business One on Azure Virtual Machines. This documentation isn't a replacement for installation documentation of Business one for SAP. The documentation should cover basic planning and deployment guidelines for the Azure infrastructure to run Business One applications on.

Business One supports two different databases:

- SQL Server - see [SAP Note #928839 - Release Planning for Microsoft SQL Server](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/928839)
- SAP HANA - for exact SAP Business One support matrix for SAP HANA, checkout  the [SAP Product Availability Matrix](https://support.sap.com/pam)

Regarding SQL Server, the basic deployment considerations as documented in the [Azure Virtual Machines DBMS deployment for SAP NetWeaver](./dbms-guide-general.md) applies. For SAP HANA, considerations are mentioned in this document.

## Prerequisites

To use this guide, you need basic knowledge of the following Azure components:

- [Azure virtual machines on Windows](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-manage-vm)
- [Azure virtual machines on Linux](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-manage-vm)
- [Azure networking and virtual networks management with PowerShell](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-virtual-network)
- [Azure networking and virtual networks with CLI](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-virtual-network)
- [Manage Azure disks with the Azure CLI](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-manage-disks)

Even if you're interested in business One only, the document [Azure Virtual Machines planning and implementation for SAP NetWeaver](./planning-guide.md) can be a good source of information.

The assumption is that you as the instance deploying SAP Business One are:

- Familiar with installing SAP HANA on a given infrastructure like a VM
- Familiar installing the SAP Business One application on an infrastructure like Azure VMs
- Familiar with operating SAP Business One and the DBMS system chosen
- Familiar with deploying infrastructure in Azure

All these areas aren't covered in this document.

Besides Azure documentation you should be aware of main SAP Notes, which refer to Business One or which are central Notes from SAP for business One:

- [528296 - General Overview Note for SAP Business One Releases and Related Products](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/528296)
- [2216195 - Release Updates Note for SAP Business One 9.2, version for SAP HANA](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2216195)
- [2483583 - Central Note for SAP Business One 9.3](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2483583)
- [2483615 - Release Updates Note for SAP Business One 9.3](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2483615)
- [2483595 - Collective Note for SAP Business One 9.3 General Issues](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2483595)
- [2027458 - Collective Consulting Note for SAP HANA-Related Topics of SAP Business One, version for SAP HANA](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2027458)

## Business One Architecture

Business One is an application that has two tiers:

- A client tier with a 'fat' client
- A database tier that contains the database schema for a tenant

A better overview which components are running in the client part and which parts are running in the server part is documented in [SAP Business One Administrator's Guide](https://help.sap.com/doc/601fbd9113be4240b81d74626439cfa9/10.0/en-US/AdministratorGuide_SQL.pdf)

Since there's heavy latency critical interaction between the client tier and the DBMS tier, both tiers need to be located in Azure when deploying in Azure. It's usual that the users then RDS into one or multiple VMs running an RDS service for the Business One client components.

### Sizing VMs for SAP Business One

SAP outlines the resource requirements for client VM sizing in the [SAP Business One Hardware Requirements Guide](https://help.sap.com/doc/bfa9770d12284cce8509956dcd4c5fcb/9.3/en-US/B1_Hardware_Requirements_Guide.pdf). For Azure, you need to focus and calculate with the requirements stated in chapter 2.4 of the document.

As Azure VMs for hosting the Business One client components and the DBMS host, only VMs that are SAP NetWeaver supported are allowed. To find the list of SAP NetWeaver supported Azure VMs, read [SAP Note #1928533](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1928533).

When you run SAP HANA as DBMS backend for Business One, only VMs that are listed for Business on HANA in the [HANA certified IaaS platform list](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/#/solutions?filters=v:deCertified;ve:24;iaas;v:120) are supported for HANA. These VM limitations apply solely to SAP HANA. The Business One client components remain unaffected.

### Operating system releases to use for SAP Business One

In principle, it's always best to use the most recent operating system releases. Especially in the Linux space, new Azure functionality was introduced with different more recent minor releases of SUSE and Red Hat. On the Windows side, using Windows Server 2016 is highly recommended.

## Deploying infrastructure in Azure for SAP Business One

The next sections provide an overview of the critical infrastructure components involved in deploying SAP.

### Azure network infrastructure

The network infrastructure you need to deploy in Azure depends on whether you deploy a single Business One system for yourself. Or whether you're a hoster who hosts dozens of Business One systems for customers. There also might be slight changes in the design on whether how you connect to Azure. One approach is to use VPN connectivity into Azure and extend your Active Directory through [VPN gateway](../../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md) or [ExpressRoute](../../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md).

![A graph of an on-prem network configuration using VPN tunneling to connect to Microsoft Azure Business One](./media/business-one-azure/simple-network-with-VPN.PNG)

The simplified configuration presented introduces several security instances that allow to control and limit routing. It starts with

- The router/firewall on the customer on-premises side.
- The next instance is the [Azure Network Security Group](../../virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview.md) that you can use to introduce routing and security rules for the Azure VNet that you run your SAP Business one configuration in.
- In order to prevent users of the Business One client from seeing the server that runs the Business One server and its database, you should separate the virtual machines. Place the VM hosting the Business One client and the VM hosting the Business One server in two different subnets within the VNet.
- You would use Azure NSG assigned to the two different subnets again in order to limit access to the Business one server.

A more sophisticated version of an Azure network configuration is based on the Azure [documented best practices of hub and spoke architecture](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke). The architecture pattern of hub and spoke would change the first simplified configuration to one like this:


![Hub and spoke configuration with Business One](./media/business-one-azure/hub-spoke-network-with-VPN.PNG)

When users access the environment through the internet and no private connection to Azure exists, the Azure network must be designed according to the principles in the Azure reference architecture. To learn more, see [DMZ between Azure and the Internet](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/secure-vnet-dmz).

### Business One database server

For the database type, SQL Server and SAP HANA are available. Independent of the DBMS, you should read the document [Considerations for Azure Virtual Machines DBMS deployment for SAP workload](./dbms-guide-general.md) to get a general understanding of DBMS deployments in Azure VMs and the related networking and storage articles.

Though emphasized in the specific and generic database documents already, you should make yourself familiar with:

- [Manage the availability of Windows virtual machines in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/availability) and [Manage the availability of Linux virtual machines in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/availability)
- [SLA for Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines/v1_8/)

These documents should help you to decide on the selection of storage types and high availability configuration.

In principle you should:

- Use Premium SSDs over Standard HDDs. To learn more about the available disk types, see [Select a disk type](/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types).
- Use Azure Managed Disks over unmanaged disks.
- Make sure that you have sufficient IOPS and I/O throughput configured with your disk configuration.
- Combine `/hana/data` and `/hana/log` volume for a cost efficient storage configuration.

#### SQL Server as DBMS

For deploying SQL Server as DBMS for Business One, go along the document [SQL Server Azure Virtual Machines DBMS deployment for SAP NetWeaver](./dbms-guide-sqlserver.md).

Rough sizing estimates for the DBMS side for SQL Server are:

| Number of users | vCPUs | Memory | Example VM types |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| up to 20 | 4 | 16 GB | D4s_v3, E4s_v3 |
| up to 40 | 8 | 32 GB | D8s_v3, E8s_v3 |
| up to 80 | 16 | 64 GB | D16s_v3, E16s_v3 |
| up to 150 | 32 | 128 GB | D32s_v3, E32s_v3 |

The sizing listed should give an idea where to start with. It may be that you need less  or more resources, in which case an adaption on Azure is easy. A change between VM types is possible with just a restart of the VM.

#### SAP HANA as DBMS

When you use SAP HANA as DBMS, you should follow the considerations from the [SAP HANA on Azure operations guide](./hana-vm-operations.md).

For details on setting up high availability and disaster recovery setups for SAP HANA used as the Business One database in Azure, see [SAP HANA high availability for Azure virtual machines](./sap-hana-availability-overview.md).

For SAP HANA backup and restore strategies, you should read the document [Backup guide for SAP HANA on Azure Virtual Machines](../../backup/sap-hana-db-about.md) and the documentation pointed to from that document.

### Business One client server

For these components, storage considerations aren't the primary concern. Nevertheless, you want to have a reliable platform. Therefore, you should use Azure Premium Storage for this VM, even for the base VHD. Sizing the VM, with the data given in [SAP Business One Hardware Requirements Guide](https://help.sap.com/doc/bfa9770d12284cce8509956dcd4c5fcb/9.3/en-US/B1_Hardware_Requirements_Guide.pdf). For Azure, you need to focus and calculate with the requirements stated in chapter 2.4 of the document. As you calculate the requirements, you need to compare them against the following documents to find the ideal VM for you:

- [Sizes for Windows virtual machines in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes)
- [SAP Note #1928533](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1928533)

Compare the number of CPUs and memory needed to what is documented. Also keep network throughput in mind when choosing the VMs.
