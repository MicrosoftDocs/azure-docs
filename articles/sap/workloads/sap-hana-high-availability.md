To establish high availability in an on-premises SAP HANA deployment, you can use either SAP HANA system replication or shared storage.

Currently on Azure virtual machines (VMs), SAP HANA system replication on Azure is the only supported high availability function.

SAP HANA system replication consists of one primary node and at least one secondary node. Changes to the data on the primary node are replicated to the secondary node synchronously or asynchronously.

This article describes how to deploy and configure the VMs, install the cluster framework, and install and configure SAP HANA system replication.

Before you begin, read the following SAP Notes and papers:

## Plan for SAP HANA high availability

To achieve high availability, install SAP HANA on two VMs. The data is replicated by using HANA system replication.

:::image type="content" source="media/sap-hana-high-availability/ha-suse-hana.png" border="false" alt-text="Diagram that shows an SAP HANA high availability overview.":::

The SAP HANA system replication setup uses a dedicated virtual host name and virtual IP addresses. In Azure, you need a load balancer to deploy a virtual IP address.

The preceding figure shows an *example* load balancer that has these configurations:

- Front-end IP address: 10.0.0.13 for HN1-db
- Probe port: 62503

## Prepare the infrastructure

The resource agent for SAP HANA is included in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications. An image for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 12 or 15 is available in Azure Marketplace. You can use the image to deploy new VMs.

### Deploy Linux VMs manually via Azure portal

This document assumes that you've already deployed a resource group, [Azure Virtual Network](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md), and subnet.

Deploy virtual machines for SAP HANA. Choose a suitable SLES image that is supported for HANA system. You can deploy VM in any one of the availability options - virtual machine scale set, availability zone, or availability set.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that the OS you select is SAP certified for SAP HANA on the specific VM types that you plan to use in your deployment. You can look up SAP HANA-certified VM types and their OS releases in [SAP HANA Certified IaaS Platforms](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/#/solutions?filters=v:deCertified;ve:24;iaas;v:125;v:105;v:99;v:120). Make sure that you look at the details of the VM type to get the complete list of SAP HANA-supported OS releases for the specific VM type.

### Configure Azure load balancer

During VM configuration, you have an option to create or select exiting load balancer in networking section. Follow below steps, to setup standard load balancer for high availability setup of HANA database.

For more information about the required ports for SAP HANA, read the chapter [Connections to Tenant Databases](https://help.sap.com/viewer/78209c1d3a9b41cd8624338e42a12bf6/latest/en-US/7a9343c9f2a2436faa3cfdb5ca00c052.html) in the [SAP HANA Tenant Databases](https://help.sap.com/viewer/78209c1d3a9b41cd8624338e42a12bf6) guide or [SAP Note 2388694][2388694].  

> [!NOTE]
> When VMs that don't have public IP addresses are placed in the back-end pool of an internal (no public IP address) standard instance of Azure Load Balancer, the default configuration is no outbound internet connectivity. You can take extra steps to allow routing to public endpoints. For details on how to achieve outbound connectivity, see [Public endpoint connectivity for VMs by using Azure Standard Load Balancer in SAP high-availability scenarios](./high-availability-guide-standard-load-balancer-outbound-connections.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Don't enable TCP timestamps on Azure VMs that are placed behind Azure Load Balancer. Enabling TCP timestamps causes the health probes to fail. Set parameter `net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps` to `0`. For details see [Load Balancer health probes](../../load-balancer/load-balancer-custom-probe-overview.md) or SAP note [2382421](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2382421).
> - To prevent saptune from changing the manually set `net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps` value from `0` back to `1`, update saptune version to 3.1.1 or higher. For more details, see [saptune 3.1.1 â€“ Do I Need to Update?](https://www.suse.com/c/saptune-3-1-1-do-i-need-to-update/).

## Create a Pacemaker cluster

Follow the steps in [Set up Pacemaker on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server in Azure](high-availability-guide-suse-pacemaker.md) to create a basic Pacemaker cluster for this HANA server. You can use the same Pacemaker cluster for SAP HANA and SAP NetWeaver (A)SCS.

## Install SAP HANA

The steps in this section use the following prefixes:

- **[A]**: The step applies to all nodes.
- **[1]**: The step applies only to node 1.
- **[2]**: The step applies only to node 2 of the Pacemaker cluster.

Replace `<placeholders>` with the values for your SAP HANA installation.

1. **[A]** Set up the disk layout by using Logical Volume Manager (LVM).

   We recommend that you use LVM for volumes that store data and log files. The following example assumes that the VMs have four attached data disks that are used to create two volumes.

   1. Run this command to list all the available disks:

      ```bash
      ls /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun*
      ```

      Example output:

      ```output
      /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun0  /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun1  /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun2  /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun3
      ```

   1. Create physical volumes for all the disks that you want to use:

      ```bash
      sudo pvcreate /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun0
      sudo pvcreate /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun1
      sudo pvcreate /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun2
      sudo pvcreate /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun3
      ```

   1. Create a volume group for the data files. Use one volume group for the log files and one volume group for the shared directory of SAP HANA:

      ```bash
      sudo vgcreate vg_hana_data_<HANA SID> /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun0 /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun1
      sudo vgcreate vg_hana_log_<HANA SID> /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun2
      sudo vgcreate vg_hana_shared_<HANA SID> /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun3
      ```

   1. Create the logical volumes.

      A linear volume is created when you use `lvcreate` without the `-i` switch. We suggest that you create a striped volume for better I/O performance. Align the stripe sizes to the values that are described in [SAP HANA VM storage configurations](./hana-vm-operations-storage.md). The `-i` argument should be the number of underlying physical volumes, and the `-I` argument is the stripe size.

      For example, if two physical volumes are used for the data volume, the `-i` switch argument is set to **2**, and the stripe size for the data volume is **256KiB**. One physical volume is used for the log volume, so no `-i` or `-I` switches are explicitly used for the log volume commands.  

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > When you use more than one physical volume for each data volume, log volume, or shared volume, use the `-i` switch and set it the number of underlying physical volumes. When you create a striped volume, use the `-I` switch to specify the stripe size.
      >
      > For recommended storage configurations, including stripe sizes and the number of disks, see [SAP HANA VM storage configurations](./hana-vm-operations-storage.md).  

      ```bash
      sudo lvcreate <-i number of physical volumes> <-I stripe size for the data volume> -l 100%FREE -n hana_data vg_hana_data_<HANA SID>
      sudo lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n hana_log vg_hana_log_<HANA SID>
      sudo lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n hana_shared vg_hana_shared_<HANA SID>
      sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/vg_hana_data_<HANA SID>/hana_data
      sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/vg_hana_log_<HANA SID>/hana_log
      sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/vg_hana_shared_<HANA SID>/hana_shared
      ```

   1. Create the mount directories and copy the universally unique identifier (UUID) of all the logical volumes:

      ```bash
      sudo mkdir -p /hana/data/<HANA SID>
      sudo mkdir -p /hana/log/<HANA SID>
      sudo mkdir -p /hana/shared/<HANA SID>
      # Write down the ID of /dev/vg_hana_data_<HANA SID>/hana_data, /dev/vg_hana_log_<HANA SID>/hana_log, and /dev/vg_hana_shared_<HANA SID>/hana_shared
      sudo blkid
      ```

   1. Edit the */etc/fstab* file to create `fstab` entries for the three logical volumes:

      ```bash
      sudo vi /etc/fstab
      ```

   1. Insert the following lines in the */etc/fstab* file:

      ```bash
      /dev/disk/by-uuid/<UUID of /dev/mapper/vg_hana_data_<HANA SID>-hana_data> /hana/data/<HANA SID> xfs  defaults,nofail  0  2
      /dev/disk/by-uuid/<UUID of /dev/mapper/vg_hana_log_<HANA SID>-hana_log> /hana/log/<HANA SID> xfs  defaults,nofail  0  2
      /dev/disk/by-uuid/<UUID of /dev/mapper/vg_hana_shared_<HANA SID>-hana_shared> /hana/shared/<HANA SID> xfs  defaults,nofail  0  2
      ```

   1. Mount the new volumes:

      ```bash
      sudo mount -a
      ```

1. **[A]** Set up the disk layout by using plain disks.

   For demo systems, you can place your HANA data and log files on one disk.

   1. Create a partition on */dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun0* and format it by using XFS:

      ```bash
      sudo sh -c 'echo -e "n\n\n\n\n\nw\n" | fdisk /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun0'
      sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun0-part1
       
      # Write down the ID of /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun0-part1
      sudo /sbin/blkid
      sudo vi /etc/fstab
      ```

   1. Insert this line in the */etc/fstab* file:

      ```bash
      /dev/disk/by-uuid/<UUID> /hana xfs  defaults,nofail  0  2
      ```

   1. Create the target directory and mount the disk:

      ```bash
      sudo mkdir /hana
      sudo mount -a
      ```

1. **[A]** Set up host name resolution for all hosts.

   You can either use a DNS server or modify the */etc/hosts* file on all nodes. This example shows you how to use the */etc/hosts* file. Replace the IP addresses and the host names in the following commands.

   1. Edit the */etc/hosts* file:

      ```bash
      sudo vi /etc/hosts
      ```

   1. Insert the following lines in the */etc/hosts* file. Change the IP addresses and host names to match your environment.

      ```bash
      10.0.0.5 hn1-db-0
      10.0.0.6 hn1-db-1
      ```

1. **[A]** Install SAP HANA, following [SAP's documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_PLATFORM/2c1988d620e04368aa4103bf26f17727/2d4de94c8bf14cda8d37278647fff8ab.html).

## Configure SAP HANA 2.0 system replication

The steps in this section use the following prefixes:

- **[A]**: The step applies to all nodes.
- **[1]**: The step applies only to node 1.
- **[2]**: The step applies only to node 2 of the Pacemaker cluster.

Replace `<placeholders>` with the values for your SAP HANA installation.

1. **[1]** Create the tenant database.

   If you're using SAP HANA 2.0 or SAP HANA MDC, create a tenant database for your SAP NetWeaver system.

   Run the following command as \<HANA SID\>adm:

   ```bash
   hdbsql -u SYSTEM -p "<password>" -i <instance number> -d SYSTEMDB 'CREATE DATABASE <SAP SID> SYSTEM USER PASSWORD "<password>"'
   ```

1. **[1]** Configure system replication on the first node:

   First, back up the databases as \<HANA SID\>adm:

   ```bash
   hdbsql -d SYSTEMDB -u SYSTEM -p "<password>" -i <instance number> "BACKUP DATA USING FILE ('<name of initial backup file for SYS>')"
   hdbsql -d <HANA SID> -u SYSTEM -p "<password>" -i <instance number> "BACKUP DATA USING FILE ('<name of initial backup file for HANA SID>')"
   hdbsql -d <SAP SID> -u SYSTEM -p "<password>" -i <instance number> "BACKUP DATA USING FILE ('<name of initial backup file for SAP SID>')"
   ```

   Then, copy the system public key infrastructure (PKI) files to the secondary site:

   ```bash
   scp /usr/sap/<HANA SID>/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs/data/SSFS_<HANA SID>.DAT   hn1-db-1:/usr/sap/<HANA SID>/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs/data/
   scp /usr/sap/<HANA SID>/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs/key/SSFS_<HANA SID>.KEY  hn1-db-1:/usr/sap/<HANA SID>/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs/key/
   ```

   Create the primary site:

   ```bash
   hdbnsutil -sr_enable --name=<site 1>
   ```

1. **[2]** Configure system replication on the second node:

   Register the second node to start the system replication.

   Run the following command as \<HANA SID\>adm:

   ```bash
   sapcontrol -nr <instance number> -function StopWait 600 10
   hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost=hn1-db-0 --remoteInstance=<instance number> --replicationMode=sync --name=<site 2> 
   ```

## Implement HANA resource agents

SUSE provides two different software packages for the Pacemaker resource agent to manage SAP HANA. Software packages SAPHanaSR and SAPHanaSR-angi are using slightly different syntax and parameters and aren't compatible. See [SUSE release notes](https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/x86_64/SLE-SAP/15-SP6/index.html#bsc-1210005) and [documentation](https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/sap-15/html/SLES4SAP-hana-angi-perfopt-15/index.html) for details and differences between SAPHanaSR and SAPHanaSR-angi. This document covers both packages in separate tabs in the respective sections.

> [!WARNING]
> Don't replace the package SAPHanaSR by SAPHanaSR-angi in an already configured cluster. Upgrading from SAPHanaSR to SAPHanaSR-angi requires a specific procedure.

1. **[A]** Install the SAP HANA high availability packages:

### [SAPHanaSR](#tab/saphanasr)
Run the following command to install the high availability packages:

```bash
sudo zypper install SAPHanaSR
```

### [SAPHanaSR-angi](#tab/saphanasr-angi)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> SAPHanaSR-angi has a minimum version requirement of SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 05 and SUSE SLES for SAP Applications 15 SP4 or higher.

Run the following command to install the high availability packages:

```bash
sudo zypper install SAPHanaSR-angi
```

---

### Set up SAP HANA HA/DR providers

The SAP HANA HA/DR providers optimize the integration with the cluster and improve detection when a cluster failover is needed. The main hook script is SAPHanaSR (for SAPHanaSR package) / susHanaSR (for SAPHanaSR-angi). We highly recommend that you configure the SAPHanaSR/susHanaSR Python hook. For HANA 2.0 SPS 05 and later, we recommend that you implement both SAPHanaSR/susHanaSR and the susChkSrv hooks.  

The susChkSrv hook extends the functionality of the main SAPHanaSR/susHanaSR HA provider. It acts when the HANA process hdbindexserver crashes. If a single process crashes, HANA typically tries to restart it. Restarting the indexserver process can take a long time, during which the HANA database isn't responsive.

With susChkSrv implemented, an immediate and configurable action is executed. The action triggers a failover in the configured timeout period instead of waiting for the hdbindexserver process to restart on the same node.

1. **[A]** Stop HANA on both nodes.

Run the following code as \<sap-sid\>adm:  

```bash
sapcontrol -nr <instance number> -function StopSystem
```

2. **[A]** Install the HANA system replication hooks. The hooks must be installed on both HANA database nodes.

   > [!TIP]
   > The SAPHanaSR Python hook can be implemented only for HANA 2.0. The SAPHanaSR package must be at least version 0.153.  
   > The SAPHanaSR-angi Python hook can be implemented only for HANA 2.0 SPS 05 and later.  
   > The susChkSrv Python hook requires SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 05, and SAPHanaSR version 0.161.1_BF or later must be installed.  

   #### [SAPHanaSR](#tab/saphanasr)

   1. **[A]** Adjust *global.ini* on each cluster node. 

      If the requirements for the susChkSrv hook aren't met, remove the entire `[ha_dr_provider_suschksrv]` block from the following parameters. You can adjust the behavior of `susChkSrv` by using the `action_on_lost` parameter. Valid values are [ `ignore` | `stop` | `kill` | `fence` ].

      ```bash
      [ha_dr_provider_SAPHanaSR]
      provider = SAPHanaSR
      path = /usr/share/SAPHanaSR
      execution_order = 1

      [ha_dr_provider_suschksrv]
      provider = susChkSrv
      path = /usr/share/SAPHanaSR
      execution_order = 3
      action_on_lost = fence

      [trace]
      ha_dr_saphanasr = info
      ```

      If you point parameter path to the default `/usr/share/SAPHanaSR` location, the Python hook code updates automatically through OS updates or package updates. HANA uses the hook code updates when it next restarts. With an optional own path like `/hana/shared/myHooks`, you can decouple OS updates from the hook version that you use.

   1. **[A]** The cluster requires *sudoers* configuration on each cluster node for \<sap-sid\>adm. In this example, that's achieved by creating a new file.

      Run the following command as root. Replace \<sid\> by lowercase SAP system ID, \<SID\> by uppercase SAP system ID and \<siteA/B\> with HANA site names chosen.

      ```bash
      cat << EOF > /etc/sudoers.d/20-saphana
      # Needed for SAPHanaSR and susChkSrv Python hooks
      Cmnd_Alias SOK_SITEA      = /usr/sbin/crm_attribute -n hana_<sid>_site_srHook_<siteA> -v SOK   -t crm_config -s SAPHanaSR
      Cmnd_Alias SFAIL_SITEA    = /usr/sbin/crm_attribute -n hana_<sid>_site_srHook_<siteA> -v SFAIL -t crm_config -s SAPHanaSR
      Cmnd_Alias SOK_SITEB      = /usr/sbin/crm_attribute -n hana_<sid>_site_srHook_<siteB> -v SOK   -t crm_config -s SAPHanaSR
      Cmnd_Alias SFAIL_SITEB    = /usr/sbin/crm_attribute -n hana_<sid>_site_srHook_<siteB> -v SFAIL -t crm_config -s SAPHanaSR
      Cmnd_Alias HELPER_TAKEOVER = /usr/sbin/SAPHanaSR-hookHelper --sid=<SID> --case=checkTakeover
      Cmnd_Alias HELPER_FENCE    = /usr/sbin/SAPHanaSR-hookHelper --sid=<SID> --case=fenceMe
      
      <sid>adm ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: SOK_SITEA, SFAIL_SITEA, SOK_SITEB, SFAIL_SITEB, HELPER_TAKEOVER, HELPER_FENCE
      EOF
      ```
  
     For details about implementing the SAP HANA system replication hook, see [Set up HANA HA/DR providers](https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/sap-15/html/SLES4SAP-hana-sr-guide-PerfOpt-15/index.html#cha.s4s.hana-hook).

   #### [SAPHanaSR-angi](#tab/saphanasr-angi)

   1. **[A]** Adjust *global.ini* on each cluster node. 

      If you choose not to use the recommended susChkSrv hook, remove the entire `[ha_dr_provider_suschksrv]` block from the following parameters. You can adjust the behavior of `susChkSrv` by using the `action_on_lost` parameter. Valid values are [ `ignore` | `stop` | `kill` | `fence` ].
  
      ```bash
      [ha_dr_provider_sushanasr]
      provider = susHanaSR
      path = /usr/share/SAPHanaSR-angi
      execution_order = 1

      [ha_dr_provider_suschksrv]
      provider = susChkSrv
      path = /usr/share/SAPHanaSR-angi
      execution_order = 3
      action_on_lost = fence
  
      [trace]
      ha_dr_sushanasr = info
      ha_dr_suschksrv = info
      ```
  
      If you point parameter path to the default `/usr/share/SAPHanaSR-angi` location, the Python hook code updates automatically through OS updates or package updates. HANA uses the hook code updates when it next restarts. With an optional own path like `/hana/shared/myHooks`, you can decouple OS updates from the hook version that you use.

   1. **[A]** The cluster requires *sudoers* configuration on each cluster node for \<sap-sid\>adm. In this example, that's achieved by creating a new file.
   
      Run the following command as root. Replace \<sid\> by lowercase SAP system ID, \<SID\> by uppercase SAP system ID and \<siteA/B\> with HANA site names chosen.

## Create SAP HANA cluster resources

1. **[1]** First, create the HANA topology resource.
### [SAPHanaSR](#tab/saphanasr)

Run the following commands on one of the Pacemaker cluster nodes:

```bash
sudo crm configure property maintenance-mode=true

# Replace <placeholders> with your instance number and HANA system ID

sudo crm configure primitive rsc_SAPHanaTopology_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> ocf:suse:SAPHanaTopology \

  meta clone-node-max="1" target-role="Started" interleave="true"
```

### [SAPHanaSR-angi](#tab/saphanasr-angi)

Run the following commands on one of the Pacemaker cluster nodes:

```bash

sudo crm configure clone cln_SAPHanaTopology_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> rsc_SAPHanaTopology_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> \
  meta clone-node-max="1" interleave="true"
```

```

SAPHanaSR-angi adds a new resource agent SAPHanaFilesystem to monitor read/write access to /hana/shared/SID. OS static mounts the /hana/shared/SID filesystem with each host having entries in /etc/fstab. SAPHanaFilesystem and Pacemaker doesn't mount the filesystem for HANA.

We recommend implementing SAPHanaFilesystem if using NFS for /hana/shared/SID location. When /hana/shared/SID is located on a block device, such as Azure managed disk, the use of  SAPHanaFilesystem is optional.

```bash
# Replace <placeholders> with your instance number and HANA system ID. 
sudo crm configure primitive rsc_SAPHanaFil_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> ocf:suse:SAPHanaFilesystem \
  op start interval="0" timeout="10" \

  params SID="<HANA SID>" InstanceNumber="<instance number>" ON_FAIL_ACTION="fence"

sudo crm configure clone cln_SAPHanaFil_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> rsc_SAPHanaFil_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> \
  meta clone-node-max="1" interleave="true"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend that you set `AUTOMATED_REGISTER` to `false` only while you complete thorough failover tests, to prevent a failed primary instance from automatically registering as secondary. When the failover tests are successfully completed, set `AUTOMATED_REGISTER` to `true`, so that after takeover, system replication automatically resumes.

Make sure that the cluster status is `OK` and that all the resources started. It doesn't matter which node the resources are running on.

sudo crm_mon -r

## Configure HANA active/read-enabled system replication in a Pacemaker cluster

In SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 01 and later versions, SAP allows an active/read-enabled setup for SAP HANA system replication. In this scenario, the secondary systems of SAP HANA system replication can be actively used for read-intensive workloads.

To support this setup in a cluster, a second virtual IP address is required so that clients can access the secondary read-enabled SAP HANA database. To ensure that the secondary replication site can still be accessed after a takeover, the cluster needs to move the virtual IP address around with the secondary of the SAPHana resource.

This section describes the extra steps that are required to manage a HANA active/read-enabled system replication in a SUSE high availability cluster that uses a second virtual IP address.

Before you proceed, make sure that you have fully configured the SUSE high availability cluster that manages SAP HANA database as described in earlier sections.

:::image type="content" source="media/sap-hana-high-availability/ha-hana-read-enabled-secondary.png" border="false" alt-text="Diagram that shows an example of SAP HANA high availability with a read-enabled secondary IP.":::

### Set up the load balancer for active/read-enabled system replication

To proceed with extra steps to provision the second virtual IP, make sure that you configured Azure Load Balancer as described in [Deploy Linux VMs manually via Azure portal](#deploy-linux-vms-manually-via-azure-portal).

For the *standard* load balancer, complete these extra steps on the same load balancer that you created earlier.

1. Create a second front-end IP pool:
   1. Open the load balancer, select **frontend IP pool**, and select **Add**.
   2. Enter the name of the second front-end IP pool (for example, **hana-secondaryIP**).
   3. Set the **Assignment** to **Static** and enter the IP address (for example, **10.0.0.14**).
   4. Select **OK**.
   5. After the new front-end IP pool is created, note the front-end IP address.
2. Create a health probe:
   1. In the load balancer, select **health probes**, and select **Add**.
   2. Enter the name of the new health probe (for example, **hana-secondaryhp**).
   3. Select **TCP** as the protocol and port **626\<instance number\>**. Keep the **Interval** value set to **5**, and the **Unhealthy threshold** value set to **2**.
   4. Select **OK**.
3. Create the load-balancing rules:
   1. In the load balancer, select **load balancing rules**, and select **Add**.
   2. Enter the name of the new load balancer rule (for example, **hana-secondarylb**).
   3. Select the front-end IP address, the back-end pool, and the health probe that you created earlier (for example, **hana-secondaryIP**, **hana-backend**, and **hana-secondaryhp**).
   4. Select **HA Ports**.
   5. Increase idle timeout to 30 minutes.
   6. Make sure that you **enable floating IP**.
   7. Select **OK**.

### Set up HANA active/read-enabled system replication

The steps to configure HANA system replication are described in [Configure SAP HANA 2.0 system replication](#configure-sap-hana-20-system-replication). If you're deploying a read-enabled secondary scenario, when you set up system replication on the second node, run the following command as \<HANA SID\>adm:

```bash
sapcontrol -nr <instance number> -function StopWait 600 10 

hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost=hn1-db-0 --remoteInstance=<instance number> --replicationMode=sync --name=<site 2> --operationMode=logreplay_readaccess 
```

### Add a secondary virtual IP address resource

You can set up the second virtual IP and the appropriate colocation constraint by using the following commands:

#### [SAPHanaSR](#tab/saphanasr)

```bash
crm configure property maintenance-mode=true

crm configure primitive rsc_secip_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 \
 meta target-role="Started" \
 operations \$id="rsc_secip_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number>-operations" \
 op monitor interval="10s" timeout="20s" \
 params ip="<secondary IP address>"

crm configure primitive rsc_secnc_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> azure-lb port=626<instance number> \
 op monitor timeout=20s interval=10 \
 meta resource-stickiness=0

crm configure group g_secip_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> rsc_secip_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> rsc_secnc_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number>

crm configure colocation col_saphana_secip_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> 4000: g_secip_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number>:Started \
 msl_SAPHana_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number>:Slave 

crm configure property maintenance-mode=false
```

#### [SAPHanaSR-angi](#tab/saphanasr-angi)

```bash
crm configure property maintenance-mode=true

crm configure primitive rsc_secip_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 \
 op monitor interval="10s" timeout="20s" \
 params ip="<secondary IP address>"

crm configure primitive rsc_secnc_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> azure-lb port=626<instance number> \
 op monitor timeout=20s interval=10 \
 meta resource-stickiness=0

crm configure group g_secip_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> rsc_secip_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> rsc_secnc_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number>

crm configure colocation col_saphana_secip_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> 4000: g_secip_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number>:Started \
 mst_SAPHanaCon_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number>:Unpromoted 

crm configure property maintenance-mode=false
```

---


Make sure that the cluster status is `OK` and that all the resources started. The second virtual IP runs on the secondary site along with the SAPHana secondary resource.

```bash
sudo crm_mon -r

# Online: [ hn1-db-0 hn1-db-1 ]
#
# Full list of resources:
#
# stonith-sbd     (stonith:external/sbd): Started hn1-db-0

#     Started: [ hn1-db-0 hn1-db-1 ]
# Master/Slave Set: msl_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03]
#     Masters: [ hn1-db-0 ]
#     Slaves: [ hn1-db-1 ]
# Resource Group: g_ip_HN1_HDB03
#     rsc_ip_HN1_HDB03   (ocf::heartbeat:IPaddr2):       Started hn1-db-0
#     rsc_nc_HN1_HDB03   (ocf::heartbeat:azure-lb):      Started hn1-db-0
# Resource Group: g_secip_HN1_HDB03:
#     rsc_secip_HN1_HDB03       (ocf::heartbeat:IPaddr2):        Started hn1-db-1
#     rsc_secnc_HN1_HDB03       (ocf::heartbeat:azure-lb):       Started hn1-db-1

```

The next section describes the typical set of failover tests to execute.

Considerations when you test a HANA cluster that's configured with a read-enabled secondary:

- When you migrate the `SAPHana_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number>` cluster resource to `hn1-db-1`, the second virtual IP moves to `hn1-db-0`. If you have configured `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="false"` and HANA system replication isn't registered automatically, the second virtual IP runs on `hn1-db-0` because the server is available and cluster services are online.  

- When you test a server crash, the second virtual IP resources (`rsc_secip_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number>`) and the Azure load balancer port resource (`rsc_secnc_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number>`) run on the primary server alongside the primary virtual IP resources. While the secondary server is down, the applications that are connected to a read-enabled HANA database connect to the primary HANA database. The behavior is expected because you don't want applications that are connected to a read-enabled HANA database to be inaccessible while the secondary server is unavailable.
  
- When the secondary server is available and the cluster services are online, the second virtual IP and port resources automatically move to the secondary server, even though HANA system replication might not be registered as secondary. Make sure that you register the secondary HANA database as read-enabled before you start cluster services on that server. You can configure the HANA instance cluster resource to automatically register the secondary by setting the parameter `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true"`.

- During failover and fallback, the existing connections for applications, which are then using the second virtual IP to connect to the HANA database, might be interrupted.  

## Test the cluster setup

This section describes how you can test your setup. Every test assumes that you're signed in as root and that the SAP HANA master is running on the `hn1-db-0` VM.

### Test the migration

Before you start the test, make sure that Pacemaker doesn't have any failed action (run `crm_mon -r`), that there are no unexpected location constraints (for example, leftovers of a migration test), and that HANA is in sync state, for example, by running `SAPHanaSR-showAttr`.

You can migrate the SAP HANA master node by running the following command:

```bash
crm resource move msl_SAPHana_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> hn1-db-1 force
```

The cluster would migrate the SAP HANA master node and the group containing virtual IP address to `hn1-db-1`.

When the migration is finished, the `crm_mon -r` output looks like this example:

```bash

```

With `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="false"`, the cluster wouldn't restart the failed HANA database or register it against the new primary on `hn1-db-0`. In this case, configure the HANA instance as secondary by running this command:

```bash
su - <hana sid>adm

# Stop the HANA instance, just in case it is running
hn1adm@hn1-db-0:/usr/sap/HN1/HDB03> sapcontrol -nr <instance number> -function StopWait 600 10
hn1adm@hn1-db-0:/usr/sap/HN1/HDB03> hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost=hn1-db-1 --remoteInstance=<instance number> --replicationMode=sync --name=<site 1>
```

The migration creates location constraints that need to be deleted again:

```bash
# Switch back to root and clean up the failed state
exit
hn1-db-0:~ # crm resource clear msl_SAPHana_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number>
```

You also need to clean up the state of the secondary node resource:

```bash
hn1-db-0:~ # crm resource cleanup msl_SAPHana_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> hn1-db-0
```

Monitor the state of the HANA resource by using `crm_mon -r`. When HANA is started on `hn1-db-0`, the output looks like this example:

```bash
Online: [ hn1-db-0 hn1-db-1 ]

### Blocking network communication

Resource state before starting the test:

   ```bash
   Online: [ hn1-db-0 hn1-db-1 ]
   
   Full list of resources:
   stonith-sbd     (stonith:external/sbd): Started hn1-db-1

    Master/Slave Set: msl_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03]
        Masters: [ hn1-db-1 ]
        Slaves: [ hn1-db-0 ]
    Resource Group: g_ip_HN1_HDB03

        rsc_nc_HN1_HDB03   (ocf::heartbeat:azure-lb):      Started hn1-db-1
   ```

Execute firewall rule to block the communication on one of the nodes.

   ```bash
   # Execute iptable rule on hn1-db-1 (10.0.0.6) to block the incoming and outgoing traffic to hn1-db-0 (10.0.0.5)
   iptables -A INPUT -s 10.0.0.5 -j DROP; iptables -A OUTPUT -d 10.0.0.5 -j DROP
   ```

When cluster nodes can't communicate to each other, there's a risk of a split-brain scenario. In such situations, cluster nodes will try to simultaneously fence each other, resulting in fence race.

When configuring a fencing device, it's recommended to configure [`pcmk_delay_max`](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000019110) property. So, in the event of split-brain scenario, the cluster introduces a random delay up to the `pcmk_delay_max` value, to the fencing action on each node. The node with the shortest delay will be selected for fencing.

Additionally, to ensure that the node running the HANA master takes priority and wins the fence race in a split brain scenario, it's recommended to set  [`priority-fencing-delay`](https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/15-SP3/single-html/SLE-HA-administration/#pro-ha-storage-protect-fencing) property in the cluster configuration. By enabling priority-fencing-delay property, the cluster can introduce an additional delay in the fencing action specifically on the node hosting HANA master resource, allowing the node to win the fence race.

Execute below command to delete the firewall rule.

   ```bash
   # If the iptables rule set on the server gets reset after a reboot, the rules will be cleared out. In case they have not been reset, please proceed to remove the iptables rule using the following command.
   iptables -D INPUT -s 10.0.0.5 -j DROP; iptables -D OUTPUT -d 10.0.0.5 -j DROP
   ```

### Test SBD fencing

You can test the setup of SBD by killing the inquisitor process:

```bash
hn1-db-0:~ # ps aux | grep sbd
root       1912  0.0  0.0  85420 11740 ?        SL   12:25   0:00 sbd: inquisitor

```

The `<HANA SID>-db-<database 1>` cluster node reboots. The Pacemaker service might not restart. Make sure that you start it again.

### Test a manual failover

You can test a manual failover by stopping the Pacemaker service on the `hn1-db-0` node:

```bash
service pacemaker stop
```

After the failover, you can start the service again. If you set `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="false"`, the SAP HANA resource on the `hn1-db-0` node fails to start as secondary.

In this case, configure the HANA instance as secondary by running this command:

```bash
service pacemaker start
su - <hana sid>adm

# Stop the HANA instance, just in case it is running
sapcontrol -nr <instance number> -function StopWait 600 10
hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost=hn1-db-1 --remoteInstance=<instance number> --replicationMode=sync --name=<site 1> 

# Switch back to root and clean up the failed state
exit
crm resource cleanup msl_SAPHana_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> hn1-db-0
```

### SUSE tests

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that the OS that you select is SAP certified for SAP HANA on the specific VM types you plan to use. You can look up SAP HANA-certified VM types and their OS releases in [SAP HANA Certified IaaS Platforms](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/#/solutions?filters=v:deCertified;ve:24;iaas;v:125;v:105;v:99;v:120). Make sure that you look at the details of the VM type you plan to use to get the complete list of SAP HANA-supported OS releases for that VM type.

Run all test cases that are listed in the SAP HANA SR Performance Optimized Scenario guide or SAP HANA SR Cost Optimized Scenario guide, depending on your scenario. You can find the guides listed in [SLES for SAP best practices][sles-for-sap-bp].

The following tests are a copy of the test descriptions of the SAP HANA SR Performance Optimized Scenario SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 12 SP1 guide. For an up-to-date version, also read the guide itself. Always make sure that HANA is in sync before you start the test, and make sure that the Pacemaker configuration is correct.

In the following test descriptions, we assume `PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER="true"` and `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="false"`.

> [!NOTE]
> The following tests are designed to be run in sequence. Each test depends on the exit state of the preceding test.

1. Test 1: Stop the primary database on node 1.

   The resource state before starting the test:

   ```output

   ```

   Run the following commands as \<hana sid\>adm on the `hn1-db-0` node:

   ```bash
   hn1adm@hn1-db-0:/usr/sap/HN1/HDB03> HDB stop
   ```

   Pacemaker detects the stopped HANA instance and fails over to the other node. When the failover is finished, the HANA instance on the `hn1-db-0` node is stopped because Pacemaker doesn't automatically register the node as HANA secondary.

   Run the following commands to register the `hn1-db-0` node as secondary and clean up the failed resource:

   ```bash
   hn1adm@hn1-db-0:/usr/sap/HN1/HDB03> hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost=hn1-db-1 --remoteInstance=<instance number> --replicationMode=sync --name=<site 1>
   
   # run as root

   Run the following commands to start Pacemaker, clean the SBD messages for the `hn1-db-1` node, register the `hn1-db-1` node as secondary, and clean up the failed resource:

   ```bash
   # run as root
   # list the SBD device(s)
   hn1-db-1:~ # cat /etc/sysconfig/sbd | grep SBD_DEVICE=
   # SBD_DEVICE="/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-36001405772fe8401e6240c985857e116;/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-36001405034a84428af24ddd8c3a3e9e1;/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-36001405cdd5ac8d40e548449318510c3"

      rsc_nc_HN1_HDB03   (ocf::heartbeat:azure-lb):      Started hn1-db-0
   ```

   Run the following commands as \<hana sid\>adm on the `hn1-db-1` node:

   ```bash
   hn1adm@hn1-db-1:/usr/sap/HN1/HDB03> HDB stop
   ```

   Pacemaker detects the stopped HANA instance and marks the resource as failed on the `hn1-db-1` node. Pacemaker automatically restarts the HANA instance.

   Run the following command to clean up the failed state:

   ```bash
   # run as root
   hn1-db-1>:~ # crm resource cleanup msl_SAPHana_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> hn1-db-1
   ```

   The resource state after the test:

1. Test 8: Crash the secondary database on node 2.

   The resource state before starting the test:

   ```output
   Clone Set: cln_SAPHanaTopology_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_SAPHanaTopology_HN1_HDB03]
      Started: [ hn1-db-0 hn1-db-1 ]

      rsc_nc_HN1_HDB03   (ocf::heartbeat:azure-lb):      Started hn1-db-0
   ```

   Run the following commands as \<hana sid\>adm on the `hn1-db-1` node:

   ```bash
   hn1adm@hn1-db-1:/usr/sap/HN1/HDB03> HDB kill-9
   ```

   Pacemaker detects the killed HANA instance and marks the resource as failed on the `hn1-db-1` node. Run the following command to clean up the failed state. Pacemaker then automatically restarts the HANA instance.

   ```bash
   # run as root
   hn1-db-1:~ # crm resource cleanup msl_SAPHana_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> HN1-db-1
   ```

   The resource state after the test:

1. Test 9: Crash the secondary site node (node 2) that's running the secondary HANA database.

   The resource state before starting the test:

   ```output
   Clone Set: cln_SAPHanaTopology_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_SAPHanaTopology_HN1_HDB03]
      Started: [ hn1-db-0 hn1-db-1 ]

      rsc_nc_HN1_HDB03   (ocf::heartbeat:azure-lb):      Started hn1-db-0
   ```

   Run the following commands as root on the `hn1-db-1` node:

   ```bash
   hn1-db-1:~ # echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger
   ```

   Pacemaker detects the killed cluster node and fenced the node. When the fenced node is rebooted, Pacemaker doesn't start automatically.

   Run the following commands to start Pacemaker, clean the SBD messages for the `hn1-db-1` node, and clean up the failed resource:

   ```bash
   # run as root
   # list the SBD device(s)
   hn1-db-1:~ # cat /etc/sysconfig/sbd | grep SBD_DEVICE=

   ```

1. Test 10: Crash primary database indexserver

   This test is relevant only when you have set up the susChkSrv hook as outlined in [Implement HANA resource agents](#implement-hana-resource-agents).

   The resource state before starting the test:

   ```output
   Clone Set: cln_SAPHanaTopology_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_SAPHanaTopology_HN1_HDB03]
      Started: [ hn1-db-0 hn1-db-1 ]
   Master/Slave Set: msl_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03]
      Masters: [ hn1-db-0 ]
      Slaves: [ hn1-db-1 ]
   Resource Group: g_ip_HN1_HDB03
      rsc_ip_HN1_HDB03   (ocf::heartbeat:IPaddr2):       Started hn1-db-0
      rsc_nc_HN1_HDB03   (ocf::heartbeat:azure-lb):      Started hn1-db-0
   ```

   Run the following commands as root on the `hn1-db-0` node:

   ```bash
   hn1-db-0:~ # killall -9 hdbindexserver
   ```

   When the indexserver is terminated, the susChkSrv hook detects the event and triggers an action to fence 'hn1-db-0' node and initiate a takeover process.

   Run the following commands to register `hn1-db-0` node as secondary and clean up the failed resource:

   ```bash
   # run as <hana sid>adm
   hn1adm@hn1-db-0:/usr/sap/HN1/HDB03> hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost=hn1-db-1 --remoteInstance=<instance number> --replicationMode=sync --name=<site 1>
   
   # run as root
   hn1-db-0:~ # crm resource cleanup msl_SAPHana_<HANA SID>_HDB<instance number> hn1-db-0
   ```

   The resource state after the test:

   ```output
   Clone Set: cln_SAPHanaTopology_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_SAPHanaTopology_HN1_HDB03]
      Started: [ hn1-db-0 hn1-db-1 ]
   Master/Slave Set: msl_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03 [rsc_SAPHana_HN1_HDB03]
      Masters: [ hn1-db-1 ]
      Slaves: [ hn1-db-0 ]
   Resource Group: g_ip_HN1_HDB03
      rsc_ip_HN1_HDB03   (ocf::heartbeat:IPaddr2):       Started hn1-db-1
      rsc_nc_HN1_HDB03   (ocf::heartbeat:azure-lb):      Started hn1-db-1
   ```

   You can execute a comparable test case by causing the indexserver on the secondary node to crash. In the event of indexserver crash, the susChkSrv hook recognizes  the occurrence and initiate an action to fence the secondary node.
