## Control plane operations

You can deploy or update the control plane by using the [deploy_controlplane](bash/deploy-controlplane.md) shell script.

You can bootstrap the deployer in the control plane by using the [install_deployer](bash/install-deployer.md) shell script.

You can bootstrap the SAP library in the control plane by using the [install_library](bash/install-library.md) shell script.
