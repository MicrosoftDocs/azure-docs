# Use SAP Deployment Automation Framework from Azure DevOps Services

Azure DevOps streamlines the deployment process by providing pipelines that you can run to perform the infrastructure deployment and the configuration and SAP installation activities.

You can use Azure Repos to store your configuration files and use Azure Pipelines to deploy and configure the infrastructure and the SAP application.

## Sign up for Azure DevOps Services

To use Azure DevOps Services, you need an Azure DevOps organization. An organization is used to connect groups of related projects. Use your work or school account to automatically connect your organization to your Microsoft Entra ID. To create an account, open [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/) and either sign in or create a new account.

## Configure Azure DevOps Services for SAP Deployment Automation Framework

You can use the following script to do a basic installation of Azure DevOps Services for SAP Deployment Automation Framework.

Open PowerShell ISE and copy the following script and update the parameters to match your environment.

```powershell
    $Env:SDAF_ADO_ORGANIZATION = "https://dev.azure.com/ORGANIZATIONNAME"
    $Env:SDAF_ADO_PROJECT = "SAP Deployment Automation Framework"
    $Env:SDAF_CONTROL_PLANE_CODE = "MGMT"
    $Env:SDAF_ControlPlaneSubscriptionID = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    $Env:ARM_TENANT_ID="zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz"

    $Env:MSI_OBJECT_ID = $null

    $branchName = "main"
        
    $UniqueIdentifier = "SDAF" + $ShortCode
    
    if ($Env:ARM_TENANT_ID.Length -eq 0) {
      az login --output none --only-show-errors --scope https://graph.microsoft.com//.default
    }
    else {
      az login --output none --tenant $Env:ARM_TENANT_ID --only-show-errors --scope https://graph.microsoft.com//.default
    }

    az config set extension.use_dynamic_install=yes_without_prompt --only-show-errors

    az extension add --name azure-devops --only-show-errors

    $differentTenant = Read-Host "Is your Azure DevOps organization hosted in a different tenant than the one you are currently logged in to? y/n"
    if ($differentTenant -eq 'y') {
        $env:AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT = Read-Host "Please enter your Personal Access Token (PAT) with permissions to add new projects, manage agent pools to the Azure DevOps organization $Env:ADO_Organization"
        try {
            az devops project list
        }
        catch {
            $_
        }
    }
    
    $confirmationWebAppDeployment = Read-Host "Do you want to use the Web Application for editing the configuration files (recommended) y/n?"
    if ($confirmationWebAppDeployment -eq 'y') {
        $Env:SDAF_WEBAPP = "true"
        $confirmation = Read-Host "Do you want to create a new Application registration (needed for the Web Application) y/n?"
        if ($confirmation -eq 'y') {
            $Env:SDAF_APP_NAME = "SDAF " + $UniqueIdentifier + " SDAF Control Plane"
        }
        else {
            $Env:SDAF_APP_NAME = Read-Host "Please provide the Application registration name"
        }
    }
    else {
        $Env:SDAF_WEBAPP = "false"
    }
    
    $Env:SDAF_AuthenticationMethod = 'Managed Identity'
    
    $confirmationDeployment = Read-Host "Do you want to use Managed Identities for the deployment (recommended) y/n?"
    
    if ($confirmationDeployment -eq 'n') {
        $Env:SDAF_AuthenticationMethod = 'Service Principal'
         
        $confirmation = Read-Host "Do you want to create a new Service Principal for the Control plane y/n?"
        if ($confirmation -eq 'y') {
            $Env:SDAF_MGMT_SPN_NAME = "SDAF " + $UniqueIdentifier + $Env:SDAF_CONTROL_PLANE_CODE + " SPN"
        }
        else {
            $Env:SDAF_MGMT_SPN_NAME = Read-Host "Please provide the Control Plane Service Principal Name"
        }
        
    }
        
    if ( $PSVersionTable.Platform -eq "Unix") {
        if ( Test-Path "SDAF") {
        }
        else {
            $sdaf_path = New-Item -Path "SDAF" -Type Directory
        }
    }
    else {
        $sdaf_path = Join-Path -Path $Env:HOMEDRIVE -ChildPath "SDAF"
        if ( Test-Path $sdaf_path) {
        }
        else {
            New-Item -Path $sdaf_path -Type Directory
        }
    }
        
    Set-Location -Path $sdaf_path
        
    if ( Test-Path "New-SDAFDevopsProject.ps1") {
        if ( $PSVersionTable.Platform -eq "Unix") {
            Remove-Item "New-SDAFDevopsProject.ps1"
        }
        else {
            Remove-Item ".\New-SDAFDevopsProject.ps1"
        }
    }
        
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/sap-automation/$branchName/deploy/scripts/New-SDAFDevopsProject.ps1 -OutFile New-SDAFDevopsProject.ps1 
    
    
    if ( $PSVersionTable.Platform -eq "Unix") {
        Unblock-File ./New-SDAFDevopsProject.ps1
        ./New-SDAFDevopsProject.ps1
    }
    else {
        Unblock-File .\New-SDAFDevopsProject.ps1
        .\New-SDAFDevopsProject.ps1
    }
    
```

Run the script and follow the instructions. The script opens browser windows for authentication and for performing tasks in the Azure DevOps project.

You can choose to either run the code directly from GitHub or you can import a copy of the code into your Azure DevOps project.

To confirm that the project was created, go to the Azure DevOps portal and select the project. Ensure that the repo was populated and that the pipelines were created.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run the following steps on your local workstation. Also ensure that you have the latest Azure CLI installed by running the `az upgrade` command.

### Configure Azure DevOps Services artifacts for a new workload zone

Use the following script to deploy the artifacts that are needed to support a new workload zone. This process creates the variable group and the service connection in Azure DevOps and, optionally, the deployment service principal.

Open PowerShell ISE and copy the following script and update the parameters to match your environment.

```powershell
    $Env:SDAF_ADO_ORGANIZATION = "https://dev.azure.com/ORGANIZATIONNAME"
    $Env:SDAF_ADO_PROJECT = "SAP Deployment Automation Framework"
    $Env:SDAF_WorkloadZoneSubscriptionID = "yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy"
    $Env:ARM_TENANT_ID="zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz"
    
    if ( $PSVersionTable.Platform -eq "Unix") {
        if ( Test-Path "SDAF") {
        }
        else {
            $sdaf_path = New-Item -Path "SDAF" -Type Directory
        }
    }
    else {
        $sdaf_path = Join-Path -Path $Env:HOMEDRIVE -ChildPath "SDAF"
        if ( Test-Path $sdaf_path) {
        }
        else {
            New-Item -Path $sdaf_path -Type Directory
        }
    }

    $branchName = "main"
    
    Set-Location -Path $sdaf_path
    
    if ( Test-Path "New-SDAFDevopsWorkloadZone.ps1") {
        remove-item .\New-SDAFDevopsWorkloadZone.ps1
    }
    
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/sap-automation/$branchName/deploy/scripts/New-SDAFDevopsWorkloadZone.ps1 -OutFile .\New-SDAFDevopsWorkloadZone.ps1 ; .\New-SDAFDevopsWorkloadZone.ps1
    
```

### Create a sample control plane configuration

You can run the `Create Sample Deployer Configuration` pipeline to create a sample configuration for the control plane. When it's running, choose the appropriate Azure region. You can also control if you want to deploy Azure Firewall and Azure Bastion.

## Manual configuration of Azure DevOps Services for SAP Deployment Automation Framework

You can manually configure Azure DevOps Services for SAP Deployment Automation Framework.

### Create a new project

You can use Azure Repos to store the code from the sap-automation GitHub repository and the environment configuration files.

Open [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) and create a new project by selecting **New Project** and entering the project details. The project contains the Azure Repos source control repository and Azure Pipelines for performing deployment activities.

If you don't see **New Project**, ensure that you have permissions to create new projects in the organization.

Record the URL of the project.

### Import the repository

Start by importing the SAP Deployment Automation Framework Bootstrap GitHub repository into Azure Repos.

Go to the **Repositories** section and select **Import a repository**. Import the `https://github.com/Azure/sap-automation-bootstrap.git` repository into Azure DevOps. For more information, see [Import a repository](/azure/devops/repos/git/import-git-repository?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true).

If you're unable to import a repository, you can create the repository manually. Then you can import the content from the SAP Deployment Automation Framework GitHub Bootstrap repository to it.

### Create the repository for manual import

Only do this step if you're unable to import the repository directly.

To create the **workspaces** repository, in the **Repos** section, under **Project settings**, select **Create**.

Choose the repository, enter **Git**, and provide a name for the repository. For example, use **SAP Configuration Repository**.

### Clone the repository

To provide a more comprehensive editing capability of the content, you can clone the repository to a local folder and edit the contents locally.

To clone the repository to a local folder, on the **Repos** section of the portal, under **Files**, select **Clone**. For more information, see [Clone a repository](/azure/devops/repos/git/clone?view=azure-devops#clone-an-azure-repos-git-repo&preserve-view=true).

:::image type="content" source="./media/devops/automation-repo-clone.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to clone the repository.":::

### Manually import the repository content by using a local clone

You can also manually download the content from the SAP Deployment Automation Framework repository and add it to your local clone of the Azure DevOps repository.

Go to the `https://github.com/Azure/SAP-automation-samples` repository and download the repository content as a .zip file. Select **Code** and choose **Download ZIP**.

Copy the content from the .zip file to the root folder of your local clone.

Open the local folder in Visual Studio Code. You should see that changes need to be synchronized by the indicator by the source control icon shown here.

:::image type="content" source="./media/devops/automation-vscode-changes.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows that source code is changed.":::

Select the source control icon and provide a message about the change. For example, enter **Import from GitHub** and select Ctrl+Enter to commit the changes. Next, select **Sync Changes** to synchronize the changes back to the repository.

### Choose the source for the Terraform and Ansible code

You can either run the SAP Deployment Automation Framework code directly from GitHub or you can import it locally.

#### Run the code from a local repository

If you want to run the SAP Deployment Automation Framework code from the local Azure DevOps project, you need to create a separate code repository and a configuration repository in the Azure DevOps project:

- **Name of configuration repository**: `Same as the DevOps Project name`. Source is `https://github.com/Azure/sap-automation-bootstrap.git`.
- **Name of code repository**: `sap-automation`. Source is `https://github.com/Azure/sap-automation.git`.
- **Name of sample and template repository**: `sap-samples`. Source is `https://github.com/Azure/sap-automation-samples.git`.

#### Run the code directly from GitHub

If you want to run the code directly from GitHub, you need to provide credentials for Azure DevOps to be able to pull the content from GitHub.

#### Create the GitHub service connection

To pull the code from GitHub, you need a GitHub service connection. For more information, see [Manage service connections](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true).

To create the service connection, go to **Project Settings** and under the **Pipelines** section, go to **Service connections**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/devops/automation-create-service-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to create a service connection for GitHub.":::

Select **GitHub** as the service connection type. Select **Azure Pipelines** in the **OAuth Configuration** dropdown.

Select **Authorize** to sign in to GitHub.

Enter a service connection name, for instance, **SDAF Connection to GitHub**. Ensure that the **Grant access permission to all pipelines** checkbox is selected. Select **Save** to save the service connection.

## Set up the web app

The automation framework optionally provisions a web app as a part of the control plane to assist with the SAP workload zone and system configuration files. If you want to use the web app, you must first create an app registration for authentication purposes. Open Azure Cloud Shell and run the following commands.

# [Linux](#tab/linux)

Replace `MGMT` with your environment, as necessary.

```bash
echo '[{"resourceAppId":"00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000","resourceAccess":[{"id":"e1fe6dd8-ba31-4d61-89e7-88639da4683d","type":"Scope"}]}]' >> manifest.json

TF_VAR_app_registration_app_id=$(az ad app create --display-name MGMT-webapp-registration --enable-id-token-issuance true --sign-in-audience AzureADMyOrg --required-resource-access @manifest.json --query "appId" | tr -d '"')

echo $TF_VAR_app_registration_app_id

az ad app credential reset --id $TF_VAR_app_registration_app_id --append --query "password"

rm manifest.json
```

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

Replace `MGMT` with your environment, as necessary.

```powershell
Add-Content -Path manifest.json -Value '[{"resourceAppId":"00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000","resourceAccess":[{"id":"e1fe6dd8-ba31-4d61-89e7-88639da4683d","type":"Scope"}]}]'

$TF_VAR_app_registration_app_id=(az ad app create --display-name MGMT-webapp-registration --enable-id-token-issuance true --sign-in-audience AzureADMyOrg --required-resource-access .\manifest.json --query "appId").Replace('"',"")

echo $TF_VAR_app_registration_app_id

az ad app credential reset --id $TF_VAR_app_registration_app_id --append --query "password"

del manifest.json
```
---

Save the app registration ID and password values for later use.

## Import the cleanup task from Visual Studio Marketplace

The pipelines use a custom task to perform cleanup activities post deployment. You can install the custom task from [Post Build Cleanup](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mspremier.PostBuildCleanup). Install it to your Azure DevOps organization before you run the pipelines.

## Preparations for a self-hosted agent

1. Create an agent pool by going to **Organizational Settings**. Under the **Pipelines** section, select **Agent Pools** > **Add Pool**. Select **Self-hosted** as the pool type. Name the pool to align with the control plane environment. For example, use `MGMT-WEEU-POOL`. Ensure that **Grant access permission to all pipelines** is selected and select **Create** to create the pool.

1. Sign in with the user account you plan to use in your [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) organization.

1. From your home page, open your user settings and select **Personal access tokens**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/devops/automation-select-personal-access-tokens.jpg" alt-text="Diagram that shows the creation of a personal access token.":::

1. Create a personal access token with these settings:

   - **Agent Pools**: Select **Read & manage**.
   - **Build**: Select **Read & execute**.
   - **Code**: Select **Read & write**.
   - **Variable Groups**: Select **Read, create, & manage**.

      Write down the created token value.

## Variable definitions

The deployment pipelines are configured to use a set of predefined parameter values defined by using variable groups.

### Common variables

Common variables are used by all the deployment pipelines. They're stored in a variable group called `SDAF-General`.

Create a new variable group named `SDAF-General` by using the **Library** page in the **Pipelines** section. Add the following variables:

| Variable                           | Value                                   | Notes                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deployment_Configuration_Path      | WORKSPACES                              | For testing the sample configuration, use `samples/WORKSPACES` instead of WORKSPACES.        |
| Branch                             | main                                    |                                                                                             |
| S-Username                         | `<SAP Support user account name>`       |                                                                                             |
| S-Password                         | `<SAP Support user password>`           | Change the variable type to secret by selecting the lock icon.                                   |
| `tf_version`                       | 1.6.0                                   | The Terraform version to use. See [Terraform download](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).  |

Save the variables.

Alternatively, you can use the Azure DevOps CLI to set up the groups.

```bash
s-user="<SAP Support user account name>"
s-password="<SAP Support user password>"

az devops login

az pipelines variable-group create --name SDAF-General --variables ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=false Deployment_Configuration_Path=WORKSPACES Branch=main S-Username=$s-user S-Password=$s-password tf_version=1.3.0 --output yaml

```

Remember to assign permissions for all pipelines by using **Pipeline permissions**.

### Environment-specific variables

Because each environment might have different deployment credentials, you need to create a variable group per environment. For example, use `SDAF-MGMT`,`SDAF-DEV`, and `SDAF-QA`.

Create a new variable group named `SDAF-MGMT` for the control plane environment by using the **Library** page in the **Pipelines** section. Add the following variables:

| Variable                        | Value                                                              | Notes                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent                           | `Azure Pipelines` or the name of the agent pool                    | This pool is created in a later step.         |

| CP_ARM_OBJECT_ID                | `Service principal object ID`                                |                                                          |
| CP_ARM_CLIENT_SECRET            | `Service principal password`                                      | Change the variable type to secret by selecting the lock icon. |
| CP_ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID          | `Target subscription ID`                                          |                                                          |

| FENCING_SPN_TENANT              | `Service principal tenant ID` for the fencing agent               | Required for highly available deployments that use a service principal for the fencing agent.               |
| PAT                             | `<Personal Access Token>`                                          | Use the personal token defined in the previous step.      |
| POOL                            | `<Agent Pool name>`                                                | The agent pool to use for this environment.               |
|                                 |                                                                    |                                                          |

Save the variables.

Remember to assign permissions for all pipelines by using **Pipeline permissions**.

When you use the web app, ensure that the Build Service has at least Contribute permissions.

You can use the clone functionality to create the next environment variable group. APP_REGISTRATION_APP_ID, WEB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET, SDAF_GENERAL_GROUP_ID, WORKLOADZONE_PIPELINE_ID and SYSTEM_PIPELINE_ID are only needed for the SDAF-MGMT group.

## Create a service connection

To remove the Azure resources, you need an Azure Resource Manager service connection. For more information, see [Manage service connections](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true).

To create the service connection, go to **Project Settings**. Under the **Pipelines** section, select **Service connections**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/devops/automation-create-service-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to create a service connection.":::

Select **Azure Resource Manager** as the service connection type and **Service principal (manual)** as the authentication method. Enter the target subscription, which is typically the control plane subscription. Enter the service principal details. Select **Verify** to validate the credentials. For more information on how to create a service principal, see [Create a service principal](deploy-control-plane.md#prepare-the-deployment-credentials).

Enter a **Service connection name**, for instance, use `Connection to MGMT subscription`. Ensure that the **Grant access permission to all pipelines** checkbox is selected. Select **Verify and save** to save the service connection.

## Permissions

Most of the pipelines add files to the Azure Repos and therefore require pull permissions. On **Project Settings**, under the **Repositories** section, select the **Security** tab of the source code repository and assign Contribute permissions to the `Build Service`.

:::image type="content" source="./media/devops/automation-repo-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows repository permissions.":::

## Deploy the control plane

Newly created pipelines might not be visible in the default view. Select the **Recent** tab and go back to **All tabs** to view the new pipelines.

Select the **Control plane deployment** pipeline and enter the configuration names for the deployer and the SAP library. Select **Run** to deploy the control plane. Make sure to select the **Deploy the configuration web application** checkbox if you want to set up the configuration web app.

### Configure the Azure DevOps Services self-hosted agent manually

Manual configuration is only needed if the Azure DevOps Services agent isn't automatically configured. Check that the agent pool is empty before you proceed.

To connect to the deployer:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Go to the resource group that contains the deployer virtual machine.

1. Connect to the virtual machine by using Azure Bastion.

1. The default username is **azureadm**.

1. Select **SSH Private Key from Azure Key Vault**.

1. Select the subscription that contains the control plane.

1. Select the deployer key vault.

1. From the list of secrets, select the secret that ends with **-sshkey**.

1. Connect to the virtual machine.

Run the following script to configure the deployer:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Azure_SAP_Automated_Deployment

cd ~/Azure_SAP_Automated_Deployment

git clone https://github.com/Azure/sap-automation.git

cd sap-automation/deploy/scripts

./configure_deployer.sh
```

Reboot the deployer, reconnect, and run the following script to set up the Azure DevOps agent:

```bash
cd ~/Azure_SAP_Automated_Deployment/

$DEPLOYMENT_REPO_PATH/deploy/scripts/setup_ado.sh
```

Accept the license and, when you're prompted for the server URL, enter the URL you captured when you created the Azure DevOps project. For authentication, select **PAT** and enter the token value from the previous step.

When prompted, enter the application pool name that you created in the previous step. Accept the default agent name and the default work folder name. The agent is now configured and starts.

## Deploy the control plane web application

Selecting the `deploy the web app infrastructure` parameter when you run the control plane deployment pipeline provisions the infrastructure necessary for hosting the web app. The **Deploy web app** pipeline publishes the application's software to that infrastructure.

Wait for the deployment to finish. Select the **Extensions** tab and follow the instructions to finalize the configuration. Update the `reply-url` values for the app registration.

As a result of running the control plane pipeline, part of the web app URL that is needed is stored in a variable named `WEBAPP_URL_BASE` in your environment-specific variable group. At any time, you can update the URLs of the registered application web app by using the following command.

# [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
webapp_url_base=<WEBAPP_URL_BASE>
az ad app update --id $TF_VAR_app_registration_app_id --web-home-page-url https://${webapp_url_base}.azurewebsites.net --web-redirect-uris https://${webapp_url_base}.azurewebsites.net/ https://${webapp_url_base}.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback
```

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

```powershell
$webapp_url_base="<WEBAPP_URL_BASE>"
az ad app update --id $TF_VAR_app_registration_app_id --web-home-page-url https://${webapp_url_base}.azurewebsites.net --web-redirect-uris https://${webapp_url_base}.azurewebsites.net/ https://${webapp_url_base}.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback
```
---
You also need to grant reader permissions to the app service system-assigned managed identity. Go to the app service resource. On the left side, select **Identity**. On the **System assigned** tab, select **Azure role assignments** > **Add role assignment**. Select **Subscription** as the scope and **Reader** as the role. Then select **Save**. Without this step, the web app dropdown functionality will not work.

You should now be able to visit the web app and use it to deploy SAP workload zones and SAP system infrastructure.
