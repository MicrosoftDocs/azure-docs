# Tutorial: Use custom allocation policies with Device Provisioning Service (DPS)

Custom allocation policies give you more control over how devices are assigned to your IoT hubs. With custom allocation policies, you can define your own allocation policies when the policies provided by the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS) don't meet the requirements of your scenario. A custom allocation policy is implemented in a webhook hosted in [Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md) and configured on one or more individual enrollments and/or enrollment groups. When a device registers with DPS using a configured enrollment entry, DPS calls the webhook to find out which IoT hub the device should be registered to and, optionally, its initial state. To learn more, see [Understand custom allocation policies](concepts-custom-allocation.md).

This tutorial demonstrates a custom allocation policy using an Azure Function written in C#. Devices are assigned to one of two IoT hubs representing a *Contoso Toasters Division* and a *Contoso Heat Pumps Division*. Devices requesting provisioning must have a registration ID with one of the following suffixes to be accepted for provisioning:

* **-contoso-tstrsd-007** for the Contoso Toasters Division
* **-contoso-hpsd-088** for the Contoso Heat Pumps Division

Devices are simulated using a provisioning sample included in the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c).

In this tutorial, you'll do the following:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Use the Azure CLI to create a DPS instance and to create and link two Contoso division IoT hubs (**Contoso Toasters Division** and **Contoso Heat Pumps Division**) to it.
> * Create an Azure Function that implements the custom allocation policy.
> * Create a new enrollment group uses the Azure Function for the custom allocation policy.
> * Create device symmetric keys for two simulated devices.
> * Set up the development environment for the Azure IoT C SDK.
> * Simulate the devices and verify that they are provisioned according to the example code in the custom allocation policy.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are for a Windows development environment. For Linux or macOS, see the appropriate section in [Prepare your development environment](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/master/doc/devbox_setup.md) in the SDK documentation.

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) 2022 with the ['Desktop development with C++'](/cpp/ide/using-the-visual-studio-ide-for-cpp-desktop-development) workload enabled. Visual Studio 2015 and Visual Studio 2017 are also supported.

- Git installed. For more information, see [Git downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

- Azure CLI installed. For more information, see [How to install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Or, you can run the commands in this tutorial in the Bash environment in [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

## Create the provisioning service and two IoT hubs

In this section, you use the Azure Cloud Shell to create a provisioning service and two IoT hubs representing the **Contoso Toasters Division** and the **Contoso Heat Pumps division**.

1. First, set environment variables in your workspace to simplify the commands in this tutorial.

   The DPS and IoT Hub names must be globally unique. Replace the `SUFFIX` placeholder with your own value.

   Also, the Azure Function code you create later in this tutorial looks for IoT hubs that have either `-toasters-` or `-heatpumps-` in their names. If you change the suggested values, make sure to use names that contain the required substrings.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   export RESOURCE_GROUP="contoso-us-resource-group"
   export LOCATION="westus"
   export DPS="contoso-provisioning-service-SUFFIX"
   export TOASTER_HUB="contoso-toasters-hub-SUFFIX"
   export HEATPUMP_HUB="contoso-heatpumps-hub-SUFFIX"
   ```

   ```powershell
   # PowerShell
   $env:RESOURCE_GROUP = "contoso-us-resource-group"
   $env:LOCATION = "westus"
   $env:DPS = "contoso-provisioning-service-SUFFIX"
   $env:TOASTER_HUB = "contoso-toasters-hub-SUFFIX"
   $env:HEATPUMP_HUB = "contoso-heatpumps-hub-SUFFIX"
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > The commands used in this tutorial create resources in the West US location by default. We recommend that you create your resources in the region nearest you that supports Device Provisioning Service. You can view a list of available locations by going to the [Azure Status](https://azure.microsoft.com/status/) page and searching for "Device Provisioning Service". In commands, locations can be specified either in one word or multi-word format; for example: westus, West US, WEST US, etc. The value is not case sensitive.

1. Use the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command to create an Azure resource group. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

   The following example creates a resource group. We recommend that you use a single group for all resources created in this tutorial. This approach will make clean up easier after you're finished.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
   ```

1. Use the [az iot dps create](/cli/azure/iot/dps#az-iot-dps-create) command to create an instance of the Device Provisioning Service (DPS). The provisioning service is added to *contoso-us-resource-group*.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot dps create --name $DPS --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
    ```

    This command might take a few minutes to complete.

1. Use the [az iot hub create](/cli/azure/iot/hub#az-iot-hub-create) command to create the **Contoso Toasters Division** IoT hub. The IoT hub is added to *contoso-us-resource-group*.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub create --name $TOASTER_HUB --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION --sku S1
    ```

    This command might take a few minutes to complete.

1. Use the [az iot hub create](/cli/azure/iot/hub#az-iot-hub-create) command to create the **Contoso Heat Pumps Division** IoT hub. This IoT hub also is added to *contoso-us-resource-group*.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub create --name $HEATPUMP_HUB --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION --sku S1
    ```

    This command might take a few minutes to complete.

1. Run the following two commands to get the connection strings for the hubs you created.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub connection-string show --hub-name $TOASTER_HUB --key primary --query connectionString -o tsv
    az iot hub connection-string show --hub-name $HEATPUMP_HUB --key primary --query connectionString -o tsv
    ```

1. Run the following commands to link the hubs to the DPS resource. Replace the placeholders with the hub connection strings from the previous step.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot dps linked-hub create --dps-name $DPS --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION --connection-string <toaster_hub_connection_string>
    az iot dps linked-hub create --dps-name $DPS --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION --connection-string <heatpump_hub_connection_string>
    ```

## Create the custom allocation function

In this section, you create an Azure function that implements your custom allocation policy. This function decides which divisional IoT hub a device should be registered to based on whether its registration ID contains the string **-contoso-tstrsd-007** or **-contoso-hpsd-088**. It also sets the initial state of the device twin based on whether the device is a toaster or a heat pump.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box, search for and select **Function App**.

1. Select **Create** or **Create Function App**.

1. On the **Function App** create page, under the **Basics** tab, enter the following settings for your new function app and select **Review + create**:

   | Parameter          | Value |
   |--------------------|-------|
   | **Subscription**   | Make sure that the subscription where you created the resources for this tutorial is selected. |
   | **Resource Group** | Select the resource group that you created in the previous section. The default provided in the previous section is **contoso-us-resource-group**. |
   | **Function App name** | Provide a name for your function app.|
   | **Do you want to deploy code or container image?** | **Code** |
   | **Runtime Stack**  | **.NET** |
   | **Version**        | Select any **in-process model** version. |
   | **Region**         | Select a region close to you. |

   > [!NOTE]
   > By default, Application Insights is enabled. Application Insights is not necessary for this tutorial, but it might help you understand and investigate any issues you encounter with the custom allocation. If you prefer, you can disable Application Insights by selecting the **Monitoring** tab and then selecting **No** for **Enable Application Insights**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-custom-allocation-policies/create-function-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Create Function App form in the Azure portal.":::

1. On the **Review + create** tab, select **Create** to create the function app.

1. Deployment might take several minutes. When it completes, select **Go to resource**.

1. On the left pane of the function app **Overview** page, select **Create function**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-custom-allocation-policies/create-function-in-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting the option to create function in the Azure portal.":::

1. On the **Create function** page, select the **HTTP Trigger** template then select **Next**.

1. On the **Template details** tab, select **Anonymous** as the **Authorization level** then select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-custom-allocation-policies/function-authorization-level.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows setting the authorization level as anonymous.":::

   >[!TIP]
   >If you keep the authorization level as **Function**, then you'll need to configure your DPS enrollments with the function API key. For more information, see [Azure Functions HTTP trigger](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger.md).

1. When the **HttpTrigger1** function opens, select **Code + Test** on the left pane. This allows you to edit the code for the function. The **run.csx** code file should be opened for editing.

1. Reference required NuGet packages. To create the initial device twin, the custom allocation function uses classes that are defined in two NuGet packages that must be loaded into the hosting environment. With Azure Functions, NuGet packages are referenced using a *function.proj* file. In this step, you save and upload a *function.proj* file for the required assemblies.  For more information, see [Using NuGet packages with Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-reference-csharp.md#using-nuget-packages).

    1. Copy the following lines into your favorite editor and save the file on your computer as *function.proj*.

        ```xml
        <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">  
            <PropertyGroup>  
                <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>  
            </PropertyGroup>  
            <ItemGroup>  
                <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Provisioning.Service" Version="1.18.1" />
                <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Shared" Version="1.30.1" />
            </ItemGroup>  
        </Project>
        ```

    1. Select the **Upload** button located above the code editor to upload your *function.proj* file. After uploading, select the file in the code editor using the drop-down box to verify the contents.

    1. Select the *function.proj* file in the code editor and verify its contents. If the *function.proj* file is empty copy the lines above into the file and save it. (Sometimes the upload creates the file without uploading the contents.)

1. Make sure *run.csx* for **HttpTrigger1** is selected in the code editor. Replace the code for the **HttpTrigger1** function with the following code and select **Save**:

    ```csharp
    #r "Newtonsoft.Json"

    ```

## Create the enrollment

In this section, you create a new enrollment group that uses the custom allocation policy. For simplicity, this tutorial uses [Symmetric key attestation](concepts-symmetric-key-attestation.md) with the enrollment. For a more secure solution, consider using [X.509 certificate attestation](concepts-x509-attestation.md) with a chain of trust.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to your Device Provisioning Service instance.

1. Select **Manage enrollments** from the **Settings** section of the navigation menu.

1. Select **Add enrollment group**.

1. On the **Registration + provisioning** tab of the **Add enrollment group** page, provide the following information to configure the enrollment group details:

   | Field | Description |
   | :--- | :--- |
   | **Attestation** |Select **Symmetric key** as the **Attestation mechanism**.|
   | **Symmetric key settings** |Check the **Generate symmetric keys automatically** box. |
   | **Group name** | Enter *contoso-custom-allocated-devices* as the group name.|
   | **Provisioning status** | Check the **Enable this enrollment** box. |

1. Select **Next: IoT hubs**.

1. On the **IoT hubs** tab of the **Add enrollment group** page, provide the following information to determine which IoT hubs the enrollment group can provision devices to:

   | Field | Description |
   | :---- | :---------- |
   | **Target IoT hubs** |Select one or more of your linked IoT hubs, or add a new link to an IoT hub.|
   | **Allocation policy** | Select **Custom (use Azure Function)**. Select **Select Azure function**, then follow the prompts to select the function that you created for this tutorial. |

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. On the **Review + create** tab, verify all of your values then select **Create**.

After saving the enrollment, reopen it and make a note of the **Primary key**. You must save the enrollment first to have the keys generated. This key is used to generate unique device keys for simulated devices in the next section.

>[!TIP]
>When you create an enrollment group in the Azure portal and select a custom allocation policy, the Azure portal automatically retrieves and embeds the function key on your behalf. If you create an enrollment programmatically, you need to provide the key as part of the creation step.

## Derive unique device keys

Devices don't use the enrollment group's primary symmetric key directly. Instead, you use the primary key to derive a device key for each device. In this section, you create two unique device keys. One key is used for a simulated toaster device. The other key is used for a simulated heat pump device.

To derive the device key, you use the enrollment group **Primary Key** you noted earlier to compute the [HMAC-SHA256](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) of the device registration ID for each device and convert the result into Base 64 format. For more information on creating derived device keys with enrollment groups, see the group enrollments section of [Symmetric key attestation](concepts-symmetric-key-attestation.md).

For the example in this tutorial, use the following two device registration IDs and compute a device key for both devices. Both registration IDs have a valid suffix to work with the example code for the custom allocation policy:

* **breakroom499-contoso-tstrsd-007**
* **mainbuilding167-contoso-hpsd-088**

The IoT extension for the Azure CLI provides the [iot dps enrollment-group compute-device-key](/cli/azure/iot/dps/enrollment-group#az-iot-dps-enrollment-group-compute-device-key) command for generating derived device keys. This command can be used on Windows-based or Linux systems, from PowerShell or a Bash shell.

Replace the value of `--key` argument with the **Primary Key** from your enrollment group.

```azurecli
az iot dps enrollment-group compute-device-key --key <ENROLLMENT_GROUP_KEY> --registration-id breakroom499-contoso-tstrsd-007
```

```azurecli
az iot dps enrollment-group compute-device-key --key <ENROLLMENT_GROUP_KEY> --registration-id mainbuilding167-contoso-hpsd-088
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can also supply the enrollment group ID rather than the symmetric key to the `iot dps enrollment-group compute-device-key` command. For example:
>
> ```azurecli
> az iot dps enrollment-group compute-device-key -g contoso-us-resource-group --dps-name contoso-provisioning-service-1098 --enrollment-id contoso-custom-allocated-devices --registration-id breakroom499-contoso-tstrsd-007
> ```

The simulated devices use the derived device keys with each registration ID to perform symmetric key attestation.

## Prepare an Azure IoT C SDK development environment

In this section, you prepare the development environment used to build the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c). The SDK includes the sample code for the simulated device. This simulated device will attempt provisioning during the device's boot sequence.

This section is oriented toward a Windows-based workstation. For a Linux example, see the set-up of the VMs in [Tutorial: Provision for geo latency](how-to-provision-multitenant.md).

1. Download the [CMake build system](https://cmake.org/download/).

    It's important that the Visual Studio prerequisites (Visual Studio and the 'Desktop development with C++' workload) are installed on your machine, **before** starting the `CMake` installation. Once the prerequisites are in place, and the download is verified, install the CMake build system.

2. Find the tag name for the [latest release](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/releases/latest) of the SDK.

3. Open a command prompt or Git Bash shell. Run the following commands to clone the latest release of the [Azure IoT Device SDK for C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) GitHub repository. Use the tag you found in the previous step as the value for the `-b` parameter, for example: `lts_01_2023`.

    ```cmd/sh
    git clone -b <release-tag> https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git
    cd azure-iot-sdk-c
    git submodule update --init
    ```

    You should expect this operation to take several minutes to complete.

4. Create a `cmake` subdirectory in the root directory of the git repository, and navigate to that folder. Run the following commands from the `azure-iot-sdk-c` directory:

    ```cmd/sh
    mkdir cmake
    cd cmake
    ```

5. Run the following command, which builds a version of the SDK specific to your development client platform. A Visual Studio solution for the simulated device will be generated in the `cmake` directory. 

    ```cmd
    cmake -Dhsm_type_symm_key:BOOL=ON -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON  ..
    ```

    If `cmake` doesn't find your C++ compiler, you might see build errors while running the command. If that happens, try running the command in the [Visual Studio command prompt](/dotnet/framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs).

    Once the build succeeds, the last few output lines look similar to the following output:

    ```cmd/sh

## Simulate the devices

In this section, you update a provisioning sample named **prov\_dev\_client\_sample** located in the Azure IoT C SDK you set up previously.

This sample code simulates a device boot sequence that sends the provisioning request to your Device Provisioning Service instance. The boot sequence causes the toaster device to be recognized and assigned to the IoT hub using the custom allocation policy.

1. In the Azure portal, select the **Overview** tab for your Device Provisioning Service and note down the **ID Scope** value.

    ![Extract Device Provisioning Service endpoint information from the portal blade](./media/quick-create-simulated-device-x509/copy-id-scope.png)

2. In Visual Studio, open the **azure_iot_sdks.sln** solution file that was generated by running CMake earlier. The solution file should be in the following location: `azure-iot-sdk-c\cmake\azure_iot_sdks.sln`.

3. In Visual Studio's *Solution Explorer* window, navigate to the **Provision\_Samples** folder. Expand the sample project named **prov\_dev\_client\_sample**. Expand **Source Files**, and open **prov\_dev\_client\_sample.c**.

4. Find the `id_scope` constant, and replace the value with your **ID Scope** value that you copied earlier.

    ```c
    static const char* id_scope = "0ne00002193";
    ```

5. Find the definition for the `main()` function in the same file. Make sure the `hsm_type` variable is set to `SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_SYMMETRIC_KEY` as shown below:

    ```c
    SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE hsm_type;
    //hsm_type = SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_TPM;
    //hsm_type = SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_X509;
    hsm_type = SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_SYMMETRIC_KEY;
    ```

6. In the `main()` function, find the call to `Prov_Device_Register_Device()`. Just before that call, add the following lines of code that use [`Prov_Device_Set_Provisioning_Payload()`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/main/provisioning_client/inc/azure_prov_client/prov_device_client.h#L52) to pass a custom JSON payload during provisioning. This can be used to provide more information to your custom allocation functions. This could also be used to pass the device type instead of examining the registration ID. For more information on sending and receiving custom data payloads with DPS, see [How to transfer payloads between devices and DPS](concepts-custom-allocation.md#use-device-payloads-in-custom-allocation).

    ```c
    // An example custom payload
    const char* custom_json_payload = "{\"MyDeviceFirmwareVersion\":\"12.0.2.5\",\"MyDeviceProvisioningVersion\":\"1.0.0.0\"}";

    prov_device_result = Prov_Device_Set_Provisioning_Payload(prov_device_handle, custom_json_payload);
    if (prov_device_result != PROV_DEVICE_RESULT_OK)
    {
        (void)printf("\r\nFailure setting provisioning payload: %s\r\n", MU_ENUM_TO_STRING(PROV_DEVICE_RESULT, prov_device_result));
    }
    ```

7. Right-click the **prov\_dev\_client\_sample** project and select **Set as Startup Project**.

### Simulate the Contoso toaster device

1. To simulate the toaster device, find the call to `prov_dev_set_symmetric_key_info()` in **prov\_dev\_client\_sample.c** which is commented out.

    ```c
    // Set the symmetric key if using they auth type
    //prov_dev_set_symmetric_key_info("<symm_registration_id>", "<symmetric_Key>");
    ```

    Uncomment the function call and replace the placeholder values (including the angle brackets) with the toaster registration ID and derived device key you generated previously. The key value **JC8F96eayuQwwz+PkE7IzjH2lIAjCUnAa61tDigBnSs=** shown below is only given as an example.

    ```c
    // Set the symmetric key if using they auth type
    prov_dev_set_symmetric_key_info("breakroom499-contoso-tstrsd-007", "JC8F96eayuQwwz+PkE7IzjH2lIAjCUnAa61tDigBnSs=");
    ```

    Save the file.

2. On the Visual Studio menu, select **Debug** > **Start without debugging** to run the solution. In the prompt to rebuild the project, select **Yes**, to rebuild the project before running.

    The following output is an example of the simulated toaster device successfully booting up and connecting to the provisioning service instance to be assigned to the toasters IoT hub by the custom allocation policy:

    ```cmd
    Provisioning API Version: 1.8.0

    Registering Device

    Provisioning Status: PROV_DEVICE_REG_STATUS_CONNECTED
    Provisioning Status: PROV_DEVICE_REG_STATUS_ASSIGNING
    Provisioning Status: PROV_DEVICE_REG_STATUS_ASSIGNING

    Registration Information received from service: contoso-toasters-hub-1098.azure-devices.net, deviceId: breakroom499-contoso-tstrsd-007

    Press enter key to exit:
    ```

    The following output is example logging output from the custom allocation function code running for the toaster device. Notice a hub is successfully selected for a toaster device. Also notice the `payload` property that contains the custom JSON content you added to the code. This is available for your code to use within the `deviceRuntimeContext`.

    This logging is available by clicking **Logs** under the function code in the portal:

### Simulate the Contoso heat pump device

1. To simulate the heat pump device, update the call to `prov_dev_set_symmetric_key_info()` in **prov\_dev\_client\_sample.c** again with the heat pump registration ID and derived device key you generated earlier. The key value **6uejA9PfkQgmYylj8Zerp3kcbeVrGZ172YLa7VSnJzg=** shown below is also only given as an example.

    ```c
    // Set the symmetric key if using they auth type
    prov_dev_set_symmetric_key_info("mainbuilding167-contoso-hpsd-088", "6uejA9PfkQgmYylj8Zerp3kcbeVrGZ172YLa7VSnJzg=");
    ```

    Save the file.

2. On the Visual Studio menu, select **Debug** > **Start without debugging** to run the solution. In the prompt to rebuild the project, select **Yes** to rebuild the project before running.

    The following output is an example of the simulated heat pump device successfully booting up and connecting to the provisioning service instance to be assigned to the Contoso heat pumps IoT hub by the custom allocation policy:

## Troubleshoot custom allocation policies

The following table shows expected scenarios and the results error codes you might receive. Use this table to help troubleshoot custom allocation policy failures with your Azure Functions.

| Scenario | Registration result from Provisioning Service | Provisioning SDK Results |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| The webhook returns 200 OK with ‘iotHubHostName’ set to a valid IoT hub host name | Result status: Assigned  | SDK returns PROV_DEVICE_RESULT_OK along with hub information |
| The webhook returns 200 OK with ‘iotHubHostName’ present in the response, but set to an empty string or null | Result status: Failed<br><br> Error code: CustomAllocationIotHubNotSpecified (400208) | SDK returns PROV_DEVICE_RESULT_HUB_NOT_SPECIFIED |
| The webhook returns 401 Unauthorized | Result status: Failed<br><br>Error code: CustomAllocationUnauthorizedAccess (400209) | SDK returns PROV_DEVICE_RESULT_UNAUTHORIZED |
| An Individual Enrollment was created to disable the device | Result status: Disabled | SDK returns PROV_DEVICE_RESULT_DISABLED |
| The webhook returns error code >= 429 | DPS’ orchestration will retry several times. The retry policy is currently:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Retry count: 10<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Initial interval: 1 s<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Increment: 9 s | SDK will ignore error and submit another get status message in the specified time |
| The webhook returns any other status code | Result status: Failed<br><br>Error code: CustomAllocationFailed (400207) | SDK returns PROV_DEVICE_RESULT_DEV_AUTH_ERROR |

## Clean up resources

If you plan to continue working with the resources created in this tutorial, you can leave them. If you don't plan to continue using the resources, use the following steps to delete all of the resources created in this tutorial to avoid unnecessary charges.

The steps here assume you created all resources in this tutorial as instructed in the same resource group named **contoso-us-resource-group**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deleting a resource group is irreversible. The resource group and all the resources contained in it are permanently deleted. Make sure that you don't accidentally delete the wrong resource group or resources. If you created the IoT Hub inside an existing resource group that contains resources you want to keep, only delete the IoT Hub resource itself instead of deleting the resource group.

To delete the resource group by name:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **Resource groups**.

2. In the **Filter by name...** textbox, type the name of the resource group containing your resources, **contoso-us-resource-group**.

3. To the right of your resource group in the result list, select **...** then **Delete resource group**.

4. You'll be asked to confirm the deletion of the resource group. Type the name of your resource group again to confirm, and then select **Delete**. After a few moments, the resource group and all of its contained resources are deleted.
