[!INCLUDE [Microsoft.Devices/provisioningServices](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/reference/logs/microsoft-devices-provisioningservices-logs-include.md)]

The following list provides additional information about the preceding logs:

- DeviceOperations: Logs related to device attestation events. See device APIs listed in [Billable service operations and pricing](about-iot-dps.md#billable-service-operations-and-pricing).
- ServiceOperations: Logs related to DPS service events. See DPS service APIs listed in [Billable service operations and pricing](about-iot-dps.md#billable-service-operations-and-pricing).

For reference, see a list of [all resource logs category types supported in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs-schema).

DPS uses the [AzureDiagnostics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics) table to store resource log information. The following columns are relevant.
