# Quickstart: Provision a simulated symmetric key device

In this quickstart, you create a simulated device on your Windows machine. The simulated device is configured to use the [symmetric key attestation](concepts-symmetric-key-attestation.md) mechanism for authentication. After you configure your device, you then provision it to your IoT hub using the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service.

If you're unfamiliar with the process of provisioning, review the [provisioning](about-iot-dps.md#provisioning-process) overview.

This quickstart demonstrates a solution for a Windows-based workstation. However, you can also perform the procedures on Linux. For a Linux example, see [Tutorial: provision for geo latency](how-to-provision-multitenant.md).

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

* Complete the steps in [Set up IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service with the Azure portal](./quick-setup-auto-provision.md).

## Prepare your development environment

::: zone pivot="programming-language-ansi-c"

In this section, you prepare a development environment that's used to build the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c). The sample code attempts to provision the device, during the device's boot sequence.

1. Download the latest [CMake build system](https://cmake.org/download/).

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >Confirm that the Visual Studio prerequisites (Visual Studio and the 'Desktop development with C++' workload) are installed on your machine, **before** starting the `CMake` installation. Once the prerequisites are in place, and the download is verified, install the CMake build system. Also, be aware that older versions of the CMake build system fail to generate the solution file used in this article. Make sure to use the latest version of CMake.

2. Open a web browser, and go to the [Release page of the Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/releases/latest).

3. Select the **Tags** tab at the top of the page.

4. Copy the tag name for the latest release of the Azure IoT C SDK.

5. Open a command prompt or Git Bash shell. Run the following commands to clone the latest release of the [Azure IoT Device SDK for C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) GitHub repository. Replace `<release-tag>` with the tag you copied in the previous step, for example: `lts_01_2023`.

    ```cmd
    git clone -b <release-tag> https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git
    cd azure-iot-sdk-c
    git submodule update --init
    ```

    This operation could take several minutes to complete.

6. When the operation is complete, run the following commands from the `azure-iot-sdk-c` directory:

    ```cmd
    mkdir cmake
    cd cmake
    ```

7. The code sample uses a symmetric key to provide attestation. Run the following command to build a version of the SDK specific to your development client platform that includes the device provisioning client:

    ```cmd
    cmake -Dhsm_type_symm_key:BOOL=ON -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON  ..
    ```

    >[!TIP]
    >If `cmake` does not find your C++ compiler, you may get build errors while running the previous command. If that happens, try running the command in the [Visual Studio command prompt](/dotnet/framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs).

8. When the build completes successfully, the last few output lines look similar to the following output:

    ```output
    $ cmake -Dhsm_type_symm_key:BOOL=ON -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON  ..
    -- Building for: Visual Studio 16 2019
    -- Selecting Windows SDK version 10.0.19041.0 to target Windows 10.0.19042.
    -- The C compiler identification is MSVC 19.29.30040.0

## Create a device enrollment

The Azure IoT Device Provisioning Service supports two types of enrollments:

* [Enrollment groups](concepts-service.md#enrollment-group): Used to enroll multiple related devices.
* [Individual enrollments](concepts-service.md#individual-enrollment): Used to enroll a single device.

This article demonstrates an individual enrollment for a single device to be provisioned with an IoT hub.

<!-- INCLUDE -->
[!INCLUDE [iot-dps-individual-enrollment-key.md](../../includes/iot-dps-individual-enrollment-key.md)]

Once you create the individual enrollment, a **primary key** and **secondary key** are generated and added to the enrollment entry. You use the primary key in the device sample later in this quickstart.

1. To view your simulated symmetric key device enrollment, select the **Individual enrollments** tab.

1. Select your device's registration ID from the list of individual enrollments.

1. Copy the value of the generated **Primary key**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/quick-create-simulated-device-symm-key/copy-device-enrollment-primary-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the enrollment details, highlighting the Copy button for the primary key of the device enrollment":::

<a id="firstbootsequence"></a>

## Prepare and run the device provisioning code

::: zone pivot="programming-language-ansi-c"

In this section, you update the device sample code to send the device's boot sequence to your Device Provisioning Service instance. This boot sequence causes the device to be recognized, authenticated, and assigned to an IoT hub linked to the Device Provisioning Service instance.

The sample provisioning code accomplishes the following tasks, in order:

1. Authenticates your device with your Device Provisioning resource using the following three parameters:

    * The ID Scope of your Device Provisioning Service
    * The registration ID for your device enrollment.
    * The primary symmetric key for your device enrollment.

2. Assigns the device to the IoT hub already linked to your Device Provisioning Service instance.

To update and run the provisioning sample with your device information:

1. In the main menu of your Device Provisioning Service, select **Overview**.

2. Copy the **ID Scope** value.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/quick-create-simulated-device-symm-key/extract-dps-endpoints.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the overview of the Device Provisioning Service instance, highlighting the ID Scope value for the instance.":::

3. In Visual Studio, open the *azure_iot_sdks.sln* solution file that was generated by running CMake. The solution file should be in the following location:

    ```output

    \azure-iot-sdk-c\cmake\azure_iot_sdks.sln

    ```

    >[!TIP]
    >If the file was not generated in your cmake directory, make sure you used a recent version of the CMake build system.

4. In Visual Studio's *Solution Explorer* window, go to the **Provision\_Samples** folder. Expand the sample project named **prov\_dev\_client\_sample**. Expand **Source Files**, and open **prov\_dev\_client\_sample.c**.

5. Find the `id_scope` constant, and replace the value with the **ID Scope** value that you copied in step 2.

    ```c
    static const char* id_scope = "0ne00002193";
    ```

6. Find the definition for the `main()` function in the same file. Make sure the `hsm_type` variable is set to `SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_SYMMETRIC_KEY` as shown in the following example:

    ```c
    SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE hsm_type;
    //hsm_type = SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_TPM;
    //hsm_type = SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_X509;
    hsm_type = SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_SYMMETRIC_KEY;
    ```

7. Find the call to `prov_dev_set_symmetric_key_info()` in **prov\_dev\_client\_sample.c** that is commented out.

    ```c
    // Set the symmetric key if using they auth type
    //prov_dev_set_symmetric_key_info("<symm_registration_id>", "<symmetric_Key>");
    ```

    Uncomment the function call, and replace the placeholder values (including the angle brackets) with your device's registration ID and the primary key value you copied earlier.

    ```c
    // Set the symmetric key if using they auth type
    prov_dev_set_symmetric_key_info("symm-key-device-007", "your primary key here");
    ```

8. Save the file.

9. Right-click the **prov\_dev\_client\_sample** project and select **Set as Startup Project**.

10. On the Visual Studio menu, select **Debug** > **Start without debugging** to run the solution. In the rebuild the project prompt, select **Yes** to rebuild the project before running.

    The following output is an example of the device successfully connecting to the provisioning Service instance to be assigned to an IoT hub:

    ```output
    Provisioning API Version: 1.2.8

    Registering Device

    Provisioning Status: PROV_DEVICE_REG_STATUS_CONNECTED
    Provisioning Status: PROV_DEVICE_REG_STATUS_ASSIGNING

    Registration Information received from service:
    test-docs-hub.azure-devices.net, deviceId: device-007
    Press enter key to exit:
    ```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

The sample provisioning code accomplishes the following tasks:

1. Authenticates your device with your Device Provisioning resource using the following three parameters:

    * The ID Scope of your Device Provisioning Service
    * The registration ID for your device enrollment.
    * The primary symmetric key for your device enrollment.

2. Assigns the device to the IoT hub already linked to your Device Provisioning Service instance.

3. Sends a test message to the IoT hub.

To update and run the provisioning sample with your device information:

1. In the main menu of your Device Provisioning Service, select **Overview**.

2. Copy the **ID Scope** value.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/quick-create-simulated-device-symm-key/extract-dps-endpoints.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the overview of the Device Provisioning Service instance, highlighting the ID Scope value for the instance.":::

3. Open a command prompt and go to the *SymmetricKeySample* in the cloned sdk repository:

    ```cmd
    cd '.\azure-iot-sdk-csharp\provisioning\device\samples\how to guides\SymmetricKeySample\'
    ```

4. In the *SymmetricKeySample* folder, open *Parameters.cs* in a text editor. This file shows the available parameters for the sample. Only the first three required parameters are used in this article when running the sample. Review the code in this file. No changes are needed.

    | Parameter                         | Required | Description     |
    | :-------------------------------- | :------- | :-------------- |
    | `--i` or `--IdScope`              | True     | The ID Scope of the DPS instance |
    | `--r` or `--RegistrationId`       | True     | The registration ID is a case-insensitive string (up to 128 characters long) of alphanumeric characters plus the special characters: `'-'`, `'.'`, `'_'`, `':'`. The last character must be alphanumeric or dash (`'-'`). |
    | `--p` or `--PrimaryKey`           | True     | The primary key of the individual enrollment or the derived device key of the group enrollment. See the [ComputeDerivedSymmetricKeySample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/tree/main/provisioning/device/samples/getting%20started/ComputeDerivedSymmetricKeySample) for how to generate the derived key. |
    | `--g` or `--GlobalDeviceEndpoint` | False    | The global endpoint for devices to connect to. Defaults to `global.azure-devices-provisioning.net` |
    | `--t` or `--TransportType`        | False    | The transport to use to communicate with the device provisioning instance. Defaults to `Mqtt`. Possible values include `Mqtt`, `Mqtt_WebSocket_Only`, `Mqtt_Tcp_Only`, `Amqp`, `Amqp_WebSocket_Only`, `Amqp_Tcp_only`, and `Http1`.|

5. In the *SymmetricKeySample* folder, open *ProvisioningDeviceClientSample.cs* in a text editor. This file shows how the [SecurityProviderSymmetricKey](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.devices.shared.securityprovidersymmetrickey?view=azure-dotnet&preserve-view=true) class is used along with the [ProvisioningDeviceClient](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.devices.provisioning.client.provisioningdeviceclient?view=azure-dotnet&preserve-view=true) class to provision your simulated symmetric key device. Review the code in this file. No changes are needed.

6. Build and run the sample code using the following command:

    * Replace `<id-scope>` with the **ID Scope** that you copied in step 2.
    * Replace `<registration-id>` with the **Registration ID** that you provided for the device enrollment.
    * Replace `<primarykey>` with the **Primary Key** that you copied from the device enrollment.

    ```cmd
    dotnet run --i <id-scope> --r <registration-id> --p <primarykey>
    ```

7. You should now see something similar to the following output. A "TestMessage" string is sent to the hub as a test message.

     ```output
    D:\azure-iot-sdk-csharp\provisioning\device\samples\how to guides\SymmetricKeySample>dotnet run --i 0ne00000A0A --r symm-key-csharp-device-01 --p sbDDeEzRuEuGKag+kQKV+T1QGakRtHpsERLP0yPjwR93TrpEgEh/Y07CXstfha6dhIPWvdD1nRxK5T0KGKA+nQ==

    :::image type="content" source="./media/quick-create-simulated-device-symm-key/copy-id-scope-and-global-device-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the overview of the Device Provisioning Service instance, highlighting the global device endpoint and ID Scope values for the instance.":::

3. Open a command prompt for executing Node.js commands, and go to the following directory:

    ```cmd
    cd azure-iot-sdk-node/provisioning/device/samples
    ```

4. In the *provisioning/device/samples* folder, open *register_symkey.js* and review the code. Notice that the sample code sets a custom payload:

    ```nodejs
    provisioningClient.setProvisioningPayload({a: 'b'});
    ```

    You can comment out this payload code for this quickstart. A custom payload would be required if you wanted to use a custom allocation function to assign your device to an IoT hub. For more information, see [Tutorial: Use custom allocation policies](tutorial-custom-allocation-policies.md).

    The `provisioningClient.register()` method attempts the registration of your device.

    No further changes are needed.

5. In the command prompt, run the following commands to set environment variables used by the sample:

    * Replace `<provisioning-global-endpoint>` with the **Global device endpoint** that you copied in step 2.
    * Replace `<id-scope>` with the **ID Scope** that you copied in step 2.
    * Replace `<registration-id>` with the **Registration ID** that you provided for the device enrollment.
    * Replace `<primarykey>` with the **Primary Key** that you copied from the device enrollment.
