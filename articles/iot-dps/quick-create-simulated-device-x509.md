# Quickstart: Provision an X.509 certificate simulated device

In this quickstart, you create a simulated device on your Windows machine. The simulated device is configured to use X.509 certificate attestation for authentication. After you configure your device, you then provision it to your IoT hub using the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service.

If you're unfamiliar with the process of provisioning, review the [provisioning](about-iot-dps.md#provisioning-process) overview. Also make sure that you complete the steps in [Set up IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service with the Azure portal](./quick-setup-auto-provision.md) before continuing.

This quickstart demonstrates a solution for a Windows-based workstation. However, you can also perform the procedures on Linux. For a Linux example, see [Tutorial: Provision for geo latency](how-to-provision-multitenant.md).

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

* Complete the steps in [Set up IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service with the Azure portal](./quick-setup-auto-provision.md).

See [Software Freedom Conservancy's Git client tools](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for the latest version of `git` tools to install, which includes *Git Bash*, the command-line app that you can use to interact with your local Git repository.

* Make sure [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is installed on your machine. On Windows, your installation of Git includes an installation of OpenSSL. You can access OpenSSL from the Git Bash prompt. To verify that OpenSSL is installed, open a Git Bash prompt and enter `openssl version`.

  >[!NOTE]
  > Unless you're familiar with OpenSSL and already have it installed on your Windows machine, we recommend using OpenSSL from the Git Bash prompt. Alternatively, you can choose to download the source code and build OpenSSL. To learn more, see the [OpenSSL Downloads](https://www.openssl.org/source/) page. Or, you can download OpenSSL pre-built from a third-party. To learn more, see the [OpenSSL wiki](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries). Microsoft makes no guarantees about the validity of packages downloaded from third-parties. If you do choose to build or download OpenSSL make sure that the OpenSSL binary is accessible in your path and that the `OPENSSL_CNF` environment variable is set to the path of your *openssl.cnf* file.

* Open both a Windows command prompt and a Git Bash prompt.

    The steps in this quickstart assume that you're using a Windows machine and the OpenSSL installation that is installed as part of Git. You use the Git Bash prompt to issue OpenSSL commands and the Windows command prompt for everything else. If you're using Linux, you can issue all commands from a Bash shell.

## Prepare your development environment

::: zone pivot="programming-language-ansi-c"

In this section, you prepare a development environment that's used to build the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c). The sample code attempts to provision the device, during the device's boot sequence.

1. Open a web browser, and go to the [Release page of the Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/releases/latest).

2. Select the **Tags** tab at the top of the page.

3. Copy the tag name for the latest release of the Azure IoT C SDK.

4. In your Windows command prompt, run the following commands to clone the latest release of the [Azure IoT Device SDK for C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) GitHub repository. Replace `<release-tag>` with the tag you copied in the previous step, for example: `lts_01_2023`.

   ```cmd
   git clone -b <release-tag> https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git
   cd azure-iot-sdk-c
   git submodule update --init
   ```

   This operation could take several minutes to complete.

5. When the operation is complete, run the following commands from the `azure-iot-sdk-c` directory:

   ```cmd
   mkdir cmake
   cd cmake
   ```

6. The code sample uses an X.509 certificate to provide attestation via X.509 authentication. Run the following command to build a version of the SDK specific to your development platform that includes the device provisioning client. A Visual Studio solution for the simulated device is generated in the `cmake` directory.

   When specifying the path used with `-Dhsm_custom_lib` in the following command, make sure to use the absolute path to the library in the `cmake` directory you previously created. The path shown assumes that you cloned the C SDK in the root directory of the C drive. If you used another directory, adjust the path accordingly.

   # [Windows](#tab/windows)

   ```cmd
   cmake -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON -Dhsm_custom_lib=c:/azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/provisioning_client/samples/custom_hsm_example/Debug/custom_hsm_example.lib ..
   ```

   # [Linux](#tab/linux)

   ```bash
   cmake -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON -Dhsm_custom_lib=/home/<USER>/azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/provisioning_client/samples/custom_hsm_example/custom_hsm_example.a ..
   ```

   ---

   >[!TIP]
   >If `cmake` doesn't find your C++ compiler, you may get build errors while running the above command. If that happens, try running the command in the [Visual Studio command prompt](/dotnet/framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs).

7. When the build succeeds, the last few output lines look similar to the following output:

   ```output
   -- Building for: Visual Studio 17 2022
   -- Selecting Windows SDK version 10.0.19041.0 to target Windows 10.0.22000.

## Create a self-signed X.509 device certificate

In this section, you use OpenSSL to create a self-signed X.509 certificate and a private key. This certificate is uploaded to your provisioning service instance and verified by the service.

> [!CAUTION]
> Use certificates created with OpenSSL in this quickstart for development testing only.
> Do not use these certificates in production.
> These certificates expire after 30 days and may contain hard-coded passwords, such as *1234*.
> To learn about obtaining certificates suitable for use in production, see [How to get an X.509 CA certificate](../iot-hub/iot-hub-x509ca-overview.md#get-an-x509-ca-certificate) in the Azure IoT Hub documentation.
>

Perform the steps in this section in your Git Bash prompt.

1. In your Git Bash prompt, navigate to a directory where you'd like to create your certificates.

2. Run the following command:

    # [Windows](#tab/windows)

    ```bash
    winpty openssl req -outform PEM -x509 -sha256 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout device-key.pem -out device-cert.pem -days 30 -extensions usr_cert -addext extendedKeyUsage=clientAuth -subj "//CN=my-x509-device"
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The extra forward slash given for the subject name (`//CN=my-x509-device`) is only required to escape the string with Git on Windows platforms.

    # [Linux](#tab/linux)

    ```bash
    openssl req -outform PEM -x509 -sha256 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout device-key.pem -out device-cert.pem -days 30 -extensions usr_cert -addext extendedKeyUsage=clientAuth -subj "/CN=my-x509-device"
    ```

    ---

3. When asked to **Enter PEM pass phrase:**, use the pass phrase `1234`.

4. When asked **Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:**, use the pass phrase `1234` again.

    A public key certificate file (*device-cert.pem*) and private key file (*device-key.pem*) should now be generated in the directory where you ran the `openssl` command.

    The certificate file has its subject common name (CN) set to `my-x509-device`. For X.509-based enrollments, the [Registration ID](./concepts-service.md#registration-id) is set to the common name. The registration ID is a case-insensitive string of alphanumeric characters plus the special characters: `'-'`, `'.'`, `'_'`, `':'`. The last character must be alphanumeric or dash (`'-'`). The common name must adhere to this format. DPS supports registration IDs up to 128 characters long; however, the maximum length of the subject common name in an X.509 certificate is 64 characters. The registration ID, therefore, is limited to 64 characters when using X.509 certificates.

5. The certificate file is Base 64 encoded. To view the subject common name (CN) and other properties of the certificate file, enter the following command:

    # [Windows](#tab/windows)

    ```bash
    winpty openssl x509 -in device-cert.pem -text -noout
    ```

    # [Linux](#tab/linux)

    ```bash
    openssl x509 -in device-cert.pem -text -noout
    ```

6. The sample code requires a private key that isn't encrypted. Run the following command to create an unencrypted private key:

    # [Windows](#tab/windows)

    ```bash
    winpty openssl rsa -in device-key.pem -out unencrypted-device-key.pem
    ```

    # [Linux](#tab/linux)

Keep the Git Bash prompt open. You need it later in this quickstart.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

The C# sample code is set up to use X.509 certificates that are stored in a password-protected PKCS#12 formatted file (`certificate.pfx`). You still need the PEM formatted public key certificate file (`device-cert.pem`) that you just created to create an individual enrollment entry later in this quickstart.

1. To generate the PKCS12 formatted file expected by the sample, enter the following command:

    # [Windows](#tab/windows)

    ```bash
    winpty openssl pkcs12 -inkey device-key.pem -in device-cert.pem -export -out certificate.pfx
    ```

    # [Linux](#tab/linux)

    ```bash
    openssl pkcs12 -inkey device-key.pem -in device-cert.pem -export -out certificate.pfx
    ```

    ---

1. When asked to **Enter pass phrase for device-key.pem:**, use the same pass phrase you did previously, `1234`.

1. When asked to **Enter Export Password:**, use the password `1234`.

1. When asked **Verifying - Enter Export Password:**, use the password `1234` again.

    A PKCS12 formatted certificate file (*certificate.pfx*) should now be generated in the directory where you ran the `openssl` command.

1. Copy the PKCS12 formatted certificate file to the project directory for the X.509 device provisioning sample. The path given is relative to the location where you downloaded the sample repo.

    ```bash
    cp certificate.pfx ./azure-iot-sdk-csharp/provisioning/device/samples/"Getting Started"/X509Sample
    ```

You don't need the Git Bash prompt for the rest of this quickstart. However, you might want to keep it open to check your certificate if you have problems in later steps.

## Create a device enrollment

The Azure IoT Device Provisioning Service supports two types of enrollments:

* [Enrollment groups](concepts-service.md#enrollment-group): Used to enroll multiple related devices.
* [Individual enrollments](concepts-service.md#individual-enrollment): Used to enroll a single device.

This article demonstrates an individual enrollment for a single device to be provisioned with an IoT hub.

<!-- INCLUDE -->
[!INCLUDE [iot-dps-individual-enrollment-x509.md](../../includes/iot-dps-individual-enrollment-x509.md)]

## Prepare and run the device provisioning code

In this section, you update the sample code to send the device's boot sequence to your Device Provisioning Service instance. This boot sequence causes the device to be recognized and assigned to an IoT hub linked to the DPS instance.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-ansi-c"

In this section, you use your Git Bash prompt and the Visual Studio IDE.

### Configure the provisioning device code

In this section, you update the sample code with your Device Provisioning Service instance information.

1. In the Azure portal, select the **Overview** tab for your Device Provisioning Service.

1. Copy the **ID Scope** value.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/quick-create-simulated-device-x509/copy-id-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the ID scope on Azure portal.":::

1. Launch Visual Studio and open the new solution file that was created in the `cmake` directory you created in the root of the azure-iot-sdk-c git repository. The solution file is named `azure_iot_sdks.sln`.

1. In Solution Explorer for Visual Studio, navigate to **Provision_Samples > prov_dev_client_sample > Source Files** and open *prov_dev_client_sample.c*.

1. Find the `id_scope` constant, and replace the value with your **ID Scope** value that you copied in step 2.

    ```c
    static const char* id_scope = "0ne00000A0A";
    ```

1. Find the definition for the `main()` function in the same file. Make sure the `hsm_type` variable is set to `SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_X509`.

    ```c
    SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE hsm_type;
    //hsm_type = SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_TPM;
    hsm_type = SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_X509;
    //hsm_type = SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_SYMMETRIC_KEY;
    ```

1. Save your changes.

1. Right-click the **prov_dev_client_sample** project and select **Set as Startup Project**.

### Configure the custom HSM stub code

The specifics of interacting with actual secure hardware-based storage vary depending on the hardware. As a result, the certificate and private key used by the simulated device in this quickstart is hardcoded in the custom Hardware Security Module (HSM) stub code.

To update the custom HSM stub code to simulate the identity of the device with ID `my-x509-device`:

1. In Solution Explorer for Visual Studio, navigate to **Provision_Samples > custom_hsm_example > Source Files** and open *custom_hsm_example.c*.

1. Update the string value of the `COMMON_NAME` string constant using the common name you used when generating the device certificate, `my-x509-device`.

    ```c
    static const char* const COMMON_NAME = "my-x509-device";
    ```

1. Update the string value of the `CERTIFICATE` constant string using the device certificate, *device-cert.pem*, that you generated previously.

    The syntax of certificate text in the sample must follow the following pattern with no extra spaces or parsing done by Visual Studio.

    ```c
    static const char* const CERTIFICATE = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n"
    "MIIFOjCCAyKgAwIBAgIJAPzMa6s7mj7+MA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMCoxKDAmBgNV\n"
        ...
    "MDMwWhcNMjAxMTIyMjEzMDMwWjAqMSgwJgYDVQQDDB9BenVyZSBJb1QgSHViIENB\n"
    "-----END CERTIFICATE-----";        
    ```

    Updating this string value manually can be prone to error. To generate the proper syntax, you can copy and paste the following command into your **Git Bash prompt**, and press **ENTER**. This command generates the syntax for the `CERTIFICATE` string constant value and writes it to the output.

    ```Bash
    sed -e 's/^/"/;$ !s/$/""\\n"/;$ s/$/"/' device-cert.pem
    ```

    Copy and paste the output certificate text for the constant value.

1. Update the string value of the `PRIVATE_KEY` constant with the unencrypted private key for your device certificate, *unencrypted-device-key.pem*.

    The syntax of the private key text must follow the following pattern with no extra spaces or parsing done by Visual Studio.

    ```

    Updating this string value manually can be prone to error. To generate the proper syntax, you can copy and paste the following command into your **Git Bash prompt**, and press **ENTER**. This command  generates the syntax for the `PRIVATE_KEY` string constant value and writes it to the output.

    ```Bash
    sed -e 's/^/"/;$ !s/$/""\\n"/;$ s/$/"/' unencrypted-device-key.pem
    ```

    Copy and paste the output private key text for the constant value.

1. Copy the **ID Scope** value.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/quick-create-simulated-device-x509/copy-id-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the ID scope on Azure portal.":::

1. In your Windows command prompt, go to the sample directory, and install the packages needed by the sample. The path shown is relative to the location where you cloned the SDK.

    ```cmd
    cd .\azure-iot-sdk-node\provisioning\device\samples
    npm install
    ```

    The sample uses five environment variables to authenticate and provision an IoT device using DPS. These environment variables are:

    | Variable name              | Description                                     |
    | :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
    | `PROVISIONING_HOST`        |  The endpoint to use for connecting to your DPS instance. For this quickstart, use the global endpoint, `global.azure-devices-provisioning.net`. |
    | `PROVISIONING_IDSCOPE`     |  The ID Scope for your DPS instance. |
    | `PROVISIONING_REGISTRATION_ID` |  The registration ID for your device. It must match the subject common name in the device certificate. |
    | `CERTIFICATE_FILE`         |  The path to your device certificate file. |
    | `KEY_FILE`                 |  The path to your device private key file. |

1. Add environment variables for the global device endpoint and ID scope. Replace `<id-scope>` with the value you copied in step 2.

    ```cmd
    set PROVISIONING_HOST=global.azure-devices-provisioning.net
    set PROVISIONING_IDSCOPE=<id-scope>
    ```

1. Set the environment variable for the device registration ID. The registration ID for the IoT device must match subject common name on its device certificate. If you followed the steps in this quickstart to generate a self-signed test certificate, `my-x509-device` is both the subject name and the registration ID for the device.

    ```cmd
    set PROVISIONING_REGISTRATION_ID=my-x509-device
    ```

1. Set the environment variables for the device certificate and (unencrypted) device private key files.

    ```cmd
    set CERTIFICATE_FILE=.\device-cert.pem
    set KEY_FILE=.\unencrypted-device-key.pem
    ```

1. Run the sample and verify that the device was provisioned successfully.

    ```cmd
    node register_x509.js
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following example:

    ```output
    registration succeeded

1. In your Windows command prompt, navigate to the sample project folder. The path shown is relative to the location where you cloned the SDK

    ```cmd
    cd .\azure-iot-sdk-java\provisioning\provisioning-device-client-samples\provisioning-X509-sample
    ```

1. Enter the provisioning service and X.509 identity information in the sample code. This information is used during provisioning, for attestation of the simulated device, prior to device registration.

    1. Open the file `.\src\main\java\samples\com\microsoft\azure\sdk\iot\ProvisioningX509Sample.java` in your favorite editor.

    1. Update the following values with the **ID Scope** and **Provisioning Service Global Endpoint** that you copied previously.

        ```java
        private static final String idScope = "[Your ID scope here]";
        private static final String globalEndpoint = "[Your Provisioning Service Global Endpoint here]";
        private static final ProvisioningDeviceClientTransportProtocol PROVISIONING_DEVICE_CLIENT_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL = ProvisioningDeviceClientTransportProtocol.HTTPS;

    1. Update the value of the `leafPublicPem` constant string with the value of your certificate, *device-cert.pem*.

        The syntax of certificate text must follow the following pattern with no extra spaces or characters.

        ```java
        private static final String leafPublicPem = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n" +
        "MIIFOjCCAyKgAwIBAgIJAPzMa6s7mj7+MA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMCoxKDAmBgNV\n" +

        "-----END CERTIFICATE-----";        
        ```

        Updating this string value manually can be prone to error. To generate the proper syntax, you can copy and paste the following command into your **Git Bash prompt**, and press **ENTER**. This command generates the syntax for the `leafPublicPem` string constant value and writes it to the output.

        ```Bash
        sed 's/^/"/;$ !s/$/\\n" +/;$ s/$/"/' device-cert.pem
        ```

        Copy and paste the output certificate text for the constant value.

    1. Update the string value of the `leafPrivateKey` constant with the unencrypted private key for your device certificate, *unencrypted-device-key.pem*.

        The syntax of the private key text must follow the following pattern with no extra spaces or characters.

        ```java
        private static final String leafPrivateKey = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n" +
        "MIIJJwIBAAKCAgEAtjvKQjIhp0EE1PoADL1rfF/W6v4vlAzOSifKSQsaPeebqg8U\n" +

        "-----END PRIVATE KEY-----";
        ```

        Updating this string value manually can be prone to error. To generate the proper syntax, you can copy and paste the following command into your **Git Bash prompt**, and press **ENTER**. This command generates the syntax for the `leafPrivateKey` string constant value and writes it to the output.

        ```Bash
        sed 's/^/"/;$ !s/$/\\n" +/;$ s/$/"/' unencrypted-device-key.pem
        ```

        Copy and paste the output private key text for the constant value.

    1. Save your changes.

1. Build the sample, and then go to the `target` folder.

    ```cmd
    mvn clean install
    cd target
    ```

1. The build outputs .jar file in the `target` folder with the following file format: `provisioning-x509-sample-{version}-with-deps.jar`; for example: `provisioning-x509-sample-1.8.1-with-deps.jar`. Execute the .jar file. You might need to replace the version in the following command.

    ```cmd
    java -jar ./provisioning-x509-sample-1.8.1-with-deps.jar
    ```

    The sample connects to DPS, which provisions the device to an IoT hub. After the device is provisioned, the sample sends some test messages to the IoT hub.
