# Device concepts

IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service is a helper service for IoT Hub that you use to configure zero-touch device provisioning to a specified IoT hub. With IoT DPS you can provision millions of devices in a secure and scalable manner.

Device provisioning  is a two part process. The first part is establishing the initial connection between the device and the IoT solution by *registering* the device. The second part is applying the proper *configuration* to the device based on the specific requirements of the solution it was registered to. Only once both those two steps have been completed can I say that the device has been fully *provisioned*. IoT DPS automates these both steps to provide a seamless provisioning experience for the device.

This article gives an overview of the *device* concepts involved in device provisioning. This article is most relevant to personas involved in the [manufacture step](about-iot-dps.md#manufacture-step) of getting a device ready for deployment.

## Attestation mechanism

The attestation mechanism is the method used for confirming a device's identity. The attestation mechanism is also relevant to the enrollment list, which tells the DPS which method of attestation to use with a given device.

> [!NOTE]
> IoT Hub uses "authentication scheme" for a similar concept in that service.

DPS supports two forms of attestation:
* **x509 certificates** based on the standard x509 certificate authentication flow.
* **SAS tokens** based on a nonce challenge using the TPM standard for keys. This does not require a physical TPM on the device, but the service expects to attest using the endorsement key per the [TPM spec](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/work-groups/trusted-platform-module/).

## Hardware security module

The hardware security module, or HSM, is used for secure, hardware-based storage of device secrets, and is the most secure form of secret storage. Both x509 certificates and SAS tokens can be stored in the HSM. HSMs can be used with both attestation mechanisms the DPS supports.

> [!TIP]
> We strongly recommend using an HSM with devices to securely store secrets on your devices.

Device secrets may also be stored in software (memory), but it is a less secure form of storage than an HSM.

## Registration ID

The registration ID is used to uniquely identify a device in DPS. The device ID must be unique in the DPS [ID scope](#id-scope). Each device must have a registration ID. The registration ID is alphanumeric, lowercase, and may contain hyphens.

* In the case of TPM, the registration ID is provided by the TPM itself.
* In the case of x509-based attestation, the registration ID is provided as the subject name of the certificate.

## Device ID

The device ID is the ID as it appears in IoT Hub. The desired device ID may be set in the enrollment entry, but it is not required to be set. If no desired device ID is specified in DPS, the registration ID is used as the device ID when registering the device. Learn more about [device IDs in IoT Hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-identity-registry.md).

## ID scope

The ID scope is assigned to a DPS when it is created by the user and is used to uniquely identify the specific DPS the device will register through. The ID scope is generated by the service and is immutable, which guarantees uniqueness.

> [!NOTE]
> Uniqueness is important for long-running deployment operations and merger and acquisition scenarios.
