# Tutorial: Provision multiple X.509 devices using enrollment groups

In this tutorial, you learn how to provision groups of IoT devices that use X.509 certificates for authentication. Sample device code from the Azure IoT SDK will be executed on your development machine to simulate provisioning of X.509 devices. On real devices, device code would be deployed and run from the IoT device.

The Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service supports two types of enrollments for provisioning devices:

* *Enrollment groups*: Used to enroll multiple related devices. **This tutorial demonstrates provisioning with enrollment groups.**
* *Individual enrollments*: Used to enroll a single device.

The Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service supports three forms of authentication for provisioning devices:

* X.509 certificates - **This tutorial demonstrates X.509 certificate attestation**
* Trusted platform module (TPM)
* Symmetric keys

In production scenarios, a [Hardware Security Module (HSM)](./concepts-service.md#hardware-security-module) is used for secure, hardware-based storage of device secrets. An HSM can be used with symmetric key, X.509 certificate, or TPM attestation to provide secure storage for secrets. Hardware-based storage of device secrets is recommended to help protect sensitive information like your device certificate's private key.

In this tutorial, you complete the following objectives:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Create a certificate chain of trust to organize a set of devices using X.509 certificates.
> * Create a new group enrollment that uses the certificate chain.
> * Set up the development environment.
> * Provision devices using the certificate chain using sample code in the Azure IoT device SDK.

  >[!NOTE]
  > Unless you're familiar with OpenSSL and already have it installed on your Windows machine, we recommend using OpenSSL from the Git Bash prompt. Alternatively, you can choose to download the source code and build OpenSSL. If you do choose to build or download OpenSSL make sure that the OpenSSL binary is accessible in your path and that the `OPENSSL_CNF` environment variable is set to the path of your *openssl.cnf* file.

## Prepare your development environment

::: zone pivot="programming-language-ansi-c"

In this section, you prepare a development environment used to build the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c). The SDK includes sample code and tools used by devices provisioning with DPS.

1. In a web browser, go to the [Release page of the Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/releases/latest).

1. Copy the tag name for the latest release of the Azure IoT C SDK, for example: `lts_03_2024`.

1. Open a Windows command prompt and run the following commands to clone the latest release of the [Azure IoT Device SDK for C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) GitHub repository. Replace `<release-tag>` with the tag you copied in the previous step.

    ```cmd
    git clone -b <release-tag> https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git
    cd azure-iot-sdk-c
    git submodule update --init
    ```

    This operation could take several minutes to complete.

1. When the operation is complete, run the following commands from the `azure-iot-sdk-c` directory:

    ```cmd
    mkdir cmake
    cd cmake
    ```

1. The code sample uses an X.509 certificate to provide attestation via X.509 authentication. Run the following command to build a version of the SDK specific to your development platform that includes the device provisioning client. A Visual Studio solution for the simulated device is generated in the `cmake` directory.

    Replace `<path` with the absolute path to the C SDK that you cloned.

    ```cmd
    cmake -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON -Dhsm_custom_lib=c:/<path>/azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/provisioning_client/samples/custom_hsm_example/Debug/custom_hsm_example.lib ..
    ```

    >[!TIP]
    >If `cmake` doesn't find your C++ compiler, you may get build errors while running the above command. If that happens, try running the command in the [Visual Studio command prompt](/dotnet/framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs).

1. When the build succeeds, the last few output lines look similar to the following output:

    ```output
    cmake -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON -Dhsm_custom_lib=c:/azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/provisioning_client/samples/custom_hsm_example/Debug/custom_hsm_example.lib ..

## Create an X.509 certificate chain

In this section, you generate an X.509 certificate chain of three certificates for testing each device with this tutorial. The certificates have the following hierarchy.

:::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-custom-hsm-enrollment-group-x509/example-device-cert-chain.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows relationship of root C A, intermediate C A, and device certificates." border="false":::

*Root certificate* You upload and verify the root certificate with DPS. This verification enables DPS to trust that certificate and verify certificates signed by it.

*Intermediate certificate*: It's common to use intermediate certificates to group devices logically by product lines, company divisions, or other criteria. This tutorial uses a certificate chain with one intermediate certificate, but in a production scenario you may have several. The intermediate certificate in this chain is signed by the root certificate. This certificate is provided to the enrollment group created in DPS. This configuration allows managing a whole group of devices that have device certificates signed by the same intermediate certificate.

*Device certificates*: A device certificates (sometimes called a leaf certificate) is signed by the intermediate certificate and stored on the device along with its private key. Ideally these sensitive items would be stored securely with an HSM. Multiple device certificates can be signed by the same intermediate certificate. Each device presents its certificate and private key, along with the certificate chain, when attempting provisioning.

For more information about certificate chains, see [X.509 certificate attestation](concepts-x509-attestation.md).

### Set up the X.509 OpenSSL environment

In this section, you create the OpenSSL configuration files, directory structure, and other files used by the OpenSSL commands.

1. Open a Git Bash command prompt and navigate to a folder where you want to generate the X.509 certificates and keys for this tutorial.

1. Create an OpenSSL configuration file named *openssl_root_ca.cnf* for your root CA certificate. OpenSSL configuration files contain policies and definitions that are consumed by OpenSSL commands. Copy and paste the following text into the *openssl_root_ca.cnf* file:

    ```text
    # OpenSSL root CA configuration file.

    [ ca ]
    default_ca = CA_default

    extendedKeyUsage = critical, OCSPSigning
    ```

1. Create an OpenSSL configuration file named *openssl_device_intermediate_ca.cnf* to use for intermediate and device certificates. Copy and paste the following text into the *openssl_device_intermediate_ca.cnf* file:

    ```text
    # OpenSSL root CA configuration file.

1. Create the directory structure, the database file *index.txt*, and the serial number file *serial* that are used by OpenSSL commands in this tutorial:

    ```bash
    mkdir certs csr newcerts private
    touch index.txt
    openssl rand -hex 16 > serial
    ```

### Create a root CA certificate

Run the following commands to create a root CA private key and a root CA certificate. You use this certificate and key to sign your intermediate certificate.

1. In your Git Bash terminal, create a root CA private key:

    ```bash
    openssl genrsa -aes256 -passout pass:1234 -out ./private/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.key.pem 4096
    ```

1. Create a root CA certificate:

    ```bash
    openssl req -new -x509 -config ./openssl_root_ca.cnf -passin pass:1234 -key ./private/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.key.pem -subj '//CN=Azure IoT Hub CA Cert Test Only' -days 30 -sha256 -extensions v3_ca -out ./certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The extra forward slash given for the subject name (`//CN=Azure IoT Hub CA Cert Test Only`) is only required to escape the string with Git on Windows platforms. On Linux platforms, provide the subject name with only one forward slash (`/CN=Azure IoT Hub CA Cert Test Only`).

1. Examine the root CA certificate:

    ```bash
    openssl x509 -noout -text -in ./certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem
    ```

    Observe that the **Issuer** and the **Subject** are both the root CA.

    ```output
    Certificate:
        Data:
            Version: 3 (0x2)
            Serial Number:

                Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
                    RSA Public-Key: (4096 bit)
    ```

### Create an intermediate CA certificate

Run the following commands to create an intermediate CA private key and an intermediate CA certificate. You use this certificate and key to sign your device certificates.

1. In your Git Bash terminal, create an intermediate CA private key:

    ```bash
    openssl genrsa -aes256 -passout pass:1234 -out ./private/azure-iot-test-only.intermediate.key.pem 4096
    ```

1. Create an intermediate CA certificate signing request (CSR):

    ```bash
    openssl req -new -sha256 -passin pass:1234 -config ./openssl_device_intermediate_ca.cnf -subj '//CN=Azure IoT Hub Intermediate Cert Test Only' -key ./private/azure-iot-test-only.intermediate.key.pem -out ./csr/azure-iot-test-only.intermediate.csr.pem
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The extra forward slash given for the subject name (`//CN=Azure IoT Hub Intermediate Cert Test Only`) is only required to escape the string with Git on Windows platforms. On Linux platforms, provide the subject name with a single forward slash (`/CN=Azure IoT Hub Intermediate Cert Test Only`).

1. Sign the intermediate certificate with the root CA certificate

    ```bash
    openssl ca -batch -config ./openssl_root_ca.cnf -passin pass:1234 -extensions v3_intermediate_ca -days 30 -notext -md sha256 -in ./csr/azure-iot-test-only.intermediate.csr.pem -out ./certs/azure-iot-test-only.intermediate.cert.pem
    ```

1. Examine the intermediate CA certificate:

    ```bash
    openssl x509 -noout -text -in ./certs/azure-iot-test-only.intermediate.cert.pem
    ```

    Observe that the **Issuer** is the root CA, and the **Subject** is the intermediate CA.

    ```output

### Create device certificates

In this section, you create two device certificates and their full chain certificates. The full chain certificate contains the device certificate, the intermediate CA certificate, and the root CA certificate. The device must present its full chain certificate when it registers with DPS.

1. Create the first device private key.

    ```bash
    openssl genrsa -out ./private/device-01.key.pem 4096
    ```

1. Create the device certificate CSR.

    The subject common name (CN) of the device certificate must be set to the [registration ID](./concepts-service.md#registration-id) that your device uses to register with DPS. The registration ID is a case-insensitive string of alphanumeric characters plus the special characters: `'-'`, `'.'`, `'_'`, `':'`. The last character must be alphanumeric or dash (`'-'`). The common name must adhere to this format. DPS supports registration IDs up to 128 characters long; however, the maximum length of the subject common name in an X.509 certificate is 64 characters. The registration ID, therefore, is limited to 64 characters when using X.509 certificates. For group enrollments, the registration ID is also used as the device ID in IoT Hub.

    The subject common name is set using the `-subj` parameter. In the following command, the common name is set to **device-01**.

    ```bash
    openssl req -config ./openssl_device_intermediate_ca.cnf -key ./private/device-01.key.pem -subj '//CN=device-01' -new -sha256 -out ./csr/device-01.csr.pem
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The extra forward slash given for the subject name (`//CN=device-01`) is only required to escape the string with Git on Windows platforms. On Linux platforms, provide the subject name with a single forward slash (`/CN=device-01`).

1. Sign the device certificate.

    ```bash
    openssl ca -batch -config ./openssl_device_intermediate_ca.cnf -passin pass:1234 -extensions usr_cert -days 30 -notext -md sha256 -in ./csr/device-01.csr.pem -out ./certs/device-01.cert.pem
    ```

1. Examine the device certificate:

    ```bash
    openssl x509 -noout -text -in ./certs/device-01.cert.pem
    ```

    Observe that the **Issuer** is the intermediate CA, and the **Subject** is the device registration ID, `device-01`.

    ```output
    Certificate:
        Data:
            Version: 3 (0x2)
            Serial Number:
                d9:55:87:57:41:c8:4c:47:6c:ee:ba:83:5d:ae:db:3a
            Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
            Issuer: CN = Azure IoT Hub Intermediate Cert Test Only
            Validity
                Not Before: Jun 20 22:55:39 2022 GMT
                Not After : Jul 20 22:55:39 2022 GMT
            Subject: CN = device-01
            Subject Public Key Info:
                Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
                    RSA Public-Key: (4096 bit)
     ```

1. The device must present the full certificate chain when it authenticates with DPS. Use the following command to create the certificate chain:

    ```bash
    cat ./certs/device-01.cert.pem ./certs/azure-iot-test-only.intermediate.cert.pem ./certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem > ./certs/device-01-full-chain.cert.pem
    ```  

1. Open the certificate chain file, *./certs/device-01-full-chain.cert.pem*, in a text editor to examine it. The certificate chain text contains the full chain of all three certificates. You use this certificate chain later in this tutorial to provision `device-01`.

    The full chain text has the following format:

    ```output
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        <Text for the device certificate includes public key>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        <Text for the intermediate certificate includes public key>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        <Text for the root certificate includes public key>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```

1. To create the private key, X.509 certificate, and full chain certificate for the second device, copy and paste this script into your Git Bash command prompt. To create certificates for more devices, you can modify the `registration_id` variable declared at the beginning of the script.

    ```bash
    registration_id=device-02
    echo $registration_id
    openssl genrsa -out ./private/${registration_id}.key.pem 4096
    openssl req -config ./openssl_device_intermediate_ca.cnf -key ./private/${registration_id}.key.pem -subj "//CN=$registration_id" -new -sha256 -out ./csr/${registration_id}.csr.pem
    openssl ca -batch -config ./openssl_device_intermediate_ca.cnf -passin pass:1234 -extensions usr_cert -days 30 -notext -md sha256 -in ./csr/${registration_id}.csr.pem -out ./certs/${registration_id}.cert.pem
    cat ./certs/${registration_id}.cert.pem ./certs/azure-iot-test-only.intermediate.cert.pem ./certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem > ./certs/${registration_id}-full-chain.cert.pem
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The extra forward slash given for the subject name (`//CN=$registration_id`) is only required to escape the string with Git on Windows platforms. On Linux platforms, provide the subject name with a single forward slash (`/CN=$registration_id`).

    >[!NOTE]
    > This script uses the registration ID as the base filename for the private key and certificate files. If your registration ID contains characters that aren't valid filename characters, you'll need to modify the script accordingly.

    > [!WARNING]
    > The text for the certificates only contains public key information.
    >
    > However, the device must also have access to the private key for the device certificate. This is necessary because the device must perform verification using that key at runtime when it attempts to provision. The sensitivity of this key is one of the main reasons it is recommended to use hardware-based storage in a real HSM to help secure private keys.

You use the following files in the rest of this tutorial:

|   Certificate                 |  File  | Description |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| root CA certificate.              | *certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem* | Uploaded to DPS and verified. |
| intermediate CA certificate   | *certs/azure-iot-test-only.intermediate.cert.pem* | Used to create an enrollment group in DPS. |
| device-01 private key          | *private/device-01.key.pem* | Used by the device to verify ownership of the device certificate during authentication with DPS. |
| device-01 full chain certificate  | *certs/device-01-full-chain.cert.pem* | Presented by the device to authenticate and register with DPS. |
| device-02 private key          | *private/device-02.key.pem* | Used by the device to verify ownership of the device certificate during authentication with DPS. |
| device-02 full chain certificate  | *certs/device-02-full-chain.cert.pem* | Presented by the device to authenticate and register with DPS. |

## Verify ownership of the root certificate

For DPS to be able to validate the device's certificate chain during authentication, you must upload and verify ownership of the root CA certificate. To add the root CA certificate to your DPS instance, follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your Device Provisioning Service instance.

1. Open **Certificates** from the left-hand menu and then select **Add** to add a new certificate.

1. Enter a friendly display name for your certificate. Browse to the location of the root CA certificate file `certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem`. Select **Upload**.

1. Select the box to **Set certificate status to verified on upload**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-custom-hsm-enrollment-group-x509/add-root-certificate.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows adding the root CA certificate and the set certificate status to verified on upload box selected.":::

1. Select **Save**.

1. Make sure your certificate is shown in the certificate tab with a status of *Verified*.
  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-custom-hsm-enrollment-group-x509/verify-root-certificate.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the verified root C A certificate in the list of certificates.":::

## Update the certificate store on Windows-based devices

On non-Windows devices, you can pass the certificate chain from the code as the certificate store.

On Windows-based devices, you must add the signing certificates (root and intermediate) to a Windows [certificate store](/windows/win32/secauthn/certificate-stores). Otherwise, the signing certificates won't be transported to DPS by a secure channel with Transport Layer Security (TLS).

> [!TIP]
> It's also possible to use OpenSSL instead of secure channel (Schannel) with the C SDK. For more information on using OpenSSL, see [Using OpenSSL in the SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/master/doc/devbox_setup.md#using-openssl-in-the-sdk).

To add the signing certificates to the certificate store in Windows-based devices:

1. In your Git Bash terminal, convert your signing certificates to `.pfx` as follows.

    Root CA certificate:

    ```bash
    openssl pkcs12 -inkey ./private/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.key.pem -in ./certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem -export -passin pass:1234 -passout pass:1234 -out ./certs/root.pfx
    ```

    Intermediate CA certificate:

    ```bash
    openssl pkcs12 -inkey ./private/azure-iot-test-only.intermediate.key.pem -in ./certs/azure-iot-test-only.intermediate.cert.pem -export -passin pass:1234 -passout pass:1234 -out ./certs/intermediate.pfx
    ```

2. Right-click the Windows **Start** button, then select **Run**. Enter *certmgr.msc* and select **Ok** to start certificate manager.

3. In certificate manager, under **Certificates - Current User**, select **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**. Then on the menu, select **Action** > **All Tasks** > **Import**.

4. Follow the Certificate Import Wizard steps to import `root.pfx`.

    * Make sure to search by **Personal information Exchange (.pfx)**
    * Use `1234` as the password.
    * Place the certificate in the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** certificate store.

5. Repeat these certificate manager steps to import `intermediate.pfx`.

    * Place the certificate in the **Intermediate Certification Authorities** certificate store.

Your signing certificates are now trusted on the Windows-based device and the full chain can be transported to DPS.

## Create an enrollment group

<!-- INCLUDE -->
[!INCLUDE [iot-dps-enrollment-group-x509.md](../../includes/iot-dps-enrollment-group-x509.md)]

## Prepare and run the device provisioning code

In this section, you update the sample code with your Device Provisioning Service instance information. If a device is authenticated, it's assigned to an IoT hub linked to the Device Provisioning Service instance configured in this section.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-ansi-c"

In this section, you use your Git Bash prompt and the Visual Studio IDE.

### Configure the provisioning device code

In this section, you update the sample code with your Device Provisioning Service instance information.

1. In the Azure portal, select the **Overview** tab for your Device Provisioning Service instance and note the **ID Scope** value.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-custom-hsm-enrollment-group-x509/copy-id-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the ID scope on the DPS overview pane.":::

2. Launch Visual Studio and open the new solution file that was created in the `cmake` directory you created in the root of the azure-iot-sdk-c git repository. The solution file is named `azure_iot_sdks.sln`.

3. In Solution Explorer for Visual Studio, navigate to **Provision_Samples > prov_dev_client_sample > Source Files** and open *prov_dev_client_sample.c*.

4. Find the `id_scope` constant, and replace the value with your **ID Scope** value that you copied earlier. For example:

    ```c
    static const char* id_scope = "0ne00000A0A";
    ```

5. Find the definition for the `main()` function in the same file. Make sure the `hsm_type` variable is set to `SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_X509` and that all other `hsm_type` lines are commented out. For example:

    ```c
    SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE hsm_type;
    //hsm_type = SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_TPM;
    hsm_type = SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_X509;
    //hsm_type = SECURE_DEVICE_TYPE_SYMMETRIC_KEY;
    ```

6. Save your changes.

7. Right-click the **prov\_dev\_client\_sample** project and select **Set as Startup Project**.

### Configure the custom HSM stub code

The specifics of interacting with actual secure hardware-based storage vary depending on the device hardware. The certificate chains used by the simulated devices in this tutorial will be hardcoded in the custom HSM stub code. In a real-world scenario, the certificate chain would be stored in the actual HSM hardware to provide better security for sensitive information. Methods similar to the stub methods used in this sample would then be implemented to read the secrets from that hardware-based storage.

While HSM hardware isn't required, it's recommended to protect sensitive information like the certificate's private key. If an actual HSM was being called by the sample, the private key wouldn't be present in the source code. Having the key in the source code exposes the key to anyone that can view the code. This is only done in this tutorial to assist with learning.

To update the custom HSM stub code to simulate the identity of the device with ID `device-01`:

1. In Solution Explorer for Visual Studio, navigate to **Provision_Samples > custom_hsm_example > Source Files** and open *custom_hsm_example.c*.

2. Update the string value of the `COMMON_NAME` string constant using the common name you used when generating the device certificate.

    ```c
    static const char* const COMMON_NAME = "device-01";
    ```

3. In your Git Bash terminal, run the following command to generate the string constant for your device certificate:

    ```Bash
    sed -e 's/^/"/;$ !s/$/""\\n"/;$ s/$/"/' ./certs/device-01-full-chain.cert.pem
    ```

   Copy the output of this command.

3. Update the string value of the `CERTIFICATE` constant string using the certificate chain you saved in *./certs/device-01-full-chain.cert.pem* after generating your certificates. Use the output certificate text from the previous step for the constant value.

    The syntax of certificate text must match the following pattern with no extra spaces or parsing done by Visual Studio.

    ```c
    // <Device/leaf cert>
    // <intermediates>
    // <root>
    static const char* const CERTIFICATE = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n"
    "MIIFOjCCAyKgAwIBAgIJAPzMa6s7mj7+MA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMCoxKDAmBgNV\n"
        ...
    "MDMwWhcNMjAxMTIyMjEzMDMwWjAqMSgwJgYDVQQDDB9BenVyZSBJb1QgSHViIENB\n"
    "-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"
    "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n"
    "MIIFPDCCAySgAwIBAgIBATANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADAqMSgwJgYDVQQDDB9BenVy\n"
        ...
    "MTEyMjIxMzAzM1owNDEyMDAGA1UEAwwpQXp1cmUgSW9UIEh1YiBJbnRlcm1lZGlh\n"
    "-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"
    "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n"
    "MIIFOjCCAyKgAwIBAgIJAPzMa6s7mj7+MA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMCoxKDAmBgNV\n"
        ...
    "MDMwWhcNMjAxMTIyMjEzMDMwWjAqMSgwJgYDVQQDDB9BenVyZSBJb1QgSHViIENB\n"
    "-----END CERTIFICATE-----";        
    ```

4. In Git Bash, run the following command to generate the string constant for your device private key:

    ```Bash
    sed -e 's/^/"/;$ !s/$/""\\n"/;$ s/$/"/' ./private/device-01.key.pem
    ```

   Copy the output of this command.

4. Update the string value of the `PRIVATE_KEY` constant with the private key for your device certificate. Use the output private key text from the previous step for the constant value.

    The syntax of the private key text must match the following pattern with no extra spaces or parsing done by Visual Studio.

    ```c
    static const char* const PRIVATE_KEY = "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
    "MIIJJwIBAAKCAgEAtjvKQjIhp0EE1PoADL1rfF/W6v4vlAzOSifKSQsaPeebqg8U\n"
        ...
    "X7fi9OZ26QpnkS5QjjPTYI/wwn0J9YAwNfKSlNeXTJDfJ+KpjXBcvaLxeBQbQhij\n"
    "-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----";
    ```

5. Save your changes.

6. Right-click the **custom_hsm_example** project and select **Build**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You must build the **custom_hsm_example** project before you build the rest of the solution in the next section.

### Run the sample

1. On the Visual Studio menu, select **Debug** > **Start without debugging** to run the solution. When prompted to rebuild the project, select **Yes** to rebuild the project before running.

    The following output is an example of simulated device `device-01` successfully booting up and connecting to the provisioning service. The device was assigned to an IoT hub and registered:

    ```output
    Provisioning API Version: 1.8.0

    Press enter key to exit:
    ```

1. Repeat the steps in [Configure the custom HSM stub code](#configure-the-custom-hsm-stub-code) for your second device (`device-02`) and run the sample again. Use the following values for that device:

    |   Description                 |  Value  |
    | :---------------------------- | :--------- |
    | Common name                | `"device-02"` |

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

The C# sample code is set up to use X.509 certificates that are stored in a password-protected PKCS#12 formatted file (.pfx). The full chain certificates you created previously are in the PEM format. To convert the full chain certificates to PKCS#12 format, enter the following commands in your Git Bash prompt from the directory where you previously ran the OpenSSL commands.

* device-01

    ```bash
    openssl pkcs12 -inkey ./private/device-01.key.pem -in ./certs/device-01-full-chain.cert.pem -export -passin pass:1234 -passout pass:1234 -out ./certs/device-01-full-chain.cert.pfx
    ```

* device-02

    ```bash
    openssl pkcs12 -inkey ./private/device-02.key.pem -in ./certs/device-02-full-chain.cert.pem -export -passin pass:1234 -passout pass:1234 -out ./certs/device-02-full-chain.cert.pfx
    ```

In the rest of this section, use your Windows command prompt.

1. In the Azure portal, select the **Overview** tab for your Device Provisioning Service.

2. Copy the **ID Scope** value.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/quick-create-simulated-device-x509/copy-id-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the ID scope on Azure portal.":::

3. In your Windows command prompt, change to the *X509Sample* directory. This directory is located in the SDK repository that you cloned in an earlier step: *.\azure-iot-sdk-csharp\provisioning\device\samples\getting started\X509Sample*.

4. Enter the following command to build and run the X.509 device provisioning sample. Replace `<id-scope>` with the ID Scope that you copied from the Azure portal. Replace `<your-certificate-folder>` with the path to the folder where you ran your OpenSSL commands.

    ```cmd
    dotnet run -- -s <id-scope> -c <your-certificate-folder>\certs\device-01-full-chain.cert.pfx -p 1234
    ```

   The device connects to DPS and is assigned to an IoT hub. Then, the device sends a telemetry message to the IoT hub. You should see output similar to the following example:

    ```output
    Loading the certificate...

In the following steps, use your Windows command prompt.

1. In the Azure portal, select the **Overview** tab for your Device Provisioning Service.

1. Copy the **ID Scope** value.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-custom-hsm-enrollment-group-x509/copy-id-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the ID scope in the Azure portal.":::

1. In your Windows command prompt, go to the sample directory, and install the packages needed by the sample. The path shown is relative to the location where you cloned the SDK.

    ```cmd

    npm install
    ```

1. In the *provisioning\device\samples* folder, open *register_x509.js* and review the code.

    The sample defaults to MQTT as the transport protocol. If you want to use a different protocol, comment out the following line and uncomment the line for the appropriate protocol.

    ```javascript

    | `PROVISIONING_IDSCOPE`     |  The ID Scope for your DPS instance. |
    | `PROVISIONING_REGISTRATION_ID` |  The registration ID for your device. It must match the subject common name in the device certificate. |
    | `CERTIFICATE_FILE`           |  The path to your device full chain certificate file. |
    | `KEY_FILE`            |  The path to your device certificate private key file. |

    The `ProvisioningDeviceClient.register()` method attempts to register your device.

1. Add environment variables for the global device endpoint and ID scope. Replace `<id-scope>` with the value you copied from the Azure portal.

    ```cmd
    set PROVISIONING_HOST=global.azure-devices-provisioning.net
    set PROVISIONING_IDSCOPE=<id-scope>
    ```

1. Set the environment variable for the device registration ID. The registration ID for the IoT device must match subject common name on its device certificate. For this tutorial, *device-01* is both the subject name and the registration ID for the device.

    ```cmd
    set PROVISIONING_REGISTRATION_ID=device-01
    ```

1. Set the environment variables for the device full chain certificate and device private key files you generated previously. Replace `<your-certificate-folder>` with the path to the folder where you ran your OpenSSL commands.

    ```cmd
    set CERTIFICATE_FILE=<your-certificate-folder>\certs\device-01-full-chain.cert.pem
    set KEY_FILE=<your-certificate-folder>\private\device-01.key.pem
    ```

1. Run the sample and verify that the device was provisioned successfully.

    ```cmd
    node register_x509.js
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following example:

    ```output
    registration succeeded
    assigned hub=contoso-hub-2.azure-devices.net
    deviceId=device-01
    Client connected
    send status: MessageEnqueued
    ```

1. Update the environment variables for your second device (`device-02`) according to the following table and run the sample again.

    |   Environment Variable        |  Value  |
    | :---------------------------- | :--------- |
    | PROVISIONING_REGISTRATION_ID  | `device-02` |
    | CERTIFICATE_FILE              | *\<your-certificate-folder\>\certs\device-02-full-chain.cert.pem* |
    | KEY_FILE                      | *\<your-certificate-folder\>\private\device-02.key.pem* |

In the following steps, use your Windows command prompt.

1. In the Azure portal, select the **Overview** tab for your Device Provisioning Service.

1. Copy the **ID Scope**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-custom-hsm-enrollment-group-x509/copy-id-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the ID scope in the Azure portal.":::

1. In your Windows command prompt, go to the directory of the [provision_x509.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/blob/v2/samples/async-hub-scenarios/provision_x509.py) sample. The path shown is relative to the location where you cloned the SDK.

    ```cmd
    cd .\azure-iot-sdk-python\samples\async-hub-scenarios
    ```

    This sample uses six environment variables to authenticate and provision an IoT device using DPS. These environment variables are:

    | Variable name              | Description                                     |
    | :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
    | `PROVISIONING_HOST`        |  The endpoint to use for connecting to your DPS instance. For this tutorial, use the global endpoint, `global.azure-devices-provisioning.net`. |
    | `PROVISIONING_IDSCOPE`     |  The ID Scope for your DPS instance. |
    | `DPS_X509_REGISTRATION_ID` |  The registration ID for your device. It must match the subject common name in the device certificate. |
    | `X509_CERT_FILE`           |  The path to your device full chain certificate file. |
    | `X509_KEY_FILE`            |  The path to your device certificate private key file. |
    | `PASS_PHRASE`              |  The pass phrase used to encrypt the private key file (if used). Not needed for this tutorial. |

1. Add the environment variables for the global device endpoint and ID scope. For the ID scope variable, use the value you copied from the Azure portal.

    ```cmd
    set PROVISIONING_HOST=global.azure-devices-provisioning.net
    set PROVISIONING_IDSCOPE=<ID scope for your DPS resource>
    ```

1. Set the environment variable for the device registration ID. The registration ID for the IoT device must match subject common name on its device certificate. For this tutorial, *device-01* is both the subject name and the registration ID for the device.

    ```cmd
    set DPS_X509_REGISTRATION_ID=device-01
    ```

1. Set the environment variables for the device full chain certificate and device private key files you generated previously. Replace `<your-certificate-folder>` with the path to the folder where you ran your OpenSSL commands.

    ```cmd
    set X509_CERT_FILE=<your-certificate-folder>\certs\device-01-full-chain.cert.pem
    set X509_KEY_FILE=<your-certificate-folder>\private\device-01.key.pem
    ```

1. Review the code for [provision_x509.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/blob/v2/samples/async-hub-scenarios/provision_x509.py). If you're not using **Python version 3.7** or later, make the [code change mentioned here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/tree/v2/samples/async-hub-scenarios#advanced-iot-hub-scenario-samples-for-the-azure-iot-hub-device-sdk) to replace `asyncio.run(main())`.

1. Run the sample. The sample connects to DPS, which will provision the device to an IoT hub. After the device is provisioned, the sample sends some test messages to the IoT hub.

    ```cmd
    python provision_x509.py
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following example:

    ```output
    The complete registration result is
    device-01
    contoso-hub-2.azure-devices.net
    initialAssignment
    null
    Will send telemetry from the provisioned device

    done sending message #6
    done sending message #7
    done sending message #8
    done sending message #9
    done sending message #10
    ```

1. Update the environment variables for your second device (`device-02`) according to the following table and run the sample again.

    |   Environment Variable        |  Value  |
    | :---------------------------- | :--------- |
    | DPS_X509_REGISTRATION_ID      | `device-02` |
    | X509_CERT_FILE                | *\<your-certificate-folder\>\certs\device-02-full-chain.cert.pem* |
    | X509_KEY_FILE                 | *\<your-certificate-folder\>\private\device-02.key.pem* |

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"

In the following steps, you use both your Windows command prompt and your Git Bash prompt.

1. In the Azure portal, select the **Overview** tab for your Device Provisioning Service.

1. Copy the **ID Scope**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-custom-hsm-enrollment-group-x509/copy-id-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the ID scope in the Azure portal.":::

1. In your Windows command prompt, navigate to the sample project folder. The path shown is relative to the location where you cloned the SDK

    ```cmd
    cd .\azure-iot-sdk-java\provisioning\provisioning-device-client-samples\provisioning-X509-sample
    ```

1. Enter the provisioning service and X.509 identity information in the sample code. This is used during provisioning, for attestation of the simulated device, prior to device registration.

    1. Open the file `.\src\main\java\samples\com\microsoft\azure\sdk\iot\ProvisioningX509Sample.java` in your favorite editor.

    1. Update the following values. For `idScope`, use the **ID Scope** that you copied previously. For global endpoint, use the  **Global device endpoint**. This endpoint is the same for every DPS instance, `global.azure-devices-provisioning.net`.

        ```java
        private static final String idScope = "[Your ID scope here]";
        private static final String globalEndpoint = "[Your Provisioning Service Global Endpoint here]";
        ```

    1. The sample defaults to using HTTPS as the transport protocol. If you want to change the protocol, comment out the following line, and uncomment the line for the protocol you want to use.

        ```java
        private static final ProvisioningDeviceClientTransportProtocol PROVISIONING_DEVICE_CLIENT_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL = ProvisioningDeviceClientTransportProtocol.HTTPS;
        ```

    1. Update the value of the `leafPublicPem` constant string with the value of your device certificate, *device-01.cert.pem*.

        The syntax of certificate text must match the following pattern with no extra spaces or characters.

        ```java
        private static final String leafPublicPem = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n"
        "MIIFOjCCAyKgAwIBAgIJAPzMa6s7mj7+MA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMCoxKDAmBgNV\n"
            ...
        "MDMwWhcNMjAxMTIyMjEzMDMwWjAqMSgwJgYDVQQDDB9BenVyZSBJb1QgSHViIENB\n"
        "-----END CERTIFICATE-----";        
        ```

        Updating this string value manually can be prone to error. To generate the proper syntax, you can copy and paste the following command into your **Git Bash prompt**, and press **ENTER**. This command  generates the syntax for the `leafPublicPem` string constant value and writes it to the output.

        ```Bash
        sed 's/^/"/;$ !s/$/\\n" +/;$ s/$/"/' ./certs/device-01.cert.pem
        ```

        Copy and paste the output certificate text for the constant value.

    1. Update the string value of the `leafPrivateKey` constant with the unencrypted private key for your device certificate, *unencrypted-device-key.pem*.

        The syntax of the private key text must match the following pattern with no extra spaces or characters.

        ```java
        private static final String leafPrivateKey = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n" +
        "MIIJJwIBAAKCAgEAtjvKQjIhp0EE1PoADL1rfF/W6v4vlAzOSifKSQsaPeebqg8U\n" +
            ...
        "X7fi9OZ26QpnkS5QjjPTYI/wwn0J9YAwNfKSlNeXTJDfJ+KpjXBcvaLxeBQbQhij\n" +
        "-----END PRIVATE KEY-----";
        ```

        To generate the proper syntax, you can copy and paste the following command into your **Git Bash prompt**, and press **ENTER**. This command generates the syntax for the `leafPrivateKey` string constant value and writes it to the output.

        ```Bash
        sed 's/^/"/;$ !s/$/\\n" +/;$ s/$/"/' ./private/device-01.key.pem
        ```

        Copy and paste the output private key text for the constant value.

    1. Add a `rootPublicPem` constant string with the value of your root CA certificate, *azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem*. You can add it just after the `leafPrivateKey` constant.

        The syntax of certificate text must match the following pattern with no extra spaces or characters.

        ```java
        private static final String rootPublicPem = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n"
        "MIIFOjCCAyKgAwIBAgIJAPzMa6s7mj7+MA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMCoxKDAmBgNV\n"
            ...
        "MDMwWhcNMjAxMTIyMjEzMDMwWjAqMSgwJgYDVQQDDB9BenVyZSBJb1QgSHViIENB\n"
        "-----END CERTIFICATE-----";        
        ```

        To generate the proper syntax, you can copy and paste the following command into your **Git Bash prompt**, and press **ENTER**. This command  generates the syntax for the `rootPublicPem` string constant value and writes it to the output.

        ```Bash
        sed 's/^/"/;$ !s/$/\\n" +/;$ s/$/"/' ./certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem
        ```

        Copy and paste the output certificate text for the constant value.

    1. Add an `intermediatePublicPem` constant string with the value of your intermediate CA certificate, *azure-iot-test-only.intermediate.cert.pem*. You can add it just after the previous constant.

        The syntax of certificate text must match the following pattern with no extra spaces or characters.

        ```java
        private static final String intermediatePublicPem = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n"
        "MIIFOjCCAyKgAwIBAgIJAPzMa6s7mj7+MA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMCoxKDAmBgNV\n"
            ...
        "MDMwWhcNMjAxMTIyMjEzMDMwWjAqMSgwJgYDVQQDDB9BenVyZSBJb1QgSHViIENB\n"
        "-----END CERTIFICATE-----";        
        ```

        To generate the proper syntax, you can copy and paste the following command into your **Git Bash prompt**, and press **ENTER**. This command  generates the syntax for the `intermediatePublicPem` string constant value and writes it to the output.

        ```Bash
        sed 's/^/"/;$ !s/$/\\n" +/;$ s/$/"/' ./certs/azure-iot-test-only.intermediate.cert.pem
        ```

        Copy and paste the output certificate text for the constant value.

    1. Find the following lines in the `main` method.

        ```java
        // For group enrollment uncomment this line
        //signerCertificatePemList.add("<Your Signer/intermediate Certificate Here>");
        ```

        Add these two lines directly beneath them to add your intermediate and root CA certificates to the signing chain. Your signing chain should include the whole certificate chain up to and including a certificate that you've verified with DPS.

        ```java
        signerCertificatePemList.add(intermediatePublicPem);
        signerCertificatePemList.add(rootPublicPem);
        ```

        > [!NOTE]
        > The order that the signing certificates are added is important. The sample will fail if it's changed.

    1. Save your changes.

1. Build the sample, and then go to the `target` folder.

    ```cmd
    mvn clean install
    cd target
    ```

1. The build outputs .jar file in the `target` folder with the following file format: `provisioning-x509-sample-{version}-with-deps.jar`; for example: `provisioning-x509-sample-1.8.1-with-deps.jar`. Execute the .jar file. You may need to replace the version in the following command.

    ```cmd
    java -jar ./provisioning-x509-sample-1.8.1-with-deps.jar
    ```

    The sample connects to DPS, which provisions the device to an IoT hub. After the device is provisioned, the sample will send some test messages to the IoT hub.

## Confirm your device provisioning registration

Examine the registration records of the enrollment group to see the registration details for your devices:

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Device Provisioning Service instance.

1. In the **Settings** menu, select **Manage enrollments**.

1. Select **Enrollment groups**. The X.509 enrollment group entry that you created previously should appear in the list.

1. Select the enrollment entry. Then select **Details** next to the **Registration status** to see the devices that have been registered through the enrollment group. The IoT hub that each of your devices was assigned to, their device IDs, and the dates and times they were registered appear in the list.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-unprovision-devices/view-registration-records.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the registration status details for the enrollment group on Azure portal.":::

1. You can select one of the devices to see further details for that device.

To verify the devices on your IoT hub:

1. In Azure portal, go to the IoT hub that your device was assigned to.

1. In the **Device management** menu, select **Devices**.

## Clean up resources

When you're finished testing and exploring this device client sample, use the following steps to delete all resources created by this tutorial.

1. Close the device client sample output window on your machine.

### Delete your enrollment group

1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, select **All resources**.

1. Select your DPS instance.

1. In the **Settings** menu, select **Manage enrollments**.

1. Select the **Enrollment groups** tab.

1. Select the enrollment group you used for this tutorial.

1. On the **Enrollment details** page, select **Details** next to the **Registration status**. Then select the check box next to the **Device Id** column header to select all of the registration records for the enrollment group. Select **Delete** at the top of the page to delete the registration records.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Deleting an enrollment group doesn't delete the registration records associated with it. These orphaned records will count against the [registrations quota](about-iot-dps.md#quotas-and-limits) for the DPS instance. For this reason, it's a best practice to delete all registration records associated with an enrollment group before you delete the enrollment group itself.

1. Go back to the **Manage enrollments** page and make sure the **Enrollment groups** tab is selected.

1. Select the check box next to the group name of the enrollment group you used for this tutorial.

1. At the top of the page, select  **Delete**.

### Delete device registrations from IoT Hub

1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, select **All resources**.

2. Select your IoT hub.

3. In the **Device management** menu, select **Devices**.

4. Select the check box next to the device ID of the devices you registered in this tutorial. For example, *device-01* and *device-02*.

5. At the top of the page, select  **Delete**.
