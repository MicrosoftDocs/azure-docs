## Create an Azure Nexus Kubernetes cluster

The following example creates a cluster named *myNexusK8sCluster* in resource group *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

Before you run the commands, you need to set several variables to define the configuration for your cluster. Here are the variables you need to set, along with some default values you can use for certain variables:

| Variable                   | Description                                                                                                              |

| ADMIN_USERNAME             | The username for the cluster administrator.                                                                              |
| SSH_PUBLIC_KEY             | The SSH public key that is used for secure communication with the cluster.                                               |

Once you've defined these variables, you can run the Azure PowerShell command to create the cluster. Add the ```-Debug``` flag at the end to provide more detailed output for troubleshooting purposes.

To define these variables, use the following set commands and replace the example values with your preferred values. You can also use the default values for some of the variables, as shown in the following example:

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Azure parameters
$RESOURCE_GROUP="myResourceGroup"
$SUBSCRIPTION="<Azure subscription ID>"
$CUSTOM_LOCATION="/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<managed_resource_group>/providers/microsoft.extendedlocation/customlocations/<custom-location-name>"
$CUSTOM_LOCATION_TYPE="CustomLocation"
$LOCATION="<ClusterAzureRegion>"

# Network parameters
$CSN_ARM_ID="/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group>/providers/Microsoft.NetworkCloud/cloudServicesNetworks/<csn-name>"
$CNI_ARM_ID="/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group>/providers/Microsoft.NetworkCloud/l3Networks/<l3Network-name>"
$POD_CIDR="10.244.0.0/16"
$SERVICE_CIDR="10.96.0.0/16"
$DNS_SERVICE_IP="10.96.0.10"

# AgentPoolConfiguration parameters
$INITIAL_AGENT_POOL_COUNT="1"
$MODE="System"
$INITIAL_AGENT_POOL_NAME="agentpool1"
$INITIAL_AGENT_POOL_VM_SIZE="NC_P10_56_v1"

# NAKS Cluster Parameters
$CLUSTER_NAME="myNexusK8sCluster"
$SSH_PUBLIC_KEY = @{
    KeyData = "$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)"
}
$K8S_VERSION="1.24.9"
$AAD_ADMIN_GROUP_OBJECT_ID="3d4c8620-ac8c-4bd6-9a92-f2b75923ef9f"
$ADMIN_USERNAME="azureuser"
$CONTROL_PLANE_COUNT="1"
$CONTROL_PLANE_VM_SIZE="NC_G6_28_v1"

$AGENT_POOL_CONFIGURATION = New-AzNetworkCloudInitialAgentPoolConfigurationObject `
-Count $INITIAL_AGENT_POOL_COUNT `
-Mode $MODE `
-Name $INITIAL_AGENT_POOL_NAME `
-VmSkuName $INITIAL_AGENT_POOL_VM_SIZE
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is essential that you replace the placeholders for CUSTOM_LOCATION, CSN_ARM_ID, CNI_ARM_ID, and AAD_ADMIN_GROUP_OBJECT_ID with your actual values before running these commands.

After defining these variables, you can create the Kubernetes cluster by executing the following Azure PowerShell command:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzNetworkCloudKubernetesCluster -KubernetesClusterName $CLUSTER_NAME `
-ResourceGroupName $RESOURCE_GROUP `
-SubscriptionId $SUBSCRIPTION `
-Location $LOCATION `
-ExtendedLocationName $CUSTOM_LOCATION `
-ExtendedLocationType $CUSTOM_LOCATION_TYPE ` 
-KubernetesVersion $K8S_VERSION `
-AadConfigurationAdminGroupObjectId $AAD_ADMIN_GROUP_OBJECT_ID `
-AdminUsername $ADMIN_USERNAME `
-SshPublicKey $SSH_PUBLIC_KEY `
-ControlPlaneNodeConfigurationCount $CONTROL_PLANE_COUNT `
-ControlPlaneNodeConfigurationVMSkuName $CONTROL_PLANE_VM_SIZE `
-InitialAgentPoolConfiguration $AGENT_POOL_CONFIGURATION `
-NetworkConfigurationCloudServicesNetworkId $CSN_ARM_ID `
-NetworkConfigurationCniNetworkId $CNI_ARM_ID `
-NetworkConfigurationPodCidr $POD_CIDR `
-NetworkConfigurationDnsServiceIP $SERVICE_CIDR `
-NetworkConfigurationServiceCidr $DNS_SERVICE_IP
```

If there isn't enough capacity to deploy requested cluster nodes, an error message appears. However, this message doesn't provide any details about the available capacity. It states that the cluster creation can't proceed due to insufficient capacity.

> [!NOTE]
> The capacity calculation takes into account the entire platform cluster, rather than being limited to individual racks. Therefore, if an agent pool is created in a zone (where a rack equals a zone) with insufficient capacity, but another zone has enough capacity, the cluster creation continues but will eventually time out. This approach to capacity checking only makes sense if a specific zone isn't specified during the creation of the cluster or agent pool.

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns information about the cluster. For more advanced options, see [Quickstart: Deploy an Azure Nexus Kubernetes cluster using Bicep](./quickstarts-kubernetes-cluster-deployment-bicep.md).

## Connect to the cluster

[!INCLUDE [quickstart-cluster-connect](./includes/kubernetes-cluster/quickstart-cluster-connect-powershell.md)]

## Add an agent pool

The cluster created in the previous step has a single node pool. Let's add a second agent pool using the ```New-AzNetworkCloudAgentPool``` create command. The following example creates an agent pool named ```myNexusK8sCluster-nodepool-2```:

You can also use the default values for some of the variables, as shown in the following example:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$RESOURCE_GROUP="myResourceGroup"
$SUBSCRIPTION="<Azure subscription ID>"
$CUSTOM_LOCATION="/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<managed_resource_group>/providers/microsoft.extendedlocation/customlocations/<custom-location-name>"
$CUSTOM_LOCATION_TYPE="CustomLocation"
$LOCATION="<ClusterAzureRegion>"
$CLUSTER_NAME="myNexusK8sCluster"
$AGENT_POOL_NAME="myNexusK8sCluster-nodepool-2"
$AGENT_POOL_VM_SIZE="NC_P10_56_v1"
$AGENT_POOL_COUNT="1"
$AGENT_POOL_MODE="User"
```

After defining these variables, you can add an agent pool by executing the following Azure PowerShell command:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzNetworkCloudAgentPool -KubernetesClusterName $CLUSTER_NAME `
-Name $AGENT_POOL_NAME `
-ResourceGroupName $RESOURCE_GROUP `
-SubscriptionId $SUBSCRIPTION `
-ExtendedLocationName $CUSTOM_LOCATION `
-ExtendedLocationType $CUSTOM_LOCATION_TYPE `
-Location $LOCATION `
-Count $AGENT_POOL_COUNT `
-Mode $AGENT_POOL_MODE `
-VMSkuName $AGENT_POOL_VM_SIZE
```

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns information about the agent pool. For more advanced options, see [Quickstart: Deploy an Azure Nexus Kubernetes cluster using Bicep](./quickstarts-kubernetes-cluster-deployment-bicep.md).
