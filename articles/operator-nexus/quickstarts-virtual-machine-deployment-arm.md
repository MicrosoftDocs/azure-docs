# Quickstart: Create an Azure Operator Nexus virtual machine by using Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template)

* Deploy an Azure Nexus virtual machine using an Azure Resource Manager template.

This quick-start guide is designed to help you get started with using Nexus virtual machines to host virtual network functions (VNFs). By following the steps outlined in this guide, you're able to quickly and easily create a customized Nexus virtual machine that meets your specific needs and requirements. Whether you're a beginner or an expert in Nexus networking, this guide is here to help. You learn everything you need to know to create and customize Nexus virtual machines for hosting virtual network functions.

## Before you begin

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machine-prereq](./includes/virtual-machine/quickstart-prereq.md)]
* Complete the [prerequisites](./quickstarts-tenant-workload-prerequisites.md) for deploying a Nexus virtual machine.

## Review the template

Before deploying the virtual machine template, let's review the content to understand its structure. 

:::code language="json" source="includes/virtual-machine/virtual-machine-arm-template.json":::

> [!WARNING]
> User data will not be encrypted, and any process on the VM can query this data. You should not store confidential information in user data. For more information, see [Azure data security and encryption best practices](/azure/security/fundamentals/data-encryption-best-practices).

Once you have reviewed and saved the template file named ```virtual-machine-arm-template.json```, proceed to the next section to deploy the template.

## Deploy the template

1. Create a file named ```virtual-machine-parameters.json``` and add the required parameters in JSON format. You can use the following example as a starting point. Replace the values with your own.

:::code language="json" source="includes/virtual-machine/virtual-machine-params.json":::

2. Deploy the template.

```azurecli
    az deployment group create --resource-group myResourceGroup --template-file virtual-machine-arm-template.json --parameters @virtual-machine-parameters.json
```

## Review deployed resources

[!INCLUDE [quickstart-review-deployment-cli](./includes/virtual-machine/quickstart-review-deployment-cli.md)]

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [quickstart-cleanup](./includes/virtual-machine/quickstart-cleanup-cli.md)]

## Next steps

You've successfully created a Nexus virtual machine. You can now use the virtual machine to host virtual network functions (VNFs).
