# Networking in Azure Operator Nexus Kubernetes

An Azure Operator Nexus, or simply Operator Nexus, instance comprises compute
and networking hardware installed at the customer premises. Multiple layers of
physical and virtual devices provide network connectivity and routing services
to the workloads running on this compute hardware. This document provides a
detailed description of each of these networking layers.

## Topology

Here we describe the topology of hardware in an Operator Nexus instance.

:::image type="content" source="media/concepts-networking/birdseye.jpg" lightbox="media/concepts-networking/birdseye.jpg" alt-text="Diagram of Networking - Birdseye view.":::

Customers own and manage Provider edge (PE) routers. These routers represent
the edge of the customer’s backbone network.

Operator Nexus manages the customer edge (CE) routers. These routers are part
of the Operator Nexus instance and are included in near-edge hardware
[bill of materials][bom] (BOM). There are two CE routers in each multi-rack
Operator Nexus instance. Each CE router has an uplink to each of the PE
routers. The CE routers are the only Operator Nexus devices that are physically
connected to the customer’s network.

Each rack of compute servers in a multi-rack Azure Operator Nexus instance has
two top-of-rack (TOR) switches. Each TOR has an uplink to each of the CE
routers.  Each TOR is connected to each bare metal compute server in the rack
and is configured as a simple [layer 2 switch][layer2-switch].

## Bare metal

Tenant workloads running on this compute infrastructure are typically virtual
or containerized network functions. Virtual network functions (VNFs) run as
virtual machines (VMs) on the compute server hardware. Containerized network
functions (CNFs) run inside containers. These containers run on VMs that
themselves run on the compute server hardware.

Network functions that provide end-user data plane services require high
performance network interfaces that offer advanced features and high I/O rates.

:::image type="content" source="media/concepts-networking/baremetal-networking.jpg" lightbox="media/concepts-networking/baremetal-networking.jpg" alt-text="Diagram of Networking - Bare metal.":::

In near-edge multi-rack Operator Nexus instances, each bare metal compute
server is a dual-socket machine with [Non-Uniform Memory Access][numa] (NUMA)
architecture.

A bare metal compute server in a near-edge multi-rack Azure Operator Nexus
instance contains one dual-port network interface card (pNIC) for each NUMA
cell. These pNICs support [Single-Root I/O Virtualization][sriov] (SR-IOV) and
other high-performance features. One NUMA cell is memory and CPU-aligned with a
one pNIC.

All network interfaces assigned to tenant workloads are host passthrough
devices and use SR-IOV virtual functions (VFs) allocated from the pNIC aligned
to the NUMA cell housing the workload VM’s CPU and memory resources.  This
arrangement ensures optimal performance of the networking stack inside the VMs
and containers that are assigned those VFs.

Compute racks are deployed with a pair of Top-of-Rack (TOR) switches. Each pNIC
on each bare metal compute server is connected to both of those TORs.
[Multi-chassis link aggregation group][mlag] (MLAG) provides high availability
and [link aggregation control protocol][lacp] (LACP) provides increased
aggregate throughput for the link.

Each bare metal compute server has a storage network interface that is provided
by a bond that aggregates two *host-local* virtual functions (VF)s (as opposed
to VM-local VFs) connected to *both* pNICs. These two VFs are aggregated in an
active-backup bond to ensure if one of the pNICs fails, network storage
connectivity remains available.

## Logical network resources

When interacting with the Operator Nexus Network Cloud API and Managed Network
Fabric APIs, users create and modify a set of logical resources.

Logical resources in the Managed Network Fabric API correspond to the networks
and access control configuration on the underlying networking hardware (the
TORs and CEs). Notably, `ManagedNetworkFabric.L2IsolationDomain` and
`ManagedNetworkFabric.L3IsolationDomain` resources contain low-level switch and
network configuration. A `ManagedNetworkFabric.L2IsolationDomain` represents a
[virtual local area network][vlan] identifier (VLAN). A
`ManagedNetworkFabric.L3IsolationDomain` represents a
[virtual routing and forwarding][vrf] configuration (VRF) on the CE routers.
Read about the [concept of an Isolation Domain][isd].

Logical resources in the Network Cloud API correspond to compute
infrastructure. There are resources for physical racks and bare metal hardware.
Likewise, there are resources for Kubernetes clusters and virtual machines that
run on that hardware and the logical networks that connect them.

`NetworkCloud.L2Network`, `NetworkCloud.L3Network`, and
`NetworkCloud.TrunkedNetwork` all represent workload networks, meaning traffic
on these networks is meant for tenant workloads.

A `NetworkCloud.L2Network` represents a layer-2 network and contains little
more than a link to a `ManagedNetworkFabric.L2IsolationDomain`. This
L2IsolationDomain contains a VLAN identifier and a maximum transmission unit
(MTU) setting. 

A `NetworkCloud.L3Network` represents a layer-3 network and contains a VLAN
identifier, information about IP address assignment for endpoints on the
network and a link to a `ManagedNetworkFabric.L3IsolationDomain`.

> [!NOTE]
> Why does a `NetworkCloud.L3Network` resource contain a VLAN identifier?
> Aren't VLANs a layer-2 concept?
> 
> Yes, yes they are! The reason for this is due
> to the fact that the `NetworkCloud.L3Network` must be able to refer to a
> specific [`ManagedNetworkFabric.InternalNetwork`][internal-net].
> `ManagedNetworkFabric.InternalNetwork`s are created within a specific
> `ManagedNetworkFabric.L3IsolationDomain` and are given a VLAN identifier.
> Therefore, in order to reference a specific
> `ManagedNetworkFabric.InternalNetwork`, the `NetworkCloud.L3Network` must
> contain both an L3IsolationDomain identifier and a VLAN identifier.

Logical *network resources* in the Network Cloud API such as
`NetworkCloud.L3Network` *reference* logical resources in the Managed Network
Fabric API and in doing so provide a logical connection between the physical
compute infrastructure and the physical network infrastructure.

When creating a Nexus Virtual Machine, you may specify zero or more L2, L3, and
Trunked Networks in the Nexus Virtual Machine's
[`NetworkAttachments`][vm-netattach]. When creating a Nexus Kubernetes Cluster,
you may specify zero or more L2, L3, and Trunked Networks in the Nexus
Kubernetes Cluster's
[`NetworkConfiguration.AttachedNetworkConfiguration`][attachednetconf] field.
AgentPools are collections of similar Kubernetes worker nodes within a Nexus
Kubernetes Cluster. You can configure each Agent Pool's attached L2, L3, and
Trunked Networks in the AgentPool's
[`AttachedNetworkConfiguration`][attachednetconf] field.

You can share networks across standalone Nexus Virtual Machines and Nexus
Kubernetes Clusters. This composability allows you to stitch together CNFs and
VNFs working in concert across the same logical networks.

:::image type="content" source="media/concepts-networking/network-compute-compose.jpg" lightbox="media/concepts-networking/network-compute-compose.jpg" alt-text="Diagram of Networking - Example complex network and compute relationships.":::

The diagram shows an example of a Nexus Kubernetes cluster with two agent pools
and a standalone Nexus Virtual Machine connected to different workload
networks. Agent Pool "AP1" has no extra network configuration and therefore it
inherits the KubernetesCluster's network information. Also note that all
Kubernetes Nodes and all standalone Nexus Virtual Machines are configured to
connect to the same Cloud Services Network. Finally, Agent Pool "AP2" and the
stand-alone VM are configured to connect to a "Shared L3 Network".

### The CloudServicesNetwork

Nexus Virtual Machines and Nexus Kubernetes Clusters always reference something
called the "Cloud Services Network" (CSN). The CSN is a special network used
for traffic between on-premises workloads and a set of external or Azure-hosted
endpoints.

Traffic on the CloudServicesNetwork is routed through a proxy, where egress
traffic is controlled via the use of an allowlist. Users can tune this
allowlist [using the Network Cloud API][csnapi].

TODO(jaypipes): Expand and explain this more. There's no good information about
CSN in our public docs.

### The CNI Network

When creating a Nexus Kubernetes Cluster, you provide the resource identifier
of a `NetworkCloud.L3Network` in the `NetworkConfiguration.CniNetworkId` field.

This "CNI network", sometimes referred to as "DefaultCNI Network", specifies
the layer-3 network that provides IP addresses for Kubernetes Nodes in the
Nexus Kubernetes cluster.

:::image type="content" source="media/concepts-networking/logical-resources.jpg" lightbox="media/concepts-networking/logical-resources.jpg" alt-text="Diagram of Networking - Logical resource view - CNI L3 Network.":::

The diagram shows the relationships between some of the Network Cloud, Managed
Network Fabric, and Kubernetes logical resources. In the diagram, a
`NetworkCloud.L3Network` is a logical resource in the Network Cloud API that
represents a layer 3 network. The `NetworkCloud.KubernetesCluster` resource has
a field `networkConfiguration.cniNetworkId` that contains a reference to the
`NetworkCloud.L3Network` resource.

The `NetworkCloud.L3Network` resource is associated with a single
`ManagedNetworkFabric.InternalNetwork` resource via its `l3IsolationDomainId`
and `vlanId` fields. The `ManagedNetworkFabric.L3IsolationDomain` resource
contains one or more `ManagedNetworkFabric.InternalNetwork` resources, keyed by
`vlanId`. When the user creates the `NetworkCloud.KubernetesCluster` resource,
one or more `NetworkCloud.AgentPool` resources are created.

Each of these `NetworkCloud.AgentPool` resources comprises one or more virtual
machines. A Kubernetes `Node` resource represents each of those virtual
machines. These Kubernetes `Node` resources must get an IP address and the
Container Networking Interface (CNI) plugins on the virtual machines grab an IP
address from the pool of IP addresses associated with the
`NetworkCloud.L3Network`. The `NetworkCloud.KubernetesCluster` resource
references the `NetworkCloud.L3Network` via its `cniNetworkId` field. The
routing and access rules for those node-level IP addresses are contained in the
`ManagedNetworkFabric.L3IsolationDomain`. The `NetworkCloud.L3Network` refers
to the `ManagedNetworkFabric.L3IsolationDomain` via its `l3IsoldationDomainId`
field.

## Operator Nexus Kubernetes networking

There are three logical layers of networking in Kubernetes:

* Node networking layer
* Pod networking layer
* Service networking layer

The *Node networking layer* provides connectivity between the Kubernetes
control plane and the kubelet worker node agent.

The *Pod networking layer* provides connectivity between containers (Pods)
running inside the Nexus Kubernetes cluster and connectivity between a Pod and
one or more tenant-defined networks.

The *Service networking layer* provides load balancing and ingress
functionality for sets of related Pods.

### Node networking 

Operator Nexus Kubernetes clusters house one or more containerized network
functions (CNFs) that run on a virtual machines (VM). A Kubernetes *Node*
represents a single VM. Kubernetes Nodes may be either *Control Plane* Nodes or
*Worker* Nodes. Control Plane Nodes contain management components for the
Kubernetes Cluster. Worker Nodes house tenant workloads.

Groups of Kubernetes Worker Nodes are called *Agent Pools*. Agent Pools are an
Operator Nexus construct, *not* a Kubernetes construct.

:::image type="content" source="media/concepts-networking/node-level.jpg" lightbox="media/concepts-networking/node-level.jpg" alt-text="Diagram of Networking - Node networking.":::

Each bare metal compute server in an Operator Nexus instance has a
[switchdev][switchdev] that is affined to a single NUMA cell on the bare metal
server. The switchdev houses a set of SR-IOV VF representor ports that provide
connectivity to a set of bridge devices that are used to house routing tables
for different networks.

In addition to the `defaultcni` interface, Operator Nexus establishes a
`cloudservices` network interface on every Node. The `cloudservices` network
interface is responsible for routing traffic destined for external (to the
customer's premises) endpoints. The `cloudservices` network interface
corresponds to the `NetworkCloud.CloudServicesNetwork` API resource that the
user defines before creating a Nexus Kubernetes cluster. The IP address
assigned to the `cloudservices` network interface is a
[link-local address][lladdr], ensuring that external network traffic always
traverses this specific interface.

In addition to the `defaultcni` and `cloudservices` network interfaces,
Operator Nexus creates one or more network interfaces on each Kubernetes Node
that correspond to `NetworkCloud.L2Network`, `NetworkCloud.L3Network`, and
`NetworkCloud.TrunkedNetwork` associations with the Nexus Kubernetes cluster
or AgentPool.

Only Agent Pool VMs have these extra network interfaces.  Control Plane VMs
only have the `defaultcni` and `cloudservices` network interfaces.

#### Node IP Address Management (IPAM)

:::image type="content" source="media/concepts-networking/node-level-ip-address-management.jpg" lightbox="media/concepts-networking/node-level-ip-address-management.jpg" alt-text="Diagram of Networking - Node networking - IP Address Management.":::

Nodes in an Agent Pool receive an IP address from a pool of IP addresses
associated with the `NetworkCloud.L3Network` resource referred to in the
`NetworkCloud.KubernetesCluster` resource's `networkConfiguration.cniNetworkId`
field. This `defaultcni` network is the default gateway for all Pods that run
on that Node and serves as the default network for east-west Pod to Pod
communication within the Nexus Kubernetes cluster.

[lladdr]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address

### Pod networking 

Kubernetes Pods are collections of one or more container images that run in a
[Linux namespace][linux-ns]. This Linux namespace isolates the container’s
processes and resources from other containers and processes on the host. For
Nexus Kubernetes clusters, this "host" is a VM that is represented as a
Kubernetes Worker Node.

Before creating an Operator Nexus Kubernetes Cluster, users first create a set
of resources that represent the virtual networks from which tenant workloads
are assigned addresses. These virtual networks are then referenced in the
`cniNetworkId`, `cloudServicesNetworkId`, `agentPoolL2Networks`,
`agentPoolL3Networks`, and `agentPoolTrunkedNetworks` fields when creating the
Operator Nexus Kubernetes Cluster.

Pods can run on any compute server in any rack in an Operator Nexus instance.
By default all Pods in a Nexus Kubernetes cluster can communicate with each
other over what is known as the [*pod network*][podnetwork]. Several
[Container Networking Interface][cni] (CNI) plugins that are installed in each
Nexus Kubernetes Worker Node manage the Pod networking.

#### Extra Networks

When creating a Pod in a Nexus Kubernetes Cluster, you declare any extra
networks that the Pod should attach to by [specifying][specify-net-anno] a
`k8s.v1.cni.cnf.io/networks` annotation. The annotation's value is a
comma-delimited list of network names. These network names correspond to names
of any Trunked, L3 or L2 Networks associated with the Nexus Kubernetes Cluster
or Agent Pool.

Operator Nexus configures the Agent Pool VM with
[NetworkAttachmentDefinition][nad] (NAD) files that contain network
configuration for a single extra network.

For each Trunked Network listed in the Pod's associated networks, the Pod gets
a single network interface. The workload is responsible for sending raw tagged
traffic through this interface or constructing tagged interfaces on top of the
network interface.

For each L2 Network listed in the Pod's associated networks, the Pod gets a
single network interface. The workload is responsible for their own static MAC
addressing.

#### Pod IP Address Management

:::image type="content" source="media/concepts-networking/pod-level-ip-address-management.jpg" lightbox="media/concepts-networking/pod-level-ip-address-management.jpg" alt-text="Diagram of Networking - Pod networking - IP Address Management.":::

When you create a Nexus Kubernetes cluster, you specify the IP address ranges
for the pod network in the `podCidrs` field. When Pods launch, the CNI plugin
establishes an `eth0@ifXX` interface in the Pod and assigns an IP address from
a range of IP addresses in that `podCidrs` field.

For L3 Networks, if the network has been configured to use Nexus IPAM, the
Pod's network interface associated with the L3 Network receives an IP address
from the IP address range (CIDR) configured for that network. If the L3 Network
isn't configured to use Nexus IPAM, the workload is responsible for statically
assigning an IP address to the Pod's network interface.

#### Routing

Inside each Pod, the `eth0` interface's traffic traverses a
[virtual ethernet device][veth] (veth) that connects to a
[switchdev][switchdev] on the host (the VM) that houses the `defaultcni`,
`cloudservices`, and other Node-level interfaces.

The `eth0` interface inside a Pod has a simple route table that effectively
uses the worker node VM's route table for any of the following traffic.

:::image type="content" source="media/concepts-networking/pod-eth0-routing.jpg" lightbox="media/concepts-networking/pod-eth0-routing.jpg" alt-text="Diagram of Networking - Pod routing.":::

* Pod to pod traffic: Traffic destined for an IP in the `podCidrs` address
  ranges flows to the switchdev on the host VM and over the Node-level
  `defaultcni` interface where it is routed to the appropriate destination agent
  pool VM's IP address.
* L3 OSDevice network traffic: Traffic destined for an IP in an associated L3
  Network with the `OSDevice` plugin type flows to the switchdev on the host VM
  and over the Node-level interface associated with that L3 Network.
* All other traffic passes to the default gateway in the Pod, which routes to the
  Node-level `cloudservices` interface. Egress rules configured on the
  CloudServicesNetwork associated with the Nexus Kubernetes cluster then
  determine how the traffic should be routed.

:::image type="content" source="media/concepts-networking/pod-ethX-routing.jpg" lightbox="media/concepts-networking/pod-ethX-routing.jpg" alt-text="Diagram of Networking - Pod routing - additional interfaces.":::

Additional network interfaces inside a Pod will use the Pod's route table to
route traffic to additional L3 Networks that use the `SRIOV` and `DPDK` plugin
types.

## Default Routing and BGP Configuration

CNFs are typically a collection of Kubernetes Pods that are connected to one or
more virtual networks. Those virtual networks are routed across the physical
network infrastructure via [Border Gateway Protocol][bgp] (BGP).
