# Provide access to Azure Operator Nexus Resources with an Azure role-based access control

Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) is an authorization system built
on [Azure Resource Manager](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md) that
provides fine-grained access management of Azure resources.

The Azure RBAC model allows users to set permissions on different scope levels: management
group, subscription, resource group, or individual resources.  Azure RBAC for key
vault also allows users to have separate permissions on individual keys, secrets,
and certificates.

For more information, see [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/overview.md).

## Operator Nexus built-in roles

Azure Operator Nexus provides the following built-in roles.

[Operator Nexus Compute Contributor Role (Preview)](#operator-nexus-compute-contributor-role-preview)

[Operator Nexus Keyset Administrator Role (Preview)](#operator-nexus-keyset-administrator-role-preview)

[Operator Nexus Owner Role (Preview)](#operator-nexus-owner-role-preview)

> [!NOTE]
> Preview roles are subject to change.
