# Troubleshoot bare metal machine issues using the `az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract` command

There might be situations where a user needs to investigate and resolve issues with an on-premises bare metal machine. Azure Operator Nexus provides a prescribed set of data extract commands via `az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract`. These commands enable users to get diagnostic data from a bare metal machine.

The command produces an output file containing the results of the data extract. By default, the data is sent to the Cluster Manager storage account. There's also a preview method where users can configure the Cluster resource with a storage account and identity that has access to the storage account to receive the output.

## Prerequisites

- This article assumes that the Azure command line interface and the `networkcloud` command line interface extension are installed. For more information, see [How to Install CLI Extensions](./howto-install-cli-extensions.md).
- The target bare metal machine is on and ready.
- The syntax for these commands is based on the 0.3.0+ version of the `az networkcloud` CLI.
- Get the Cluster Managed Resource group name (cluster_MRG) that you created for Cluster resource.

## Send command output to a user specified storage account

See [Azure Operator Nexus Cluster support for managed identities and user provided resources](./howto-cluster-managed-identity-user-provided-resources.md)

To access the output, users need the appropriate access to the storage blob. For information on assigning roles to storage accounts, see [Assign an Azure role for access to blob data](/azure/storage/blobs/assign-azure-role-data-access?tabs=portal).

### Clear the cluster's CommandOutputSettings

To change the cluster from a user-assigned identity to a system-assigned identity, the CommandOutputSettings must first be cleared using the command in the next section, then set using this command.

The CommandOutputSettings can be cleared, directing run-data-extract output back to the cluster manager's storage. However, it isn't recommended since it's less secure, and the option will be removed in a future release.

However, the CommandOutputSettings do need to be cleared if switching from a user-assigned identity to a system-assigned identity.

Use this command to clear the CommandOutputSettings:

```azurecli-interactive
az rest --method patch \
  --url  "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription>/resourceGroups/<cluster-resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.NetworkCloud/clusters/<cluster-name>?api-version=2024-08-01-preview" \
  --body '{"properties": {"commandOutputSettings":null}}'
```

## DEPRECATED METHOD: Verify access to the Cluster Manager storage account

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Cluster Manager storage account is targeted for removal in April 2025 at the latest. If you're using this method today for command output, consider converting to using a user provided storage account.

If using the Cluster Manager storage method, verify you have access to the Cluster Manager's storage account:

1. From Azure portal, navigate to Cluster Manager's Storage account.
1. In the Storage account details, select **Storage browser** from the navigation menu on the left side.
1. In the Storage browser details, select on **Blob containers**.
1. If you encounter a `403 This request is not authorized to perform this operation.` while accessing the storage account, storage account’s firewall settings need to be updated to include the public IP address.
1. Request access by creating a support ticket via Portal on the Cluster Manager resource. Provide the public IP address that requires access.

## Execute a run-data-extract command

The run data extract command executes one or more predefined scripts to extract data from a bare metal machine.

> [!WARNING]
> Microsoft doesn't provide or support any Operator Nexus API calls that expect plaintext username and/or password to be supplied. Note any values sent are logged and are considered exposed secrets, which should be rotated and revoked. The Microsoft documented method for securely using secrets is to store them in an Azure Key Vault. If you have specific questions or concerns, submit a request via the Azure portal.

The current list of supported commands are

- [SupportAssist/TSR collection for Dell troubleshooting](#hardware-support-data-collection)\
  Command Name: `hardware-support-data-collection`\
  Arguments: Type of logs requested

  - `SysInfo` - System Information
  - `TTYLog` - Storage TTYLog data
  - `Debug` - debug logs

- [Collect Microsoft Defender for Endpoints (MDE) agent information](#collect-mde-agent-information)\
  Command Name: `mde-agent-information`\
  Arguments: None

- [Collect MDE diagnostic support logs](#collect-mde-support-diagnostics)\
  Command Name: `mde-support-diagnostics`\
  Arguments: None

- [Collect Dell Hardware Rollup Status](#hardware-rollup-status)\
  Command Name: `hardware-rollup-status`\
  Arguments: None

- [Generate Cluster Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Report](#generate-cluster-cve-report)\
  Command Name: `cluster-cve-report`\
  Arguments: None

- [Collect Helm Releases](#collect-helm-releases)\
  Command Name: `collect-helm-releases`\
  Arguments: None
- [Collect `systemctl status` Output](#collect-systemctl-status-output)\
  Command Name: `platform-services-status`\
  Arguments: None

The command syntax is:

```azurecli-interactive
az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract --name "<machine-name>"  \
  --resource-group "<cluster_MRG>" \
  --subscription "<subscription>" \
  --commands '[{"arguments":["<arg1>","<arg2>"],"command":"<command1>"}]'  \
  --limit-time-seconds "<timeout>"
```

Specify multiple commands using json format in `--commands` option. Each `command` specifies command and arguments. For a command with multiple arguments, provide as a list to the `arguments` parameter. See [Azure CLI Shorthand](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/doc/shorthand_syntax.md) for instructions on constructing the `--commands` structure.

These commands can be long running so the recommendation is to set `--limit-time-seconds` to at least 600 seconds (10 minutes). The `Debug` option or running multiple extracts might take longer than 10 minutes.

In the response, the operation performs asynchronously and returns an HTTP status code of 202. See the [Viewing the Output](#viewing-the-output) section for details on how to track command completion and view the output file.

### Hardware Support Data Collection

This example executes the `hardware-support-data-collection` command and get `SysInfo` and `TTYLog` logs from the Dell Server. The script executes a `racadm supportassist collect` command on the designated bare metal machine. The resulting tar.gz file contains the zipped extract command file outputs in `hardware-support-data-<timestamp>.zip`.

```azurecli
az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract --name "bareMetalMachineName" \
  --resource-group "cluster_MRG" \
  --subscription "subscription" \
  --commands '[{"arguments":["SysInfo", "TTYLog"],"command":"hardware-support-data-collection"}]' \
  --limit-time-seconds 600
```

### Collect MDE Agent Information

Data is collected with the `mde-agent-information` command and formatted as JSON
to `/hostfs/tmp/runcommand/mde-agent-information.json`. The JSON file is found
in the data extract zip file located in the storage account. The script executes a
sequence of `mdatp` commands on the designated bare metal machine.

This example executes the `mde-agent-information` command without arguments.

```azurecli
az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract --name "bareMetalMachineName" \
  --resource-group "cluster_MRG" \
  --subscription "subscription" \
  --commands '[{"command":"mde-agent-information"}]' \
  --limit-time-seconds 600
```

**`mde-agent-information` Output**

  "threatInformation": {
      "list": $threat_info_list,
      "quarantineList": $threat_info_quarantine_list
    }
}
```

### Collect MDE Support Diagnostics

Data collected from the `mde-support-diagnostics` command uses the MDE Client Analyzer tool to bundle information from `mdatp` commands and relevant log files. The storage account `tgz` file contains a `zip` file named `mde-support-diagnostics-<hostname>.zip`. The `zip` should be sent along with any support requests to ensure the supporting teams can use the logs for troubleshooting and root cause analysis, if needed.

This example executes the `mde-support-diagnostics` command without arguments.

```azurecli
az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract --name "bareMetalMachineName" \
  --resource-group "cluster_MRG" \
  --subscription "subscription" \
  --commands '[{"command":"mde-support-diagnostics"}]' \
  --limit-time-seconds 600
```

### Generate Cluster CVE Report

Vulnerability data is collected with the `cluster-cve-report` command and formatted as JSON to `{year}-{month}-{day}-nexus-cluster-vulnerability-report.json`. The JSON file is found in the data extract zip file located in the storage account. The data collected includes vulnerability data per container image in the cluster.

This example executes the `cluster-cve-report` command without arguments.

> [!NOTE]
> The target machine must be a control-plane node or the action doesn't execute.

```azurecli
az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract --name "bareMetalMachineName" \
  --resource-group "cluster_MRG" \
  --subscription "subscription" \
  --commands '[{"command":"cluster-cve-report"}]' \
  --limit-time-seconds 600

**CVE Data Details**

The CVE data is refreshed per container image every 24 hours or when there's a change to the Kubernetes resource referencing the image.

### Collect Helm Releases

Helm release data is collected with the `collect-helm-releases` command and formatted as json to `{year}-{month}-{day}-helm-releases.json`. The JSON file is found in the data extract zip file located in the storage account. The data collected includes all helm release information from the Cluster, which consists of the standard data returned when running the command `helm list`.

This example executes the `collect-helm-releases` command without arguments.

> [!NOTE]
> The target machine must be a control-plane node or the action doesn't execute.

```azurecli
az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract --name "bareMetalMachineName" \
  --resource-group "cluster_MRG" \
  --subscription "subscription" \
  --commands '[{"command":"collect-helm-releases"}]' \
  --limit-time-seconds 600
```

### Collect Systemctl Status Output

Service status is collected with the `platform-services-status` command. The output is in plain text format and
returns an overview of the status of the services on the host and the `systemctl status` for each found service.

This example executes the `platform-services-status` command without arguments.

```azurecli
az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract --name "bareMetalMachineName" \
  --resource-group "clusete_MRG" \
  --subscription "subscription" \
  --commands '[{"command":"platform-services-status"}]' \
  --limit-time-seconds 600
  --output-directory "/path/to/local/directory"
