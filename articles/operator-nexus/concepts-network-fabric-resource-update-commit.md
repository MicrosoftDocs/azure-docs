# Update and commit Network Fabric resources

Currently, Nexus Network Fabric resources require that you disable a parent resource (such as an L3Isolation domain) and reput the parent or child resource with updated values and execute the administrative post action to enable and configure the devices. Network Fabric's new resource update flow allows you to  batch and update a set of Network Fabric resources via a `commitConfiguration` POST action when resources are enabled. There's no change if you choose the current workflow of disabling L3 Isolation domain, making changes and the enabling L3 Isolation domain. 

>[!Note]
>As part of our continued efforts to improve operational efficiency and reliability, we are announcing that new Fabric Commit v2 workflow will become the default commit workflow starting with Azure Operator 2507.1 release and commit v1 is depricated. Refer [Commit Workflow v2 in Azure Operator Nexus - Network Fabric](./concepts-commit-workflow-v2.md)

## Network Fabric resource update overview

Any Create, Update, Delete (CUD) operation on a child resource linked to an existing enabled parent resource or an update to an enabled parent resource property is considered an **Update** operation. A few examples would be a new Internal network, or a new subnet needs to be added to an existing enabled Layer 3 Isolation domain (Internal network is a child resource of Layer 3 isolation domain). A new route policy needs to be attached to existing internal network; both these scenarios qualify for an **Update** operation. 

Any update operation carried out on supported Network Fabric resources shown in the following table puts the fabric into a pending commit state (currently **Accepted** in Configuration state) where you must initiate a fabric commit-configuration action to apply the desired changes. All updates to Network Fabric resources (including child resources) in fabric follow the same workflow. 

Commit action/updates to resources shall only be valid and applicable when the fabric is in provisioned state and Network Fabric resources are in an **enabled administrative state. Updates to parent and child resources can be batched (across various Network Fabric resources) and a `commitConfiguration` action can be performed to execute all changes in a single POST action.  

Creation of parent resources and enablement via administrative action is independent of Update/Commit Action workflow. Additionally, all administrative actions to enable / disable are independent and shall not require commitConfiguration action trigger for execution. CommitConfiguration action is only applicable to a scenario when operator wants to update any existing Azure Resource Manager resources and fabric, parent resource is in enabled state. Any automation scripts or Bicep files that were used by the operators to create Network Fabric resource and enable require no changes. 

## User workflow

To successfully execute update resources, fabric must be in provisioned state. The following steps are involved in updating Network Fabric resources. 

1. Operator updates the required Network Fabric resources (multiple resources updates can be batched) which were already enabled (config applied to devices) using update call on Network Fabric resources via AzCli, Azure Resource Manager, Portal. (Refer to the supported scenarios, resources, and parameters' details  in the following table). 

    In the following example, a new `internalnetwork` is  added to an existing L3Isolation **l3domain101523-sm**. 

    ```azurecli
    az networkfabric internalnetwork create --subscription 5ffad143-8f31-4e1e-b171-fa1738b14748 --resource-group "Fab3Lab-4-1-PROD" --l3-isolation-domain-name "l3domain101523-sm" --resource-name "internalnetwork101523" --vlan-id 789 --mtu 1432 --connected-ipv4-subnets "[{prefix:'10.252.11.0/24'},{prefix:'10.252.12.0/24'}]
    ```

1. Once the Azure Resource Manager update call succeeds, the specific resource's `ConfigurationState` is set to **Accepted** and when it fails, it's set to **Rejected**. Fabric `ConfigurationState` is set to **Accepted** regardless of PATCH call success/failure. 

    If any Azure Resource Manager resource on the fabric (such as Internal Network or `RoutePolicy`) is in **Rejected** state, the Operator has to correct the configuration  and ensure the specific resource's ConfigurationState is set to Accepted before proceeding further. 

2. Operator executes the commitConfiguration POST action on Fabric resource. 

    ```azurecli
    az networkfabric fabric commit-configuration --subscription 5ffad143-8f31-4e1e-b171-fa1738b14748 --resource-group "FabLAB-4-1-PROD" --resource-name "nffab3-4-1-prod"
    ```

3. Service validates if all the resource updates succeeded and validates inputs. It also validates connected logical resources to ensure consistent behavior and configuration. Once all validations succeed, the new configuration is generated and pushed to the devices. 

1. Specific resource `configurationState` is reset to **Succeeded** and Fabric `configurationState` is set to **Provisioned**. 
1. If the `commitConfiguration` action fails, the service displays the appropriate error message and notifies the operator of the potential Network Fabric resource update failure.

## Behavior notes and constraints

- If a parent resource is in a **Disabled** administrative state and there are changes made to either to the parent or the child resources, the `commitConfiguration` action isn't applicable. Enabling the resource would push the configuration. The commit path for such resources is triggered only when the parent resource is in the **Enabled** administrative state. 

- If `commitConfiguration` fails, then the fabric remains in the **Accepted** in configuration state  until the user addresses the issues and performs a successful `commitConfiguration`. Currently, only roll-forward mechanisms are provided when failure occurs.

- If the Fabric configuration is in an **Accepted** state and has updates to Azure Resource Manager resources yet to be committed, then no administrative action is allowed on the resources. 

- If the Fabric configuration is in an **Accepted** state and has updates to Azure Resource Manager resources yet to be committed, then delete operation on supported resources can't be triggered. 

- Creation of parent resources is independent of `commitConfiguration` and the update flow. *Re-PUT* of resources isn't supported on any resource. 

- Network Fabric resource update is supported for both Greenfield deployments and Brownfield deployments but with some constraints. 

    - In the Greenfield deployment, the Fabric configuration state is **Accepted**  once there are any updates done Network Fabric resources. Once the `commitConfiguration` action is triggered, it moves to either **Provisioned** or **Accepted** state depending on success or failure of the action.  

    - In the Brownfield deployment, the `commitConfiguration` action is supported but the supported Network Fabric resources (such as Isolation domains, Internal Networks, RoutePolicy & ACLs) must be created using general availability version of the API (2023-06-15). This temporary restriction is relaxed following the migration of all resources to the latest version. 

    - In the Brownfield deployment, the Fabric configuration state remains in a **Provisioned** state when there are changes to any supported Network Fabric resources or commitConfiguration action is triggered. This behavior is temporary until all fabrics are migrated to the latest version. 

- Route policy and other related resources (IP community, IP Extended Community, IP PrefixList) updates are considered as a list replace operation. All the existing statements are removed and only the new updated statements are configured. 

- Updating or removing existing subnets, routes, BGP configurations, and other relevant network params in Internal network or external networks configuration might cause traffic disruption and should be performed at operators discretion. 

- Update of new Route policies and ACLs might cause traffic disruption depending on the rules applied.  

- Use a list command on the specific resource type (list all resources of an internal network type) to verify the resources that are updated and aren't committed to device. The resources that have an **Accepted** or **Rejected** configuration state can be filtered and identified as resources that are yet to be committed or where the commit to device fails. 

For example: 

```azurecli
az networkfabric internalnetwork list --resource-group "example-rg" --l3domain  "example-l3domain"
```
