# Azure Operator Nexus observability metrics

In Operator Nexus Network Fabric (NNF), Ethernet monitoring is a critical component in maintaining optimal network performance, ensuring availability, and proactively addressing potential issues before they cause disruptions in the fabric. Monitoring includes traffic analysis, device health, security, and details specific to individual Ethernet interfaces. By closely monitoring the fabric infrastructure, we can ensure that NNF operates smoothly and efficiently, and that any potential problems are identified and addressed early on.

The following aspects of NNF devices are monitored:

-   **Availability:** Monitoring the connectivity of devices ensures that the network is available and prevents downtime

-   **Performance**: Tracking metrics such as interface bandwidth utilization, packet loss, latency, and jitter, lets us evaluate network performance and pinpoint any bottlenecks

-   **Security**: Monitoring helps to identify any suspicious activity, unauthorized access attempts, or potential security threats on the network

-   **Health**: Monitoring device CPU, memory, temperature, fan, power supply status, and interface operational status, lets us identify any potential failures

## ACL state counters

State counters for Access Control Lists (ACLs) in a network device help you oversee and control network traffic. They offer data on the number of packets that matched to each ACL entry. These counters can be examined on a global scale, or per interface, and by incoming and outgoing traffic.


| Metrics Category | Description/Usage | Collection interval | Measure unit  |
|--|--|--|--|
| ACL (Access List) Matched Packets | The total count of network packets that match the criteria set by the current Access Control List (ACL) entry in a network device. This count helps in monitoring and managing network traffic. | 5 min               | Number of packets. |

## BGP status

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) connections are essential to effective communication between BGP peers, and optimal network performance. Network administrators can detect network problems or disruptions by observing these states. For example, a connection remaining in the 'Idle' state could suggest a configuration problem. The 'Established' state, which indicates a successful routing information exchange between BGP peers, is essential for the network to function correctly.

| Metrics Category | Description/Usage | Collection interval  | Measured unit |
|--|--|--|--|
| BGP Peer Status  | The BGP peer status, as defined by [RFC 4271](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4271), and summarized after this table. | 5 mins and on demand | N/A |

The BGP connection states are:

- **Idle (1):** The initial state of a BGP connection.
- **Connect (2):** The system is waiting for the TCP connection to be completed.
- **Active (3):** The system is trying to initiate a TCP connection with the peer.
- **OpenSent (4):** The system is waiting to receive an OPEN message from the peer.
- **OpenConfirm (5):** The system is waiting for a KEEPALIVE or NOTIFICATION message from the peer.
- **Established (6):** The BGP connection is fully established and the peers can exchange UPDATE messages.

## Component operational state

The operational state of a hardware or software component shows its current functioning state.

| Metrics Category | Description/Usage | Collection interval | Measured unit |
|--|--|--|--|
| Component Operation Status | Operational Status of the entities that can be part of the device's inventory, such as line cards, transceivers, fans, power supplies, etc. The possible values are described after this table. | 5 mins and on demand | N/A  |

The possible operational states are:

- **Active (0):** The component is enabled and active (up)
- **Inactive (1):** The component is enabled but inactive (down)
- **Disabled (2):** The component is administratively disabled

## Interface operational state

The operational state of an interface in a network device shows its current functioning state.

| Metrics Category | Description/Usage | Collection interval | Measured unit |
|--|--|--|--|
| Interface Operational State | The operational state of the interface. The possible values are described after this table. | 5 mins | N/A |

The possible operational states are:

- **Up (0):** The interface is operational and able to transmit and receive data
- **Down (1):** The interface isn't operational, and is unable to transmit or receive data
- **Lower_layer_down (2):** The interface is down due to a failure in a lower layer of the network stack
- **Testing (3):** The interface is undergoing testing and isn't yet operational
- **Unknown (4):** The status of the interface is unknown, possibly due to a failure in the device's monitoring system
- **Dormant (5):** The interface is operational but is currently in a dormant state, meaning it isn't transmitting or receiving data
- **Not_present (6):** The interface isn't present in the device, possibly because it has been physically removed or it hasn't been installed yet


## Interface state counters

Interface state counters track the number of frames or packets matching certain conditions. All of them are collected at 5-minute intervals.

| Interface Out Packets                     | The total number of packets transmitted out of the interface, including all unicast, multicast, broadcast, and bad packets. |
| Interface Out Unicasts Packets            | The total number of outgoing packets that weren't addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sublayer, including packets that were discarded or not sent. |

## Interface state rate

The interface state rate can have effects on network performance and dependability. A high frequency of state alterations could signal an unstable network connection, potentially resulting in diminished performance and network congestion.

All of the state rate measurements are collected at 5-minute intervals.

| Metrics Category            | Description/Usage |

| Interface In Packets Rate | The rate of packets received on the interface, including all unicasts, multicasts, broadcasts, and bad packets. |
| Interface Out Discards Rate | The rate of outbound packets that were discarded even though no errors were detected to prevent them being transmitted. |
| Interface Out Packets Rate | The rate of packets transmitted out of the interface, including all unicasts, multicasts, broadcasts, and bad packets. |


## LACP state rate

Monitoring the LACP state rate is vital due to its potential effects on network performance and dependability. The term "LACP state rate" in the context of Link Aggregation Control Protocol denotes the pace at which LACP control packets are transmitted or received by an interface that supports LACP.

All of the state rate measurements are collected at 5-minute intervals.

| Metrics Category    | Description/Usage |
|--|--|
| Lacp Errors         | The term "Number of LACPDU illegal packet errors" signifies the tally of Link Aggregation Control Protocol Data Units (LACPDUs) that, despite being received, are deemed unlawful due to their incorrectly formed structure or an unauthorized value of Protocol Subtype. |

| Lacp unknown Errors | Number of LACPDUs unknown errors. |

## LLDP state counters

LLDP state counters show how many LLDP frames have been sent and received by a network device. LLDP stands for Link Layer Discovery Protocol, which is a standard protocol that allows devices to advertise their identity, capabilities, and neighbors on a local area network. LLDP state counters can help network administrators monitor the health and performance of the network, troubleshoot connectivity issues, and discover the topology and configuration of the devices.

All of the measurements are collected at 5-minute intervals.

| Metrics Category | Description/Usage |
|--|--|
| Lldp Frame in        | LLDPFrameIn in a network device refers to the number of Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) frames that the device received. |
| Lldp Frame out       | LLDPFrameOut in a network device refers to the number of Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) frames that the device sent. LLDP is used by network devices to advertise their identity and capabilities to other devices on the same network. |
| Lldp TLV unknown     | LLDPTLVUnknown in a network device refers to the number of Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) frames received that contain unknown Type-Length-Value (TLV) entries. TLVs are used in network protocols to specify optional information. An "unknown" TLV suggests the device received data that it doesn't recognize or can't interpret, which could indicate compatibility issues within the network. |

## Terminal service monitoring

Monitors terminal server IP reachability (TS Net1 and TS Net3, IPv4) and HTTP file server availability via periodic (every 5 minutes) ICMP ping from Azure Fabric Monitoring Infrastructure. Metrics reflect real-time reachability status, including disconnected or unhealthy scenarios. For TsPing, any value apart from 1 indicates an unhealthy state (2: Destination Unreachable, 3: Time Exceeded provide specific reasons). For NnfFileServer, any value apart from 200 is unhealthy; -1 indicates the server is unreachable or there is an error on the monitoring service.

| **Metric**        | **Value**                                                                                                 | **Targeted ARM Resource** |
