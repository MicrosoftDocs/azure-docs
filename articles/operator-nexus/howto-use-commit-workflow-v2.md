# How to use Commit Workflow v2 in Azure Operator Nexus

The **Commit Workflow v2** ensures that device-impacting changes to a Network Fabric instance are explicitly acknowledged and committed before being applied to the underlying infrastructure. This structured workflow increases reliability and control over configuration changes.

## Prerequisites

* **Runtime version**: `5.0.1` or later is required for Commit Workflow v2.

* **Azure CLI version** `8.0.0b3` or later is installed

* Your **Network Fabric must be in `Provisioned` state** and **configuration state must be `Succeeded`**.

* The **fabric and all impacted resources must have admin state set to `Enabled`**.

* You must have **BYOS (Bring Your Own Storage)** configured on the fabric to use the optional validation step.

## Commit Workflow v2 overview

Any `patch` operation on parent resources or `Create`/`Update`/`Delete` (CUD) operation on connected child resources now requires an explicit commit step. Changes are **batched** until you lock, validate (optional), and commit them.

### Step 1: Update resources

Make patch or CUD operations via Azure CLI, Portal, or ARM template.
Once these changes are made, the fabric's configuration state will change to `Accepted (Pending Commit)`.

#### Example scenarios

* Create a new **Route Policy** and attach it to **Internal Network 1**

* Create another **Internal Network 2**

All these changes are **batched**, but **not applied** to devices yet.


### Step 2: Lock Configuration (Mandatory)

Lock the configuration to signal that all intended updates are completed. After this lock, **no further updates** can be made to any fabric-related resources until you unlock.

#### Azure CLI Command

```Azure CLI
az networkfabric fabric lock-fabric \
    --action Lock \
    --lock-type Configuration \
    --network-fabric-name "example-fabric" \
    --resource-group "example-rg"
```

- Successful execution transitions the fabric to a **locked state**.

- Check CLI output for success or failure status.


### Step 3: Validate updates (Optional but recommended)

Validate the configuration using the `view-device-configuration` post-action. This step provides insight into the expected configuration outcomes.

> [!Important] 
> BYOS must be configured on the Network Fabric.

#### Azure CLI Command

```Azure CLI

az networkfabric fabric view-device-configuration \
    --network-fabric-name "example-fabric"\
    --resource-group "example-rg"
```

- **Pre-Device Changes**: Current config for all devices (CE, TOR, Management Switches)

- **Post-Device Changes**: Preview of what will be applied after commit

#### Need to Make More Updates?

Unlock the configuration to make further changes, then repeat the lock/validate/commit steps.

#### Unlock Example

```Azure CLI
az networkfabric fabric lock-fabric \
    --action Unlock \
    --lock-type Configuration \
    --network-fabric-name "example-fabric" \
    --resource-group "example-rg"
```

### Step 4: Commit Configuration (Mandatory)

Commit the configuration to apply the batched changes to all relevant fabric devices.

#### Azure CLI Command

```Azure CLI
az networkfabric fabric commit-configuration \
  --resource-group "example-rg" \
  --resource-name "example-fabric"
```

- The operation returns a **status**: `Succeeded`, `InProgress`, or `Failed`

- Use CLI polling or Azure Activity Logs to monitor progress

> [!Important]
> - This workflow applies **only when the fabric is in Provisioned state** and **admin state is Enabled**. <br>
> - Locking is mandatory before commit; **commit cannot proceed without locking first**. <br>
> - **Rollback is not supported** â€“ any incorrect configuration must be updated and re-committed. <br>
> - Updates outside of this workflow (e.g., to tags or disconnected resources) do **not require commit**. <br>
