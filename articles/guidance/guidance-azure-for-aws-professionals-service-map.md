# Microsoft Azure for AWS professionals

As the leading public cloud platforms, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) each offer businesses a broad and deep set of capabilities with global coverage. Yet many organizations choose to use both platforms together for greater choice and flexibility, as well as to spread their risk and dependencies with a multi-cloud approach. Consulting companies and software vendors may also want to build on and use both Azure and AWS as this combination represents the majority of the cloud market demand.

To help decide which platform is right for your needs, we’ve created a reference chart below to show each IT capability along with its corresponding service or feature in both Azure and AWS. In some cases, you’ll see multiple services listed because these fall into the same category but the depth and breadth of the capabilities provided will vary.
