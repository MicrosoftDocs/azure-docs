# Tutorial: Manage the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery estate using Copilot (preview)

This article describes how to use Azure Business Continuity Center Copilot to make your business continuity journey seamless. 

## What is Azure Business Continuity Center Copilot? 

The Azure Business Continuity Center Copilot feature assists you to protect and recover your resources. The key use cases for the Azure Business Continuity Center Copilot are prioritized by the four Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) pillars:

- Protection management 
- Ransomware protection 
- Monitoring and reporting 
- Learn and get help on capabilities

With Azure Business Continuity Center Copilot (preview), you can check for the protection status of your Azure resources in the Azure portal using natural language directly. The Copilot retrieves information about your resources and their protection status and guides you through the relevant processes.

## Sample prompts 

The following table lists the supported prompts:

| Category | Prompts |
| --- | --- |
| **Security** | - How many vaults are in poor security level? <br> - Show security level of all the vaults. <br> - How can I increase the security level of a vault?  |
| **Management** | - Show the BCDR real estate across all the subscriptions. <br> - Show the datasources that aren't protected in `XXX` regions. <br> - Show me a list of all datasources that are protected using Azure Site Recovery only. |
| **Monitoring** | - Which data sources don't have Recovery Points (RP) in the last seven days? <br> - How many backup jobs failed in the last 12 hours? <br> - Retrigger backup for all failed backup jobs in the last 24 hours. |

## View the BCDR real estate across all the subscriptions

Ask Copilot for Azure Business Continuity Center (preview) to get information on your resource protection with prompts such as **Show the BCDR real estate across all the subscriptions.**

Copilot provides a summary of resources based on the protection status and generates an Azure Resource Graph (ARG) query that you can run directly to fetch granular information. Additionally, you can export the data as a CSV file from the ARG Query Explorer page.

## Enhance protection for the resources

Copilot also helps you to improve resilience by enhancing the protection of existing resources. With this feature, you can enable protection using multiple available solutions.

>[!Note]
> This feature is available for Azure VMs only.

To enhance protection of your resources, follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Copilot**, and then use the prompt **Show the running Virtual Machines**.

2. On **Select resources**, choose your virtual machine, and then click **Select**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-manage-data-using-copilot/enhance-protection-select-item.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to enhance protection using the Copilot." lightbox="./media/tutorial-manage-data-using-copilot/enhance-protection-select-item.png":::

3. On the selected *VM* blade, Copilot shows the current solution with which the VM is protected. Select **Enhance Protection** to proceed with protection enhancement. 

    Copilot redirects to the blade from where you can configure protection with other solutions.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-manage-data-using-copilot/enhance-protection-select-solution.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the current protection details." lightbox="./media/tutorial-manage-data-using-copilot/enhance-protection-select-solution.png":::

   The specific solution blade appears where you can configure backup or disaster recovery.

### View the security level

You can ask Copilot for a summary of your security posture and get guidance to enhance the security. 

To view the security level of resources on **Copilot**, use the prompt **Show security level for all datasources.** Copilot provides a summary of the number of datasources based on their security levels.

You can also run an ARG query to fetch more details or download the data as a CSV file.

### Increase the security configuration

You can also ask Copilot to help enhance your security posture. 

To increase the security configuration, follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on **Copilot**, use the prompt **Increase security level for vault.** Copilot provides a series of steps to enable various security features.

2. On **Select resources**, choose a vault, either a **Recovery Services vault** or a **Backup vault**, and then click **Select**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-manage-data-using-copilot/change-security-level-select-vault.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to select a vault." lightbox="./media/tutorial-manage-data-using-copilot/change-security-level-select-vault.png":::

3. Review the current security level, and then use Copilot to choose the required target level.

4. Choose the way you want to proceed, through the Azure portal or CLI tools.

   If you select **Command tools (PowerShell/CLI)**, Copilot provides the script for download from the Azure portal  to modify the security levels.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-manage-data-using-copilot/change-security-level-select-tool.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the tools available to change security level." lightbox="./media/tutorial-manage-data-using-copilot/change-security-level-select-tool.png":::

   Copilot lists through each security feature and tries to update it so that the desired security level is reached. Select the required options to increase the security levels.

   Some security features, such as **Multi-user authorization**, require more manual intervention. Copilot provides the process to modify the security settings.

## Trigger backup for resources

Copilot can help you get a list of datasources that don’t have any Recovery Point in a specified duration. This helps to monitor any backup failures and maintain service level agreement (SLA) for recovery.

To trigger an on-demand backup for resources, follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on **Copilot**, trigger a query to check for resources that don't have Recovery Point by using the prompt **How many datasources don’t have Recovery Point in the last 7 days.** 

   Copilot shows a list of such resources and the ARG query to fetch more details.

     :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-manage-data-using-copilot/view-recovery-point.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the items with no recovery points." lightbox="./media/tutorial-manage-data-using-copilot/view-recovery-point.png":::

2. Azure Business Continuity Center Copilot (preview) also provides a PowerShell script for download from the Azure portal to trigger backups on all such resources.

   To trigger an on-demand backup, select **Yes** on the further prompt.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-manage-data-using-copilot/trigger-backup-for-recovery-point.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Copilot prompts to trigger backup." lightbox="./media/tutorial-manage-data-using-copilot/trigger-backup-for-recovery-point.png":::

   The following screenshots show, the scripts to fetch the list of failed backup jobs and to trigger backups for them.

     :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-manage-data-using-copilot/trigger-backup-script-for-failed-jobs.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the script to trigger backup on failed jobs." lightbox="./media/tutorial-manage-data-using-copilot/trigger-backup-script-for-failed-jobs.png":::

   You can also fetch a list of failed backup jobs in a given time period.
