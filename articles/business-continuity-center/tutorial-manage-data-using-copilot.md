# Tutorial: Manage the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery estate using Copilot

This article describes how to use Azure Business Continuity Center Copilot to make your business continuity journey seamless. 

## What is Azure Business Continuity Center Copilot? 

The Azure Business Continuity Center Copilot feature assists you to protect and recover your resources. The key use cases for the Azure Business Continuity Center Copilot are prioritized by the four Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) pillars:

- Protection management 
- Ransomware protection 
- Monitoring and reporting 
- Learn and get help on capabilities

With Azure Business Continuity Center Copilot, you can check for the protection status of your Azure resources in the Azure portal using natural language directly. The Copilot retrieves information about your resources and their protection status and guides you through the relevant processes.

## Sample prompts 

The following table lists the supported prompts:

| Category | Prompts |
| --- | --- |
| **Security** | - How many vaults are in poor security level? <br> - Show security level of all the vaults. <br> - How can I increase the security level of a vault?  |
| **Management** | - Show the BCDR real estate across all the subscriptions. <br> - Show the datasources that aren't protected in `XXX` regions. <br> - Show me a list of all datasources that are protected using Azure Site Recovery only. |
| **Monitoring** | - Which data sources don't have Recovery Points (RP) in the last seven days? <br> - How many backup jobs failed in the last 12 hours? <br> - Retrigger backup for all failed backup jobs in the last 24 hours. |

## View the BCDR real estate across all the subscriptions

Ask Copilot for Azure Business Continuity Center to get information on your resource protection with prompts such as **Show the BCDR real estate across all the subscriptions.**

Copilot provides a summary of resources based on the protection status and generates an Azure Resource Graph (ARG) query that you can run directly to fetch granular information. Additionally, you can export the data as a CSV file from the ARG Query Explorer page.
