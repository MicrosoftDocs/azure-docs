# Support matrix for Azure Business Continuity Center

This article describes supportable scenarios and limitations.

You can use [Azure Business Continuity Center](business-continuity-center-overview.md), a cloud-native unified business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) management platform in Azure to manage your protection estate across solutions and environments. This feature helps enterprises to govern, monitor, operate, and analyze backups and replication at scale. This article summarizes the solutions and scenarios that Azure Business Continuity Center supports for each workload type.

## Supported regions

Azure Business Continuity Center supports all Azure regions.

## Supported solutions and datasources

The following table lists all supported scenarios:

| Solution | Resource/datasource type |
| --- | --- |
| [Azure Backup](/azure/backup/) | - Azure VM backup <br> - SQL in Azure VM backup <br> - SAP HANA on Azure VM backup <br> - Azure Files backup <br> - Azure Blobs backup <br> - Azure Managed Disks backup <br> - Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server backup <br> - Azure Kubernetes services |
| [Azure Site Recovery](/azure/site-recovery/) | - Azure to Azure disaster recovery <br> - VMware and Physical to Azure disaster recovery |

## Supported scenarios

The following table lists all supported scenarios:

| Category | Scenario | Supported solution and workloads | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Monitoring | View all backup and site recovery jobs. | All Solutions and datasource types from [this section](#supported-solutions-and-datasources). | - Seven days’ worth of jobs available out of the box. <br><br> - Each filter/drop-down supports a maximum of 1000 items. Hence, if you want to filter the grid for a particular vault, there might be scenarios where you might not see the desired vault if you have more than 1,000 vaults. In these cases, choosing the **All** option in filter helps you aggregate data across your entire set of subscriptions and vaults that you have access to. |
| Monitoring | View Azure Monitor alerts at scale | **Azure Backup**: <br><br> - Azure Virtual Machine <br> - Azure Database for PostgreSQL server <br> - SQL in Azure VM <br> - SAP HANA in Azure VM <br> - Azure Files <br> - Azure Blobs <br> - Azure Disks <br><br> **Azure Site Recovery**: <br><br> - Azure to Azure disaster recovery <br> - VMware and Physical to Azure disaster recovery | See [Alerts documentation](tutorial-monitor-alerts-metrics.md#monitor-alerts). |

| Reporting | View historical data of your Backup and Site Recovery estate in Reports | **Azure Backup**: <br><br> - Azure Files <br> - Azure Virtual Machine <br> - SAP HANA in Azure VM <br> - SQL in Azure VM <br> - Azure Disk <br> - Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server <br> - Azure Blob <br> - Azure Backup Agent <br> - Azure Backup Server <br> - Data Protection Manager (DPM) <br><br> **Azure Site Recovery**: <br><br> - Azure to Azure disaster recovery <br> - VMware and Physical to Azure disaster recovery | [Shows data based on the LA workspace retention](tutorial-reporting-for-data-insights.md#view-reports-in-azure-business-continuity-center). |
