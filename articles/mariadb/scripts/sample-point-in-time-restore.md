# Restore an Azure Database for MariaDB server using Azure CLI
This sample CLI script restores a single Azure Database for MariaDB server to a previous point in time.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This article requires version 2.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed. 

## Sample script
In this sample script, edit the highlighted lines to update the admin username and password to your own. Replace the subscription ID used in the `az monitor` commands with your own subscription ID.
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/mariadb/backup-restore-pitr/backup-restore.sh?highlight=15-16 "Restore Azure Database for MariaDB.")]

## Clean up deployment
Use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it after the script has been run. 
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/mariadb/backup-restore-pitr/delete-mariadb.sh  "Delete the resource group.")]

## Script explanation
This script uses the commands outlined in the following table:

| **Command** | **Notes** |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az_group_create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az mariadb server create](/cli/azure/mariadb/server#az_mariadb_server_create) | Creates a MariaDB server that hosts the databases. |
| [az mariadb server restore](/cli/azure/mariadb/server#az_mariadb_server_restore) | Restore a server from backup. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az_group_delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
