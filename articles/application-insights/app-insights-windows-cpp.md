# Analytics for C++ Windows Store apps

Microsoft provides two solutions for device devOps: [HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net/) for client devices; and [Application Insights](app-insights-overview.md) for the server side and client web pages.

[HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net/) is our Mobile DevOps solution for building iOS, OS X, Android or Windows device apps, as well as cross platform apps based on Xamarin, Cordova, and Unity. With it, you can distribute builds to beta testers, collect crash data, and get user feedback. It’s integrated with Visual Studio Team Services enabling easy build deployments and work item integration. 

Go to:

* [HockeyApp](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb)
* [HockeyApp Blog](http://hockeyapp.net/blog/)
* Join [Hockeyapp Preseason](http://hockeyapp.net/preseason/) to get early releases.

If your app has a server side, use [Application Insights](app-insights-overview.md) to monitor the web server side of your app on [ASP.NET](app-insights-asp-net.md) or [J2EE](app-insights-java-get-started.md). 

You can also use [Application Insights for Windows Desktop apps](app-insights-windows-desktop.md).

> [AZURE.NOTE] On June 15, 2016, we will stop showing data in Application Insights for iOS, Android, Windows Store, and Windows Phone apps.
