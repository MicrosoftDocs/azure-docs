# Analytics for Android apps

Microsoft provides two solutions for device devOps: [HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net/) for client side analytics; and [Application Insights](app-insights-overview.md) for the server side.

[HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net/) is our Mobile DevOps solution for iOS, OS X, Android or Windows device apps, as well as cross platform apps based on Xamarin, Cordova, and Unity. With it, you can distribute builds to beta testers, collect crash data, and get user feedback. It’s integrated with Visual Studio Team Services enabling easy build deployments and work item integration.

Go to:

* [HockeyApp](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb)
* [Get started with HockeyApp for Android](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/client-integration-android/hockeyapp-for-android-sdk).
* [HockeyApp Blog](http://hockeyapp.net/blog/)
* Join [Hockeyapp Preseason](http://hockeyapp.net/preseason/) to get early releases.

If your app has a server side, use [Application Insights](app-insights-overview.md) to monitor the web server side of your app on [ASP.NET](app-insights-asp-net.md) or [J2EE](app-insights-java-get-started.md). 

> [AZURE.NOTE] You will soon be able to use [Application Insights Analytics](app-insights-analytics.md) and [Continuous Export](app-insights-export-telemetry.md) with telemetry sent from the HockeyApp SDK.
