# Analytics for Android apps

Microsoft provides two solutions for device devOps: [HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net/) for devOps workflow and crash analysis; and [Application Insights](app-insights-overview.md) for usage and crash analytics.

[HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net/) is our Mobile DevOps solution for iOS, OS X, Android or Windows device apps, as well as cross platform apps based on Xamarin, Cordova, and Unity. With it, you can distribute builds to beta testers, collect crash data, and get user feedback. It’s integrated with Visual Studio Team Services enabling easy build deployments and work item integration. You can learn more from the [HockeyApp Knowledge Base](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb) and keep up to date on the [HockeyApp Blog](http://hockeyapp.net/blog/).

Use [Application Insights SDK for Android](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Android) for usage analytics. If your app has a server side, you can send the client and server data to the same Application Insights resource.
