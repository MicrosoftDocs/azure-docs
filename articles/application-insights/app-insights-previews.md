# Preview upcoming changes to Azure Application Insights 

Application Insights frequently releases new features. If you want to see previews of these improvements, you can sign up on the Application Insights Preview blade.  The development team makes previews of new features available on a limited basis before releasing them to all users. 

The following image illustrates how to set your preview preferences.
