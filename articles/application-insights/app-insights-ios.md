# Analytics for iOS apps

Microsoft provides two solutions for device devOps: [HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net/) for client devices; and [Application Insights](app-insights-overview.md) for the server side and client web pages.

[HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net/) is our Mobile DevOps solution for building iOS, OS X, Android or Windows device apps, as well as cross platform apps based on Xamarin, Cordova, and Unity. With it, you can distribute builds to beta testers, collect crash data, and get user feedback. It’s integrated with Visual Studio Team Services enabling easy build deployments and work item integration. 


Go to:

* [HockeyApp](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb)
* [HockeyApp for iOS](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/client-integration-ios-mac-os-x-tvos/hockeyapp-for-ios)
* [HockeyApp Blog](http://hockeyapp.net/blog/)
* Join [Hockeyapp Preseason](http://hockeyapp.net/preseason/) to get early releases.

If your app has a server side, use [Application Insights](app-insights-overview.md) to monitor the web server side of your app on [ASP.NET](app-insights-asp-net.md) or [J2EE](app-insights-java-get-started.md). 


## Analytics, export and API access to HockeyApp data 

[Set up a HockeyApp bridge](app-insights-hockeyapp-bridge-app.md) in Application Insights. This enables you to:

* Use the powerful [Analytics](app-insights-analytics.md) query language over your telemetry. 
* [Export telemetry](app-insights-export-telemetry.md) to Azure blob storage.
