# Analyzing Trends in Visual Studio

<!-- Hero screenshot -->

> [AZURE.NOTE] Application Insights Trends is available in Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 and later, or with the [Developer Analytics Tools extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/82367b81-3f97-4de1-bbf1-eaf52ddc635a) version 5.209 and later.

## Open Application Insights Trends
To open the Application Insights Trends window:
* From the Application Insights toolbar button, choose **Explore Telemetry Trends**, or
* From the Visual Studio menu bar, choose **View > Other Windows > Application Insights Trends**.

You may see a prompt to select a resource. Click **Select a resource**, sign in with an Azure subscription, then choose an Application Insights resource from the list for which you'd like to analyze telemetry trends.

## Choose a trend analysis

Get started by choosing from one of five common trend analyses:
* **Investigate performance issues with your server requests** - Requests made to your service in the last 24 hours, grouped by response times
* **Analyze errors in your server requests** - Requests made to your service in the last 24 hours, grouped by HTTP response code
* **Examine the exceptions in your application** - Exceptions from your service in the last 24 hours, grouped by exception type
* **Check the performance of your application's dependencies** - Services called by your service in the last 24 hours, grouped by response times
* **Inspect your custom events** - Custom events you've set up for your service that have been sent in the last 24 hours, grouped by event type.

These pre-built analyses are available later from the **View common types of telemetry analysis** button in the upper-left corner of the Trends window.
