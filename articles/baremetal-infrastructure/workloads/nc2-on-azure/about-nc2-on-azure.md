# About Nutanix Cloud Clusters on Azure

In this article, we'll give an overview of the features BareMetal Infrastructure offers for Nutanix workloads.

Nutanix Cloud Clusters (NC2) on Microsoft Azure provides a hybrid cloud solution that operates as a single cloud, allowing you to manage applications and infrastructure in your private cloud and Azure. With NC2 running on Azure, you can seamlessly move your applications between on-premises and Azure using a single management console. With NC2 on Azure, you can use your existing Azure accounts and networking setup (VPN, VNets, and Subnets), eliminating the need to manage any complex network overlays. With this hybrid offering, you use the same Nutanix software and licenses across your on-premises cluster and Azure to optimize your IT investment efficiently.

You use the NC2 console to create a cluster, update the cluster capacity (the number of nodes), and delete a Nutanix cluster. After you create a Nutanix cluster in Azure using NC2, you can operate the cluster in the same manner as you operate your on-premises Nutanix cluster with minor changes in the Nutanix command-line interface (nCLI), Prism Element and Prism Central web consoles, and APIs.

## Operating system and hypervisor

NC2 runs Nutanix Acropolis Operating System (AOS) and Nutanix Acropolis Hypervisor (AHV).

- AHV hypervisor is based upon open source Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM).
- AHV will determine the lowest processor generation in the cluster and constrain all Quick Emulator (QEMU) domains to that level.

This functionality allows mixing of processor generations within an AHV cluster and ensures the ability to live-migrate between hosts.

AOS abstracts kvm, virsh, qemu, libvirt, and iSCSI from the end-user and handles all backend configuration. Thus users can use Prism to manage everything they would want to manage, while not needing to be concerned with low-level management.

## SKUs

We offer two SKUs: AN36 and AN36P. The following table presents component options for each available SKU.

## Benefits of NC2 on Azure
Running Nutanix Cloud Clusters (NC2) on Azure offers several key benefits including
- **Consistent tools** : Use your existing skills and tools with the Nutanix platform. Additionally, with the same Nutanix OS and Hypervisor there's no need for any application refactoring. Finally, this provides for an easy migration of VMs and workload and seamless operations in a hybrid environment.
- **Dynamic provisioning**: Azure infrastructure eliminates the need to procure or manage hardware, allowing for dynamic scaling of workloads both to the cloud from on-premises and within the cloud2.
- **Enables critical business scenarios** such as: Easy cloud migration from on-premises to NC2 on Azure, disaster recovery site in Azure, and dynamic provisioning for on-demand scaling of resources and workloads.
- **Part of the Azure ecosystem**: Extend and integrate into the broader Azure ecosystem.
- **Cost efficiency and savings**: Benefit from cost efficiencies including: Reuse existing licenses for NC2 and Microsoft software via Azure Hybrid Benefit, Register for reserved instances for hardware cost savings, and get free Extended Security Updates for Windows Server by being in Azure.

## Other cost benefits

### Microsoft Azure Consumption Contract (MACC) credits 
NC2 on Azure infrastructure counts toward your organization's Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC) agreement.

### Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows and SQL Server
Azure Hybrid Benefit enables commercial customers to use their qualifying on-premises licenses on Azure. With Software Assurance or an active Linux subscription, you can take advantage of Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server, Windows Server, or Linux running in the NC2 on Azure environment. 

The primary benefit allows you to reuse you existing licensing investments to run in NC2 on Azure. There are other benefits, including allowing you to migrate over time while maintaining license compliance both on-premises and in Azure. 

Under the Azure Hybrid Benefit terms NC2 on Azure should be considered a Dedicated Host. For details on full benefits and considerations see the Azure Hybrid Benefit section under the Product terms
- [SQL Server Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering/SQLServer/EAEAS)

## Responsibility matrix

NC2 on Azure implements a shared responsibility model that defines distinct roles and responsibilities of the three parties involved in the offering: the Customer, Microsoft, and Nutanix.

On-premises Nutanix environments require the Nutanix customer to support all the hardware and software for running the platform. For NC2 on Azure, Microsoft maintains the hardware for the customer.

:::image type="content" source="media/nc2-on-azure-responsibility-matrix.png" alt-text="Diagram showing the support responsibilities for Microsoft and partners." border="false" lightbox="media/nc2-on-azure-responsibility-matrix.png":::

Microsoft manages the Azure BareMetal specialized compute hardware and its data and control plane platform for underlay network. Microsoft supports if the customers plan to bring their existing Azure Subscription, virtual network, vWAN, etc.

Nutanix covers the life-cycle management of Nutanix software (MCM, Prism Central/Element, etc.) and their licenses.

**Monitoring and remediation**

Microsoft continuously monitors the health of the underlay and BareMetal infrastructure. If Microsoft detects a failure, it takes action to repair the failed services.

## Support
Microsoft provides support for the BareMetal infrastructure of NC2 on Azure. You can submit aâ€¯support request. For Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) managed subscriptions, the first level of support provides the Solution Provider in the same fashion as CSP does for other Azure services.
