# Connect BareMetal Infrastructure instances in Azure

In this article, we'll show what you can do in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with your deployed BareMetal Infrastructure instances. 
 
## Register the resource provider
An Azure resource provider for BareMetal instances lets you see the instances in the Azure portal. By default, the Azure subscription you use for BareMetal instance deployments registers the *BareMetalInfrastructure* resource provider. If you don't see your deployed BareMetal instances, register the resource provider with your subscription. 

You can register the BareMetal instance resource provider via the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)
 
You'll need to list your subscription in the Azure portal and then double-click the subscription used to deploy your BareMetal instances.
 
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. On the Azure portal menu, select **All services**.

1. In the **All services** box, enter **subscription**, and then select **Subscriptions**.

1. Select the subscription from the subscription list.

1. Select **Resource providers** and enter **BareMetalInfrastructure** into search. The resource provider should be **Registered**, as the image shows.
 
>[!NOTE]
>If the resource provider isn't registered, select **Register**.
 
:::image type="content" source="media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/register-resource-provider-azure-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the BareMetal instances registered.":::

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To begin using Azure CLI:

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

Sign in to the Azure subscription you use for the BareMetal instance deployment through the Azure CLI. Register the `BareMetalInfrastructure` resource provider with the [az provider register](/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-register) command:

```azurecli
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.BareMetalInfrastructure
```

You can use the [az provider list](/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-list) command to see all available providers.

For more information about resource providers, see [Azure resource providers and types](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md).  

## BareMetal instances in the Azure portal
 
When you submit a BareMetal instance deployment request, specify the Azure subscription you're connecting to the BareMetal instances. Use the same subscription you use to deploy the application layer that works against the BareMetal instances.
 
During the deployment of your BareMetal instances, a new [Azure resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resources-portal.md) is created in the Azure subscription you used in the deployment request. This new resource group lists all BareMetal instances you've deployed in that subscription.

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. In the Azure portal, in the BareMetal subscription, select **Resource groups**.
 
   :::image type="content" source="media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/view-baremetal-instances-azure-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the list of Resource groups.":::

1. In the list, locate the new resource group.
 
   :::image type="content" source="media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/filter-resource-groups.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the BareMetal instance in a filtered Resource groups list." lightbox="media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/filter-resource-groups.png":::
   
   >[!TIP]
   >You can filter on the subscription you used to deploy the BareMetal instance. After you filter to the proper subscription, you might have a long list of resource groups. Look for one with a post-fix of **-Txxx** where xxx is three digits like **-T250**.

1. Select the new resource group to view its details. The image shows one BareMetal instance deployed.
   
   >[!NOTE]
   >If you deployed several BareMetal instance tenants under the same Azure subscription, you will see multiple Azure resource groups.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To see all your BareMetal instances, run the [az baremetalinstance list](/cli/azure/baremetalinstance#az-baremetalinstance-list) command for your resource group:

```azurecli
az baremetalinstance list --resource-group DSM05A-T550 â€“output table
```

> [!TIP]
> The `--output` parameter is a global parameter, available for all commands. The **table** value presents output in a friendly format. For more information, see [Output formats for Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/format-output-azure-cli).

## View the attributes of a single instance

You can view the details of a single instance.

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

In the list of BareMetal instances, select the single instance you want to view.
 
:::image type="content" source="media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/view-attributes-single-baremetal-instance.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the BareMetal instance attributes of a single instance." lightbox="media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/view-attributes-single-baremetal-instance.png":::
 
The attributes in the image don't look much different than the Azure virtual machine (VM) attributes. On the left, you'll see the Resource group, Azure region, and subscription name and ID. If you assigned tags, you'll see them here as well. By default, the BareMetal instances don't have tags assigned.
 
On the right, you'll see the name of the BareMetal instance, operating system (OS), IP address, and SKU that shows the number of CPU threads and memory. You'll also see the power state and hardware version (revision of the BareMetal instance stamp). The power state indicates whether the hardware unit is powered on or off. The operating system details, however, don't indicate whether it's up and running.
 
The possible hardware revisions are:

* Revision 3 (Rev 3)

* Revision 4 (Rev 4)
 
* Revision 4.2 (Rev 4.2)
 
>[!NOTE]
>Rev 4.2 is the latest rebranded BareMetal Infrastructure using the existing Rev 4 architecture. Rev 4 provides closer proximity to the Azure virtual machine (VM) hosts. It has significant improvements in network latency between Azure VMs and SAP HANA instances. You can access and manage your BareMetal instances through the Azure portal. For more information, see [BareMetal Infrastructure on Azure](concepts-baremetal-infrastructure-overview.md).

 
Also on the right side, you'll find the [Azure proximity placement group's](/azure/virtual-machines/co-location) name. The placement group's name is created automatically for each deployed BareMetal instance. Reference the proximity placement group when you deploy the Azure VMs that host the application layer. Use the proximity placement group associated with the BareMetal instance to ensure the Azure VMs are deployed close to the BareMetal instance.
 
>[!TIP]
>To locate the application layer in the same Azure datacenter as Revision 4.x, see [Azure proximity placement groups for optimal network latency](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-proximity-placement-scenarios).

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To see these details of a BareMetal instance, run the [az baremetalinstance show](/cli/azure/baremetalinstance#az-baremetalinstance-show) command:

```azurecli
az baremetalinstance show --resource-group DSM05A-T550 --instance-name orcllabdsm01
```

If you're uncertain of the instance name, run the `az baremetalinstance list` command, described above.

## Check activities of a single instance
 
You can check the activities of a single BareMetal instance. One of the main activities recorded are restarts of the instance. The data listed includes the activity's status, timestamp the activity triggered, subscription ID, and the Azure user who triggered the activity.
 
:::image type="content" source="media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/check-activities-single-baremetal-instance.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the BareMetal instance activities." lightbox="media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/check-activities-single-baremetal-instance.png":::
 
Changes to the instance's metadata in Azure also get recorded in the Activity log. Besides the restart, you can see the activity of **Write BareMetalInstances**. This activity makes no changes on the BareMetal instance itself but documents the changes to the unit's metadata in Azure.
 
Another activity that gets recorded is when you add or delete a [tag](../azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources.md) to an instance.
 
## Add and delete an Azure tag to an instance

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)
 
You can add Azure tags to a BareMetal instance or delete them. Tags get assigned just as they do when assigning tags to VMs. As with VMs, the tags exist in the Azure metadata. Tags have the same restrictions for BareMetal instances as for VMs.
 
Deleting tags also works the same way as for VMs. Both applying and deleting a tag is listed in the BareMetal instance's Activity log.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Assigning tags to BareMetal instances works the same as assigning tags for virtual machines. As with VMs, the tags exist in the Azure metadata. Tags have the same restrictions for BareMetal instances as for VMs.

To add tags to a BareMetal instance, run the [az baremetalinstance update](/cli/azure/baremetalinstance#az-baremetalinstance-update) command:

```azurecli
az baremetalinstance update --resource-group DSM05a-T550 --instance-name orcllabdsm01 --set tags.Dept=Finance tags.Status=Normal
```

Use the same command to remove a tag:

```azurecli
az baremetalinstance update --resource-group DSM05a-T550 --instance-name orcllabdsm01 --remove tags.Dept
```

---

## Check properties of an instance
 
When you acquire the instances, you can go to the Properties section to view the data collected about the instances. Data collected includes:
- Azure connectivity
- Storage backend
- ExpressRoute circuit ID
- Unique resource ID
- Subscription ID. 

You'll use this information in support requests or when setting up storage snapshot configuration.
 
Another critical piece of information you'll see is the storage NFS IP address. It isolates your storage to your **tenant** in the BareMetal instance stack. You'll use this IP address when you edit the [Configure Azure Application Consistent Snapshot tool](../azure-netapp-files/azacsnap-cmd-ref-configure.md).
 
:::image type="content" source="media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/baremetal-instance-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the BareMetal instance property settings." lightbox="media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/baremetal-instance-properties.png":::
 
## Restart a BareMetal instance through the Azure portal

There are various situations where the OS won't finish a restart, which requires a power restart of the BareMetal instance.

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

You can do a power restart of the instance directly from the Azure portal:
 
Select **Restart** and then **Yes** to confirm the restart.
 
:::image type="content" source="media/connect-baremetal-infrastructure/baremetal-instance-restart.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to restart the BareMetal instance.":::
 
When you restart a BareMetal instance, you'll experience a delay. During this delay, the power state moves from **Starting** to **Started**, which means the OS has started up completely. As a result, after a restart, you can only log into the unit once the state switches to **Started**.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To restart a BareMetal instance, use the [az baremetalinstance restart](/cli/azure/baremetalinstance#az-baremetalinstance-restart) command:

```azurecli
az baremetalinstance restart --resource-group DSM05a-T550 --instance-name orcllabdsm01
```

---

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Depending on the amount of memory in your BareMetal instance, a restart and a reboot of the hardware and operating system can take up to one hour.
 
## Open a support request for BareMetal instances
 
You can submit support requests specifically for BareMetal instances.
1. In Azure portal, under **Help + Support**, create a **[New support request](https://rc.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Support)** and provide the following information for the ticket:
