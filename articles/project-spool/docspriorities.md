## Short-Term Priorities

1. Define our highest-priority use-cases. **[We are here]**
2. Determine how to auto-generate SDK API Reference Docs [contact identified].
3. Determine how to auto-generate REST API Reference Docs [[instructions acquired](https://github.com/Azure/adx-documentation-pr/wiki)].
4. Build a minimum-viable quickstart for one of our use-cases, including supporting reference, conceptual, and architecture materials.  Possibly including the corresponding sample in our demo app.  Get a feel for how long it takes to build out a MVP use-case from end-to-end.
5. With this time-cost awareness, plan out our other use-cases and content plan with weekly goals along the Private Preview / Build / General Availability timeline.
6. Review and adjust on at least a weekly basis - ideally incorporating MVP or internal user feedback along the way.


## Docs Deliverables

1. A list of use-cases, ranked by priority.
2. A Table of Contents, where each item contains a customer intent statement and an overview of the tasks covered within the item.  This Table of Contents should include (with a focus on CLI if possible):
   1. Overview
   2. Quickstarts
   3. Tutorials
   4. Samples - [CLI example](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/samples-cli), RM, Azure PowerShell, Code Samples
   5. Concepts
   6. How-to guides
   7. Reference - PowerShell, PS Classic, .NET, REST... 
   8. Resources - REST, FAQ, Pricing Calculator, Quota, Regional Availability, Release Notes, StackOverflow, Troubleshooting
3. A Landing Page Stub
4. An initial article set.  The focus is on quality here; we'll leverage templates when possible.  This should include:
  1. A reference from the Overview
  2. A quickstart
  3. A tutorial
  4. A sample for one platform / language  
5. Other article sets **[TBD]**
