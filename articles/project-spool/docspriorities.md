## Docs Deliverables

1. A list of use-cases, ranked by priority. **[done]**
2. A Table of Contents, where each item contains a customer intent statement and an overview of the tasks covered within the item.  This Table of Contents should include (with a focus on CLI if possible):
   1. Overview
   2. Quickstarts
   3. Tutorials
   4. Samples - [CLI example](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/samples-cli), RM, Azure PowerShell, Code Samples
   5. Concepts
   6. How-to guides
   7. Reference - PowerShell, PS Classic, .NET, REST... 
   8. Resources - REST, FAQ, Pricing Calculator, Quota, Regional Availability, Release Notes, StackOverflow, Troubleshooting
3. A Landing Page Stub
4. An initial article set.  The focus is on quality here; we'll leverage templates when possible.  This should include:
  1. A reference from the Overview
  2. A quickstart
  3. A tutorial
  4. A sample for one platform / language  
5. Other article sets **[TBD]**


## Short-Term Priorities

1. Define our highest-priority use-cases. **[We are here]**
2. Determine how to auto-generate SDK API Reference Docs [Robert Outlaw gave me some pointers here].
   1. > Our SDK generation is base off shipped packages such as NuGet or npm modules.  It’s more or less as easy as you telling us what packages you have shipped, and we can generate docs for them.
3. Determine how to auto-generate REST API Reference Docs [[instructions acquired](https://github.com/Azure/adx-documentation-pr/wiki)].
4. Build a minimum-viable quickstart for one of our use-cases, including supporting reference, conceptual, and architecture materials.  Possibly including the corresponding sample in our demo app.  Get a feel for how long it takes to build out a MVP use-case from end-to-end.
5. With this time-cost awareness, plan out our other use-cases and content plan with weekly goals along the Private Preview / Build / General Availability timeline.
6. Review and adjust on at least a weekly basis - ideally incorporating MVP or internal user feedback along the way.




The focus will be on `Add voice and video to your app in 15 mins!`
