# About Azure Communication Services

Azure Communication Services (ACS) allows you to easily add real-time communications features to your applications.

When you use ACS, you're building on top of the same infrastructure that powers Microsoft Teams and the consumer Skype experiance. These Azure native services seamlessly auto-scale for global deployments of any size. You can use ACS for various forms of communication:

- Voice over the Internet (VOIP) 
- Voice over the publicly switched telephony network (PSTN)
- Video over the Internet (video calling)
- Chat over the Internet
- Chat through SMS

You can mix communication types intuitively, for example a single call may have end-users enjoying a browser application interacting with end-users on traditional telephony device. To support PSTN voice and SMS scenarios, ACS lets you acquire phone numbers quickly across a variety of geographies straight from the Azure portal or using ACS APIs and SDKs.

Communication between human users is a subset of ACS' capabilities. You can build services and applications to directly interact with the data plane of the voice, video, and chat experiance, for example connecting Azure Bots to support an interactive voice response system (IVR).
 
## Relationship to other Microsoft communication products
There are two other Microsoft communication products you may consider that are not directly interoperable with ACS at this time.

[Microsoft Graph Cloud Communication APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/cloud-communications-concept-overview) allow organizations to build communication experiances tied to Azure Active Directory users with M365 licenses. This is ideal for applications tied to AAD or where you want to extend productivity experiances in Microsoft Teams. There are also APIs to build applications and customization within the [Teams experience.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/?view=msteams-client-js-latest)

[Azure PlayFab Party](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/features/multiplayer/networking/) simplifies adding low-latency chat and data communication to games. While you can power gaming chat and networking systems with ACS, PlayFab is a tailored option and free on Xbox.
