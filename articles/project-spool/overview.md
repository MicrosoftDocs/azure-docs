# About Azure Communication Services

Azure Communication Services (ACS) allows you to easily add real-time communications features to your applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. It's a communications platform as a service (CPaaS) that allows you to focus on your customer experience while Azure handles the heavy lifting behind the scenes.

When you use ACS, you're building on top of the same infrastructure that powers Skype and Teams. This allows you to seamlessly scale and integrate your offerings with other Azure services like Cortana, Microsoft Graph, Cognitive Services, Bot Framework, and Machine Learning.

You'll use the ACS SDKs to connect your users to cross-platform sessions that facilitate real-time voice, video, and messaging.

There are three primary capabilities that ACS offers: Voice, Video, and Messaging. Each of these are highly configurable and offer a rich subset of features and integration possibilities.
