# About WebRTC

WebRTC is a free, open-source project that gives browsers and mobile applications real-time communications capabilities. To read more about this project, visit [WebRTC.org](https://webrtc.org/).

Many of Project Spool's components are built on top of WebRTC. Programmable Video and Programmable Voice utilize WebRTC protocols to connect your users' devices to one another over the internet.
