# SDK Options

TODO


### meta

-  Customer intent statements: 
   - I want to know what the Spool SDK story is. How many SDKs are there? When do I use each one?

- Discussion:
  - What SDKs are we offering?
  - Are Azure and IC3 developing their own SDKs that leverage one another? What's that relationship look like?
  - I've heard that we're offering a "quickstart" SDK and then another SDK that gives users the ability to fine-tune their configuration / integration. Can we elaborate on this by providing a clear list of SDK<>use-case pairs?
