# ACS Identity

ACS Identity is a the formatted identity that will be provided to the ACS customer from the ACS Identity Service.
ACS Identity 


# Identity model

Every addressable entitiy in ACS world, a user, bot, pstn number, short code, application ... is represented by special type :
* user - UserIdentity represents an object in ACS world that maps ACS Identity to a to an entity in your system
* pstn numbers - PhoneNumberIdentity represents an entity in ACS world that maps to a phone number.
* bot | server application - BotIdentity represents an entity in ACS world that maps to a particular bot or server application, identified by ACS Identity or bot APP ID

When your application interacts with other entities in the ACS system using ACS client SDKs you'll use corresponding Identity objects:
Identity types defines set of properties:
* type - user | bot | pstn | ...
* identity, depending on the type:
  * ACS Identity - a unique string, generated by ACS service for a given entity in your system
  * APP ID - representing id of a 1p or 3p bot provisioned through ACS
  * phone number
  * short code..

Identity interface:
```cs
public enum IdentityType
{
  User,
  Bot,
  Pstn,
  ...
}
interface IIdentity
    {
        IdentityType Type { get; }
        string AcsId { get; }
    }
 interface IUserIdentity: IIdentity {}
 interface IBotIdentity: IIdentity {}
 interface IPstnIdentity: IIdentity {}

```

## Create Identity instance
To create Identity object you have to create an instance of class for corresponding identity type:

```javascript
const { ChatClient, UserIdentity, BotIdentity, PstnIdentity } = require('@azure/communicationservices-chat');
const client = new ChatClient(endpoint, userAccessToken);

const userIdentity = new UserIdentity('acs_identity__for_bob'); 
const pstnIdentity = new PstnIdentity('pstn_number_e_164'); 
const botIdentity = new BotIdentity('acs_identity__for_bot'); 
```

## Use Identity with ACS Client SDK
To interact with other addressable entities in your system using ACS Client SDK you have to address them using Identity objects
```javascript
const { ChatClient } = require('@azure/communicationservices-chat');
const { CallClient } = require('@azure/communicationservices-calling');
const { SmsClient } = require('@azure/communicationservices-sms');
// create client for alice@contoso.com
const chatClient = new ChatClient(endpoint, userAccessToken);
const callingClient = new CallClient(endpoint, userAccessToken);
const smsClient = new SmsClient(endpoint, userAccessToken);

// create Identity objects
const bobUserIdentity = new UserIdentity('acs_identity_for_bob'); 
const bobPhoneIdentity = new PstnIdentity('bob_phone_number_e_164'); 

// send message from alice to bob
chatClient.send('message', {recipients: [bobUserIdentity]});

// send message from alice to bob
SmsClient.send('message', {recipients: [bobPhoneIdentity]});


// alice starts call with bob
callingClient.call([bobUserIdentity, bobPhoneIdentity]);
```

## ACS Identity resolution
ACS will not provide a way for customers to provide customer specific identities and will not store any type of data that would map an ACS Identity to a customer specific identity. Therefore, ACS will have no knowledge of how customer has assigned the ACS Identity.

You as a customer have to maintain map of ACS identities to entities in your system, in a way that is suitable to satisfy requirements of the system you're building, for example by storing this mapping in a (non)persistent database.
