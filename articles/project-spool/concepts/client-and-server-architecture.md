# Client and Server Architecture

Every Spool app has the following components:

1. **Clients**. These are your users' devices.
2. **Server(s)**. Your clients talk to your server to establish connectivity with other clients.
3. **Spaces**. Conversations between any number of clients are facilitated by "spaces". When one client wants to talk to another client, it does so through a Space. Spaces can have one or many connected clients.
