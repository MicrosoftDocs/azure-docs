Project Spool gives you a global Phone Numbers catalog that allows you to tailor your communications for specific locales.

TODO: explain provisioning, managing, metadata, deprovisioning, all other related concepts.

To get started with phone numbers, visit the Getting Started With Phone Numbers and Short Codes Quickstart.
