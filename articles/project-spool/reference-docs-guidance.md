## Intro

Reference docs come in two flavors:

- **Autogenerated docs**: These docs are generated using automation capabilities provided by Robert Outlaw's (routlaw) team. Java, Javascript, Typescript, .NET, Python, Azure REST, non-Azure REST, and PowerShell (all modules except Azure Powershell) are supported here. For **autogenerated docs**, it's generally advised that product teams leverage automation capabilities whenever possible. Teams traditionally engage directly with the Reference Docs Automation team. [This ticket](https://ceapex.visualstudio.com/Onboarding/_workitems/edit/266845) is being used to facilitate this engagement. Feel free to add comments to this ticket with any questions or concerns and a member of Robert's team will help onboard you.

- **Team-generated docs**: These docs are generated by the Spool team. *(pending guidance from docs publishing team)*

### SDK Preparation Instructions

#### Generating C# SDK Reference Docs


**Preparation instructions**: Instructions are detailed [here](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/onboard/admin/reference/dotnet/documenting-api?branch=master). In summary:

- In your project's build settings, enable the generation of an XML comment file with the `-doc` compiler option. Our nuget packages must include this file.
- Annotate your code with [XML documentation comments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/). Within these comments, use the [recommended documentation tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/recommended-tags-for-documentation-comments). .NET API documentation writing guidelines are located [here](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs/wiki).
- You can include markdown in your annotations by following the instructions [here](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/onboard/admin/reference/dotnet/documenting-api?branch=master). An example of this is [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.ml.transforms.valuemappingestimator?view=ml-dotnet).
- Publish your package to Nuget, and then let Robert's team know you're ready via [this ticket](https://ceapex.visualstudio.com/Onboarding/_workitems/edit/266845).


#### Generating JS SDK Reference Docs

Preparation instructions: Instructions are detailed [here](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/onboard/admin/reference/js-ts/documenting-api?branch=master). In summary:
- For Javascript, [JSDoc conventions](https://jsdoc.app/) are used.
- For TypeScript, [TypeDoc conventions](http://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/) are used.
- Once your package is ready, let Robert's team know via [this ticket](https://ceapex.visualstudio.com/Onboarding/_workitems/edit/266845).
