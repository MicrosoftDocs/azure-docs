### Intro

Reference docs come in two flavors:

- **Autogenerated docs**: These docs are generated using automation capabilities provided by Robert Outlaw's (routlaw) team. Java, Javascript, Typescript, .NET, Python, Azure REST, non-Azure REST, and PowerShell (all modules except Azure Powershell) are supported here.
- **Team-generated docs**: These docs are generated by the Spool team.

### Auto-generated docs

For **autogenerated docs**, it's generally advised that product teams leverage automation capabilities whenever possible. Teams traditionally engage directly with the Reference Docs Automation team. [This ticket](https://ceapex.visualstudio.com/Onboarding/_workitems/edit/266845) is being used to facilitate this engagement. Feel free to add comments to this ticket with any questions or concerns and a member of Robert's team will help onboard you.

### ACS Needs

The reference documentation types we need for ACS are:

- **REST Management** docs to support resource management (portal actions) via REST APIs. This is similar to the [Mixed Reality REST API doc set](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/mixedreality/), the [Azure Media Services OpenAPI Swagger spec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/media-services/latest/), and the [Azure Media Services REST API spec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/media-services/latest/).
- **Azure CLI** docs to support resource management (portal actions) via the Azure CLI. This is similar to the [Azure Monitor CLI doc set](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/monitor?view=azure-cli-latest) and the [Azure Media Services CLI doc set](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ams?view=azure-cli-latest).
- **C# Reference** docs to support the server and client C# SDKs. This is similar to the [Azure Notification Hubs .NET API docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.notificationhubs?view=azure-dotnet).
- **JS Reference** docs to support the server and client JS SDKs. This is similar to the [Azure Blob Storage API reference docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/@azure/storage-blob/?view=azure-node-latest)
- **Objective C Reference** docs to support the server and client Objective-C SDKs. This is similar to the [Spatial Anchors Objective C SDK docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/objectivec/api/spatial-anchors/).
- **Java Reference** docs to support the server and client Java SDKs. This is similar to the [Azure Functions Java API docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/)

The status and ownership of these reference docs are outlined in [this spreadsheet](https://microsoft.sharepoint-df.com/:x:/t/IC3SDK/EasbZy5MyMBLq2S0NyTNBVABhKiR6r8bq8Ld8clQQkgOeA?e=jxpgWn).


#### Generating C# SDK Reference Docs


**Preparation instructions**: Instructions are detailed [here](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/onboard/admin/reference/dotnet/documenting-api?branch=master). In summary:

- In your project's build settings, enable the generation of an XML comment file with the `-doc` compiler option. Our nuget packages must include this file.
- Annotate your code with [XML documentation comments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/). Within these comments, use the [recommended documentation tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/recommended-tags-for-documentation-comments). .NET API documentation writing guidelines are located [here](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs/wiki).
- You can include markdown in your annotations by following the instructions [here](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/onboard/admin/reference/dotnet/documenting-api?branch=master). An example of this is [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.ml.transforms.valuemappingestimator?view=ml-dotnet).
- Publish your package to Nuget, and then let Robert's team know you're ready via [this ticket](https://ceapex.visualstudio.com/Onboarding/_workitems/edit/266845).




#### Generating JS SDK Reference Docs

Preparation instructions: Instructions are detailed [here](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/onboard/admin/reference/js-ts/documenting-api?branch=master). In summary:
- For Javascript, [JSDoc conventions](https://jsdoc.app/) are used.
- For TypeScript, [TypeDoc conventions](http://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/) are used.
- Once your package is ready, let Robert's team know via [this ticket](https://ceapex.visualstudio.com/Onboarding/_workitems/edit/266845).



### FAQ

**Q:** How do we deliver SDKs to Robert's team?

**A:** (Robert) For non-released SDKs, we suggest using an unauthenticated (very important) MyGet feed for .NET and a NPM feed for JS/TS.

~

**Q:** Would it be possible to send the Ref Docs Automation team partially-completed SDKs to "flush the pipes"?

**A:** (Robert) Yes, we can start working with incomplete content, as long as its available in a feed. This is actually a great way to train your team on how to trigger new doc builds and manage the configuration yourself.

~

**Q:** How is hosting managed? Who owns it? How are our docs updated? 

**A:** (Robert) Hosting is automatically configured and updates are handled via Azure DevOps. Once we have your packages, docs are generated into a github repo that holds the files we generate. When you have an update, you go into the Azure devops repo and kick off a job that generates a preview link. Upon your approval, those changes can then be published to customers.

~

**Q:** Can we stage stuff during private preview?

**A:** (Robert) Yes! Then for public preview, we press publish.

~

**Q:** What exactly are we responsible for managing?

**A:** (Robert) We build the house for you, and then give you ownership of the keys and management. So after we set up the infrastructure and generate your content, you're responsible for maintaining the repository and managing releases through our devops pipeline.

~

**Q:** How will we update our reference docs?

**A:** (Robert) It'll be through ops.microsoft.com / the docs portal. We offer training for this when you're ready. In short - updates are pushed by you, not pulled by us.

~

**Q:** We have a lot of different SDKs. How should these be organized across repositories?

**A:** (Robert) We recommend separating repositories by language.

~

**Q:** How can we make our ref docs consumable through the API explorer?

**A:** (Robert) Let's worry about that once your content is published.

~

**Q:** What are the pros/cons of using your pipeline vs managing our own repos?

**A:** (Robert) Your team can generate their own docs, but the automated infrastructure is durable. Once you set things up, it just works. We have a strong preference for auto-gen docs… it's the best way to ensure docs that don't get out of date since updating them takes a click of a button as opposed to merging.

~

**Q:** What if your team doesn't support the language?

**A:** (Robert) You have to manage generation, hosting, updates. An example for objective-c: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/objectivec/cognitive-services/speech/ and https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-objective-c-cognitive-services-pr
