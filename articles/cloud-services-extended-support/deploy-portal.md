    The **Create a cloud service (extended support)** pane opens.

1. On the **Basics** tab, select or enter the following information:

    - **Subscription**: Select a subscription to use for the deployment.
    - **Resource group**: Select an existing resource group, or create a new one.
    - **Cloud service name**: Enter a name for your Cloud Services (extended support) deployment.
        - The DNS name of the cloud service is separate and is specified by the DNS name label of the public IP address. You can modify the DNS name in **Public IP** on the **Configuration** tab.
    - **Region**: Select the region to deploy the service to.

    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy-portal-3.png" alt-text="Image shows the Cloud Services (extended support) Basics tab.":::

1. On the **Basics** tab under **Cloud service configuration, package, and service definition**, add your package (.cspkg or .zip) file, configuration (.cscfg) file, and definition (.csdef) file for the deployment. You can add existing files from blob storage or upload the files from your local machine. If you upload the files from your local machine, the files are then stored in a storage account in Azure.

    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy-portal-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the section of the Basics tab where you upload files and select storage.":::

1. Select the **Configuration** tab, and then select or enter the following information:

    - **Virtual network**: Select a virtual network to associate with the cloud service, or create a new virtual network.

      - Cloud Services (extended support) deployments *must* be in a virtual network.
      - The virtual network *must* also be referenced in the configuration (.cscfg) file under `NetworkConfiguration`.

    - **Public IP**: Select an existing public IP address to associate with the cloud service, or create a new one.

        - If you have IP input endpoints defined in your definition (.csdef) file, create a public IP address for your cloud service.
        - Cloud Services (extended support) supports only a Basic SKU public IP address.
        - If your configuration (.cscfg) file contains a reserved IP address, set the allocation type for the public IP address to **Static**.
        - (Optional) You can assign a DNS name for your cloud service endpoint by updating the DNS label property of the public IP address associated with the cloud service.  
    - (Optional) **Start cloud service**: Select the checkbox if you want to start the service immediately after it deploys.
    - **Key vault**: Select a key vault.
        - A key vault is required when you specify one or more certificates in your configuration (.cscfg) file. When you select a key vault, we attempt to find the selected certificates that are defined in your configuration (.cscfg) file based on the certificate thumbprints. If any certificates are missing from your key vault, you can upload them now    , and then select **Refresh**.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/deploy-portal-5.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Configuration tab in the Azure portal when you create a Cloud Services (extended support) deployment.":::

1. When all information is entered or selected, select the **Review + Create** tab to validate your deployment configuration and create your Cloud Services (extended support) deployment.
