# Azure Cloud Services (extended support) definition WebRole schema

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of March 31, 2025, cloud Services (extended support) is deprecated and will be fully retired on March 31, 2027. [Learn more](https://aka.ms/csesretirement) about this deprecation and [how to migrate](https://aka.ms/cses-retirement-march-2025).

The Azure web role is a role that is customized for web application programming as supported by IIS 7, such as ASP.NET, PHP, Windows Communication Foundation, and FastCGI.

The default extension for the service definition file is csdef.

## Basic service definition schema for a web role  
The basic format of a service definition file containing a web role is as follows.

```xml

The following table describes the attributes of the `WebRole` element.

| Attribute | Type | Description |  
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |  
|name|string|Required. The name for the web role. The role's name must be unique.|  
|enableNativeCodeExecution|boolean|Optional. The default value is `true`; native code execution and full trust are enabled by default. Set this attribute to `false` to disable native code execution for the web role, and use Azure partial trust instead.|  
|vmsize|string|Optional. Set this value to change the size of the virtual machine that is allotted to the role. The default value is `Small`. For more information, see [Virtual Machine sizes for Cloud Services](available-sizes.md).|  

##  <a name="ConfigurationSettings"></a> ConfigurationSettings  
The `ConfigurationSettings` element describes the collection of configuration settings for a web role. This element is the parent of the `Setting` element.

##  <a name="Setting"></a> Setting  
The `Setting` element describes a name and value pair that specifies a configuration setting for an instance of a role.

The following table describes the attributes of the `Setting` element.

| Attribute | Type | Description |  
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |  
|name|string|Required. A unique name for the configuration setting.|  

The configuration settings for a role are name and value pairs that are declared in the service definition file and set in the service configuration file.

##  <a name="LocalResources"></a> LocalResources  
The `LocalResources` element describes the collection of local storage resources for a web role. This element is the parent of the `LocalStorage` element.

##  <a name="LocalStorage"></a> LocalStorage  
The `LocalStorage` element identifies a local storage resource that provides file system space for the service at runtime. A role may define zero or more local storage resources.

> [!NOTE]
>  The `LocalStorage` element can appear as a child of the `WebRole` element to support compatibility with earlier versions of the Azure SDK.

The following table describes the attributes of the `LocalStorage` element.

| Attribute | Type | Description |  
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |  
|name|string|Required. A unique name for the local store.|  
|cleanOnRoleRecycle|boolean|Optional. Indicates whether the local store should be cleaned when the role is restarted. Default value is `true`.|  
|sizeInMb|int|Optional. The desired amount of storage space to allocate for the local store, in MB. If not specified, the default storage space allocated is 100 MB. The minimum amount of storage space that may be allocated is 1 MB.<br /><br /> The maximum size of the local resources is dependent on the virtual machine size. For more information, see [Virtual Machine sizes for Cloud Services](available-sizes.md).|  
  
The name of the directory allocated to the local storage resource corresponds to the value provided for the name attribute.

##  <a name="Endpoints"></a> Endpoints  
The `Endpoints` element describes the collection of input (external), internal, and instance input endpoints for a role. This element is the parent of the `InputEndpoint`, `InternalEndpoint`, and `InstanceInputEndpoint` elements.

Input and Internal endpoints are allocated separately. A service can have a total of 25 input, internal, and instance input endpoints, which can be allocated across the 25 roles allowed in a service. For example, if you have five roles, you can allocate five input endpoints per role, or you can allocate 25 input endpoints to a single role or you can allocate one input endpoint each to 25 roles.

> [!NOTE]
>  Each role deployed requires one instance per role. The default provisioning for a subscription is limited to 20 cores and thus is limited to 20 instances of a role. If your application requires more instances than is provided by the default provisioning see [Billing, Subscription Management and Quota Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/) for more information on increasing your quota.

##  <a name="InputEndpoint"></a> InputEndpoint  
The `InputEndpoint` element describes an external endpoint to a web role.

You can define multiple endpoints that are a combination of HTTP, HTTPS, UDP, and TCP endpoints. You can specify any port number you choose for an input endpoint, but the port numbers specified for each role in the service must be unique. For example, if you specify that a web role uses port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS, you might then specify that a second web role uses port 8080 for HTTP and port 8043 for HTTPS.

The following table describes the attributes of the `InputEndpoint` element.

| Attribute | Type | Description |  
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |

|certificate|string|Required for an HTTPS endpoint. The name of a certificate defined by a `Certificate` element.|  
|localPort|int|Optional. Specifies a port used for internal connections on the endpoint. The `localPort` attribute maps the external port on the endpoint to an internal port on a role. This attribute is useful in scenarios where a role must communicate to an internal component on a port that different from the one that is exposed externally.<br /><br /> If not specified, the value of `localPort` is the same as the `port` attribute. Set the value of `localPort` to “*” to automatically assign an unallocated port that is discoverable using the runtime API.<br /><br /> Possible values range between 1 and 65535, inclusive (Azure SDK version 1.7 or higher).<br /><br /> The `localPort` attribute is only available using the Azure SDK version 1.3 or higher.|  
|ignoreRoleInstanceStatus|boolean|Optional. When the value of this attribute is set to `true`, the status of a service is ignored, and the load balancer won't remove the endpoint. Setting this value to `true` useful for debugging busy instances of a service. The default value is `false`. **Note:**  An endpoint can still receive traffic even when the role isn't in a Ready state.|  
|loadBalancerProbe|string|Optional. The name of the load balancer probe associated with the input endpoint. For more information, see [LoadBalancerProbe Schema](schema-csdef-loadbalancerprobe.md).|  

##  <a name="InternalEndpoint"></a> InternalEndpoint  
The `InternalEndpoint` element describes an internal endpoint to a web role. An internal endpoint is available only to other role instances running within the service; it isn't available to clients outside the service. Web roles that don't include the `Sites` element can only have a single HTTP, UDP, or TCP internal endpoint.

|port|int|Optional. The port used for internal load-balanced connections on the endpoint. A load-balanced endpoint uses two ports. The port used for the public IP address, and the port used on the private IP address. Typically, these values are set to the same, but you can choose to use different ports.<br /><br /> Possible values range between 1 and 65535, inclusive (Azure SDK version 1.7 or higher).<br /><br /> The `Port` attribute is only available using the Azure SDK version 1.3 or higher.|  

##  <a name="InstanceInputEndpoint"></a> InstanceInputEndpoint  
The `InstanceInputEndpoint` element describes an instance input endpoint to a web role. An instance input endpoint is associated with a specific role instance by using port forwarding in the load balancer.

##  <a name="FixedPortRange"></a> FixedPortRange  
The `FixedPortRange` element specifies the range of ports that are assigned to the internal endpoint or instance input endpoint, and sets the port used for load balanced connections on the endpoint.

> [!NOTE]
>  The `FixedPortRange` element works differently depending on the element in which it resides. When the `FixedPortRange` element is in the `InternalEndpoint` element, it opens all ports on the load balancer within the range of the min and max attributes for all virtual machines on which the role runs. When the `FixedPortRange` element is in the `InstanceInputEndpoint` element, it opens only one port within the range of the min and max attributes on each virtual machine running the role.
