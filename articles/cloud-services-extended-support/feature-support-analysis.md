# Feature Analysis: Cloud Services (extended support) and Virtual Machine Scale Sets

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of March 31, 2025, cloud Services (extended support) is deprecated and will be fully retired on March 31, 2027. [Learn more](https://aka.ms/csesretirement) about this deprecation and [how to migrate](https://aka.ms/cses-retirement-march-2025).
