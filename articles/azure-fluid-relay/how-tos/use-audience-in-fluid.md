# How to: Use audience features in the Fluid Framework

In this tutorial, you'll learn about using the Fluid Framework [Audience](https://fluidframework.com/docs/build/audience/) with [React](https://reactjs.org/) to create a visual demonstration of users connecting to a container. The audience object holds information related to all users connected to the container. In this example, the Azure Client library will be used to create the container and audience.

The following image shows ID buttons and a container ID input field. Leaving the container ID field blank and clicking a user ID button will create a new container and join as the selected user. Alternatively, the end-user can input a container ID and choose a user ID to join an existing container as the selected user.

The next image shows multiple users connected to a container represented by boxes. The box outlined in blue represents the user who is viewing the client while the boxes outlined in black represents the other connected users. As new users attach to the container with unique ID's, the number of boxes will increase.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the [Fluid Framework Overview](https://fluidframework.com/docs/) and that you have completed the [QuickStart](https://fluidframework.com/docs/start/quick-start/). You should also be familiar with the basics of [React](https://reactjs.org/), [creating React projects](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app), and [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

## Create the project

1. Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the parent folder where you want to create the project; e.g., `C:\My Fluid Projects`.
1. Run the following command at the prompt. (Note that the CLI is np**x**, not npm. It was installed when you installed Node.js.)

    ```dotnetcli
    npx create-react-app fluid-audience-tutorial
    ```

1. The project is created in a subfolder named `fluid-audience-tutorial`. Navigate to it with the command `cd fluid-audience-tutorial`.

1. The project uses the following Fluid libraries:

    | Library                             | Description |
    |-------------------------------------|-------------|
    | `fluid-framework`                   | Contains the SharedMap [distributed data structure](../concepts/data-structures.md) that synchronizes data across clients. |
    | `@fluidframework/azure-client`      | Defines the connection to a Fluid service server and defines the starting schema for the [Fluid container](../concepts/architecture.md#container). |
    | `@fluidframework/test-client-utils` | Defines the [InsecureTokenProvider](../concepts/authentication-authorization.md#the-token-provider) needed to create the connection to a Fluid Service. |

    Run the following command to install the libraries.

    ```dotnetcli
    npm install @fluidframework/azure-client @fluidframework/test-client-utils fluid-framework
    ```

## Code the project

### Set up state variables and component view

1. Open the file `\src\App.js` in the code editor. Delete all the default `import` statements. Then delete all the markup from the `return` statement. Then add import statements for components and React hooks. Note that we'll be implementing the imported **AudienceDisplay** and **UserIdSelection** components in the later steps. The file should look like the following:

    ```js
        import { useState, useCallback } from "react";
        import { AudienceDisplay } from "./AudienceDisplay";
        import { UserIdSelection } from "./UserIdSelection";
    
        export const App = () => {
        // TODO 1: Define state variables to handle view changes and user input
        return (
        // TODO 2: Return view components
        );
        }
    ```

1. Replace `TODO 1` with the following code. This code initializes local state variables that will be used within the application. The `displayAudience` value determines if we render the **AudienceDisplay** component or the **UserIdSelection** component (see `TODO 2`). The `userId` value is the user identifier to connect to the container with and the `containerId` value is the container to load. The `handleSelectUser` and `handleContainerNotFound` functions are passed in as callbacks to the two views and manage state transitions. `handleSelectUser` is called when attempting to create/load a container. `handleContainerNotFound` is called when creating/loading a container fails.

    Note, the values userId and containerId will come from a **UserIdSelection** component through the `handleSelectUser` function.

    ```js
        const [displayAudience, setDisplayAudience] = useState(false);
        const [userId, setUserId] = useState();
        const [containerId, setContainerId] = useState();
    
        const handleSelectUser = useCallback((userId, containerId) => {
        setDisplayAudience(true)
        setUserId(userId);
        setContainerId(containerId);
        }, [displayAudience, userId, containerId]);
    
        const handleContainerNotFound = useCallback(() => {
        setDisplayAudience(false)
        }, [setDisplayAudience]);
    ```

1. Replace `TODO 2` with the following code. As stated above, the `displayAudience` variable will determine if we render the **AudienceDisplay** component or the **UserIdSelection** component. Also, functions to update the state variables are passed into components as properties.

    ```js
        (displayAudience) ?
        <AudienceDisplay userId={userId} containerId={containerId} onContainerNotFound={handleContainerNotFound}/> :
        <UserIdSelection onSelectUser={handleSelectUser}/>
    ```

### Set up AudienceDisplay component

1. Create and open a file `\src\AudienceDisplay.js` in the code editor. Add the following `import` statements:

    ```js
        import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
        import { SharedMap } from "fluid-framework";
        import { AzureClient } from "@fluidframework/azure-client";
        import { InsecureTokenProvider } from "@fluidframework/test-client-utils";
    ```
    
    Note that the objects imported from the Fluid Framework library are required for defining users and containers. In the following steps, **AzureClient** and **InsecureTokenProvider** will be used to configure the client service (see `TODO 1`) while the **SharedMap** will be used to configure a `containerSchema` needed to create a container (see `TODO 2`).

1. Add the following functional components and helper functions:

    ```js
        const tryGetAudienceObject = async (userId, userName, containerId) => {
        // TODO 1: Create container and return audience object
        }
    
        export const AudienceDisplay = (props) => {
        //TODO 2: Configure user ID, user name, and state variables
        //TODO 3: Set state variables and set event listener on component mount
        //TODO 4: Return list view
        }
    
        const AudienceList = (data) => {
        //TODO 5: Append view elements to list array for each member
        //TODO 6: Return list of member elements
        }
    ```

    Note that the **AudienceDisplay** and **AudienceList** are functional components which handle getting and rendering audience data while the `tryGetAudienceObject` method handles the creation of container and audience services.

### Getting container and audience

You can use a helper function to get the Fluid data, from the Audience object, into the view layer (the React state). The `tryGetAudienceObject` method is called when the view component loads after a user ID is selected. The returned value is assigned to a React state property.

1. Replace `TODO 1` with the following code. Note that the values for `userId` `userName` `containerId` will be passed in from the **App** component. If there's no `containerId`, a new container is created. Also, note that the `containerId` is stored on the URL hash. A user entering a session from a new browser may copy the URL from an existing session browser or navigate to `localhost:3000` and manually input the container ID. With this implementation, we want to wrap the `getContainer` call in a try catch in the case that the user inputs a container ID which doesn't exist. Visit the [Containers](../concepts/architecture.md#container) documentation for more information.

    ```js
        const userConfig = {
            id: userId,
            name: userName,
            additionalDetails: {
                email: userName.replace(/\s/g, "") + "@example.com",
                date: new Date().toLocaleDateString("en-US"),
            },
        };
    
        const serviceConfig = {
            connection: {
                type: "local",
                tokenProvider: new InsecureTokenProvider("", userConfig),
                endpoint: "http://localhost:7070",
            },
        };
    
        const client = new AzureClient(serviceConfig);
    
        const containerSchema = {
            initialObjects: { myMap: SharedMap },
        };
    
        let container;
        let services;
        if (!containerId) {
            ({ container, services } = await client.createContainer(containerSchema));
            const id = await container.attach();
            location.hash = id;
        } else {
            try {
                ({ container, services } = await client.getContainer(containerId, containerSchema));
            } catch (e) {
                return;
            }
        }
        return services.audience;
    ```

### Getting the audience on component mount

Now that we've defined how to get the Fluid audience, we need to tell React to call `tryGetAudienceObject` when the Audience Display component is mounted.

1. Replace `TODO 2` with the following code. Note that the user ID will come from the parent component as either `user1` `user2` or `random`. If the ID is `random` we use `Math.random()` to generate a random number as the ID. Additionally, a name will be mapped to the user based on their ID as specified in `userNameList`. Lastly, we define the state variables which will store the connected members as well as the current user. `fluidMembers` will store a list of all members connected to the container whereas `currentMember` will contain the member object representing the current user viewing the browser context.

    ```js
        const userId = props.userId == "random" ? Math.random() : props.userId;
        const userNameList = {
        "user1" : "User One",
        "user2" : "User Two",
        "random" : "Random User"
        };
        const userName = userNameList[props.userId];
    
        const [fluidMembers, setFluidMembers] = useState();
        const [currentMember, setCurrentMember] = useState();
    ```

1. Replace `TODO 3` with the following code. This will call the `tryGetAudienceObject` when the component is mounted and set the returned audience members to `fluidMembers` and `currentMember`. Note, we check if an audience object is returned in case  a user inputs a containerId which doesn't exist and we need to return them to the **UserIdSelection** view (`props.onContainerNotFound()` will handle switching the view). Also, it is good practice to deregister event handlers when the React component dismounts by returning `audience.off`.

    ```js
        useEffect(() => {
        tryGetAudienceObject(userId, userName, props.containerId).then(audience => {
            if(!audience) {
            props.onContainerNotFound();
            alert("error: container id not found.");
            return;
            }
    
            const updateMembers = () => {
            setFluidMembers(audience.getMembers());
            setCurrentMember(audience.getMyself());
            }
    
            updateMembers();
    
            audience.on("membersChanged", updateMembers);
    
            return () => { audience.off("membersChanged", updateMembers) };
        });
        }, []);
    ```

1. Replace `TODO 4` with the following code. Note, if the `fluidMembers` or `currentMember` has not been initialized, a blank screen is rendered. The **AudienceList** component will render the member data with styling (to be implemented in the next section).

    ```js
        if (!fluidMembers || !currentMember) return (<div/>);
    
        return (
            <AudienceList fluidMembers={fluidMembers} currentMember={currentMember}/>
        )
    ```
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Connection transitions can result in short timing windows where `getMyself` returns `undefined`. This is because the current client connection will not have been added to the audience yet, so a matching connection ID cannot be found. To prevent React from rendering a page with no audience members, we add a listener to call `updateMembers` on `membersChanged`. This works since the service audience emits a `membersChanged` event when the container is connected.

### Create the view

1. Replace `TODO 5` with the following code. Note we are rendering a list component for each member passed from the **AudienceDisplay** component. For each member, we first compare `member.userId` to `currentMember.userId` to check if that member `isSelf`. This way, we can differentiate the client user from the other users and display the component with a different color. We then push the list component to a `list` array. Each component will display member data such as `userId` `userName` and `additionalDetails`.

    ```js
        const currentMember = data.currentMember;
        const fluidMembers = data.fluidMembers;
    
        const list = [];
        fluidMembers.forEach((member, key) => {
            const isSelf = (member.userId === currentMember.userId);
            const outlineColor = isSelf ? 'blue' : 'black';
    
            list.push(
            <div style={{
                padding: '1rem',
                margin: '1rem',
                display: 'flex',
                outline: 'solid',
                flexDirection: 'column',
                maxWidth: '25%',
                outlineColor
            }} key={key}>
                <div style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Name</div>
                <div>
                    {member.userName}
                </div>
                <div style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>ID</div>
                <div>
                    {member.userId}
                </div>
                <div style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Connections</div>
                {
                    member.connections.map((data, key) => {
                        return (<div key={key}>{data.id}</div>);
                    })
                }
                <div style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Additional Details</div>
                { JSON.stringify(member.additionalDetails, null, '\t') }
            </div>
            );
        });
    ```

1. Replace `TODO 6` with the following code. This will render all each of the member elements we pushed into the `list` array.

    ```js
        return (
            <div>
                {list}
            </div>
        );
    ```

### Setup UserIdSelection component

1. Create and open a file `\src\UserIdSelection.js` in the code editor. This component will include user ID buttons and container ID input fields which allow end-users to choose their user ID and collaborative session. Add the following `import` statements and functional components:

    ```js
    import { useState } from 'react';
    
    export const UserIdSelection = (props) => {
        // TODO 1: Define styles and handle user inputs
        return (
        // TODO 2: Return view components
        );
    }
    ```

1. Replace `TODO 1` with the following code. Note that the `onSelectUser` function will update the state variables in the parent **App** component and prompt a view change. The `handleSubmit` method is triggered by button elements which will be implemented in `TODO 2`. Also, the `handleChange` method is used to update the `containerId` state variable. This method will be called from an input element event listener implemented in `TODO 2`. Also, note that we update the `containerId` be getting the value from an HTML element with the id `containerIdInput` (defined in `TODO 2`).

    ```js
        const selectionStyle = {
        marginTop: '2rem',
        marginRight: '2rem',
        width: '150px',
        height: '30px',
        };
    
        const [containerId, setContainerId] = (location.hash.substring(1));
    
        const handleSubmit = (userId) => {
        props.onSelectUser(userId, containerId);
        }
    
        const handleChange = () => {
        setContainerId(document.getElementById("containerIdInput").value);
        };
    ```

1. Replace `TODO 2` with the following code. This will render the user ID buttons as well as the container ID input field.

    ```js
        <div style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection:'column'}}>
        <div style={{marginBottom: '2rem'}}>
            Enter Container Id:
            <input type="text" id="containerIdInput" value={containerId} onChange={() => handleChange()} style={{marginLeft: '2rem'}}></input>
        </div>
        {
            (containerId) ?
            (<div style={{}}>Select a User to join container ID: {containerId} as the user</div>)
            : (<div style={{}}>Select a User to create a new container and join as the selected user</div>)
        }
        <nav>
            <button type="submit" style={selectionStyle} onClick={() => handleSubmit("user1")}>User 1</button>
            <button type="submit" style={selectionStyle} onClick={() => handleSubmit("user2")}>User 2</button>
            <button type="submit" style={selectionStyle} onClick={() => handleSubmit("random")}>Random User</button>
        </nav>
        </div>
    ```

## Start the Fluid server and run the application

> [!NOTE]
> To match the rest of this how-to, this section uses `npx` and `npm` commands to start a Fluid server. However, the code in this article can also run against an Azure Fluid Relay server. For more information, see [How to: Provision an Azure Fluid Relay service](provision-fluid-azure-portal.md) and [How to: Connect to an Azure Fluid Relay service](connect-fluid-azure-service.md)

In the Command Prompt, run the following command to start the Fluid service.

```dotnetcli
npx @fluidframework/azure-local-service@latest
```

Open a new Command Prompt and navigate to the root of the project; for example, `C:/My Fluid Projects/fluid-audience-tutorial`. Start the application server with the following command. The application opens in the browser. This may take a few minutes.

```dotnetcli
npm run start
```

Navigate to `localhost:3000` on a browser tab to view the running application. To create a new container, select a user ID button while leaving the container ID input blank. To simulate a new user joining the container session, open a new browser tab and navigate to `localhost:3000`. This time, input the container ID value which can be found from first browser tab's url proceeding `http://localhost:3000/#`.

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to install an additional dependency to make this demo compatible with webpack 5. If you receive a compilation error related to a "buffer" or "url" package, please run `npm install -D buffer url` and try again. This will be resolved in a future release of Fluid Framework.

## Next steps

- Try extending the demo with more key/value pairs in the `additionalDetails` field in `userConfig`.
- Consider integrating audience into a collaborative application which utilizes distributed data structures such as SharedMap or SharedString.
- Learn more about [Audience](https://fluidframework.com/docs/build/audience/).

> [!TIP]
> When you make changes to the code the project will automatically rebuild and the application server will reload. However, if you make changes to the container schema, they will only take effect if you close and restart the application server. To do this, give focus to the Command Prompt and press Ctrl-C twice. Then run `npm run start` again.
