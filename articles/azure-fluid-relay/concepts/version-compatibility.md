# Version compatibility with Fluid Framework releases

To connect your application to Azure Fluid Relay service,
you'll use the **@fluidframework/azure-client** library. You'll also use the **fluid-framework** library to use the core
data structures and provided by the Fluid Framework.

Since you are using Azure Fluid Relay, you should first install the latest available version of
@fluidframework/azure-client and use that version to determine what version of the fluid-framework library to use. The library expresses a *peer dependency* on the version of the fluid-framework package on
which it depends.

You can use the [install-peerdeps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/install-peerdeps) tool to install both
@fluidframework/azure-client and the compatible version of fluid-framework using the following command:

```bash
npx install-peerdeps @fluidframework/azure-client
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Now that Azure Fluid Relay is generally available, we no longer support any pre-release version of **@fluidframework/azure-client** and **fluid-framework**.
> You must upgrade to the latest 1.0 version per the table below. With this upgrade, youâ€™ll make use of our new multi-region routing capability where
> Azure Fluid Relay will host your session closer to your end users to improve customer experience. In the latest package, you will need to update your
> serviceConfig object to the new Azure Fluid Relay service endpoint instead of the storage and orderer endpoints. You can find the service endpoint in 
> the "Access Key" section of the Fluid Relay resource in the Azure portal. The orderer and storage endpoints used in earlier versions are deprecated now.

> [!NOTE]
> Fluid packages follow npm semver versioning standards. Patch updates are only applied to the latest minor version. To stay current ensure you are on
> the latest published minor/patch version. To learn more about semver, see [Semantic Versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning).
