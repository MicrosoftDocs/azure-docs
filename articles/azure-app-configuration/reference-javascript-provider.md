# JavaScript configuration provider

[![configuration-provider-npm-package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@azure/app-configuration-provider?label=@azure/app-configuration-provider)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/app-configuration-provider)

Azure App Configuration is a managed service that helps developers centralize their application configurations simply and securely. The JavaScript configuration provider library enables loading configuration from an Azure App Configuration store in a managed way. This client library adds additional [functionality](./configuration-provider-overview.md#feature-development-status) above the Azure SDK for JavaScript.

## Load configuration

The `load` method exported in the `@azure/app-configuration-provider` package is used to load configuration from the Azure App Configuration. The `load` method allows you to either use Microsoft Entra ID or connection string to connect to the App Configuration store.

### [Microsoft Entra ID](#tab/entra-id)

You use the `DefaultAzureCredential` to authenticate to your App Configuration store. Follow the [instructions](./concept-enable-rbac.md#authentication-with-token-credentials) to assign your credential the **App Configuration Data Reader** role.

```javascript
const { load } = require("@azure/app-configuration-provider");
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const endpoint = process.env.AZURE_APPCONFIG_ENDPOINT;
const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential(); // For more information, see https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/javascript/sdk/credential-chains#use-defaultazurecredential-for-flexibility

async function run() {
    // Connect to Azure App Configuration using a token credential and load all key-values with no label.
    const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential);
    console.log('appConfig.get("message"):', appConfig.get("message"));
}

run();
```

### [Connection string](#tab/connection-string)

```javascript
const { load } = require("@azure/app-configuration-provider");
const connectionString = process.env.AZURE_APPCONFIG_CONNECTION_STRING;

async function run() {
    // Connect to Azure App Configuration using a connection string and load all key-values with no label.
    const appConfig = await load(connectionString);
    console.log('appConfig.get("message"):', appConfig.get("message"));
}

run();
```

---

The `load` method returns an instance of `AzureAppConfiguration` type which is defined as follows:

```typescript
type AzureAppConfiguration = {
    refresh(): Promise<void>;
    onRefresh(listener: () => any, thisArg?: any): Disposable;
} & IGettable & ReadonlyMap<string, any> & IConfigurationObject;
```

For more information about `refresh` and `onRefresh` methods, see the [Configuration refresh](#configuration-refresh) section.

### Consume configuration

The `AzureAppConfiguration` type extends the following interfaces:

- `IGettable`

    ```typescript
    interface IGettable {
        get<T>(key: string): T | undefined;
    }
    ```

    The `IGettable` interface provides `get` method to retrieve the value of a key-value from the Map-styled data structure.

    ```typescript
    const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential);
    const fontSize = appConfig.get("app:font:size"); // value of the key "app:font:size" from the App Configuration store
    ```

- `ReadonlyMap`

    The `AzureAppConfiguration` type also extends the [`ReadonlyMap`](https://typestrong.org/typedoc-auto-docs/typedoc/interfaces/TypeScript.ReadonlyMap.html) interface, providing read-only access to key-value pairs.

- `IConfigurationObject`

    ```typescript
    interface IConfigurationObject {
        constructConfigurationObject(options?: ConfigurationObjectConstructionOptions): Record<string, any>;
    }
    ```

    The `IConfigurationObject` interface provides `constructConfigurationObject` method to construct a configuration object based on a Map-styled data structure and hierarchical keys. The optional `ConfigurationObjectConstructionOptions` parameter can be used to specify the separator for converting hierarchical keys to object properties. By default, the separator is `"."`.

    ```typescript
    interface ConfigurationObjectConstructionOptions {
        separator?: "." | "," | ";" | "-" | "_" | "__" | "/" | ":"; // supported separators
    }
    ```

   In JavaScript, objects or maps are commonly used as the primary data structures to represent configurations. The JavaScript configuration provider library supports both of the configuration approaches, providing developers with the flexibility to choose the option that best fits their needs.

    ```typescript
    const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential);
    const settingsObj = appConfig.constructConfigurationObject({separator: ":"});
    const fontSize1 = appConfig.get("app:font:size"); // map-style configuration representation
    const fontSize2 = settingsObj.app.font.size; // object-style configuration representation
    ```

### JSON content type handling

You can [create JSON key-values](./howto-leverage-json-content-type.md#create-json-key-values-in-app-configuration) in App Configuration. When loading key-values from Azure App Configuration, the configuration provider will automatically convert the key-values of valid JSON content type (e.g. application/json) into object.

```json
{
    "key": "font",
    "label": null,
    "value": "{\r\n\t\"size\": 12,\r\n\t\"color\": \"red\"\r\n}",
    "content_type": "application/json"
}
```

The above key-value will be loaded as `{ size: 12, color: "red" }`.

```typescript
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential);
const { size, color } = appConfig.get("font");
```

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with version *2.2.0* of `@azure/app-configuration-provider`, the configuration provider allows comments, as defined in ([JSONC](https://jsonc.org/)), in key-values with an `application/json` content type.

### Load specific key-values using selectors

By default, the `load` method will load all configurations with no label from the configuration store. You can configure the behavior of the `load` method through the optional parameter of [`AzureAppConfigurationOptions`](https://github.com/Azure/AppConfiguration-JavaScriptProvider/blob/main/src/appConfigurationOptions.ts) type.

To refine or expand the configurations loaded from the App Configuration store, you can specify the key or label selectors under the `AzureAppConfigurationOptions.selectors` property.

```typescript
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    selectors: [
        { // load the subset of keys starting with "app1." prefix and "test" label
            keyFilter: "app1.*",
            labelFilter: "test"
        },
        { // load the subset of keys with "dev" label"
            keyFilter: "*",
            labelFilter: "dev"
        }
    ]
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> Key-values are loaded in the order in which the selectors are listed. If multiple selectors retrieve key-values with the same key, the value from the last one will override any previously loaded value.

#### Tag filters

The tag filters parameter selects key-values with specific tags. A key-value is only loaded if it has all of the tags and corresponding values specified in the filters.

```typescript
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    selectors: [
        { // load the subset of keys with "test" label" and three tags
            keyFilter: "*",
            labelFilter: "test",
            tagFilters: [
                "emptyTag=",
                "nullTag=\0",
                "tag1=value1"
            ]
        }
    ]
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> The characters asterisk (`*`), comma (`,`), and backslash (`\`) are reserved and must be escaped with a backslash when used in a tag filter.

### Trim prefix from keys

You can trim the prefix off of keys by providing a list of trimmed key prefixes to the `AzureAppConfigurationOptions.trimKeyPrefixes` property.

```typescript
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    selectors: [{
        keyFilter: "app.*"
    }],
    trimKeyPrefixes: ["app."]
});
```

## Configuration refresh

Dynamic refresh for the configurations lets you pull their latest values from the App Configuration store without having to restart the application. You can set `AzureAppConfigurationOptions.refreshOptions` to enable the refresh and configure refresh options. The loaded configuration will be updated when any change of selected key-values is detected on the server. By default, a refresh interval of 30 seconds is used, but you can override it with the `refreshIntervalInMs` property.

```typescript
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    refreshOptions: {
        enabled: true,
        refreshIntervalInMs: 15_000
    }
});
```

Setting up `refreshOptions` alone won't automatically refresh the configuration. You need to call the `refresh` method on `AzureAppConfiguration` instance returned by the `load` method to trigger a refresh. 

```typescript
// this call is not blocking, the configuration will be updated asynchronously
appConfig.refresh();
```

This design prevents unnecessary requests to App Configuration when your application is idle. You should include the `refresh` call where your application activity occurs. This is known as **activity-driven configuration refresh**. For example, you can call `refresh` when processing an incoming request or inside an iteration where you perform a complex task.

```typescript
const server = express();
// Use an express middleware to refresh configuration whenever a request comes in
server.use((req, res, next) => {
    appConfig.refresh();
    next();
})
```

Even if the refresh call fails for any reason, your application will continue to use the cached configuration. Another attempt will be made when the configured refresh interval has passed and the refresh call is triggered by your application activity. Calling `refresh` is a no-op before the configured refresh interval elapses, so its performance impact is minimal even if it's called frequently.

### Custom refresh callback

The `onRefresh` method lets you custom callback functions that will be invoked each time the local configuration is successfully updated with changes from the Azure App Configuration store. It returns a Disposable object, which you can use to remove the registered callback

```typescript
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    refreshOptions: {
        enabled: true
    }
});
const disposer = appConfig.onRefresh(() => {
    console.log("Config refreshed.");
});

appConfig.refresh();
// Once the refresh is successful, the callback function you registered will be executed.
// In this example, the message "Config refreshed" will be printed.

disposer.dispose();
```

### Refresh on sentinel key

A sentinel key is a key that you update after you complete the change of all other keys. The configuration provider will monitor the sentinel key instead of all selected key-values. When a change is detected, your app refreshes all configuration values.

```typescript
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    refreshOptions: {
        enabled: true,
        watchedSettings: [
            { key: "sentinel" }
        ]
    }
});
```

For more information about refresh configuration, go to [Use dynamic configuration in JavaScript](./enable-dynamic-configuration-javascript.md).

## Feature flag

You can [create feature flags](./manage-feature-flags.md#create-a-feature-flag) in Azure App Configuration. By default, the feature flags will not be loaded by configuration provider. You can enable loading and refreshing feature flags through `AzureAppConfigurationOptions.featureFlagOptions` property when calling the `load` method.

```typescript
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    featureFlagOptions: {
        enabled: true, // enable loading feature flags
        selectors: [ { keyFilter: "*", labelFilter: "Prod" } ],
        refresh: {
            enabled: true, // enable refreshing feature flags
            refreshIntervalInMs: 60_000
        }
    }
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> If `featureFlagOptions` is enabled and no selector is specified, the configuration provider will load all feature flags with no label from the App Configuration store.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To effectively consume and manage feature flags loaded from Azure App Configuration, install and use the [`@microsoft/feature-management`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/feature-management) package. This library provides a structured way to control feature behavior in your application.

### Feature management

Feature management library provides a way to develop and expose application functionality based on feature flags. The feature management library is designed to work in conjunction with the configuration provider library. The configuration provider will load all selected feature flags into the configuration under the `feature_flags` list of the `feature_management` section. The feature management library will consume and manage the loaded feature flags for your application.

The following example demonstrates how to integrate the `@microsoft/feature-management` library with the configuration provider to dynamically control API accessibility in an Express application based on the status of the `Beta` feature flag.

```typescript
// Load feature flags from Azure App Configuration
import { load } from "@azure/app-configuration-provider";
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    featureFlagOptions: {
        enabled: true, // enable loading feature flags
        refresh: {
            enabled: true // enable refreshing feature flags
        }
    }
});

import { ConfigurationMapFeatureFlagProvider, FeatureManager } from "@microsoft/feature-management";
// Create a feature flag provider which uses the configuration provider as feature flag source
const ffProvider = new ConfigurationMapFeatureFlagProvider(appConfig);
// Create a feature manager which will evaluate the feature flag
const fm = new FeatureManager(ffProvider);

import express from "express";
const server = express();

// Use a middleware to achieve request-driven configuration refresh
server.use((req, res, next) => {
    // this call is not blocking, the configuration will be updated asynchronously
    appConfig.refresh();
    next();
});

server.get("/Beta", async (req, res) => {
    if (await featureManager.isEnabled("Beta")) {
        res.send("Welcome to the Beta page!");
    } else {
        res.status(404).send("Page not found");
    }
});
```

## Key Vault reference

Azure App Configuration supports referencing secrets stored in Azure Key Vault. In App Configuration, you can create keys that map to secrets stored in Key Vault. The secrets are securely stored in Key Vault, but can be accessed like any other configuration once loaded.

The configuration provider library retrieves Key Vault references, just as it does for any other keys stored in App Configuration. Because the client recognizes the keys as Key Vault references, they have a unique content-type, and the client will connect to Key Vault to retrieve their values for your application. You need to configure `AzureAppConfigurationOptions.KeyVaultOptions` property with the proper credential to allow the configuration provider to connect to Azure Key Vault.

```typescript
const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    keyVaultOptions: {
        credential: credential
    }
});
```

You can also provide `SecretClient` instance directly to `KeyVaultOptions`. In this way, you can customize the options while creating `SecretClient`.

```typescript
import { SecretClient } from "@azure/keyvault-secrets";

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
const secretClient = new SecretClient(keyVaultUrl, credential, {
    serviceVersion: "7.0",
});
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    keyVaultOptions: {
        secretClients: [ secretClient ]
    }
});
```

You can also set `secretResolver` property to locally resolve secrets that don’t have a Key Vault associated with them.

```typescript
const resolveSecret = (url) => "From Secret Resolver";
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    keyVaultOptions: {
        secretResolver: resolveSecret
    }
});
```

You can also set `clientOptions` property to configure `SecretClientOptions` used to connect to Azure Key Vault that has no registered `SecretClient`.

```typescript
const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    keyVaultOptions: {
        credential: credential,
        clientOptions: { // configure a custom SecretClientOptions
            retryOptions: { 
                maxRetries: 3, 
                maxRetryDelayInMs: 1000 
            }
        }
    }
});
```

### Parallel secret resolution

Azure Key Vault doesn't provide a batch API for retrieving multiple secrets in a single request. When your application needs to load numerous Key Vault references, you can improve performance by enabling parallel secret resolution using the `parallelSecretResolutionEnabled` property in `KeyVaultOptions`. This allows the provider to fetch multiple secrets in parallel rather than sequentially:


```typescript
const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    keyVaultOptions: {
        credential: credential,
        parallelSecretResolutionEnabled: true
    }
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> When resolving secret in parallel, you may encounter the [service limit](/azure/key-vault/general/service-limits#secrets-managed-storage-account-keys-and-vault-transactions) of Azure Key Vault.
> To handle throttling effectively, implement the [client-side throttling best practices](/azure/key-vault/general/overview-throttling#how-to-throttle-your-app-in-response-to-service-limits) by configuring appropriate retry options for the `SecretClient`. You can either register custom `SecretClient` instances or configure `clientOptions` via the `AzureAppConfigurationOptions.keyVaultOptions`.

### Key Vault secret refresh

Azure App Configuration enables you to configure secret refresh intervals independently of your configuration refresh cycle. This is crucial for security because while the Key Vault reference URI in App Configuration remains unchanged, the underlying secret in Key Vault might be rotated as part of your security practices.

To ensure your application always uses the most current secret values, configure the `secretRefreshIntervalInMs` property in `KeyVaultOptions`. This forces the provider to retrieve fresh secret values from Key Vault when:

- Your application calls `AzureAppConfiguration.refresh`
- The configured refresh interval for the secret has elapsed

This mechanism works even when no changes are detected in your App Configuration store, ensuring your application stays in sync with rotated secrets.

```typescript
const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    keyVaultOptions: {
        credential: credential,
        secretRefreshIntervalInMs: 7200_000 // 2 hours
    }
});
```

## Snapshot

[Snapshot](./concept-snapshots.md) is a named, immutable subset of an App Configuration store's key-values. The key-values that make up a snapshot are chosen during creation time through the usage of key and label filters. Once a snapshot is created, the key-values within are guaranteed to remain unchanged.

You can use snapshot selector to load key-values or feature flags from a snapshot:

```typescript
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    selectors: [
        { snapshotName: "MySnapshot" }, // load key-values from snapshot
        { keyFilter: "test*", labelFilter: "test" }
    ],
    featureFlagOptions: {
        enabled: true,
        selectors: [
            { snapshotName: "MySnapshot" }, // load feature flags from snapshot
            { keyFilter: "*", labelFilter: "test" }
        ]
    }
});
```

## Startup retry

Configuration loading is a critical path operation during application startup. To ensure reliability, the Azure App Configuration provider implements a robust retry mechanism during the initial configuration load. This helps protect your application from transient network issues that might otherwise prevent successful startup.

You can customize this behavior via the `AzureAppConfigurationOptions.startupOptions`:

```typescript
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, { 
    startupOptions: { 
        timeoutInMs: 300_000
    }
});
```
