# Enable conditional features with a custom filter in an ASP.NET Core application

Feature flags can use feature filters to enable features conditionally. To learn more about feature filters, see [Enable conditional features with feature filters](./howto-feature-filters.md).

The example used in this guide is based on the ASP.NET Core application introduced in the feature management [quickstart](./quickstart-feature-flag-aspnet-core.md). Before proceeding further, complete the quickstart to create an ASP.NET Core application with a *Beta* feature flag. Once completed, you must [add a custom feature filter](./howto-feature-filters.md) to the *Beta* feature flag in your App Configuration store. 

In this guide, you'll learn how to implement a custom feature filter and use the feature filter to enable features conditionally.

## Prerequisites

- Create an [ASP.NET Core app with a feature flag](./quickstart-feature-flag-aspnet-core.md).
- [Add a custom feature filter to the feature flag](./howto-feature-filters.md)

## Implement a custom feature filter

You've added a custom feature filter named **Random** with a **Percentage** parameter for your *Beta* feature flag in the prerequisites. Next, you'll implement the feature filter to enable the *Beta* feature flag based on the chance defined by the **Percentage** parameter.

1. Add a `RandomFilter.cs` file with the following code.

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.FeatureManagement;

    namespace TestAppConfig
    {
        [FilterAlias("Random")]
        public class RandomFilter : IFeatureFilter
        {
            private readonly Random _random;

            public RandomFilter()
            {
                _random = new Random();
            }

            public Task<bool> EvaluateAsync(FeatureFilterEvaluationContext context)
            {
                int percentage = context.Parameters.GetSection("Percentage").Get<int>();

                int randomNumber = _random.Next(100);

                return Task.FromResult(randomNumber <= percentage);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    You added a `RandomFilter` class that implements the `IFeatureFilter` interface from the `Microsoft.FeatureManagement` library. The `IFeatureFilter` interface has a single method named `EvaluateAsync`, which is called whenever a feature flag is evaluated. In `EvaluateAsync`, a feature filter enables a feature flag by returning `true`.

    You decorated a `FilterAliasAttribute` to the `RandomFilter` to give your filter an alias **Random**, which matches the filter name you set in the *Beta* feature flag in Azure App Configuration.

1. Open the *Program.cs* file and register the `RandomFilter` by calling the `AddFeatureFilter` method. 

    ```csharp
    // The rest of existing code in Program.cs
    // ... ...

    // Add feature management to the container of services.
    builder.Services.AddFeatureManagement()
                    .AddFeatureFilter<RandomFilter>();

    // The rest of existing code in Program.cs
    // ... ...
    ```

## Feature filter in action

Relaunch the application and refresh the browser a few times. Without manually toggling the feature flag, you will see that the **Beta** menu sometimes appears and sometimes doesn't.
