# Import settings to App Configuration with Azure Pipelines

The Azure App Configuration Import task imports key-values from a configuration file into your App Configuration store. This task enables full circle functionality within the pipeline as you're now able to export settings from the App Configuration store and import settings to the App Configuration store.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- App Configuration store - [create one for free](./quickstart-azure-app-configuration-create.md#create-an-app-configuration-store)
- Azure DevOps project - [create one for free](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2014881)
- [Azure Pipelines agent version 2.144.0](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/releases/tag/v2.144.0) or later and [Node version 16](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.16.0/) or later for running the task on self-hosted agents.

## Create a service connection

1. Save and queue a release. The release log displays any failures encountered during the execution of the task.

## Parameters

The following parameters are used by the App Configuration Import task:

- **Azure subscription**: A drop-down containing your available Azure service connections. To update and refresh your list of available Azure service connections, press the **Refresh Azure subscription** button to the right of the textbox.
- **App Configuration Endpoint**: A drop-down that loads your available configuration stores endpoint under the selected subscription. To update and refresh your list of available configuration stores endpoint, press the **Refresh App Configuration Endpoint** button to the right of the textbox. 
- **Configuration File Path**: The path to your configuration file. The **Configuration File Path** parameter begins at the root of the file repository. You can browse through your build artifact to select a configuration file. (`...` button to the right of the textbox). The supported file formats depend on the file content profile. For the default profile the supported file formats are yaml, json and properties. For KvSet profile the supported file format is json.
- **File Content Profile**: The Configuration File's [content profile](./concept-config-file.md). Default value is **Default**.
     - **Default**: Refers to the conventional configuration file formats that are directly consumable by applications.
     - **Kvset**: Refers to a [file schema](https://aka.ms/latest-kvset-schema) that contains all properties of an App Configuration key-value, including key, value, label, content type, and tags. The task parameters 'Separator', 'Label', 'Content type', 'Prefix', 'Tags', and 'Depth' aren't applicable when using the Kvset profile.
- **Import Mode**: The default value is **All**. Determines the behavior when importing key-values.
    - **All**: Imports all key-values in the configuration file to App Configuration. 
    - **Ignore-Match**: Imports only settings that have no matching key-value in App Configuration. Matching key-values are considered to be key-values with the same key, label, value, content type, and tags.
- **Dry Run**: Default value is **Unchecked**.
   - **Checked**: No updates are performed to App Configuration. Instead any updates that would have been performed in a normal run are printed to the console for review.
   - **Unchecked**: Performs any updates to App Configuration and doesn't print to the console.
- **Separator**: The separator that's used to flatten .json and .yml files.
- **Depth**: The depth that the .json and .yml files are flattened to.
- **Prefix**: A string appended to the beginning of each key imported to the App Configuration store.
- **Label**: A string added to each key-value as the label within the App Configuration store.
- **Content Type**: A string added to each key-value as the content type within the App Configuration store.
- **Tags**: A JSON object in the format of `{"tag1":"val1", "tag2":"val2"}`, which defines tags that are added to each key-value imported to your App Configuration store.
- **Delete key-values that are not included in the configuration file**: Default value is **Unchecked**. The behavior of this option depends on the configuration file content profile.
   - **Checked**:
       - **Default content profile**: Removes all key-values in the App Configuration store that match both the specified prefix and label before importing new key-values from the configuration file.
       - **Kvset content profile**: Removes all key-values in the App Configuration store that aren't included in the configuration file before importing new key-values from the configuration file.
   - **Unchecked**: Imports all key-values from the configuration file into the App Configuration store and leaves everything else in the App Configuration store intact.



## Troubleshooting

If an unexpected error occurs, debug logs can be enabled by setting the pipeline variable `system.debug` to `true`.

## FAQ

**How can I upload multiple configuration files?**

To import multiple configuration files to the App Configuration store, create multiple instances of the Azure App Configuration Import task within the same pipeline.

**How can I create Key Vault references or feature flags using this task?**

Depending on the file content profile you selected, refer to examples in the [Azure App Configuration support for configuration file](./concept-config-file.md).

**Why am I receiving a 409 error when attempting to import key-values to my configuration store?**

A 409 Conflict error message occurs if the task tries to remove or overwrite a key-value that is locked in the App Configuration store.
