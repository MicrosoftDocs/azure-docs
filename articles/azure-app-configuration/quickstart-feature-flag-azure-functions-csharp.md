# Quickstart: Add feature flags to an Azure Functions app

In this quickstart, you create an Azure Functions C# code project and use feature flags in it. You use the feature management from Azure App Configuration to centrally store all your feature flags and control their states.

The .NET Feature Management libraries extend the framework with feature flag support. These libraries are built on top of the .NET configuration system. They integrate with App Configuration through its .NET configuration provider.

>[!NOTE]  
>This article currently only supports [C# in-process function apps](../azure-functions/functions-dotnet-class-library.md) that run on .NET 6.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- An App Configuration store. [Create a store](./quickstart-azure-app-configuration-create.md#create-an-app-configuration-store).
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs) with the **Azure development** workload.

## Add a feature flag

Add a feature flag called *Beta* to the App Configuration store and leave **Label** and **Description** with their default values. For more information about how to add feature flags to a store using the Azure portal or the CLI, go to [Create a feature flag](./manage-feature-flags.md#create-a-feature-flag).

## Create a Functions project

The Azure Functions project template in Visual Studio creates a C# class library project that you can publish to a function app in Azure. You can use a function app to group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, scaling, and sharing of resources.

1. From the Visual Studio menu, select **File** > **New** > **Project**.

1. In **Create a new project**, enter *functions* in the search box, choose the **Azure Functions** template, and then select **Next**.

1. In **Configure your new project**, enter a **Project name** for your project, and then select **Create**. The function app name must be valid as a C# namespace, so don't use underscores, hyphens, or any other nonalphanumeric characters.

1. For the **Create a new Azure Functions application** settings, use the values in the following table:

    | Setting      | Value  | Description                      |
    | ------------ |  ------- |----------------------------------------- |
    | **.NET version** | **.NET 6** | This value creates a function project that runs in-process with version 4.x of the Azure Functions runtime. For more information, see [Azure Functions runtime versions overview](../azure-functions/functions-versions.md).   |
    | **Function template** | **HTTP trigger** | This value creates a function triggered by an HTTP request. |
    | **Storage account (AzureWebJobsStorage)**  | **Storage emulator** | Because a function app in Azure requires a storage account, one is assigned or created when you publish your project to Azure. An HTTP trigger doesn't use an Azure Storage account connection string; all other trigger types require a valid Azure Storage account connection string.  |
    | **Authorization level** | **Anonymous** | The created function can be triggered by any client without providing a key. This authorization setting makes it easy to test your new function. For more information about keys and authorization, see [Authorization keys](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger.md#authorization-keys) and [HTTP and webhook bindings](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook.md). |
    
    ![Screenshot of Azure Functions project settings](../../includes/media/functions-vs-tools-create/functions-project-settings.png)

    ---

    Make sure you set the **Authorization level** to **Anonymous**. If you choose the default level of **Function**, you're required to present the [function key](../azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger.md#authorization-keys) in requests to access your function endpoint.

1. Select **Create** to create the function project and HTTP trigger function.

## Connect to an App Configuration store

This project will use [dependency injection in .NET Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-dotnet-dependency-injection.md). It adds Azure App Configuration as an extra configuration source where your feature flags are stored.

1. Right-click your project, and select **Manage NuGet Packages**. On the **Browse** tab, search for and add following NuGet packages to your project.
   - [Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration/) version 4.1.0 or later
   - [Microsoft.FeatureManagement](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.FeatureManagement/) version 2.2.0 or later
   - [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions/) version 1.1.0 or later 

1. Add a new file, *Startup.cs*, with the following code. It defines a class named `Startup` that implements the `FunctionsStartup` abstract class. An assembly attribute is used to specify the type name used during Azure Functions startup.

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    using Microsoft.FeatureManagement;

    [assembly: FunctionsStartup(typeof(FunctionApp.Startup))]

    namespace FunctionApp
    {
        class Startup : FunctionsStartup
        {
            public override void ConfigureAppConfiguration(IFunctionsConfigurationBuilder builder)
            {
            }

            public override void Configure(IFunctionsHostBuilder builder)
            {
            }
        }
    }
    ```


1. Update the `ConfigureAppConfiguration` method, and add Azure App Configuration provider as an extra configuration source by calling `AddAzureAppConfiguration()`. 

    The `UseFeatureFlags()` method tells the provider to load feature flags. All feature flags have a default cache expiration of 30 seconds before rechecking for changes. The expiration interval can be updated by setting the `FeatureFlagsOptions.CacheExpirationInterval` property passed to the `UseFeatureFlags` method. 

    ```csharp
    public override void ConfigureAppConfiguration(IFunctionsConfigurationBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.ConfigurationBuilder.AddAzureAppConfiguration(options =>
        {
            options.Connect(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ConnectionString"))
                   .Select("_")
                   .UseFeatureFlags();
        });
    }
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > If you don't want any configuration other than feature flags to be loaded to your application, you can call `Select("_")` to only load a nonexisting dummy key `"_"`. By default, all configuration key-values in your App Configuration store will be loaded if no `Select` method is called.

1. Update the `Configure` method to make Azure App Configuration services and feature manager available through dependency injection.

    ```csharp
    public override void Configure(IFunctionsHostBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.Services.AddAzureAppConfiguration();
        builder.Services.AddFeatureManagement();
    }
    ```

1. Open *Function1.cs*, and add the following namespaces.

    ```csharp
    using System.Linq;
    using Microsoft.FeatureManagement;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration;
    ```

   Add a constructor used to obtain instances of `_featureManagerSnapshot` and `IConfigurationRefresherProvider` through dependency injection. From the `IConfigurationRefresherProvider`, you can obtain the instance of `IConfigurationRefresher`.

    ```csharp
    private readonly IVariantFeatureManagerSnapshot _featureManagerSnapshot;
    private readonly IConfigurationRefresher _configurationRefresher;

    public Function1(IVariantFeatureManagerSnapshot featureManagerSnapshot, IConfigurationRefresherProvider refresherProvider)
    {
        _featureManagerSnapshot = featureManagerSnapshot;
        _configurationRefresher = refresherProvider.Refreshers.First();
    }
    ```

1. Update the `Run` method to change the value of the displayed message depending on the state of the feature flag.

   The `TryRefreshAsync` method is called at the beginning of the Functions call to refresh feature flags. It will be a no-op if the cache expiration time window isn't reached. Remove the `await` operator if you prefer the feature flags to be refreshed without blocking the current Functions call. In that case, later Functions calls will get updated value.

    ```csharp
    [FunctionName("Function1")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Run(
        [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
        ILogger log)
    {
        log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

        await _configurationRefresher.TryRefreshAsync();

        string message = await _featureManagerSnapshot.IsEnabledAsync("Beta")
                ? "The Feature Flag 'Beta' is turned ON"
                : "The Feature Flag 'Beta' is turned OFF";

        return (ActionResult)new OkObjectResult(message);
    }
    ```

## Test the function locally

1. Set an environment variable named **ConnectionString**, where the value is the connection string you retrieved earlier in your App Configuration store under **Access Keys**. If you use the Windows command prompt, run the following command and restart the command prompt to allow the change to take effect:

    ```cmd
        setx ConnectionString "<connection-string-of-your-app-configuration-store>"
    ```

    If you use Windows PowerShell, run the following command:

    ```azurepowershell
        $Env:ConnectionString = "<connection-string-of-your-app-configuration-store>"
    ```

    If you use macOS or Linux, run the following command:

    ```bash
        export ConnectionString='<connection-string-of-your-app-configuration-store>'
    ```

1. Press F5 to test your function. If prompted, accept the request from Visual Studio to download and install **Azure Functions Core (CLI)** tools. You might also need to enable a firewall exception so that the tools can handle HTTP requests.

1. Copy the URL of your function from the Azure Functions runtime output.

    ![Quickstart Function debugging in VS](./media/quickstarts/function-visual-studio-debugging.png)

1. Paste the URL for the HTTP request into your browser's address bar. The following image shows the response indicating that the feature flag *Beta* is disabled. 

    ![Quickstart Function feature flag disabled](./media/quickstarts/functions-launch-ff-disabled.png)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **All resources**, and select the App Configuration store that you created.

1. Select **Feature manager**, and change the state of the *Beta* key to **On**.

1. Refresh the browser a few times. When the refresh interval time window passes, the page will change to indicate the feature flag *Beta* is turned on, as shown in the image below.
