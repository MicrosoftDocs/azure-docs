# Enable features on a schedule in an ASP.NET Core application

In this guide, you use the time window filter to enable a feature on a schedule for an ASP.NET Core application. 

The example used in this article is based on the ASP.NET Core application introduced in the feature management [quickstart](./quickstart-feature-flag-aspnet-core.md). Before proceeding further, complete the quickstart to create an ASP.NET Core application with a *Beta* feature flag. Once completed, you must [add a time window filter](./howto-timewindow-filter.md) to the *Beta* feature flag in your App Configuration store.

## Prerequisites

- Create an [ASP.NET Core application with a feature flag](./quickstart-feature-flag-aspnet-core.md).
- [Add a time window filter to the feature flag](./howto-timewindow-filter.md)
- Update the [`Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore/) package to version **3.0.0** or later.

## Use the time window filter

You've added a time window filter for your *Beta* feature flag in the prerequisites. Next, you'll use the feature flag with the time window filter in your ASP.NET Core application.

Starting with version *3.0.0* of `Microsoft.FeatureManagement`, the following [built-in filters](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Dotnet#built-in-feature-filters) are registered automatically as part of the `AddFeatureManagement` call. You don't need to add `TimeWindowFilter` manually.

- `TimeWindowFilter`
- `ContextualTargetingFilter`
- `PercentageFilter`

```csharp
// This call will also register built-in filters to the container of services.
builder.Services.AddFeatureManagement();
```

## Time window filter in action

Relaunch the application. If your current time is earlier than the start time set for the time window filter, the **Beta** menu item won't appear on the toolbar. This is because the *Beta* feature flag is disabled by the time window filter.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of browser with Beta menu hidden.](./media/quickstarts/aspnet-core-feature-flag-local-before.png)

Once the start time has passed, refresh your browser a few times. You'll notice that the **Beta** menu item now appears. This is because the *Beta* feature flag is now enabled by the time window filter.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of browser with Beta menu.](./media/quickstarts/aspnet-core-feature-flag-local-after.png)

If recurrence is enabled when you set up the time window filter, the **Beta** menu will disappear once your current time passes the end time you set in the time window filter. However, the **Beta** menu will reappear according to your recurrence settings and continue this pattern until the recurrence expiration time, if set.
