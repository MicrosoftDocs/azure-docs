# Azure App Configuration best practices

This article discusses common patterns and best practices when you're using Azure App Configuration.

## Key groupings

App Configuration provides two options for organizing keys:

* Key prefixes
* Labels

You can use either one or both options to group your keys.

*Key prefixes* allow you to group related keys by using a common prefix in their names. Prefixes can include multiple segments separated by delimiters such as `/` or `:`, forming a hierarchical namespace. This approach is useful when storing configuration keys for multiple applications or microservices within a single App Configuration store.

It's important to remember that keys are directly referenced by your application code to retrieve their corresponding values. Therefore, keys should remain stable to avoid code changes. If needed, you can use the App Configuration provider to trim key prefixes at runtime.

*Labels* enable you to create variations of a key, such as different versions or environment-specific settings. By assigning labels, you can maintain multiple values for the same key. Your application can then retrieve different sets of key-values by specifying the appropriate label, allowing your key references in code to remain consistent.

## Key-value compositions

App Configuration treats each key stored within it as an independent entity. It doesn't infer relationships between keys or inherit values based on key hierarchy. However, you can aggregate multiple sets of keys effectively by using labels combined with configuration stacking in your application.

Consider an example where you have a configuration setting named *TestApp:MySetting*, whose value varies depending on the environment. You can create two keys with the same name, but assign different labels—one with no label (default) and another labeled *Development*. The unlabeled key holds the default value, while the labeled key contains the environment-specific value.

In your application code, you first load the default (unlabeled) key-values, then load the environment-specific key-values using the *Development* label. When loading the second set, any matching keys overwrite the previously loaded values. This approach allows you to "stack" multiple configuration sets, with the last loaded value taking precedence. [App Configuration providers](./configuration-provider-overview.md) across supported languages and platforms offer this stacking capability.

The following example demonstrates how to implement key-value composition in a .NET application:

```csharp
configBuilder.AddAzureAppConfiguration(options => {
    options.Connect(new Uri("<your-app-config-endpoint>"), new DefaultAzureCredential())
           // Load all keys that start with `TestApp:` and compose with two different labels
           .Select(keyFilter: "TestApp:*", labelFilter: LabelFilter.Null)
           .Select(keyFilter: "TestApp:*", labelFilter: "Development");
});
```

[Use labels to enable different configurations for different environments](./howto-labels-aspnet-core.md) provides a complete example.

## Configuration refresh

Azure App Configuration supports dynamic configuration refresh without requiring an application restart. The [App Configuration providers](./configuration-provider-overview.md) can monitor configuration changes using two approaches:

### Monitoring all selected keys

In this approach, the provider monitors all selected keys. If a change is detected in any of the selected key-values, the entire configuration is reloaded. This approach ensures immediate updates without requiring additional key modifications.

#### [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
configBuilder.AddAzureAppConfiguration(options =>
{
    options.Connect(new Uri("<your-app-config-endpoint>"), new DefaultAzureCredential())
           // Load all keys that start with `TestApp:` and have no label
           .Select(keyFilter: "TestApp:*", labelFilter: LabelFilter.Null)
           .ConfigureRefresh(refreshOptions =>
           {
               // Trigger full configuration refresh when any selected key changes.
               refreshOptions.RegisterAll();
           });
});
```

#### [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

```javascript
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    selectors: [{ keyFilter: "TestApp:*" }],
    refreshOptions: {
        enabled: true
    }
});
```

---

### Monitoring a sentinel key

Alternatively, you can monitor an individual key, often referred to as the *sentinel key*. This approach is useful when updating multiple key-values. By updating the sentinel key only after all other configuration changes are completed, you ensure your application reloads configuration just once, maintaining consistency.

#### [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
configBuilder.AddAzureAppConfiguration(options =>
{
    options.Connect(new Uri("<your-app-config-endpoint>"), new DefaultAzureCredential())
           // Load all keys that start with `TestApp:` and have no label
           .Select(keyFilter: "TestApp:*", labelFilter: LabelFilter.Null)
           .ConfigureRefresh(refreshOptions =>
           {
               // Trigger full configuration refresh only if the `SentinelKey` changes.
               refreshOptions.Register("SentinelKey", refreshAll: true);
           });
});
```

#### [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

```javascript
const appConfig = await load(endpoint, credential, {
    selectors: [{ keyFilter: "TestApp:*" }],
    refreshOptions: {
        enabled: true,
        watchedSettings: [{ key: "SentinelKey" }]
    }
});
```

Both approaches are available through App Configuration providers across supported languages and platforms.

To reduce the risk of configuration inconsistencies, use [configuration snapshots](./howto-create-snapshots.md) to ensure configuration integrity.

## References to external data

App Configuration is designed to store any configuration data that you would normally save in configuration files or environment variables. However, some types of data may be better suited to reside in other sources. For example, store secrets in Key Vault, files in Azure Storage, membership information in Microsoft Entra groups, or customer lists in a database.

You can still take advantage of App Configuration by saving a reference to external data in a key-value. You can [use content type](./concept-key-value.md#use-content-type) to differentiate each data source. When your application reads a reference, it loads the actual data from the referenced source, assuming it has the necessary permission to the source. If you change the location of your external data, you only need to update the reference in App Configuration instead of updating and redeploying your entire application.

The App Configuration [Key Vault reference](use-key-vault-references-dotnet-core.md) feature is an example in this case. It allows the secrets required for an application to be updated as necessary while the underlying secrets themselves remain in Key Vault.

## App Configuration bootstrap

To access an Azure App Configuration store, you can authenticate using either a connection string or Microsoft Entra ID. While connection strings are readily available in the Azure portal, they contain credential information and must be treated as secrets. If you choose this approach, store the connection string securely in Azure Key Vault and ensure your application authenticates to Key Vault to retrieve it.

A more secure and recommended approach is to use Microsoft Entra ID authentication. If your application is hosted in Azure—such as on Azure Kubernetes Service, App Service, or Azure Functions—you can use managed identities provided by Microsoft Entra ID. Managed identities eliminate the need to manage secrets explicitly. With this method, your application only requires the App Configuration endpoint URL, which can be safely embedded in your application code or configuration files.

For more information, see [Use managed identities to access App Configuration](./howto-integrate-azure-managed-service-identity.md).

## Azure Kubernetes Service access to App Configuration

The following options are available for workloads hosted in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to access Azure App Configuration. These options also apply to Kubernetes in general.

* **Add [Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider](./quickstart-azure-kubernetes-service.md) to your AKS cluster.** The Kubernetes provider runs as a pod in the cluster. It can construct ConfigMaps and Secrets from key-values and Key Vault references in your App Configuration store. The ConfigMap and Secret are consumable as environment variables or mounted files without requiring any modifications to your application code. If you have multiple applications running in the same AKS cluster, they can all access the generated ConfigMaps and Secrets, eliminating the need for individual requests to App Configuration. The Kubernetes provider also supports dynamic configuration updates. This is the recommended option if feasible for you.

* **Update your application to use Azure App Configuration provider libraries.** The provider libraries are available in many frameworks and languages, such as [ASP.NET](./quickstart-aspnet-core-app.md), [.NET](./quickstart-dotnet-core-app.md), [Java Spring](./quickstart-java-spring-app.md), [JavaScript/Node.js](./quickstart-javascript-provider.md), and [Python](./quickstart-python-provider.md). This approach gives you full access to App Configuration's functionalities, including dynamic configuration and feature management. You have granular control of what data to load and from which App Configuration store for each application.

* **[Integrate with Kubernetes deployment using Helm](./integrate-kubernetes-deployment-helm.md).** If you don't wish to update your application or add a new pod to your AKS cluster, you have the option of bringing data from App Configuration to your Kubernetes cluster by using Helm via deployment. This approach enables your application to continue accessing configuration from Kubernetes variables and Secrets. You can run Helm upgrade whenever you want your application to incorporate new configuration changes.

## App Service or Azure Functions access to App Configuration

Use the App Configuration provider or SDK libraries to access App Configuration directly in your application. This approach gives you full access to App Configuration's functionalities, including dynamic configuration and feature management. Your application running on App Service or Azure Functions can obtain access to your App Configuration store via any of the following methods:

* Enable managed identity on your App Service or Azure Functions and grant it access to your App Configuration store. For more information, see [Use managed identities to access App Configuration](howto-integrate-azure-managed-service-identity.md).
* Store the connection string to your App Configuration store in the *Application settings* of App Service or Azure Functions. For enhanced security, store the connection string in Key Vault and [reference it from App Service or Azure Functions](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references.md).

You can also make your App Configuration data accessible to your application as *Application settings* or environment variables. With this approach, you can avoid changing your application code.

* Add references to your App Configuration data in the *Application settings* of your App Service or Azure Functions. App Configuration offers tools to [export a collection of key-values as references](howto-import-export-data.md#export-data-to-azure-app-service) at once. For more information, see [Use App Configuration references for App Service and Azure Functions](../app-service/app-service-configuration-references.md).
* [Export your App Configuration data](howto-import-export-data.md#export-data-to-azure-app-service) to the *Application settings* of your App Service or Azure Functions without selecting the option of export-as-reference. Export your data again every time you make new changes in App Configuration if you like your application to pick up the change.

## Reduce requests made to App Configuration

Excessive requests to App Configuration can result in throttling or overage charges. To reduce the number of requests made:

* Increase the refresh interval, especially if your configuration values don't change frequently. Specify a new refresh interval using the [`SetRefreshInterval` method](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration.azureappconfiguration.azureappconfigurationrefreshoptions.setrefreshinterval).

* Watch a single *sentinel key*, rather than watching individual keys. Refresh all configuration only if the sentinel key changes. See [Use dynamic configuration in an ASP.NET Core app](enable-dynamic-configuration-aspnet-core.md) for an example.

* Use the [App Configuration Kubernetes Provider](./quickstart-azure-kubernetes-service.md) if you run multiple workloads in a Kubernetes cluster, each pulling data from App Configuration individually. The Kubernetes provider retrieves data from App Configuration and makes it available as Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets. This way, your workloads can access the data via ConfigMaps and Secrets without needing to pull data from App Configuration separately.

* [Enable geo-replication](./howto-geo-replication.md) of your App Configuration store and spread your requests across multiple replicas. For example, use a different replica from each geographic region for a globally deployed application. Each App Configuration replica has its separate request quota. This setup gives you a model for scalability and enhanced resiliency against transient and regional outages.

## Importing configuration data into App Configuration

App Configuration offers the option to bulk [import](./howto-import-export-data.md) your configuration settings from your current configuration files using either the Azure portal or CLI. You can also use the same options to export key-values from App Configuration, for example between related stores. If you adopt Configuration as Code and manage your configurations in GitHub or Azure DevOps, you can set up ongoing configuration file import using [GitHub Actions](./push-kv-github-action.md) or [Azure Pipeline Import Task](./azure-pipeline-import-task.md).

## Multi-region deployment in App Configuration

If your application is deployed in multiple regions, we recommend that you [enable geo-replication](./howto-geo-replication.md) of your App Configuration store. You can let your application primarily connect to the replica matching the region where instances of your application are deployed and allow them to fail over to replicas in other regions. This setup minimizes the latency between your application and App Configuration, spreads the load as each replica has separate throttling quotas, and enhances your application's resiliency against transient and regional outages. For more information, see [Resiliency and Disaster Recovery](./concept-disaster-recovery.md).

## Building applications with high resiliency

Applications often rely on configuration to start, making Azure App Configuration's high availability critical. For improved resiliency, applications should use App Configuration's reliability features and consider taking the following measures based on your specific requirements. 

* **Provision in regions with Azure availability zone support.** Availability zones allow applications to be resilient to data center outages. App Configuration offers zone redundancy for all customers without any extra charges. Creating your App Configuration store in regions with support for availability zones is recommended. You can find [a list of regions](./faq.yml#how-does-app-configuration-ensure-high-data-availability) where App Configuration has enabled availability zone support.
* **[Enable geo-replication](./howto-geo-replication.md) and allow your application to failover or distribute load among replicas.** This setup gives you a model for scalability and enhanced resiliency against transient failures and regional outages. For more information, see [Resiliency and Disaster Recovery](./concept-disaster-recovery.md).
* **Deploy configuration with [safe deployment practices](/azure/well-architected/operational-excellence/safe-deployments).** Incorrect or accidental configuration changes can frequently cause application downtime. You should avoid making configuration changes that impact the production directly from, for example, the Azure portal whenever possible. In safe deployment practices (SDP), you use a progressive exposure deployment model to minimize the potential blast radius of deployment-caused issues. If you adopt SDP, you can build and test a [configuration snapshot](./howto-create-snapshots.md) before deploying it to production. During the deployment, you can update instances of your application to progressively pick up the new snapshot. If issues are detected, you can roll back the change by redeploying the last-known-good (LKG) snapshot. The snapshot is immutable, guaranteeing consistency throughout all deployments. You can utilize snapshots along with dynamic configuration. Use a snapshot for your foundational configuration and dynamic configuration for emergency configuration overrides and feature flags.
* **Include configuration with your application.** If you want to ensure that your application always has access to a copy of the configuration, or if you prefer to avoid a runtime dependency on App Configuration altogether, you can pull the configuration from App Configuration during build or release time and include it with your application. To learn more, check out examples of integrating App Configuration with your [CI/CD pipeline](./integrate-ci-cd-pipeline.md) or [Kubernetes deployment](./integrate-kubernetes-deployment-helm.md).
* **Use App Configuration providers.** Applications play a critical part in achieving high resiliency because they can account for issues arising during their runtime, such as networking problems, and respond to failures more quickly. The App Configuration providers offer a range of built-in resiliency features, including automatic replica discovery, replica failover, startup retries with customizable timeouts, configuration caching, and adaptive strategies for reliable configuration refresh. It's highly recommended that you use App Configuration providers to benefit from these features. If that's not an option, you should consider implementing similar features in your custom solution to achieve the highest level of resiliency.

## Client applications in App Configuration 

When you use App Configuration in client applications, ensure that you consider two major factors. First, if you're using the connection string in a client application, you risk exposing the access key of your App Configuration store to the public. Second, the typical scale of a client application might cause excessive requests to your App Configuration store, which can result in overage charges or throttling. For more information about throttling, see the [FAQ](./faq.yml#are-there-any-limits-on-the-number-of-requests-made-to-app-configuration).

To address these concerns, we recommend that you use a proxy service between your client applications and your App Configuration store. The proxy service can securely authenticate with your App Configuration store without a security issue of leaking authentication information. You can build a proxy service by using one of the App Configuration provider libraries, so you can take advantage of built-in caching and refresh capabilities for optimizing the volume of requests sent to App Configuration. For more information about using App Configuration providers, see articles in Quickstarts and Tutorials. The proxy service serves the configuration from its cache to your client applications, and you avoid the two potential issues that are discussed in this section.

## Multitenant applications in App Configuration

A multitenant application is built on an architecture where a shared instance of your application serves multiple customers or tenants. For example, you may have an email service that offers your users separate accounts and customized experiences. Your application usually manages different configurations for each tenant. Here are some architectural considerations for [using App Configuration in a multitenant application](/azure/architecture/guide/multitenant/service/app-configuration).

## Configuration as Code

Configuration as code is a practice of managing configuration files under your source control system, for example, a git repository. It gives you benefits like traceability and approval process for any configuration changes. If you adopt configuration as code, App Configuration has tools to assist you in [managing your configuration data in files](./concept-config-file.md) and deploying them as part of your build, release, or CI/CD process. This way, your applications can access the latest data from your App Configuration store.

- For GitHub, you can import configuration files from your GitHub repository into your App Configuration store using [GitHub Actions](./push-kv-github-action.md)
- For Azure DevOps, you can include the [Azure App Configuration Import](azure-pipeline-import-task.md), an Azure pipeline task, in your build or release pipelines for data synchronization. 
- For others, you can import configuration files to App Configuration using Azure CLI as part of your CI/CD system. For more information, see [az appconfig kv import](scripts/cli-import.md).

This model allows you to include validation and testing steps before committing data to App Configuration. If you use multiple App Configuration stores, you can also push the configuration data to them incrementally or all at once.
