# Why Azure Applied AI Services?

Azure Applied AI Services reduce the time developers need to modernize business processes from months to days. These services help you accelerate time to value for specific business scenarios through a combination of Azure Cognitive Services, task-specific AI, and business logic.  ​


## Benefits: ​​
•	Modernize business process – Use task specific AI to solve your scenario
•	Accelerate development – Go live with your AI solutions quickly
•	Run responsibly anywhere – Enterprise-grade responsible and secure services on the cloud and to the edge 
 

## What is the difference between Applied AI Services and  Cognitive Services? 
 
Both Applied AI Services and Cognitive Services are designed to help developers create intelligent apps. Cognitive Services provides general purpose AI services that serve the core engine for Applied AI Services.  
 
Applied AI Services build on top of Cognitive Services with additional task-specific AI and business logic to optimize for specific use cases so that developers spend less time designing solutions or setting up pipelines.  
 
If there isn’t an Applied AI Service available to meet to meet a specific use case, developers can also build their own solutions from scratch, using Cognitive Services as building blocks.
