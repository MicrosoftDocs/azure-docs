# What are Azure Applied AI Services?

Azure Applied AI Services are high-level services focused on empowering developers to quickly unlock the value of data by applying AI into their key business scenarios.  Built on top of the AI APIs of Azure Cognitive Services, Azure Applied AI Services are optimized for critical tasks ranging from monitoring and diagnosing metric anomalies, mining knowledge from documents, enhancing the customer experience through transcription analysis, boosting literacy in the classroom, document understanding and more. Previously, companies would have to orchestrate multiple AI skills, add business logic, and create a UI to go from development to deployment for their scenario – all of which would consume time, expertise, and resources – these “scenario specific” services provide developers these benefits “out of the box”.​

## Azure Form Recognizer

Enabling organizations in all industries to consume information hidden within documents to increase productivity, automate business processes and generate knowledge and insights.  Azure Form Recognizer is a service that lets you build automated data processing software using machine learning technology. Identify and extract text, key/value pairs, selection marks, tables, and structure from your documents. The service outputs structured data that includes the relationships in the original file, bounding boxes, confidence and more. You quickly get accurate results that are tailored to your specific content without heavy manual intervention or extensive data science expertise. Use Form Recognizer to automate data entry in your applications and enrich your documents' search capabilities.  Azure Form Recognizer is built using OCR, Text Analytics and Custom Text from Azure Cognitive Services.

Form Recognizer is composed of custom document processing models, prebuilt models for invoices, receipts, IDs and business cards, and the layout model.
