# Get started with Form Recognizer

::: moniker range="form-recog-3.0.0"
[!INCLUDE [applies to v3.0](../includes/applies-to-v3-0.md)]

::: moniker range="form-recog-3.0.0"

Get started with the latest version of Azure Form Recognizer. Azure Form Recognizer is a cloud-based Azure Applied AI Service that uses machine learning to extract key-value pairs, text, tables and key data from your documents. You can easily integrate Form Recognizer models into your workflows and applications by using an SDK in the programming language of your choice or calling the REST API.  For this quickstart, we recommend that you use the free service while you're learning the technology. Remember that the number of free pages is limited to 500 per month.

To learn more about Form Recognizer features and development options, visit our [Overview](../overview.md) page.

That's it, congratulations! In this quickstart, you used Form Recognizer models to analyze various forms in different ways.

## Next steps

* For an enhanced experience and advanced model quality, try the [Form Recognizer v3.0 Studio ](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio).

* The v3.0 Studio supports any model trained with v2.1 labeled data.

* You can refer to the API migration guide for detailed information about migrating from v2.1 to v3.0.
* *See* our [**REST API**](get-started-sdks-rest-api.md?view=form-recog-3.0.0&preserve-view=true) or [**C#**](get-started-sdks-rest-api.md?view=form-recog-3.0.0&preserve-view=true), [**Java**](get-started-sdks-rest-api.md?view=form-recog-3.0.0&preserve-view=true), [**JavaScript**](get-started-sdks-rest-api.md?view=form-recog-3.0.0&preserve-view=true), or [**Python**](get-started-sdks-rest-api.md?view=form-recog-3.0.0&preserve-view=true) SDK quickstarts to get started with the v3.0 version.
