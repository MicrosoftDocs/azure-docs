# Get started: Form Recognizer Python SDK v3.0 | Preview

>[!NOTE]
> Form Recognizer v3.0 is currently in public preview. Some features may not be supported or have limited capabilities. 

[Reference documentation](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-ai-formrecognizer/latest/azure.ai.formrecognizer.html) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/azure/ai/formrecognizer) | [Package (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-formrecognizer/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/samples)

 Get started with Azure Form Recognizer using the Python programming language. Azure Form Recognizer is a cloud-based Azure Applied AI Service that uses machine learning to extract and analyze form fields, text, and tables from your documents. You can easily call Form Recognizer models by integrating our client library SDks into your workflows and applications. We recommend that you use the free service when you're learning the technology. Remember that the number of free pages is limited to 500 per month.

To learn more about Form Recognizer features and development options, visit our [Overview](../overview.md#form-recognizer-features-and-development-options) page.

In this quickstart you'll use following features to analyze and extract data and values from forms and documents:

* [🆕 **General document**](#general-document-model)—Analyze and extract text, tables, structure, key-value pairs, and named entities.

* [**Layout**](#layout-model)—Analyze and extract tables, lines, words, and selection marks like radio buttons and check boxes in forms documents, without the need to train a model.

* [**Prebuilt Invoice**](#prebuilt-model)—Analyze and extract common fields from specific document types using a pre-trained model.

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)

  * Your Python installation should include [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). You can check if you have pip installed by running `pip --version` on the command line. Get pip by installing the latest version of Python.

* The latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your preferred IDE. For more information, *see* [Getting Started with Python in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)

* A Cognitive Services or Form Recognizer resource. Once you have your Azure subscription, create a [single-service](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) or [multi-service](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne) Form Recognizer resource in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

> [!TIP]
> Create a Cognitive Services resource if you plan to access multiple cognitive services under a single endpoint/key. For Form Recognizer access only, create a Form Recognizer resource. Please note that you'lll need a single-service resource if you intend to use [Azure Active Directory authentication](../../../active-directory/authentication/overview-authentication.md).

* After your resource deploys, select **Go to resource**. You need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Form Recognizer API. You will paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart:

  :::image type="content" source="../media/containers/keys-and-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot: keys and endpoint location in the Azure portal.":::

## Set up

Open a terminal window in your local environment and install the Azure Form Recognizer client library for Python with pip:

```console
pip install azure-ai-formrecognizer==3.2.0b2

```

### Create a new Python application

Create a new Python file called **form_recognizer_quickstart.py** in your preferred editor or IDE. Then import the following libraries:

```python
import os
from azure.core.exceptions import ResourceNotFoundError
from azure.ai.formrecognizer import DocumentAnalysisClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
```

### Create variables for your Azure resource API endpoint and key

```python
endpoint = "YOUR_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT"
key = "YOUR_FORM_RECOGNIZER_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY"
```

At this point, your Python application should contain the following lines of code:

```python
import os
from azure.core.exceptions import ResourceNotFoundError
from azure.ai.formrecognizer import DocumentAnalysisClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

endpoint = "YOUR_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT"
key = "YOUR_FORM_RECOGNIZER_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY"

```

> [!TIP]
> If you would like to try more than one code sample:
>
> * Select one of the sample code blocks below to copy and paste into your application.
> * [**Run your application**](#run-your-application).
> * Comment out that sample code block but keep the set-up code and library directives.
> * Select another sample code block to copy and paste into your application.
> * [**Run your application**](#run-your-application).
> * You can continue to comment out, copy/paste, and run the sample blocks of code.

### Select a code sample to copy and paste into your application:

* [**General document**](#general-document-model)

* [**Layout**](#layout-model)

* [**Prebuilt Invoice**](#prebuilt-model)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, use secure methods to store and access your credentials. For more information, *see* Cognitive Services [security](../../../cognitive-services/cognitive-services-security.md).

## General document model

Extract text, tables, structure, key-value pairs, and named entities from documents.

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * For this example, you'll need a **form document file from a URL**. You can use our [sample form document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/master/curl/form-recognizer/sample-layout.pdf) for this quickstart.
> * To analyze a given file at a URL, you'll use the `begin_analyze_document_from_url` method and pass in `prebuilt-document` as the model Id. The returned value is a `result` object containing data about the submitted document.
> * We've added the file URL value to the `docUrl` variable in the `analyze_general_documents` function.
> * For simplicity, all the entity fields that the service returns are not shown here. To see the list of all supported fields and corresponding types, see our [General document](../concept-general-document.md#named-entity-recognition-ner-categories) concept page.

###### Add the following code to your general document application on a line below the `key` variable

    print("----------------------------------------")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    analyze_layout()

```

## Prebuilt model

Extract and analyze data from common document types using a pre-trained model.

### Choose a prebuilt model ID

You are not limited to invoices—there are several prebuilt models to choose from, each of which has its own set of supported fields. The model to use for the analyze operation depends on the type of document to be analyzed. Here are the model IDs for the prebuilt models currently supported by the Form Recognizer service:

* [**prebuilt-invoice**](../concept-invoice.md): extracts text, selection marks, tables, key-value pairs, and key information from invoices.
* [**prebuilt-receipt**](../concept-receipt.md): extracts text and key information from receipts.
* [**prebuilt-idDocument**](../concept-id-document.md): extracts text and key information from driver licenses and international passports.
* [**prebuilt-businessCard**](../concept-business-card.md): extracts text and key information from business cards.

#### Try the prebuilt invoice model

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * We wll analyze an invoice using the prebuilt-invoice model. You can use our [sample invoice document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/master/curl/form-recognizer/sample-invoice.pdf) for this quickstart.
> * We've added the file URL value to the `invoiceUrl` variable at the top of the file.
> * To analyze a given file at a URI, you'll use the `beginAnalyzeDocuments` method and pass `PrebuiltModels.Invoice` as the model Id. The returned value is a `result` object containing data about the submitted document.
> * For simplicity, all the key-value pairs that the service returns are not shown here. To see the list of all supported fields and corresponding types, see our [Invoice](../concept-invoice.md#field-extraction) concept page.

#### Add the following code to your prebuilt invoice application below the `key` variable

```python

def format_bounding_region(bounding_regions):
    if not bounding_regions:
        return "N/A"
    return ", ".join("Page #{}: {}".format(region.page_number, format_bounding_box(region.bounding_box)) for region in bounding_regions)
