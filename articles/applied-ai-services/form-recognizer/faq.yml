      - question: |
           What is the accuracy score and how is it calculated?
        answer: |
           The output of a `build` (v3.0) or `train` (v2.1) custom model operation includes the estimated accuracy score. This score represents the model's ability to accurately predict the labeled value on a visually similar document.

           Accuracy is measured within a percentage value range between 0% (low) and 100% (high).

           See [Interpret and improve accuracy and confidence scores](concept-accuracy-confidence.md#accuracy-scores)

      - question: |
          How can I improve accuracy scores?
        answer: |
          The accuracy of a model is influenced by variances in the visual structure of your documents.

          - Ensure that all variations of a document are included in the training dataset. Variations include different formats, for example, digital versus scanned PDFs.

          - Separate visually distinct document types and train different models.

          - Make sure that you don't have extraneous labels.

          - For signature and region labeling, don't include the surrounding text.

          See [[Interpret and improve accuracy and confidence scores](concept-accuracy-confidence.md#ensure-high-model-accuracy)]

      - question: |
           What is the confidence score and how is it calculated?
        answer: |

           A confidence score indicates probability by measuring the degree of statistical certainty that the extracted result has been detected correctly.

           The confidence value range is a percentage between 0% (low) and 100% (high).

           It's best to target a score of 80% or higher. For more sensitive cases, like financial or medical records, a score of close to 100% is recommended and you may also require human review.

           See [Interpret and improve accuracy and confidence scores](concept-accuracy-confidence.md#confidence-scores)

      - question: |
          How can I improve confidence scores?
        answer: |

         Following an analysis operation, review the JSON output. Examine the `confidence` values for each key/value result under the `pageResults` node. You should also look at the confidence score in the `readResults` node, which corresponds to the text-read operation. The confidence of the read results doesn’t affect the confidence of the key/value extraction results, so you should check both.

            - If the confidence score for the `readResults` object is low, improve the quality of your input documents.

            - If the confidence score for the `pageResults` object is low, ensure that the documents being analyzed are of the same type.

            - Consider incorporating human review into your workflows.

            - Use forms with different values in each field.

            - For custom models, use a larger set of training documents. Tagging more documents teaches your model to recognize fields with greater accuracy.

            See [Interpret and improve accuracy and confidence scores](concept-accuracy-confidence.md#confidence-scores)

      - question: |
          What is a bounding box?
        answer: |

          A bounding box is an abstract rectangle that surrounds text elements on a document or form.  It's used as a reference point for object detection.

          - The bounding box specifies position using an x and y coordinate plane presented in an array of four numerical pairs. Each pair represents a corner of the box in the following order: top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left.

          - For an image, coordinates are given in pixels.

          - For a PDF, coordinates are given in inches.

          - You can use the bounding box returned by Form Recognizer to identify the location of recognized entities.

      - question: |
            Which file formats does Form Recognizer support? Are there size limitations for input documents?
        answer:  |

            - Form Recognizer extracts data from form and document images and returns a structured output from JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and PDF (text-embedded or scanned) file formats.
            - For PDF and TIFF, up to 2000 pages can be processed (with a free tier subscription, only the first two pages are processed).
            - Your file size must be less than 50 MB.
            - Image dimensions must be between 50 x 50 pixels and 10000 x 10,000 pixels.
            - PDF dimensions can be a maximum of 17 x 17 inches (corresponding to Legal or A3 paper size) or smaller.
            - The total allowable size of training data is 500 pages or less.

            To ensure the best results, see [input requirements](concept-model-overview.md#input-requirements).

      - question: |
            Both Form Recognizer Studio and the FOTT sample labeling tool are available. Which one should I use?
        answer:  |
           Most of time [Form Recognizer Studio]() is recommended since it can reduce your time for configuring Form Recognizer resource and storage services.

           Consider using FOTT (Form OCR Testing Tool) for the following scenarios:

              - Your data must remain within a single machine. Use the [FOTT sample labeling tool]() and [Form Recognizer container]().

              - Your project is highly dependent on [Form Recognizer v2.1](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-1/operations/AnalyzeWithCustomForm) and you intend to continue using the v2.1 APIs.

  - name: Service limits and pricing
    questions:
      - question: |
         How does Azure calculate the price for using Form Recognizer services?
        answer: |
         Form Recognizer billing is  calculated monthly based on the model type and number of pages analyzed:

          - When you submit a document for analysis, all pages are analyzed unless you specify a page range with the `pages` parameter in your request.

          - Training a custom model is always free with Form Recognizer. You’re only charged when a model is used to analyze a document.

          - Container pricing is the same as cloud service pricing.

          - Form Recognizer offers a free tier (F0) that enables you to test all the Form Recognizer features.

          - Form Recognizer has a commitment-based pricing model for large workloads.

         Learn more about [Azure Form Recognizer pricing options](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/form-recognizer/#pricing).

      - question: |
          What are best practices to mitigate throttling?
        answer: |
          Form Recognizer uses autoscaling to provide the required computational resources on-demand, while keeping customer costs low. To mitigate throttling during autoscaling, we recommend the following approach:

          - Implement retry logic in your application.

          - If you find that you’re being throttled on the number of POST requests, consider adding a delay between the requests.

          - Increase the workload gradually. Avoid sharp changes.

          Learn more about Form Recognizer [service quotas and limits](service-limits.md)

      - question: |
         How can I reduce request latency for my API calls?
        answer: |
          - Latency is defined as the amount of time it takes for an API server to handle and process an incoming request and deliver the outgoing response to the client. Occasional variability in latency and performance is inherent in any micro-service-based, stateless, asynchronous service that processes images and large documents at scale. While we're continuously scaling up the hardware and capacity and scaling capabilities, you may still see latency issues at run time.

          - Try applying longer timeouts to account for random latency spikes. A timeout of 1 to 2 minutes should be sufficient to catch all responses. If not, try the call again after a short delay.

          - Consider using [Proximity placement groups](../../virtual-machines/co-location.md) for workloads where low latency is a requirement.
          
          - Enable a backup resource in another region to mitigate the latency impact.


  - name: Custom models
    questions:
      - question: |
          How do I assemble the best training data?
        answer: |
          When you use the Form Recognizer custom model, you provide your own training data. Here are a few tips to help train your models effectively:

            - Use text-based instead of image-based PDFs when possible. One way to identify an image-based PDF is to try selecting specific text in the document. If you can only select the entire image of the text, the document is image-based, not text-based.

            - Organize your training documents by using a subfolder for each format (JPG, PNG, BMP, PDF, or TIFF).

            - Use forms that have all of the available fields completed.

            - Use forms with differing values in each field.

            - If your images are low quality, use a larger data set (more than five training documents).

            Learn more about [building a training data set](build-training-data-set.md)

      - question: |
          What are best practices for training a highly accurate custom model?
        answer: |
         The level of accuracy for your model is dependent on the quality of your training materials:

          - Determine if you need to use a single model or multiple models composed into a single model.

          - Since model accuracy can decrease when you have different formats analyzed with a single model, plan on segmenting your dataset into folders, where each folder is a unique template. Train one model per folder and compose the resulting models into a single endpoint.

          - Custom forms rely on a consistent visual template. If your form has variations with formats and page breaks, consider segmenting your dataset to train multiple models.

          - Ensure you have a balanced dataset by accounting for formats, document types, and structure.

          Learn more about [composed models](concept-custom.md).

      - question: |
          Can I retrain a custom model?
        answer: |

          Form Recognizer doesn’t have an explicit retrain operation. Each train operation generates a new model.

          If you find that your model needs retraining, add more samples to your training data set and train a new model.

      - question: |
          How many custom models can I compose into a single custom model?
        answer: |
           With the [Model Compose](compose-custom-models.md#create-a-composed-model) operation, you can assign up to 100 models to a single model ID.

           - When you make the Analyze request with a composed model ID, Form Recognizer first classifies the form you submitted, chooses the best matching model, and then returns the results.

           - Model Compose is currently available only for custom models trained with labels.

           Learn more about [composed models](concept-custom.md).

      - question: |
          How do I refine a model beyond the initial training?
        answer: |
         Each train operation generates a new model.

          - Start by creating a dataset for your new template.

          - Label and train a new model.

          - Validate that the new model performs well for your specific document types.

          - Compose your new model with the existing model into a single endpoint. Form Recognizer can then determine the best model for each document to be analyzed.

          Learn more about [composed models](concept-custom.md).

      - question: |
            I'm building a custom model, what does the signature-detection label return?
        answer: |
            [Signature detection](quickstarts/try-v3-form-recognizer-studio.md#signature-detection) looks for the presence of a signature, not the identity of the person signing the document.

            If the model returns "unsigned" for signature detection, the model didn’t find a signature in the defined field.

      - question: |
             What should I consider and what are best practices for extracting tables from documents?
        answer: |
           You can start with the Form Recognizer [layout model](concept-layout.md) to extract texts, tables, selection marks, and structure information from documents and images. You can also consider the following factors:

             - Is the data that you wish to extract presented as a table and is the table structure meaningful?

             - If the data isn’t in a table format, can the data fit in a two-dimensional grid?

             - Do your tables span across multiple pages? If so, to avoid having to label all of the pages, split the PDF into pages prior to sending it to Form Recognizer. Following the analysis, post-process the pages to a single table.

             - If you’re creating custom models, refer to [Labeling as tables](quickstarts/try-v3-form-recognizer-studio.md#labeling-as-tables). Dynamic tables have a variable number of rows for each given column. Fixed tables have a constant number of rows for each given column.

  - name: Storage account
    questions:
      - question: |
         I was able to access my storage account a few days ago. Why am I now having trouble reconnecting?
        answer:  |

          When you create a shared access signature (SAS), the default duration is 48 hours. After 48 hours, you'll need to create a new token.

          Consider setting a longer duration period for the time you'll be using your storage account with Form Recognizer.

      - question: |
           If my storage account is behind a VNet or firewall, how do I give Form Recognizer access to my storage account data?
        answer: |
            If you have an Azure storage account protected by a Virtual Network (VNet) or firewall, Form Recognizer can’t directly access your storage account. However, Private Azure storage account access and authentication are supported by [managed identities for Azure resources](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md). Once a managed identity is enabled, the Form Recognizer service can access your storage account using an assigned managed identity credential.

            If you intend to analyze your private storage account data with FOTT, the tool must be deployed behind the VNet or firewall.

  - name: Containers
    questions:
      - question: |
          Do I need an internet connection to use Form Recognizer containers?
        answer: |

          Yes, Form Recognizer containers require internet connectivity to send [billing information](containers/form-recognizer-container-install-run.md?tabs=layout#billing) to Azure.
