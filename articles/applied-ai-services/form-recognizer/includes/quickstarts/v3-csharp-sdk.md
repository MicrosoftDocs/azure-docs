Azure Cognitive Services Form Recognizer is a cloud service that uses machine learning to extract and analyze from your documents. You can easily call Form Recognizer models by integrating our client library SDks into your workflows and applications.

### Form Recognizer models

The C# SDK supports the following models and capabilities:

* 🆕General document—Analyze and extract text, tables, structure, key-value pairs and named entities.|
* Layout—Analyze and extract tables, lines, words, and selection marks like radio buttons and check boxes in forms documents, without the need to train a model.
* Custom—Analyze and extract form fields and other content from your custom forms, using models you trained with your own form types.
* Invoices—Analyze and extract common fields from invoices, using a pre-trained invoice model.
* Receipts—Analyze and extract common fields from receipts, using a pre-trained receipt model.
* ID documents—Analyze and extract common fields from ID documents like passports or driver's licenses, using a pre-trained ID documents model.
* Business Cards—Analyze and extract common fields from business cards, using a pre-trained business cards model.

In this quickstart you'll use following features to analyze and extract data and values from forms and documents:

* [**General document**](#try-it-general-document-model)

* [**Layout**](#try-it-layout-model)

* [**Prebuilt Invoice**](#try-it-prebuilt-invoice-model)

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)

* The current version of [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

* A Cognitive Services or Form Recognizer resource. Once you have your Azure subscription, create a [single-service](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) or [multi-service](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne) Form Recognizer resource in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

> [!TIP] 
> Create a Cognitive Services resource if you plan to access multiple cognitive services under a single endpoint/key. For Form Recognizer access only, create a Form Recognizer resource. Please note that you'lll need a single-service resource if you intend to use [Azure Active Directory authentication](#create-formrecognizerclient-with-azure-active-directory-credential).

* After your resource deploys, click **Go to resource**. You need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Form Recognizer API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart:

## Set up

### [Option 1: .NET Command-line interface (CLI)](#tab/cli)

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app with the name `formrecognizer-quickstart`. This command creates a simple "Hello World" C# project with a single source file: *Program.cs*.</br></br>

```console
dotnet new console -n formrecognizer-quickstart
```

Open a command line and switch to the directory that contains your project file. Build the application with:

```console
dotnet build
```

The build output should contain no warnings or errors.

```console
...
Build succeeded.
 0 Warning(s)
 0 Error(s)
...
```

### Create DocumentAnalysisClient with AzureKeyCredential

* In order to interact with the Form Recognizer service, you'll need to create an instance of the `DocumentAnalysisClient` class. Once you have the value for the API key, create an `AzureKeyCredential`. With the endpoint and key credential, you can create the DocumentAnalysisClient:

You can set `endpoint` and `apiKey` based on an environment variable, a configuration setting, or any way that works for your application.

```

## Try the General Document model

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * For this example, you'll need a **form document file at a URI**. You can use our [sample form document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/master/curl/form-recognizer/sample-layout.pdf) for this quickstart.
> * To analyze a given file at a URI, you'll use the `StartAnalyzeDocumentFromUri` method. The returned value is an `AnalyzeResult` object containing data about the submitted document.



## Try the Layout model

Extract text, selection marks, text styles, and table structures, along with their bounding region coordinates from documents.
