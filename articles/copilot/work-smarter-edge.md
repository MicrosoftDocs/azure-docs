# Work smarter with your Azure Stack HCI clusters using Microsoft Copilot in Azure

Microsoft Copilot in Azure (preview) can help you identify problems and get information about your [Azure Stack HCI](/azure-stack/hci/overview) clusters.

When you ask Microsoft Copilot in Azure for information about the state of your hybrid infrastructure, it automatically pulls context when possible, based on the current conversation or on the page you're viewing in the Azure portal. If the context of a query isn't clear, you'll be prompted to clarify what you're looking for.

## Sample prompts

Here are a few examples of the kinds of prompts you can use to work with your Azure Stack HCI clusters. Modify these prompts based on your real-life scenarios, or try additional prompts to get different types of information.

- "Summarize my HCI clusters"
- "Tell me more about the alerts"
- "Find any anomalies in my HCI clusters"
- "Find any anomalies from the most recent alert"

## Examples

In this example, Microsoft Copilot in Azure responds to the prompt "**summarize my HCI clusters**" with details about the number of clusters, their status, and any alerts that affect them.
