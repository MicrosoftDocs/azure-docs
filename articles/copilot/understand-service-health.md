# Understand service health events and status using Microsoft Copilot for Azure (preview)

You can ask Microsoft Copilot for Azure (preview) questions to get information from [Azure Service Health](/azure/service-health/overview). This provides a quick way to find out if there are any service health events impacting your Azure subscriptions. You can also get more information about a known service health event.

[!INCLUDE [scenario-note](includes/scenario-note.md)]

## Sample prompts

Here are a few examples of the kinds of prompts you can use to get service health information. Modify these prompts based on your real-life scenarios, or try additional prompts about specific service health events.

- "Am I impacted by any service health events?"
- "Is there any outage impacting me?"
- "Can you tell me more about this tracking ID {0}?"
- "Is the event with tracking ID {0} still active?"
- "What is the status of the event with tracking ID {0}"

## Examples

You can ask "Is there any Azure outage ongoing?" In this example, no outages or service health issues are found. If there are service health issues impacting your account, you can ask further questions to get more information.
