# Try Playwright Workspaces for free

Playwright Workspaces is a fully managed service for end-to-end testing built on top of Playwright. With the free trial, you can try Playwright Workspaces for free for 30 days and 100 test minutes. In this article, you learn about the limits of the free trial, how to get started, and how to track your free trial usage.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
* Your Azure account needs the [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner), [Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor), or one of the [classic administrator roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles#classic-subscription-administrator-roles).

## Limits to free trial

The following table lists the limits for the Playwright Workspaces free trial.

| Resource | Limit |
|-|-|
| Duration of trial | 30 days |
| Total test minutes¹ | 100 minutes |
| Number of workspaces<sup>2,3</sup> | 1 |

¹ If your usage exceeds the free test minute limit, only the overage counts toward the pay-as-you-go billing model. See [Playwright Workspaces pricing](https://aka.ms/pww/pricing)

² These limits only apply to the *first* workspace you create in your Azure subscription. Any subsequent workspaces you create in the subscription automatically uses the pay-as-you-go billing model.

³ If you delete the free trial workspace, you can't create a new free trial workspace anymore.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you exceed any of these limits, the workspace is automatically converted to the pay-as-you-go billing model. Learn more about the [Playwright Workspaces pricing](https://aka.ms/pww/pricing).
