# What is Playwright Workspaces?

Playwright Workspaces is a fully managed service for end-to-end web testing, built on top of [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). With Playwright Workspaces, you can significantly speed up test execution by running tests in parallel using managed cloud-based browsers. The service takes care of the underlying infrastructure and complexity, allowing you to validate your web app across major browsers on both Linux and Windows—so you can ship features faster and with greater confidence.

Get started with [Quickstart: run your Playwright tests at scale with Playwright Workspaces](./quickstart-run-end-to-end-tests.md).

To learn more about how to create end-to-end tests with the Playwright test framework, visit the [Getting started documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) on the Playwright website.

## Accelerate tests with parallel remote browsers

As your application becomes more complex, your test suite increases in size. The time to complete your test suite also grows accordingly. Use parallel remote browsers to shorten the overall test suite completion time.

- Distribute your tests across many parallel browsers, hosted on cloud infrastructure.

- Scale your tests beyond the processing power of your developer workstation, local infrastructure, or CI agent machines.

- Consistent regional performance by running your tests on browsers in an Azure region that's closest to your client machine.

Learn more about how you can [configure for optimal performance](./concept-determine-optimal-configuration.md).

## Test consistently across multiple operating systems and browsers

Modern web apps need to work flawlessly across numerous browsers, operating systems, and devices.

- Run tests simultaneously across all modern browsers on Windows, Linux, and mobile emulation of Google Chrome for Android and Mobile Safari.

- Using service-managed browsers ensures consistent and reliable results for both functional and visual regression testing, whether tests are run from your team's developer workstations or CI pipeline.

- Playwright Workspaces supports all [browsers supported by Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/release-notes).

## Endpoint testing

Use cloud-hosted remote browsers to test web applications regardless of where they're hosted, without having to allow inbound connections on your firewall.

- Test publicly and privately hosted applications.

- During the development phase, [run tests against a localhost development server](./how-to-test-local-applications.md).

## Playwright support

Playwright Workspaces is built on top of the Playwright framework.

- Support for multiple versions of Playwright with each new Playwright release.

- Integrate your existing Playwright test suite without changing your test code.

- Use the [Playwright Test Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright) for a rich editor experience.

- Continuous end-to-end testing by using the Playwright CLI to [integrate with continuous integration (CI) tools](./quickstart-automate-end-to-end-testing.md).

## How it works

Playwright Workspaces instantiates cloud-hosted browsers across different operating systems. Playwright executes tests on the client machine—either a developer workstation or a CI agent—and remotely control cloud-hosted browsers via the Playwright Workspaces service. The test code remains on the client machine throughout the test run, while browser interactions are performed in the cloud.

After a test run completes, the test results, trace files, and other test run files are available on the client machine.

You don’t need to modify your existing test code to run it with Playwright Workspaces. Simply install the Playwright Workspaces package and specify your workspace endpoint.

## In-region data residency & data at rest

Playwright Workspaces doesn't store or process customer data outside the region you deploy the workspace in. When you use the regional affinity feature, the metadata is transferred from the cloud hosted browser region to the workspace region in a secure and compliant manner.

Playwright Workspaces automatically encrypts all data stored in your workspace with keys managed by Microsoft (service-managed keys). For example, this data includes workspace details, Playwright test run metadata like test start and end time, test minutes, who ran the test, and test results which are published to the service.
