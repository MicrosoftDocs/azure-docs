# Migrate from Google Cloud

Migrating a workload from Google Cloud to Azure typically follows the following steps:

1. Assessing your current workload in Google Cloud
1. Designing a similar solution in Azure
1. Preparing the workload and Azure for migration
1. Performing the migration
1. Evaluating success

These general steps are applicable for custom applications as well as for commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions. Once on Azure, you can then further optimize your workload with services and features that will benefit your workload and its users.

Microsoft Azure has a collection of articles that can help guide you with some of these steps to have a successful migration.

## Migration guidance

ou'll need to make sure you've established a strong foundation on Azure. Follow the Azure adoption guidance in the [Cloud Adoption Framework](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/get-started/) to build a solid platform for any workloads you'll be migrating.

If you're new to designing workloads in Azure, be sure to start with the basics by reviewing the content in the [Azure for Google Cloud professionals guide](/azure/architecture/gcp-professional/). This guide will help you map technology that you are familar with to similar services available on Azure.

For a quick start on migration training, use the [Introduction to migrating from Google Cloud to Microsoft Azure](/training/modules/introduction-to-migrating-gcp-to-azure/) module on Microsoft Learn.

### Service guides

While migration is typically addressed at the workload level, it's important that architects, software engineers, and data professionals have an understanding of service level migration concerns as well. Use these service level guides to help drive assessment, prepration, and migration steps.
