# Migrate storage from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Azure

The articles listed on this page outline scenarios for how to migrate storage services from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Azure storage services. 

Storage services are foundational components of most enterprise workloads. The migration process moves these services while ensuring that they retain the same capabilities. Examples of storage services include file storage, blob storage, data lakes, virtual machine images, and file shares that store critical data for various purposes. Whether it's to support custom applications, AI/ML training processes, business intelligence operations, or commercial off-the-shelf solutions, your storage infrastructure requires careful migration planning.

## Component comparison

Start the migration process by comparing the AWS storage service that's used in the workload with the closest Azure counterpart. The goal is to identify the most suitable Azure services for your workload. For more information, see [Comparing AWS and Azure storage services](/azure/architecture/aws-professional/storage).

> [!NOTE]
> This comparison isn't an exact representation of the functionality that these services provide in your workload.
