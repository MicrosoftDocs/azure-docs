# Migrate databases and data from Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Many workloads contain databases, such as transactional databases, data warehouses, caches, serach indexes, or specialized NoSQL stores. These databases contain the data necessary for your custom applications, AI/ML context/training, business intelligence operations, or commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions. Microsoft Azure has guidance to help you migrate a workload that involve the componets that hold and secure your data.

## Azure service awareness

If you haven't yet selected your application platform in Azure, review the [Azure for AWS professionals guide](/azure/architecture/aws-professional/), which has a service mapping available for databases and data. This is a list that maps similar services between the two cloud providers.

See, the [Azure database services map](/azure/architecture/aws-professional/databases) and the [Azure data and AI services map](/azure/architecture/aws-professional/data-ai).

## Scenarios and component guides

Microsoft publishes guidance for select services to help architects, developers, and database administrators plan their migration efforts. Use these guides, combined with guidance available for your other components, to assess, plan, and perform your migration.

### TODO: Organize and present key migration content available for this technology area

## Related workload components

Your workload contains other components as well that will need to migrate with your compute. Microsoft has similar guidance for:

- [Compute](./migrate-compute-from-aws.md)
- [Storage](./migrate-storage-from-aws.md)
- Identity and access management (IAM)
- Networking
- Messaging and integration
- Security

Use the table of contents to explore other topics related to your workload's architecture.
