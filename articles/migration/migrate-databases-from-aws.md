# Migrate databases from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Azure

Data migration is critical when you move from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Microsoft Azure. You need to transition your databases and make sure that they work similarly in the new environment. The scope of this migration includes various database types, such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, and data warehouses. For example, you might have a workload that uses an Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for PostgreSQL database that you need to migrate to Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

## Component comparison

Start the migration process by comparing the Amazon Web Services (AWS) database and services that your workload uses to their closest Azure counterparts. The goal is to identify the most suitable Azure services for your workload.

## Migration scenarios

Use the following scenarios as examples for your migration process.
