# Guidance on Customizing Preconfigured Solutions
The preconfigured solutions provided with the Azure IoT Suite enable customers to see the services within the suite working together to deliver an end-to-end canonical solution.  From this starting point, there are a variety of places where customization and extension may occur to customize the solution for specific scenarios.  The following sections outline these common customization points.

## Finding the source code

## Changing the preconfigured rules

## Adding your own rules (working with stream Analytics)

## Creating your own simulated device

## Building and using your own (physical) device

## Customizing your dashboard
