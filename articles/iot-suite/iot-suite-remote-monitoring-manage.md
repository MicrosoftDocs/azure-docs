# Manage and configure your devices

Contoso has ordered new machinery to expand one of their facilities to increase output. While you wait for the new machinery to be delivered, you want to run some tests with a simulation to verify the behavior of your solution.

This tutorial shows you how to manage the devices connected to your solution from the solution dashboard.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

>[!div class="checklist"]
> * Provision a simulated device.
> * Test the simulated device.
> * Call device methods from the dashboard.
> * Provision a physical device.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need a deployed instance of the remote monitoring solution in your Azure subscription.

If you haven't deployed the remote monitoring solution yet, you should complete the [Deploy the remote monitoring preconfigured solution](iot-suite-remote-monitoring-deploy.md) tutorial.

## Provision a simulated device

## Test the simulated device

## Call device methods from the dashboard

## Provision a physical device

## Next steps

This tutorial showed you how to:

<!-- Repeat task list from intro -->
>[!div class="checklist"]
> * Provision a simulated device.
> * Test the simulated device.
> * Call device methods from the dashboard.
> * Provision a physical device.

Now that you have learned how to manage your devices, the suggested next steps are to learn how to:

* [Troubleshoot and remediate device issues](./iot-suite-remote-monitoring-maintain.md).
* [Test your solution with simulated devices](iot-suite-remote-monitoring-test.md).
