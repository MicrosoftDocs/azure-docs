# Overview of Azure IoT Suite
Microsoft provides a breadth of capabilities with the Azure IoT services.  These services deliver enterprise grade abilities to collect data from devices, analyze data streams in-motion, store and query large data sets, visual both real-time and historical data, and integrate with important back office systems.  The Azure IoT Suite packages a set of commonly leveraged services together and extended capabilities to reduce time-to-value for customers.  These extensions include pre-configured solutions which deliver canonical implementation of the most common solution patterns.  Combined with the IoT software development kits (SDKs), customers are able to easily customize the pre-configured solutions or leverage them as examples for development of new solutions.
