## Azure IoT Suite

The Microsoft Azure IoT Suite is an enterprise-grade solution that enables you to get started quickly through a set of extensible preconfigured solutions that address common IoT scenarios, such as *remote monitoring* and *connected devices*.

The preconfigured solutions:

- Are complete, working, end-to-end solutions that include simulated devices to get you started, preconfigured Azure services such as [Azure IoT Hub][], [Azure Event Hubs][], [Azure Stream Analytics][], [Azure Machine Learning][], and [Azure storage][], and solution specific management consoles.
- Contain proven, production-ready code that you can customize and extend to implement your own specific IoT scenarios.

You may also be interested in the [Azure IoT Hub][] service that many of the preconfigured solution use. [Azure IoT Hub][] provides many of the data processing and analytics capabilities defined in the sample solution architecture.
