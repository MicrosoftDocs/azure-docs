## Azure IoT Suite
Azure IoT Suite includes a collection of preconfigured solutions for you to deploy in your Azure subscription. These preconfigured solutions:
- Implement common IoT scenarios such as _remote monitoring_ and _predictive maintenance_.
- Are complete, working, end-to-end solutions that include simulated devices to get you started, a configured IoT hub, and other preconfigured Azure services such as Azure Stream Analytics, Machine Learning, and Azure storage.
- Contain proven, production-ready code that you can customize and extend to implement your own specific IoT scenarios.
- Are implementations of the Microsoft IoT reference architecture.

You may also be interested in the Azure IoT Hub service that many of the preconfigured solution use.The Azure IoT Hub service provides many of the "Device and event processing" capabilities defined in the reference architecture.
