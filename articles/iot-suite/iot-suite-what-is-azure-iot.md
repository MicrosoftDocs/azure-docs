## Azure IoT Suite
The Microsoft Azure IoT Suite is an enterprise-grade solution that enables you to get started quickly through a set of extensible preconfigured solutions. These solutions address common IoT scenarios, such as [remote monitoring][lnk-preconfigured-solutions], [predictive maintenance][lnk-predictive-maintenance], and [connected factory][lnk-connected-factory]. These solutions are implementations of the IoT solution architecture outlined in this article.

The preconfigured solutions are complete, working, end-to-end solutions that include:

- Simulated devices to get you started.
- Preconfigured Azure services such as [Azure IoT Hub][Azure IoT Hub], [Azure Event Hubs][Azure Event Hubs], [Azure Stream Analytics][Azure Stream Analytics], [Azure Machine Learning][Azure Machine Learning], and [Azure storage][Azure storage].
- Solution-specific management consoles.

The preconfigured solutions contain proven, production-ready code that you can customize and extend to implement your own specific IoT scenarios.

You may also be interested in the [Azure IoT Hub][Azure IoT Hub] service that many of the preconfigured solutions use. [Azure IoT Hub][Azure IoT Hub] provides the secure and reliable bi-directional communications between devices and the cloud used in the preconfigured solution architecture.
