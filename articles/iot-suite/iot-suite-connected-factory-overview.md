# Tutorial: Get started with the connected factory preconfigured solution
## Introduction
Azure IoT Suite [preconfigured solutions][lnk-preconfigured-solutions] combine multiple Azure IoT services to deliver end-to-end solutions that implement common IoT business scenarios. The *connected factory* preconfigured solution connects to and monitors your industry devices. You can use the solution to analyse the stream of data from your devices and to drive operational productivity and profitability.

This tutorial shows you how to provision the connected factory preconfigured solution. It also walks you through the basic features of the preconfigured solution. You can access many of these features from the solution *dashboard* that deploys as part of the preconfigured solution:

## Scenario overview

When you deploy the connected factory preconfigured solution, it is prepopulated with resources that enable you to step through a common industrial scenario. In this scenario, several factories connected to the solution are reporting overall equipment efficiency and key performance indicators. The following sections show you how to:

* Monitor factories, production lines and stations OEE and KPI values
* Analyze the telemetry data generated from these devices using Azure Time Series Insights
* Fix the issue by taking actions on alerts generated

A key feature of this scenario is that you can perform all these actions remotely from the solution dashboard. You do not need physical access to the devices.

## View the solution dashboard

The solution dashboard enables you to manage the deployed solution. It is a hierachirical representation of a global factory configuration. For example, you can view OEE, KPIs publish new nodes for telemetry and action alerts.

1. When the provisioning is complete and the tile for your preconfigured solution indicates **Ready**, choose **Launch** to open your connected factory solution portal in a new tab.

    ![Launch the preconfigured solution][img-launch-solution]

1. By default, the solution portal shows the *dashboard*. You can navigate to other areas of the solution portal using the menu on the left-hand side of the page.

    ![Remote monitoring preconfigured solution dashboard][img-menu]

The dashboard displays the following information:

* A **Factory list** panel that shows the status, location and current production configuration in the solution. When you first run the solution, there are [still being finalized] simulated devices. The production line simulation comprise of three real OPC UA servers per assembly line with simulated tasks being performed and sharing data. The production line controlled by a simple Manufacturing Execution System (MES) via OPC UA. The simulated devices are OPC UA servers running in virtual machines each running in their own Docker Container.
* A map that displays the location of each device connected to the solution. The solution uses the Bing Maps API to plot information on the map. The locations on the map can be clicked and will display details of the production lines at that location. See the [FAQ][lnk-faq] to learn how to make the map dynamic. 
* An **Alerts** panel that displays alerts generated by the devices when a telemetry value has exceeded a specific threshold.
* An **Overall Equipment Efficiency** panel that shows the Overall Equipement Efficiency value for the devices. This value is aggregated from the station view to the global factory level. The OEE figure and its constituent elements can be further anal
* **Key Performance Indicators** panel that displays the number of units produced and energy used by the devices. These values are aggregated from a station view to the global factory level.

## View Factories

The *Factories* panel shows you the geographical location of all the factories in the solution, their status and current production configuration. From the locations list you can navigate to the other levels in the solution hierarchy, the location names in the list are hyperlinks which when clicked display details of the production lines at that location. It is then possible to drill into the production line details and down to the a station level view. You can filter and the list of devices in the factory list.

1. The  **Factory panel ** shows the factory list for this solution.

   ![View the device list in the solution portal][img-devicelist]

2. The device list initially shows 6 simulated factories created by the provisioning process. You can add additional simulated and physical devices to the solution.

3. To view the details of the factory, click the location of the factory in the factory list.

   ![View the device details in the solution portal][img-devicedetails]

4. To view the details of the production line, click the production line name in the factory list.

    ![View the device details in the solution portal][img-devicedetails]

5. To view the configuration of the stations on the production line, click the station name in the factory list.

    ![View the device details in the solution portal][img-devicedetails]

6. To view details on specific nodes in the station, click on the name. This will launch the context panel with Azure Time Series Insights visualizations. These graphs can be clicked on to enable you do further analysis in the Azure Time Series Insights explorer environment.

    ![View the device details in the solution portal][img-devicedetails]

## View alerts

The alert history panel at the global level shows you the alerts that are being generated from all of your devices due to them reporting higher than expected telemetry values. This panel displays alerts at each level of the hierarchy from the station level view to the global view. The alerts contain a description of the alert, date, time, location and number of occurences. Deeper insights to the data that resulted in the alert being created can be gained using the Azure Time Series Insights data which is visualized in the alerts where applicable. Actions can be taken directly on the alerts these include close, acknowledge, show sensor data and calling a method on the device to reset it.

![TODO Alarm history on the solution dashboard][img-alarms]

> [!NOTE]
> These alerts are generated by rules that are included in the preconfigured solution. These rule generates alert when the OEE figure, its constiuent elements and the key performance indicators values exceeds thresholds. 

1. The **Alerts panel** shows the alerts generated in this solution.

    ![View the device list in the solution portal][img-devicelist]

2. To view the details of an alert click on the alert in the alerts panel.

    ![View the device list in the solution portal][img-devicelist]

3. To further analyse the alert data click on the graph in the alert panel,this opens the the Azure Time Series Insights explorer environment.

4. To address the alert a number of actions are available in the alert panel, choose the appropriate option for you and click on the execute action command button.

    ![View the device list in the solution portal][img-devicelist]

## View Overall Equipment Efficiency
Overall Equipment Efficiency identifies the percentage of manufacturing time that is productive. This is a standard industry measure and it is calculated by by multiplying the availability rate,performance rate and quality rate: OEE = availability x performance x quality.

    ![View the device list in the solution portal][img-devicelist]

1. To view Overall Equipment Efficiency for any level in the hierarchy, navigate to the specific view you require, the Overall Equipement Efficiency for that view is displayed in the panel along with each of the elements that make up the Overall Equipment Efficiency percentage.  

    ![View the device list in the solution portal][img-devicelist]

2. To further analyse the Overall Equipment Efficiency for any level in the hierarchy data click on either the Overall Equipment Efficiency percentage, availability percentage, performance percentage or quality percentage. A context panel will appear with Azure Time Series Insights powered visualizations enabling you view data from the last hour, last 24 hours and last 7 days.

    ![View the device list in the solution portal][img-devicelist]

3. To further analyse the alert data click on the graph in the alert panel,this opens the the Azure Time Series Insights explorer environment.

    ![View the device list in the solution portal][img-devicelist]

## View Key Performance Indicators
The solution provides two key performance indicators, Units per hour and Energy Used in kWh. 

1. To view Units per hour or Energy Used for any level in the hierarchy, navigate to the specific view you require, the Units per hour and Energy used are displayed in the panel. 

    ![View the device list in the solution portal][img-devicelist]

2.  To further analyse Units per hour or Energy Used for any level in the hierarchy data click on either the units produced or Energy used gauge in the Key Performance Indicators panel. A context panel will appear with Azure Time Series Insights powered visualizations enabling you view data from the last hour, last 24 hours and last 7 days.

    ![View the device list in the solution portal][img-devicelist]

## Scenario review

In this scenario, you identified a potential issue with some of your remote devices using Overall Equipment Efficiency and Key Performance Indicator values on the dashboard. You then used Azure Time Series Insights to provide more information to help drill further into the telemetry data for OEE and KPIs to help with detecting anomalies. You also used the alert panel to view issues with your factories and you used the actions available to you to resolve the alert.


## Other features

The following sections describe some additional features of the connected factory preconfigured solution that are not described as part of the previous scenario.

## Apply filters ##

1. Click on the **chevron** to display a list of available filters in either the factory locations panel or the alerts panel.

2. The filters panel is displayed for you. 

    ![Display the list of filters][img-unhealthy-filter]

3. Choose the filter that you require, it is also possible to type free text into the filter fields if you require.

The filter is then applied for you, the filter state is also shown in the dashboard via a funnel which is displayed in the factories and alerts tables.

5. To clear a filter, click on the funnel, the filter context panel is opened and click filter. The text “All” will be displayed in the factories and alerts tables.

### Browse an OPC Server

When you deploy the preconfigured solution, you automatically provision XX sample devices that you can see in the device list. These devices are *simulated devices* running in an Azure WebJob. Simulated devices make it easy for you to experiment with the preconfigured solution without the need to deploy real, physical devices. If you do want to connect a real device to the solution, see the [Connect your device to the remote monitoring preconfigured solution][lnk-connect-rm] tutorial. [LINK TO CONNECT YOUR OWN DEVICE]

## Behind the scenes

When you deploy a preconfigured solution, the deployment process creates multiple resources in the Azure subscription you selected. You can view these resources in the Azure [portal][lnk-portal]. The deployment process creates a **resource group** with a name based on the name you choose for your preconfigured solution:

![Preconfigured solution in the Azure portal][img-portal]

You can view the settings of each resource by selecting it in the list of resources in the resource group.

You can also view the source code for the preconfigured solution. The connected factory preconfigured solution source code is in the [azure-iot-remote-monitoring][lnk-rmgithub] GitHub repository:

* The **DeviceAdministration** folder contains the source code for the dashboard.
* The **Simulator** folder contains the source code for the simulated device.
* The **EventProcessor** folder contains the source code for the back-end process that handles the incoming telemetry.

When you are done, you can delete the preconfigured solution from your Azure subscription on the [azureiotsuite.com][lnk-azureiotsuite] site. This site enables you to easily delete all the resources that were provisioned when you created the preconfigured solution.

> [!NOTE]
> To ensure that you delete everything related to the preconfigured solution, delete it on the [azureiotsuite.com][lnk-azureiotsuite] site and do not delete the resource group in the portal.
