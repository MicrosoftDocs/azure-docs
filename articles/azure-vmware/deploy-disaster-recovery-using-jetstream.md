# Deploy disaster recovery using JetStream DR software

[JetStream DR](https://www.jetstreamsoft.com/product-portfolio/jetstream-dr/) is a cloud-native disaster recovery solution designed to minimize downtime of virtual machines (VMs) if there's a disaster. Instances of JetStream DR are deployed at both the protected and recovery sites. 

JetStream is built on the foundation of Continuous Data Protection (CDP), using [VMware vSphere API for I/O filtering (VAIO) framework](https://core.vmware.com/resource/vmware-vsphere-apis-io-filtering-vaio), which enables minimal or close to no data loss. JetStream DR provides the level of protection wanted for business and mission-critical applications. It also enables cost-effective DR by using minimal resources at the DR site and using cost-effective cloud storage, such as [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/).

In this article, learn how to implement JetStream DR for your Azure VMware Solution private cloud and on-premises VMware vSphere workloads.

## Core components of the JetStream DR solution

| Items | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **JetStream Management Server Virtual Appliance (MSA)**  | MSA enables both Day 0 and Day 2 configuration, such as primary sites, protection domains, and recovering VMs.  The MSA is deployed from an OVA file on a vSphere node by the cloud admin.  The MSA collects and maintains statistics relevant to VM protection and implements a vCenter Server plugin that allows you to manage JetStream DR natively with the vSphere Client. The MSA doesn't handle replication data of protected VMs.  | 
| **JetStream DR Virtual Appliance (DRVA)**  | Linux-based Virtual Machine appliance receives protected VMs replication data from the source ESXi host. It maintains the replication log and manages the transfer of the VMs and their data to the object store such as Azure Blob Storage. Depending upon the number of protected VMs and the amount of VM data to replicate, the private cloud admin can create one or more DRVA instances.  | 
| **JetStream ESXi host components (IO Filter packages)**  | JetStream software installed on each ESXi host configured for JetStream DR. The host driver intercepts the vSphere VMs I/O and sends the replication data to the DRVA. The IO filters also monitor relevant events, such as vMotion, Storage vMotion, snapshots, etc.   | 
| **JetStream Protected Domain**  | Logical group of VMs that are protected together using the same policies and runbook. The data for all VMs in a protection domain is stored in the same Azure Blob container instance. A single DRVA instance handles replication to remote DR storage for all VMs in a Protected Domain.   | 
| **Azure Blob Storage containers**  | The protected VM's replicated data is stored in Azure Blobs. JetStream software creates one Azure Blob container instance for each JetStream Protected Domain.    | 

## JetStream scenarios on Azure VMware Solution
You can use JetStream DR with Azure VMware Solution for the following two scenarios:  

- On-premises VMware vSphere to Azure VMware Solution DR

- Azure VMware Solution to Azure VMware Solution DR

### Scenario 1: On-premises VMware vSphere to Azure VMware Solution DR

In this scenario, the primary site is your on-premises VMware vSphere environment and the DR site is an Azure VMware Solution private cloud.

### Scenario 2: Azure VMware Solution to Azure VMware Solution DR

In this scenario, the primary site is an Azure VMware Solution private cloud in one Azure region. The disaster recovery site is an Azure VMware Solution private cloud in a different Azure region.

## Disaster Recovery with Azure NetApp Files, JetStream DR and Azure VMware Solution 

Disaster Recovery to cloud is a resilient and cost-effective way of protecting the workloads against site outages and data corruption events like ransomware. Using the VMware VAIO framework, on-premises VMware workloads can be replicated to Azure Blob storage and recovered with minimal or close to no data loss and near-zero Recovery Time Objective (RTO). JetStream DR can seamlessly recover workloads replicated from on-premises to Azure VMware Solution and specifically to Azure NetApp Files. 

JetStream DR enables cost-effective disaster recovery by consuming minimal resources at the DR site and using cost-effective cloud storage. JetStream DR automates recovery to Azure NetApp Files (ANF) datastores using Azure Blob Storage. It can recover independent VMs or groups of related VMs into the recovery site infrastructure according to runbook settings. It also provides point-in-time recovery for ransomware protection. 

### Install JetStream DR 
To install JetStream DR in the on-premises data center and in the Azure VMware Solution private cloud:

- Install JetStream DR in the on-premises data center: 

  - Download the JetStream DR bundle from Azure Marketplace (ZIP) and deploy the JetStream DR MSA (OVA) in the designated cluster.
  - Configure the cluster with the IO filter package (install JetStream VIB). 
  - Create Azure Blob (Azure Storage Account) in the same region as the DR Azure VMware Solution cluster.
  - Deploy the disaster recovery virtual appliance (DRVA) and assign a replication log volume (VMDK from existing datastore or shared iSCSI storage). 
  - Create Protected Domains (groups of related VMs) and assign DRVAs and the Azure Blob Storage/ANF.
  - Start protection. 

- Install JetStream DR in the Azure VMware Solution private cloud: 

   - Use the Run command to install and configure JetStream DR.
   - Add the same Azure Blob container and discover domains using the Scan Domain option.
   - Deploy the DRVA appliance. 
   - Create a replication log volume using an available vSAN or ANF datastore.
   - Import protected domains and configure RocVA (recovery VA) to use ANF datastore for VM placements. 
   - Select the appropriate failover option and start continuous rehydration for near-zero RTO domains/VMs. 

- During a disaster event, trigger failover to Azure NetApp Files datastores in the designated Azure VMware Solution DR site. 

- Invoke failback to the protected site after the protected site is recovered. 

### Ransomware recovery 

Recovering from ransomware can be a daunting task. It can be hard for IT organizations to pinpoint what the 'safe point of return' is and how to ensure that recovered workloads are safeguarded from the attacks reoccurring by sleeping malware or through vulnerable applications. 

JetStream DR for Azure VMware Solution together with Azure NetApp Files datastores can address these concerns by allowing organizations to recover from an available point-in-time. It ensures workloads are recovered to a functional and isolated network if necessary. It allows the applications to function and communicate with each other without exposing them to any North-South traffic. It also gives security teams a safe place to perform forensics, and conduct other recovery measures.

## Configure JetStream DR 
 
This section only covers an overview of the steps required for configuring JetStream DR.  For detailed descriptions and steps, see the [Configuring JetStream DR](https://www.jetstreamsoft.com/portal/jetstream-knowledge-base/configuring-jetstream-dr/) documentation. 
 
Once JetStream DR MSA and JetStream VIB are installed on the Azure VMware Solution clusters, use the JetStream portal to complete the remaining configuration steps. 



1. Access the JetStream portal from the vCenter appliance.

1. [Add an external storage site](https://www.jetstreamsoft.com/portal/jetstream-knowledge-base/add-a-storage-site/).  

1. [Deploy a JetStream DRVA appliance](https://jetstreamsoft.com/portal/online-docs/jsdr-admin_4.2/deploydrva.html). 

1. Create a JetStream replication log store volume using one of the datastores available to the Azure VMware Solution cluster. 

   >[!TIP]
   >Fast local storage, such as vSAN datastore, is preferred for the replication log volume. 
 
1. [Create a JetStream protected domain](https://www.jetstreamsoft.com/portal/jetstream-knowledge-base/create-a-protected-domain/). Provide the Azure Blob Storage site, JetStream DRVA instance, and replication log volume created in previous steps. 

1. Select the VMs you want to protect, then start VM protection.

 
For remaining configuration steps for JetStream DR, such as creating a failover runbook, invoking failover to the DR site, and invoking failback to the primary site, see the [JetStream Admin Guide documentation](https://www.jetstreamsoft.com/portal/jetstream-knowledge-base/disaster-recovery-with-azure-netapp-files-jetstream-dr-and-avs-azure-vmware-solution/).  
 
## Disable JetStream DR on an Azure VMware Solution cluster  
 
This cmdlet disables JetStream DR only on one of the clusters and doesn't completely uninstall JetStream DR.
