# Enable first-party application service principal for Azure VMware Solution Generation 2 Private Clouds

In this article, you learn how to re-enable the Azure VMware Solution service principal. This service principal is required to be enabled to deploy the Azure VMware Solution Generation (Gen) 2 Private Clouds. If you're already familiar with how to enable service principal, re-enable the service principal for application ID '1a5e141d-70dd-4594-8442-9fc46fa48686' with name 'Avs Fleet Rp'.

## Prerequisite
 
You must have the permissions to edit applications in your Microsoft Entra ID tenant, such as:  
- Cloud Application Administrator  
- Application Administrator  
- Global Administrator  

## Enable first-party application service principal for Azure VMware Solution Gen 2 Private Clouds

There are two options to enable the service principal for Azure VMware Solution. You can use either the **Microsoft Entra ID** portal or Azure PowerShell. The following sections describe both options.

### Option 1: From the Portal  

1. Select **Microsoft Entra ID**.  

2. Search **Microsoft Entra ID** for the application ID ``1a5e141d-70dd-4594-8442-9fc46fa48686``. Select **'Avs Fleet Rp'**.  

3. Enable the **'Avs Fleet Rp'** Enterprise application for user sign-in by toggling the **Enabled for users to sign-in** toggle to **Yes**.   

4. Ensure you select **Save**.  


### Option 2: From Azure PowerShell  

1. Run the following command:  
    ```powershell  
    Get-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId 1a5e141d-70dd-4594-8442-9fc46fa48686  
    ```  

2. Use the 'ID' returned. You can copy the value from the 'ID' column to use in the next command. The 'ID' field is a full GUID.  

3. Run the following command to enable the service principal using the value you copied from the 'ID' column:  
    ```powershell  
    Set-AzureADServicePrincipal -ObjectId 0a9fa53e-1930 -AccountEnabled $True  
    ```
