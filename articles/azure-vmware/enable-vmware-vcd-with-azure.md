# Install VMware Cloud Director with Azure VMware Solution

This article explains how to install VMware Cloud Director to enable Enterprise and hosters to use Azure VMware Solution private cloud underlying resources for virtual datacenters.

[VMware Cloud director](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/cloud-director/vmware-cloud-director/10-6/overview.html) is a cloud services platform that delivers secure, isolated, and elastic virtual data center compute, network, storage, and security in a self-service model. VMware Cloud Director obtains its resources from an underlying virtual infrastructure.

> [!Note]
> VMware Cloud Director on Azure VMware Solution is currently available for eligible hosters and select Enterprise customers only. Contact your account team for more information.

Eligible Enterprise and hoster can install VMware Cloud director on Azure VMware solution and integrate it with Azure VMware Solution private cloud datacenter to enable multitenancy, using its underlying resources to deliver the secure, isolated virtual datacenters that VMware Cloud Director offers.


## VMware Cloud Director on Azure VMware Solution architecture overview

Azure VMware Solution provides private clouds that contain VMware vSphere clusters built from dedicated bare-metal Azure infrastructure. The minimum initial deployment is three hosts, with the option to add more hosts, up to a maximum of 16 hosts per cluster. All provisioned private clouds have VMware vCenter Server, VMware vSAN, VMware vSphere, and VMware NSX. 

VMware Cloud Director enables multi-tenancy by using organizations. Each organization can have one or more organization virtual data centers (VDC). Every Organization's VDC can have its own dedicated Tier-1 router (Organization VDC Edge Gateway), which connects to the shared Tier-0 router (Provider gateway).

## How to install and configure VMware Cloud Director on Azure VMware Solution

You can self-install and self-manage VMware Cloud Director on Azure VMware Solution. This document covers VMware Cloud Director appliance-based installation. 

A VMware Cloud Director server group consists of one or more VMware Cloud Director servers which run a collection of services called a VMware Cloud Director cell. All cells share a single VMware Cloud Director database and transfer server storage and connect to the vSphere and network resources. 

The VMware Cloud Director appliance includes an embedded PostgreSQL database with a high availability function. 


### VMware Cloud Director Installation Prerequisites 

Ensure all installation prerequisites are completed before proceeding with installation.

- Review [VMware Cloud Director appliance sizing guidelines](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/cloud-director/vmware-cloud-director/10-6/vcd-appliance-sizing-guidelines.html) to determine resource requirements of VMware Cloud Director appliances.
- [VMware Cloud Director network configuration requirements](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/cloud-director/vmware-cloud-director/10-6/vmware-cloud-director-installation-and-upgrade-guide-10-6/vmware-cloud-director-hardware-and-software-requirements-install/network-configuration-requirements-install.html)
    - You must use NTP to synchronize the clocks of all VMware Cloud Director servers, including the database server. The maximum allowable drift between the clocks of synchronized servers is 2 seconds.
    - All host names that you specify during installation and configuration must be resolvable by DNS using forward and reverse lookup of the fully qualified domain name or the unqualified hostname.
    - The VMware Cloud Director cell server must have the following network interfaces.
    - One IP address is required for the appliance, HTTP traffic, and console traffic.
    - One network interface is required for internal database communication.
    - The appliance, HTTP traffic, and console traffic use eth0. The internal database traffic uses eth1.

-	Download VMware Cloud Director binaries from Broadcom support portal or [create a support ticket](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/~/overview) to obtain the VMware Cloud Director binaries.

### Prepare the Transfer server storage for your VMware Cloud Director appliances

Transfer server storage is used for appliance cluster management and for providing temporary storage for uploads, downloads, and catalog items. Each member of the server group mounts this volume at the same mountpoint: /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/data/transfer. You can use Linux NFS server to create transfer share on Azure VMware Solution. 

Prepare the transfer share by following [requirements for the NFS server configuration](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/cloud-director/vmware-cloud-director/10-6/vmware-cloud-director-installation-and-upgrade-guide-10-6/deployment-uprade-and-administration-of-the-vcd-appliance-install/preparing-the-transfer-server-storage-for-your-vmware-cloud-director-appliance-install.html), so that VMware Cloud Director can write files to an NFS-based transfer server storage location and read files from it. 


### Install VMware Cloud Director appliances on Azure VMware Solution

To configure High availability for your VMware Cloud Director database, deploy one primary and two standby instances of the VMware Cloud Director appliance. Optionally, you can horizontally scale your server group by additionally deploying application cells.

VMware Cloud Director is deployed in two stages:
- Stage 1: Deploy the Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) with basic settings.
- Stage 2: Configure VMware Cloud Director by logging in to the VAMI page. https://<VCD_FQDN_or_IP>:5480


#### Procedure

1.	Deploy the VMware Cloud Director appliance as a primary cell. 
    - The primary cell is the first member in the VMware Cloud Director server group. The embedded database is configured as the VMware Cloud Director database. 
    - The database name is vcloud, and the database user is vcloud.

2.	For initial configuration of primary appliance, sign-in to VMware Cloud Director’s Virtual Appliance Management Interface (VAMI) at https://VCD_eth1_ip_address:5480
    - Fill the form (NFS Share, DB Password, and Admin User, VMware Cloud Director Settings) and start the configuration.
    - When the initial configuration is complete, you can access the VMware Cloud Director instance.
    - Verify that the primary cell is up and running by logging  to the VMware Cloud Director Service Provider Admin Portal at https://primary_eth0_ip_address/provider
    - To verify the PostgreSQL database health, log in as root to the appliance management user interface at https://primary_eth1_ip_address:5480. The primary node must be in a running status.
3.	Deploy two instances of the VMware Cloud Director appliance as standby cells. Log in to the VAMI interface of the standby cell and enter the same NFS mount used in the Primary Cell configuration.
    - After the initial standby appliance deployment, the replication manager begins synchronizing its database with the primary appliance database.
    - During this time, the VMware Cloud Director database and therefore the VMware Cloud Director UI are unavailable.
4.	You can monitor the cluster status by using the VMware Cloud Director appliance management user interface.
    - Verify that all cells in the HA cluster are running. See View Your VMware Cloud Director Appliance Cluster Health and Failover Mode.
5.	(Optional) Deploy one or more instances of the VMware Cloud Director appliance as VMware Cloud Director Application cells.

Once VMware Cloud Director is installed, you can then add Azure VMware solution vCenter and NSX-T to VMware Cloud Director to start using its resources.
