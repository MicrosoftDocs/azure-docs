# Save costs with reserved instances in Azure VMware Solution

When you commit to a reserved instance of [Azure VMware Solution](introduction.md), you save money. The reservation discount automatically applies to the running Azure VMware Solution hosts that match the reservation scope and attributes. In addition, a reserved instance purchase covers only the compute part of your usage and includes software licensing costs.

## Purchase restriction considerations

Reserved instances are available with some exceptions:

- **Clouds**: Reservations are available only in the regions listed on the [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=azure-vmware) page.
- **Insufficient quota**: A reservation scoped to a single or shared subscription must have hosts quota available in the subscription for the new reserved instance. You can [create a quota increase request](request-host-quota-azure-vmware-solution.md) to resolve this issue.
- **Offer eligibility**: You need an [Azure Enterprise Agreement (EA)](../cost-management-billing/manage/ea-portal-agreements.md) with Microsoft.
- **Capacity restrictions**: In rare circumstances, Azure limits the purchase of new reservations for Azure VMware Solution host SKUs because of low capacity in a region.

## Buy a reservation

You can buy a reserved instance of an Azure VMware Solution host instance in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Reservations/CreateBlade/referrer/documentation/filters/%7B%22reservedResourceType%22%3A%22VirtualMachines%22%7D).

You can pay for the reservation [upfront or with monthly payments](../cost-management-billing/reservations/prepare-buy-reservation.md).

These requirements apply to buying a reserved dedicated host instance:

-   To buy a reservation, you must have the owner role or reservation purchaser role on an Azure subscription.
-   For EA subscriptions, you must enable the **Add Reserved Instances** option in the [EA portal](https://ea.azure.com/). If disabled, you must be an EA Admin for the subscription to enable it.
-   For a subscription under a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) Azure plan, the partner must purchase the customer's reserved instances in the Azure portal.

### Buy reserved instances for an EA subscription

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Select **All services** > **Reservations**.

1. Select **Purchase Now**, and then select **Azure VMware Solution**.

1. Enter the required fields. The selected attributes that match running Azure VMware Solution hosts qualify for the reservation discount. Attributes include the SKU, regions (where applicable), and scope. Reservation scope selects where the reservation savings apply.

   If you have an EA agreement, you can use the **Add more option** to add instances quickly. The option isn't available for other subscription types.

The charges are deducted from the Azure Prepayment (previously called monetary commitment) balance, if available, or charged as overage.

## Usage data and reservation usage

Your usage that gets a reservation discount has an effective price of zero. You can see which Azure VMware Solution instance received the reservation discount for each reservation.

For more information about how reservation discounts appear in usage data:

- For EA customers, see [Understand Azure reservation usage for your EA enrollment](../cost-management-billing/reservations/understand-reserved-instance-usage-ea.md).
- For individual subscriptions, see [Understand Azure reservation usage for your pay-as-you-go subscription](../cost-management-billing/reservations/understand-reserved-instance-usage.md).

## Change a reservation after purchase

You can make these changes to a reservation after purchase:

- Update reservation scope
- Instance size flexibility (if applicable)
- Ownership

You can also split a reservation into smaller chunks or merge reservations. None of the changes causes a new commercial transaction or changes the end date of the reservation.

For more information about CSP-managed reservations, see [Sell Azure reservations to customers by using Partner Center, the Azure portal, or APIs](/partner-center/azure-reservations).

>[!NOTE]
>After you purchase your reservation, you won't be able to make these types of changes directly:
>
> - An existing reservation's region
> - SKU
> - Quantity
> - Duration
>
> However, you can *exchange* a reservation if you want to make changes.

## Cancel, exchange, or refund reservations

You can cancel, exchange, or refund reservations with certain limitations. For more information, see [Self-service exchanges and refunds for Azure reservations](../cost-management-billing/reservations/exchange-and-refund-azure-reservations.md). *Azure VMware Solution reservations don't fall into this category, so the new exchange rules don't apply.*

CSPs can cancel, exchange, or refund reservations, with certain limitations, purchased for their customer. For more information, see [Manage, cancel, exchange, or refund Azure reservations for customers](/partner-center/azure-reservations-manage).
