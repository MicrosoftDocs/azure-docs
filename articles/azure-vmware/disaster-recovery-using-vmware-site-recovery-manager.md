# Deploy disaster recovery with VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM)

This article explains how to implement disaster recovery for on-premises VMware vSphere virtual machines (VMs) or Azure VMware Solution-based VMs. The solution in this article uses [VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM)](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/live-recovery/site-recovery-manager/8-8.html) and vSphere Replication with Azure VMware Solution. Instances of VMware SRM and replication servers are deployed at both the protected and the recovery sites.       

VMware SRM is a disaster recovery solution designed to minimize downtime of the virtual machines in an Azure VMware Solution environment if there was a disaster. VMware SRM automates and orchestrates failover and failback, ensuring minimal downtime in a disaster. Also, built-in nondisruptive testing ensures your recovery time objectives are met. Overall, VMware SRM simplifies management through automation and ensures fast and highly predictable recovery times.

VMware vSphere Replication is VMware's hypervisor-based replication technology for VMware vSphere VMs. It protects VMs from partial or complete site failures. In addition, it simplifies DR protection through storage-independent, VM-centric replication. VMware vSphere Replication is configured on a per-VM basis, allowing more control over which VMs are replicated.


> [!NOTE]
> The current version of VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) in Azure VMware Solution is 8.7.0.3.

## Supported scenarios

VMware SRM helps you plan, test, and run the recovery of VMs between a protected VMware vCenter Server site and a recovery VMware vCenter Server site. You can use VMware SRM with Azure VMware Solution with the following two DR scenarios: 

- On-premises VMware vSphere to Azure VMware Solution private cloud disaster recovery 
- Primary Azure VMware Solution to Secondary Azure VMware Solution private cloud disaster recovery 

The diagram shows the deployment of the on-premises VMware vSphere to Azure VMware Solution private cloud disaster recovery scenario.

The diagram shows the deployment of the primary Azure VMware Solution to secondary Azure VMware Solution scenario.

:::image type="content" source="media/vmware-srm-vsphere-replication/vmware-site-recovery-manager-diagram.png" alt-text="Diagram showing the VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) disaster recovery solution in Azure VMware Solution." border="false" lightbox="media/vmware-srm-vsphere-replication/vmware-site-recovery-manager-diagram.png":::

You can use VMware SRM to implement different types of recovery, such as:

- **Planned migration** commences when both primary and secondary Azure VMware Solution sites are running and fully functional. It's an orderly migration of virtual machines from the protected site to the recovery site where no data loss is expected when migrating workloads in an orderly fashion. 

- **Disaster recovery** using SRM can be invoked when the protected Azure VMware Solution site goes offline unexpectedly. VMware Site Recovery Manager orchestrates the recovery process with the replication mechanisms to minimize data loss and system downtime.

   In Azure VMware Solution, only individual VMs can be protected on a host by using VMware SRM in combination with VMware vSphere Replication.

- **Bidirectional Protection** uses a single set of paired VMware SRM sites to protect VMs in both directions. Each site can simultaneously be a protected site and a recovery site, but for a different set of VMs.

>[!IMPORTANT]

## Install SRM in Azure VMware Solution

1. In your on-premises data center, install VMware SRM and vSphere Replication.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Use the [Two-site Topology with one vCenter Server instance per PSC](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/live-recovery/site-recovery-manager/8-8/site-recovery-manager-installation-and-configuration-8-8/site-recovery-manager-appliance-overview/site-recovery-manager-and-vcenter-server-deployment-models/srm-in-a-two-site-topology-with-one-vcenter-server-per-platform-services-controller.html) deployment model. Also, make sure that the [required vSphere Replication Network ports](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=2087769) are opened.
1. In your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, under **Manage**, select **Add-ons** > **Disaster recovery**.

1. The default CloudAdmin user in the Azure VMware Solution private cloud doesn't have sufficient privileges to install VMware SRM or vSphere Replication. The installation process involves multiple steps outlined in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. Instead, you can install VMware SRM with vSphere Replication as an add-on service from your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.


1. :::image type="content" source="media/VMware-srm-vsphere-replication/disaster-recovery-add-ons.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure VMware Solution private cloud to install VMware SRM with vSphere Replication as an add-on" border="true" lightbox="media/VMware-srm-vsphere-replication/disaster-recovery-add-ons.png":::


> [!NOTE]
> The current version of VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) in Azure VMware Solution is 8.7.0.3.
1. From the **Disaster Recovery Solution** drop-down, select **VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) â€“ vSphere Replication**. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/VMware-srm-vsphere-replication/disaster-recovery-solution-srm-add-on.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Disaster recovery tab under Add-ons with VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) - vSphere replication selected." border="true" lightbox="media/VMware-srm-vsphere-replication/disaster-recovery-solution-srm-add-on.png":::

1. Provide the License key, select agree with terms and conditions, and then select **Install**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >If you don't provide the license key, SRM is installed in an Evaluation mode. The license is used only to enable VMware SRM.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/VMware-srm-vsphere-replication/disaster-recovery-solution-srm-licence.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Disaster recovery tab under Add-ons with the License key field selected." border="true" lightbox="media/VMware-srm-vsphere-replication/disaster-recovery-solution-srm-licence.png":::


## Install the vSphere Replication appliance

After the VMware SRM appliance installs successfully, you'll need to install the vSphere Replication appliances. Each replication server accommodates up to 200 protected VMs. Scale in or scale out as per your needs. 

1. From the **Replication using** drop-down, on the **Disaster recovery** tab, select **vSphere Replication**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vmware-srm-vsphere-replication/vsphere-replication-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the vSphere Replication selected for the Replication using option.":::

1. Move the vSphere server slider to indicate the number of replication servers you want based on the number of VMs to be protected. Then select **Install**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vmware-srm-vsphere-replication/vsphere-replication-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to increase or decrease the number of replication servers.":::

1. Once installed, verify that both VMware SRM and the vSphere Replication appliances are installed.

   >[!TIP]
   >The Uninstall button indicates that both VMware SRM and the vSphere Replication appliances are currently installed.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vmware-srm-vsphere-replication/vsphere-replication-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that both SRM and the replication appliance are installed.":::
  

## Configure site pairing in vCenter Server

After installing VMware SRM and vSphere Replication, you need to complete the configuration and site pairing in vCenter Server.

1. Sign in to the vSphere Client as cloudadmin@vsphere.local.

1. Navigate to **Site Recovery**, check the status of both vSphere Replication and VMware SRM, and then select **OPEN Site Recovery** to launch the client.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vmware-srm-vsphere-replication/open-site-recovery.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing vSphere Client with the vSphere Replication and Site Recovery Manager installation status as OK." border="true":::


1. Select **NEW SITE PAIR** in the Site Recovery (SR) client in the new tab that opens.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/vmware-srm-vsphere-replication/new-site-pair.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing vSphere Client with the New Site Pair button selected for Site Recovery." border="true":::

1. Enter the remote site details, and then select **NEXT**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >An Azure VMware Solution private cloud operates with an embedded Platform Services Controller (PSC), so only one local vCenter Server can be selected. If the remote vCenter Server is using an embedded Platform Service Controller (PSC), use the vCenter Server's FQDN (or its IP address) and port to specify the PSC. 
   >
   >The remote user must have sufficient permissions to perform the pairings. An easy way to ensure this is to give that user the VRM administrator and SRM administrator roles in the remote vCenter Server. For a remote Azure VMware Solution private cloud, cloudadmin is configured with those roles.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vmware-srm-vsphere-replication/pair-the-sites-specify-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Site details for the new site pair." border="true" lightbox="media/vmware-srm-vsphere-replication/pair-the-sites-specify-details.png":::

1. Select **CONNECT** to accept the certificate for the remote vCenter Server.

   At this point, the client should discover the VMware VRM and VMware SRM appliances on both sides as services to pair.

1. Select the appliances to pair and then select **NEXT**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/vmware-srm-vsphere-replication/pair-the-sites-new-site.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the vCenter Server and services details for the new site pair." border="true" lightbox="media/vmware-srm-vsphere-replication/pair-the-sites-new-site.png":::

1. Select **CONNECT** to accept the certificates for the remote VMware SRM and the remote vCenter Server (again).

1. Select **CONNECT** to accept the certificates for the local VMware SRM and the local vCenter Server.

1. Review the settings and then select **FINISH**.

   If successful, the client displays another panel for the pairing. However, if unsuccessful, an alarm is reported.

1. At the bottom, in the right corner, select the double-up arrow to expand the panel to show **Recent Tasks** and **Alarms**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >The SR client sometimes takes a long time to refresh. If an operation seems to take too long or appears "stuck", select the refresh icon on the menu bar. 

1. Select **VIEW DETAILS** to open the panel for remote site pairing, which opens a dialog to sign in to the remote vCenter Server.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vmware-srm-vsphere-replication/view-details-remote-pairing.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the new site pair details for Site Recovery Manager and vSphere Replication." border="true" lightbox="media/vmware-srm-vsphere-replication/view-details-remote-pairing.png":::

1. Enter the username with sufficient permissions to do replication and site recovery and then select **LOG IN**. 

   For pairing, the sign in, which is often a different user, is a one-time action to establish pairing. The SR client requires this sign in every time the client is launched to work with the pairing.

   >[!NOTE] 
   >The user with sufficient permissions should have **VRM administrator** and **SRM administrator** roles given to them in the remote vCenter Server. The user should also have access to the remote vCenter Server inventory, like folders and datastores. For a remote Azure VMware Solution private cloud, the cloudadmin user has the appropriate permissions and access. 
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/vmware-srm-vsphere-replication/sign-into-remote-vcenter.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the vCenter Server credentials." border="true":::

   You see a warning message indicating that the embedded VRS in the local VRM isn't running. The warning is because Azure VMware Solution doesn't use the embedded VRS in an Azure VMware Solution private cloud, it uses VRS appliances instead.

## Ongoing management of your VMware SRM solution

Microsoft aims to simplify VMware SRM and vSphere Replication installation on an Azure VMware Solution private cloud. You're responsible for managing your license and the day-to-day operation of the disaster recovery solution. 

## Scale limitations

To learn about the limits for the VMware Site Recovery Manager Add-On with the Azure VMware Solution, check the [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints.](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md#azure-vmware-solution-limits)

## VMware SRM licenses

You can install VMware SRM using an evaluation license or a production license.  The evaluation license is valid for 60 days. After the evaluation period, you'll be required to obtain a production license of VMware SRM. 

You can't use pre-existing on-premises VMware SRM licenses for your Azure VMware Solution private cloud. Work with your sales teams and VMware to acquire a new term-based production license of VMware SRM. 

Once a production license of VMware SRM is acquired, you can start using the Azure VMware Solution portal to update VMware SRM with the new production license. 


## Uninstall VMware SRM 

If you no longer require VMware SRM, you must uninstall it in a clean manner. Before you uninstall VMware SRM, you must remove all VMware SRM configurations from both sites in the correct order. If you don't remove all configurations before uninstalling VMware SRM, some VMware SRM components, such as placeholder VMs, might remain in the Azure VMware Solution infrastructure.

1. In the vSphere Client, select **Site Recovery** > **Open Site Recovery**.

2. On the **Site Recovery** home tab, select a site pair and select **View Details**.

3. Select the **Recovery Plans** tab, right-click on a recovery plan and select **Delete**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >You cannot delete recovery plans that are running.

4. Select the **Protection Groups** tab, select a protection group, and select the **Virtual Machines** tab.

5. Highlight all virtual machines, right-click, and select **Remove Protection**.

   Removing protection from a VM deletes the placeholder VM from the recovery site. Repeat this operation for all protection groups.

6. In the **Protection Groups** tab, right-click a protection group and select **Delete**.

   >[!NOTE] 
   >You cannot delete a protection group that is included in a recovery plan. You cannot delete vSphere Replication protection groups that contain virtual machines on which protection is still configured.

7. Select **Site Pair** > **Configure** and remove all inventory mappings.

   a. Select each of the **Network Mappings**, **Folder Mappings**, and **Resource Mappings** tabs.

   b. In each tab, select a site, right-click a mapping, and select **Delete**.

8. For both sites, select **Placeholder Datastores**, right-click the placeholder datastore, and select **Remove**.

9. Select **Site Pair** > **Summary**, and select **Break Site Pair**.

   >[!NOTE] 
   >Breaking the site pairing removes all information related to registering Site Recovery Manager with Site Recovery Manager, vCenter Server, and the Platform Services Controller on the remote site.

10. In your private cloud, under **Manage**, select **Add-ons** > **Disaster recovery**, and then select **Uninstall the replication appliances**.

11. Once replication appliances are uninstalled, from the **Disaster recovery** tab, select **Uninstall for the Site Recovery Manager**.

12. Repeat these steps on the secondary Azure VMware Solution site.


## Support
