# Plan self-service maintenance for Azure VMware Solution (public preview)

In this article, you learn about how to use the self-service maintenance orchestration feature to schedule or reschedule planned maintenance directly from the Azure portal. For more information, see [Host maintenance and lifecycle management](architecture-private-clouds.md).

## Prerequisites

Before scheduling or rescheduling maintenance, ensure the following:

- An Azure VMware Solution private cloud in place.
- A subscription with Early Access and Self Serve for Maintenance features enabled, available under Preview Features in the Azure portal.

## Schedule maintenance
To schedule maintenance, follow these steps:

1.	Access the Maintenance pane by clicking the Schedule link in the banner. You see a list of upcoming maintenance events.

    :::image type="content" source="media/self-service-orchestration/schedule-maintenance.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Maintenance pane with upcoming maintenance events and the Schedule button highlighted." lightbox="media/self-service-orchestration/schedule-maintenance.png":::

2. Hover over the info icon near the **Schedule** button to view the scheduling deadline for each maintenance event.
    
3. Select **Schedule**, input your preferred date and time, and confirm the selection.

>[!Note] 
> If maintenance is not scheduled before the deadline, the system will automatically assign a maintenance window based on availability.

## Check maintenance readiness

Before scheduling, verify the Maintenance Ready status for the event:
- If the status is No, there may be configuration issues blocking maintenance.
- To view detailed information with an action plan to address the issues, select the provided hyperlink.

Addressing readiness issues ensures a smooth maintenance process and prevents automatic cancellations.

## Reschedule maintenance

If the assigned maintenance slot isn't suitable, you can reschedule the event using the following steps:
1. Navigate to Operations in the left menu and select Maintenance.
1. Under the Upcoming Maintenance tab, select the Reschedule option next to the event.
1. Input your revised date and time, then confirm by clicking Reschedule.
Once rescheduled, the system updates the schedule with the new date, visible in the portal.

> [!Note]
> Users cannot reschedule maintenance after the upgrade deadline, on freeze days, or for tasks addressing critical security vulnerabilities.

## Errors and restrictions
The following system error or warning messages appear while trying to reschedule maintenance tasks:
- You can schedule/reschedule maintenance only before the upgrade deadline and on freeze days.
- You can reschedule maintenance up to 24 hours before the start of the maintenance.
- Each maintenance task has an internal deadline. Dates beyond this appear greyed out on the portal. To reschedule past this point, raise a support ticket. Critical maintenance or fixes for critical security vulnerabilities may have the reschedule option disabled.
- This feature is enabled only for specific maintenance activities. As a result, not all Azure VMware Solution maintenance tasks appear in this section or have the option to reschedule.
