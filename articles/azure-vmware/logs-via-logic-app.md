## Prerequisites

Make sure you have an Azure VMware Solution private cloud set up that is streaming its syslogs to an Azure Event Hubs instance within an Azure Event Hubs namespace. **A valid instance of event hub within your Azure Event Hub namespace is required**. For setup guidance, visit [Configure VMware syslogs - Stream to Microsoft Azure Event Hubs](/azure/azure-vmware/configure-vmware-syslogs#stream-to-microsoft-azure-event-hubs).

## Create an Azure Logic Apps instance

1. From your Azure portal, select **Create a resource**, then search for **Logic App**. Find the one called **Logic App**, select **Create**, then click **Logic App**.

2. Select the Hosting plan that makes the most sense for your consumption needs. In most cases, the **Workflow Service Plan** should suffice.

:::image type="content" source="media/logs-to-logic-app/logs-to-logic-app-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing which hosting option of Azure Logic Apps to select." border="false"  lightbox="media/logs-to-logic-app/logs-to-logic-app-2.png":::

3. Enter the Subscription you intend to use, the Resource Group chosen to house this instance. Give it a name and select a region.
**If your log management server is hosted in Azure—including within your Azure VMware Solution private cloud—ensure you select the same region as the Azure Virtual Network connected to your log management server. Otherwise, the integration will fail.**
The default Windows plan is **Workflow Standard WS1 (210 total ACU, 3.5 Gb memory, 1 vCPU)** which should be enough to handle log volumes from large workloads. This option can always be adjusted later, as needed. After filing these details, select **Review + create**.

## Integrating with Azure Virtual Network

If your log management server is hosted in Azure - for example, your VMware Cloud Foundation Operations for Logs in your Azure VMware Solution private cloud - you will need to integrate your Azure Logic App with an Azure virtual network that can be reached by the log management server. This ensures the Logic App can communicate with endpoints that are only accessible within the virtual network. 

For example - if you're deploying your log management server on an Azure VMware Solution private cloud, you will need an Azure Virtual Network that can be peered to the private cloud's network.
###Prerequisites
- The Azure Virtual Network and the Azure Logic App must be in the same region. **Cross-region integration is not supported and will cause the setup to fail.**
- Ensure there is an available subnet in your Azure Virtual Network for integration. For more information, visit [Add, change, or delete a virtual network subnet](../virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet.md).

###Steps to integrate with your Azure Virtual Network
1. In the Azure Logic App, navigate to **Settings > Networking**. 
:::image type="content" source="media/logs-to-logic-app/logs-to-logic-app-21.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where the Networking tab is in the Azure Logic App instance." border="false"  lightbox="media/logs-to-logic-app/logs-to-logic-app-21.png":::

2. Select the highlighted text that says **Not configured** next to **Virtual Network integration**.

## Adding certificates, updating HTTP headers, and configuring notifications

### Certificates
If Azure Logic Apps requires the certificate from the log management server to be trusted, you may need to add the certificate to the Logic Apps instance to enable successful log transmission. This is a necessary step when using tools such as VMware Cloud Foundation Operations for Logs, for example. You may add this to the Azure Logic App instance using the following approach: 

1. Export the certificate from the log management server and save it as a .cer file. 

2. In the Azure Logic App, navigate to  **Settings > Certificates**. Navigate to the tab that says **Public key certificates (.cer)** and click on **Add certificate**. 

:::image type="content" source="media/logs-to-logic-app/logs-to-logic-app-14.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to add the Public key certificate in the Azure Logic App instance." border="false"  lightbox="media/logs-to-logic-app/logs-to-logic-app-14.png":::

3. Upload the certificate from Step 1 to **CER certificate file** and give the certificate a name, then click **Add** at the bottom.

:::image type="content" source="media/logs-to-logic-app/logs-to-logic-app-15.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to add the Public key certificate in the Azure Logic App instance and giving it a name." border="false"  lightbox="media/logs-to-logic-app/logs-to-logic-app-15.png":::

4. Once saved, copy the **Thumbprint** value. We need that for our environment variable in Step 5. 

:::image type="content" source="media/logs-to-logic-app/logs-to-logic-app-16.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to copy the thumbprint of the newly added certificate." border="false"  lightbox="media/logs-to-logic-app/logs-to-logic-app-16.png":::

5. Under **Settings**, select **Environment variables**, then select **Add**. The name of the environment variable to add is **WEBSITE_LOAD_ROOT_CERTIFICATES** and the value is going to be the thumbprint you copied. Select **Apply** at the bottom of the panel to save the changes and **Apply** again at the bottom of the list of environment variables to apply these changes. The new environment variable should take effect.

:::image type="content" source="media/logs-to-logic-app/logs-to-logic-app-17.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the successfully added environment variable." border="false"  lightbox="media/logs-to-logic-app/logs-to-logic-app-17.png":::

### HTTP Headers
By default, the **HTTP-Trigger-to-Log-Destination** trigger in the workflow you created has the following key-value pairs under Headers: 
 - **Content-Type** : **application/json**

This works by itself for log management tools such as VMware Cloud Foundation Operations for Logs. You may need to verify the log management server's ingestion cURL command to see if there are other headers that may need to be added. If you see other headers, add them here and click **Save** at the top, so that the logs can be ingested properly into your log management server. 

:::image type="content" source="media/logs-to-logic-app/logs-to-logic-app-18.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where headers can be modified inside the workflow." border="false"  lightbox="media/logs-to-logic-app/logs-to-logic-app-18.png":::

### Run History
The Run History section of a workflow in Azure Logic Apps provides a detailed log of workflow executions, helping you track successful runs, diagnose failures, and troubleshoot issues. By reviewing the timestamps, status codes, and error messages, you can ensure your Azure VMware Solution syslog forwarding process is running smoothly and quickly identify any disruptions.

:::image type="content" source="media/logs-to-logic-app/logs-to-logic-app-20.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Run History can be accessed." border="false"  lightbox="media/logs-to-logic-app/logs-to-logic-app-20.png":::

### Configuring Notifications
You will notice in the last step of the workflow that there is an optional item called **Optional-Notification (README)**. You may replace this item with one of the available actions in Azure Logic Apps, such as Outlook emails or Teams messages, to notify you in the event there is a failure sending your logs to your log management server.
