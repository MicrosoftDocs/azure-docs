# Back up Azure VMware Solution VMs with Azure Backup Server

This article shows you how to back up VMware virtual machines (VMs) running on Azure VMware Solution with Azure Backup Server.  First, thoroughly go through [Set up Microsoft Azure Backup Server for Azure VMware Solution](set-up-backup-server-for-azure-vmware-solution.md).

Then, walk through all of the necessary procedures to:

> [!div class="checklist"] 
> * Set up a secure channel so that Azure Backup Server can communicate with VMware vCenter Server over HTTPS. 
> * Add the account credentials to Azure Backup Server. 
> * Add the vCenter Server to Azure Backup Server. 
> * Set up a protection group that contains the VMware vSphere VMs you want to back up, specify backup settings, and schedule the backup.

## Create a secure connection to the vCenter Server

By default, Azure Backup Server communicates with VMware vCenter Server over HTTPS. To set up the HTTPS connection, download the VMware certificate authority (CA) certificate and import it on the Azure Backup Server.

### Set up the certificate

1. In the browser, on the Azure Backup Server machine, enter the vSphere Client URL.

   > [!NOTE] 
   > If the VMware vSphere Client **Getting Started** page doesn't appear, verify the connection and browser proxy settings and try again.

1. On the VMware vSphere Client **Getting Started** page, select **Download trusted root CA certificates**.

   :::image type="content" source="../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/vsphere-web-client.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the vSphere Client Getting Started window to access vSphere remotely.":::

1. Save the **download.zip** file to the Azure Backup Server machine, and then extract its contents to the **certs** folder, which contains the:

   - Root certificate file with an extension that begins with a numbered sequence like 0.0 and 0.1.
   - CRL file with an extension that begins with a sequence like, .r0 or .r1.

1. In the **certs** folder, right-click the root certificate file and select **Rename** to change the extension to **.crt**.

   The file icon changes to one that represents a root certificate.

1. Right-click the root certificate, and select **Install Certificate**.

1. In the **Certificate Import Wizard**, select **Local Machine** as the destination for the certificate, and select **Next**.

   > [!NOTE] 
   > If asked, confirm that you want to allow changes to the computer.

1. Select **Place all certificates in the following store**, and select **Browse** to choose the certificate store.

   :::image type="content" source="../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/cert-import-wizard-local-store.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Certificate Store dialog with Place all certificates in the following store option selected.":::

1. Select **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** as the destination folder, and select **OK**.

1. Review the settings, and select **Finish** to start importing the certificate.

   :::image type="content" source="../backup/media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/cert-wizard-final-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Certificate Import Wizard.":::

1. After the certificate import is confirmed, sign in to the vCenter Server to confirm that your connection is secure.

### Enable TLS 1.2 on Azure Backup Server

VMware vSphere 6.7 onwards has TLS enabled as the communication protocol. 

1. Copy the following registry settings, and paste them into Notepad. Then save the file as TLS.REG without the .txt extension.

   ```text

## Restore VMware vSphere virtual machines

In the Azure Backup Server Administrator Console, there are two ways to find recoverable data. You can search or browse. When you recover data, you might or might not want to restore data or a VM to the same location. For this reason, Azure Backup Server supports three recovery options for VMware VM backups:

- **Original location recovery (OLR)**: Use OLR to restore a protected VM to its original location. You can restore a VM to its original location only if no disks were added or deleted since the backup occurred. If disks were added or deleted, you must use alternate location recovery.
- **Alternate location recovery (ALR)**: Use when the original VM is missing, or you don't want to disturb the original VM. Provide the location of an ESXi host, resource pool, folder, and the storage datastore and path. To help differentiate the restored VM from the original VM, Azure Backup Server appends *"-Recovered"* to the name of the VM.
- **Individual file location recovery (ILR)**: If the protected VM is a Windows Server VM, individual files or folders inside the VM can be recovered by using the ILR capability of Azure Backup Server. To recover individual files, see the procedure later in this article. Restoring an individual file from a VM is available only for Windows VM and disk recovery points.

### Restore a recovery point

1. In the Azure Backup Server Administrator Console, select the **Recovery** view. 

1. Use the **Browse** pane and browse or filter to find the VM you want to recover. After you select a VM or folder, the **Recovery points for pane display the available recovery points.

   :::image type="content" source="../backup/media/restore-azure-backup-server-vmware/recovery-points.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the available recovery points for VMware vCenter Server.":::

1. In the **Recovery points for** pane, select a date when a recovery point was taken. For example, calendar dates in bold have available recovery points. Alternately, you can right-click the VM, select **Show all recovery points**, and then select the recovery point from the list.

   > [!NOTE] 
   > For short-term protection, select a disk-based recovery point for faster recovery. After short-term recovery points expire, you see only **Online** recovery points to recover.

1. Before recovering from an online recovery point, ensure the staging location contains enough free space to house the full uncompressed size of the VM you want to recover. The staging location can be viewed or changed by running the **Configure Subscription Settings Wizard**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-vmware-solution-backup/mabs-recovery-folder-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the recovery folder location.":::

1. Select **Recover** to open the **Recovery Wizard**.

   :::image type="content" source="../backup/media/restore-azure-backup-server-vmware/recovery-wizard.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Recovery Wizard review dialog.":::

1. Select **Next** to go to the **Specify Recovery Options** screen. Select **Next** again to go to the **Select Recovery Type** screen. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > VMware vSphere workloads don't support enabling network bandwidth throttling.

1. On the **Select Recovery Type** page, either recover to the original instance or a new location.

   - If you choose **Recover to original instance**, you don't need to make any more choices in the wizard. The data for the original instance is used.
   - If you choose **Recover as virtual machine on any host**, then on the **Specify Destination** screen, provide the information for **ESXi Host**, **Resource Pool**, **Folder**, and **Path**.

   :::image type="content" source="../backup/media/restore-azure-backup-server-vmware/recovery-type.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Recovery Wizard to select recovery type.":::

1. On the **Summary** page, review your settings and select **Recover** to start the recovery process. 

   The **Recovery status** screen shows the progression of the recovery operation.

### Restore an individual file from a VM

You can restore individual files from a protected VM recovery point. This feature is only available for Windows Server VMs. Restoring individual files is similar to restoring the entire VM, except you browse in the VMDK and find the files you want before you start the recovery process. 

> [!NOTE]
> Restoring an individual file from a VM is available only for Windows VM and disk recovery points.

1. In the Azure Backup Server Administrator Console, select the **Recovery** view.

1. In the **Browse** pane, browse or filter to find the VM you want to recover. After you select a VM or folder, the **Recovery points for pane display the available recovery points.

   :::image type="content" source="../backup/media/restore-azure-backup-server-vmware/vmware-rp-disk.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the recovery points for VMware vCenter Server.":::

1. In the **Recovery points for** pane, use the calendar to select the wanted recovery points' date. Depending on how the backup policy was configured, dates can have more than one recovery point. 

1. After you select the day when the recovery point was taken, make sure you choose the correct **Recovery time**. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the selected date has multiple recovery points, choose your recovery point by selecting it in the **Recovery time** drop-down menu. 

   After you choose the recovery point, the list of recoverable items appears in the **Path** pane.

1. To find the files you want to recover, in the **Path** pane, double-click the item in the **Recoverable Item** column to open it. Then select the file or folders you want to recover. To select multiple items, select the **Ctrl** key while you select each item. Use the **Path** pane to search the list of files or folders that appear in the **Recoverable Item** column.
    
   > [!NOTE]
   > The option, **Search list below** doesn't search into subfolders. To search through subfolders, double-click the folder. Use the **Up** button to move from a child folder into the parent folder. You can select multiple items (files and folders), but they must be in the same parent folder. You can't recover items from multiple folders in the same recovery job.

   :::image type="content" source="../backup/media/restore-azure-backup-server-vmware/vmware-rp-disk-ilr-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the date and time for the available recovery points selected.":::

1. After selecting the items for recovery, in the Administrator Console tool ribbon, select **Recover** to open the **Recovery Wizard**. In the **Recovery Wizard**, the **Review Recovery Selection** screen shows the selected items to be recovered.

1. On the **Specify Recovery Options** screen, do one of the following steps:

   - Select **Modify** to enable network bandwidth throttling. In the **Throttle** dialog box, select **Enable network bandwidth usage throttling** to turn it on. Once enabled, configure the **Settings** and **Work Schedule**.
   - Select **Next** to leave network throttling disabled.

1. On the **Select Recovery Type** screen, select **Next**. You can only recover your files or folders to a network folder.

1. On the **Specify Destination** screen, select **Browse** to find a network location for your files or folders. Azure Backup Server creates a folder where all recovered items are copied. The folder name has the prefix MABS_day-month-year. When you select a location for the recovered files or folder, the details for that location are provided.

   :::image type="content" source="../backup/media/restore-azure-backup-server-vmware/specify-destination.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the date and time, destination, and destination path for the available recovery points selected.":::

1. On the **Specify Recovery Options** screen, choose which security setting to apply. You can opt to modify the network bandwidth usage throttling, but throttling is disabled by default. Also, **SAN Recovery** and **Notification** aren't enabled.

1. On the **Summary** screen, review your settings and select **Recover** to start the recovery process. The **Recovery status** screen shows the progression of the recovery operation.
