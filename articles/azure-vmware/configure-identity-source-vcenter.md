# Set an external identity source for vCenter Server

[!INCLUDE [vcenter-access-identity-description](includes/vcenter-access-identity-description.md)]

You can set up vCenter Server to use an external Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory service to authenticate users. A user can sign in by using their Windows Server Active Directory account credentials or credentials from a third-party LDAP server. Then, the account can be assigned a vCenter Server role, like in an on-premises environment, to provide role-based access for vCenter Server users.

> - Run commands one at a time in the order that's described in the article.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that your Windows Server Active Directory network is connected to your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.

- For Windows Server Active Directory authentication with LDAPS:

  1. Get access to the Windows Server Active Directory domain controller with Administrator permissions.
  1. Enable LDAPS on your Windows Server Active Directory domain controllers by using a valid certificate. You can obtain the certificate from an [Active Directory Certificate Services Certificate Authority (CA)](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/2980.ldap-over-ssl-ldaps-certificate.aspx) or a [third-party or public CA](/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/enable-ldap-over-ssl-3rd-certification-authority).
  1. To obtain a valid certificate, complete the steps in [Create a certificate for secure LDAP](../active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-configure-ldaps.md#create-a-certificate-for-secure-ldap). Ensure that the certificate meets the listed requirements.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Avoid using self-signed certificates in production environments.  
  
  1. Optional: If you don't provide the `SSLCertificatesSasUrl` parameter, the certificate is automatically downloaded from the domain controller via the `PrimaryUrl` or the `SecondaryUrl` parameters. Alternatively, you can manually [export the certificate for LDAPS authentication](#export-the-certificate-for-ldaps-authentication-optional) and upload it to an Azure Storage account as blob storage. Then, [grant access to Azure Storage resources by using an SAS](../storage/common/storage-sas-overview.md).  

- Configure DNS resolution for Azure VMware Solution to your on-premises Windows Server Active Directory. Set up a DNS forwarder in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Configure a DNS forwarder for Azure VMware Solution](configure-dns-azure-vmware-solution.md).

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about LDAPS and certificate issuance, contact your security team or your identity management team.

## Export the certificate for LDAPS authentication (Optional)

First, verify that the certificate that's used for LDAPS is valid. If you don't have a certificate, complete the steps to [create a certificate for LDAPS](../active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-configure-ldaps.md#create-a-certificate-for-secure-ldap) before you continue.

To verify that the certificate is valid:

1. Sign in to a domain controller on which LDAPS is active by using Administrator permissions.
1. Open the **Run** tool, enter **mmc**, and then select **OK**.
1. Select **File** > **Add/Remove Snap-in**.
1. In the list of snap-ins, select **Certificates**, and then select **Add**.
1. In the **Certificates snap-in** pane, select **Computer account**, and then select **Next**.
1. Keep **Local computer** selected, select **Finish**, and then select **OK**.
1. In the **Certificates (Local Computer)** management console, expand the **Personal** folder and select the **Certificates** folder to view the installed certificates.

   :::image type="content" source="media/run-command/ldaps-certificate-personal-certficates.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the list of certificates in the management console." lightbox="media/run-command/ldaps-certificate-personal-certficates.png":::

1. Double-click the certificate for LDAPS. Ensure that the certificate date **Valid from** and **Valid to** is current and that the certificate has a private key that corresponds to the certificate.

   :::image type="content" source="media/run-command/ldaps-certificate-personal-general.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the properties of the LDAPS certificate." lightbox="media/run-command/ldaps-certificate-personal-general.png":::

1. In the same dialog, select the **Certification Path** tab and verify that the value for **Certification path** is valid. It should include the certificate chain of root CA and optional intermediate certificates. Check that the **Certificate status** is **OK**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/run-command/ldaps-certificate-cert-path.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the certificate chain on the Certification Path tab." lightbox="media/run-command/ldaps-certificate-cert-path.png":::

1. Select **OK**.

#### To export the certificate:

1. In the Certificates console, right-click the LDAPS certificate and select **All Tasks** > **Export**. The Certificate Export Wizard opens. Select **Next**.
1. In the **Export Private Key** section, select **No, do not export the private key**, and then select **Next**.
1. In the **Export File Format** section, select **Base-64 encoded X.509(.CER)**, and then select **Next**.
1. In the **File to Export** section, select **Browse**. Select a folder location to export the certificate, and enter a name. Then select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> If more than one domain controller is set to use LDAPS, repeat the export procedure for each additional domain controller to export their corresponding certificates. Note that you can reference only two LDAPS servers in the `New-LDAPSIdentitySource` Run tool. If the certificate is a wildcard certificate, such as `.avsdemo.net`, export the certificate from only one of the domain controllers.

## Upload the LDAPS certificate to blob storage and generate an SAS URL (Optional)

Next, upload the certificate file (in *.cer* format) you exported to an Azure Storage account as blob storage. Then, [grant access to Azure Storage resources by using an SAS](../storage/common/storage-sas-overview.md).

If you need multiple certificates, upload each one individually and generate an SAS URL for each certificate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to copy all SAS URL strings. The strings aren't accessible after you leave the page.

> [!TIP]
> An alternative method to consolidate certificates involves storing all the certificate chains in one file, as detailed in a [VMware knowledge base article](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=2041378). Then, generate a single SAS URL for the file that contains all the certificates.

## Set up NSX-T DNS for Windows Server Active Directory domain resolution

Create a DNS zone and add it to the DNS service. Complete the steps in [Configure a DNS forwarder in the Azure portal](./configure-dns-azure-vmware-solution.md).

After you complete these steps, verify that your DNS service includes your DNS zone.

:::image type="content" source="media/run-command/ldaps-dns-zone-service-configured.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the DNS service with the required DNS zone included." lightbox="media/run-command/ldaps-dns-zone-service-configured.png":::

Your Azure VMware Solution private cloud should now properly resolve your on-premises Windows Server Active Directory domain name.

## Add Windows Server Active Directory by using LDAP via SSL

To add Windows Server Active Directory over LDAP with SSL as an external identity source to use with SSO to vCenter Server, run the New-LDAPSIdentitySource cmdlet.

1. Go to your Azure VMware Solution private cloud and select **Run command** > **Packages** > **New-LDAPSIdentitySource**.

1. Provide the required values or modify the default values, and then select **Run**.

1. To see the progress, check **Notifications** or the **Run Execution Status** pane.

> [!WARNING]
> If you don't provide a value for **DomainName**, all external identity sources are removed. Run the cmdlet Update-IdentitySourceCredential only after the password is rotated in the domain controller.

## Renew existing certificates for LDAPS identity source

1. Renew the existing certificates in your domain controllers.

1. Optional: If the certificates are stored in default domain controllers, this step is optional. Leave the SSLCertificatesSasUrl parameter blank and the new certificates will be downloaded from the default domain controllers and updated in vCenter automatically. If you choose to not use the default way, [export the certificate for LDAPS authentication](#to-export-the-certificate) and [upload the LDAPS certificate to blob storage and generate an SAS URL](#upload-the-ldaps-certificate-to-blob-storage-and-generate-an-sas-url-optional). Save the SAS URL for the next step.

1. Select **Run command** > **Packages** > **Update-IdentitySourceCertificates**.

1. Provide the required values and the new SAS URL (optional), and then select **Run**.

   | **Field** | **Value** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **DomainName***  |  The FQDN of the domain, for example **avslab.local**.  |
   | **SSLCertificatesSasUrl (optional)**  | A comma-delimited list of SAS path URI to Certificates for authentication. Ensure permissions to read are included. To generate, place the certificates in any storage account blob and then right-click the cert and generate SAS. If the value of this field isn't provided by a user, the certificates will be downloaded from the default domain controllers.  |

1. Check **Notifications** or the **Run Execution Status** pane to see the progress.
