# Deploy and configure Azure VMware Solution

After you [plan your deployment](plan-private-cloud-deployment.md), deploy and configure your Azure VMware Solution private cloud. 

In this tutorial, you'll:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Register the resource provider and create a private cloud
> * Connect to a new or existing ExpressRoute virtual network gateway
> * Validate the network connection

Once you completed this section, follow the next steps provided at the end of this tutorial.

## Register the Microsoft.AVS resource provider

[!INCLUDE [register-resource-provider-steps](includes/register-resource-provider-steps.md)]

## Create an Azure VMware Solution private cloud

[!INCLUDE [create-private-cloud-azure-portal-steps](includes/create-private-cloud-azure-portal-steps.md)]

## Connect to Azure Virtual Network with ExpressRoute

In the planning phase, you defined whether to use an *existing* or *new* ExpressRoute virtual network gateway.  

>[!IMPORTANT]
>[!INCLUDE [disk-pool-planning-note](includes/disk-pool-planning-note.md)] 

### Use a new ExpressRoute virtual network gateway

>[!IMPORTANT]
>You must have a virtual network with a GatewaySubnet that **does not** already have a virtual network gateway.

| If | Then  |
| --- | --- |
| You don't already have a virtual network...     |  Create the following:<ol><li><a href="tutorial-configure-networking.md#create-a-virtual-network-manually">Virtual network</a></li><li><a href="../expressroute/expressroute-howto-add-gateway-portal-resource-manager.md#create-the-gateway-subnet">GatewaySubnet</a></li><li><a href="tutorial-configure-networking.md#create-a-virtual-network-gateway">Virtual network gateway</a></li><li><a href="tutorial-configure-networking.md#connect-expressroute-to-the-virtual-network-gateway">Connect ExpressRoute to the gateway</a></li></ol>        |

| You already have a virtual network **with** a GatewaySubnet... | Create the following: <ol><li><a href="tutorial-configure-networking.md#create-a-virtual-network-gateway">Virtual network gateway</a></li><li><a href="tutorial-configure-networking.md#connect-expressroute-to-the-virtual-network-gateway">Connect ExpressRoute to the gateway</a></li></ol>    |

### Use an existing virtual network gateway

[!INCLUDE [connect-expressroute-to-vnet](includes/connect-expressroute-vnet.md)]


## Validate the connection

Ensure connectivity between the Azure Virtual Network where the ExpressRoute terminates and the Azure VMware Solution private cloud. 

1. Use a [virtual machine](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal#create-virtual-machine) within the Azure Virtual Network where the Azure VMware Solution ExpressRoute terminates. For more information, see [Connect to Azure Virtual Network with ExpressRoute](#connect-to-azure-virtual-network-with-expressroute).  

   1. Sign in to the Azure [portal](https://portal.azure.com).

   1. Navigate to a running VM, and under **Settings**, select **Networking** and the network interface resource.

      :::image type="content" source="../virtual-network/media/diagnose-network-routing-problem/view-nics.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing virtual network interface settings in Azure portal.":::

   1. On the left, select **Effective routes**. A list of address prefixes that are contained within the `/22` CIDR block you entered during the deployment phase displays.

1. To sign in to both vCenter Server and NSX Manager, open a web browser and sign in to the same virtual machine used for network route validation.  

   Find the vCenter Server and NSX Manager console's IP addresses and credentials in the Azure portal.  Select your private cloud and then **Manage** > **VMware credentials**.

## Next steps

In the next tutorial, you'll connect Azure VMware Solution to your on-premises network through ExpressRoute.
