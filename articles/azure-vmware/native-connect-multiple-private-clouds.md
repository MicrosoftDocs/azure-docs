# Connect multiple Azure VMware Solution Generation 2 Private Clouds

In this article, you learn how to connect a Azure VMware Solution Generation 2 (Gen 2) private cloud to other Gen 2 private clouds.

## Prerequisite

Have multiple Azure VMware Solution Gen 2 private clouds deployed successfully.

## Connect multiple Azure VMware Solution Gen 2 

Private clouds deployed in different Azure Virtual Networks can be connected using Virtual Network peering. The Virtual Network peering provides the best possible throughput and latency between Azure VMware Solution private clouds in the same region. For more information about how to do Azure Virtual Network peering, see [Create, change, or delete a Virtual Network peering](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview).

Depending on the location of the private cloud, you may require local Virtual Network peering or a global Virtual Network peering.
