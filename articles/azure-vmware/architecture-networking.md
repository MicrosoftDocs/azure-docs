# Azure VMware Solution networking and interconnectivity concepts

[!INCLUDE [avs-networking-description](includes/azure-vmware-solution-networking-description.md)]

Azure VMware Solution private cloud offers two types of interconnectivity:

- [**Basic Azure-only interconnectivity**](#azure-virtual-network-interconnectivity) allows you to manage and use your private cloud with a single virtual network in Azure. This setup is ideal for evaluations or implementations that don't require access from on-premises environments.

- [**Full on-premises to private cloud interconnectivity**](#on-premises-interconnectivity) extends the basic Azure-only implementation to include interconnectivity between on-premises and Azure VMware Solution private clouds.

This article explains key networking and interconnectivity concepts, including requirements and limitations. It also provides the information you need to configure your networking with Azure VMware Solution.

## Azure VMware Solution private cloud use cases

The use cases for Azure VMware Solution private clouds include:

- New VMware vSphere VM workloads in the cloud
- VM workload bursting to the cloud (on-premises to Azure VMware Solution only)
- VM workload migration to the cloud (on-premises to Azure VMware Solution only)
- Disaster recovery (Azure VMware Solution to Azure VMware Solution or on-premises to Azure VMware Solution)
- Consumption of Azure services

> [!TIP]
> All use cases for the Azure VMware Solution service are enabled with on-premises to private cloud connectivity.

## Azure virtual network interconnectivity

You can interconnect your Azure virtual network with the Azure VMware Solution private cloud implementation. This connection allows you to manage your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, consume workloads in your private cloud, and access other Azure services.

The following diagram illustrates the basic network interconnectivity established during a private cloud deployment. It shows the logical networking between a virtual network in Azure and a private cloud. This connectivity is established via a backend ExpressRoute that is part of the Azure VMware Solution service. The interconnectivity supports the following primary use cases:

- Inbound access to vCenter Server and NSX Manager from VMs in your Azure subscription.
- Outbound access from VMs on the private cloud to Azure services.
- Inbound access to workloads running in the private cloud.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When connecting **production** Azure VMware Solution private clouds to an Azure virtual network, use an ExpressRoute virtual network gateway with the Ultra Performance Gateway SKU and enable FastPath to achieve 10Gbps connectivity. For less critical environments, use the Standard or High Performance Gateway SKUs for slower network performance.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to connect more than four Azure VMware Solution private clouds in the same Azure region to the same Azure virtual network, use [AVS Interconnect](connect-multiple-private-clouds-same-region.md) to aggregate private cloud connectivity within the Azure region.

## On-premises interconnectivity

In the fully interconnected scenario, you can access the Azure VMware Solution from your Azure virtual network(s) and on-premises. This implementation extends the basic implementation described in the previous section. An ExpressRoute circuit is required to connect from on-premises to your Azure VMware Solution private cloud in Azure.

The following diagram shows the on-premises to private cloud interconnectivity, which enables the following use cases:

- Hot/Cold vSphere vMotion between on-premises and Azure VMware Solution.
- On-premises to Azure VMware Solution private cloud management access.

For full interconnectivity to your private cloud, enable ExpressRoute Global Reach and then request an authorization key and private peering ID for Global Reach in the Azure portal. Use the authorization key and peering ID to establish Global Reach between an ExpressRoute circuit in your subscription and the ExpressRoute circuit for your private cloud. Once linked, the two ExpressRoute circuits route network traffic between your on-premises environments and your private cloud. For more information on the procedures, see the [tutorial for creating an ExpressRoute Global Reach peering to a private cloud](tutorial-expressroute-global-reach-private-cloud.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't advertise bogon routes over ExpressRoute from on-premises or your Azure VNet. Examples of bogon routes include 0.0.0.0/5 or 192.0.0.0/3.

## Route advertisement guidelines to Azure VMware Solution

Follow these guidelines when advertising routes from your on-premises and Azure virtual network to Azure VMware Solution over ExpressRoute:

| **Supported** |**Not supported**|
| ---------------| ---------------|
| Default route â€“ 0.0.0.0/0*| Bogon routes. For example: ``0.0.0.0/1, 128.0.0.0/1 0.0.0.0/5``, or ``192.0.0.0/3.``|
|RFC-1918 address blocks. For example: (``10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16``) or its subnets ( ``10.1.0.0/16, 172.24.0.0/16, 192.168.1.0/24``).| Special address block reserved by IANA. For example,``RFC 6598-100.64.0.0/10`` and its subnets. |
|Customer owned public-IP CIDR block or its subnets.||

> [!NOTE]
> The customer-advertised default route to Azure VMware Solution can't be used to route back the traffic when the customer accesses Azure VMware Solution management appliances (vCenter Server, NSX Manager, HCX Manager). The customer needs to advertise a more specific route to Azure VMware Solution for that traffic to be routed back.
