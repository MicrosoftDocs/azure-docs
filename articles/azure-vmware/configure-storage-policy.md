# Configure storage policy

VMware vSAN storage policies define storage requirements for your virtual machines (VMs). These policies guarantee the required level of service for your VMs because they determine how storage is allocated to the VM. Each VM deployed to a vSAN datastore is assigned at least one VM storage policy.

You can assign a VM storage policy in an initial deployment of a VM or when you do other VM operations, such as cloning or migrating. Post-deployment cloudadmin users or equivalent roles can't change the default storage policy for a VM. However, **VM storage policy** per disk changes is permitted.

The Run command lets authorized users change the default or existing VM storage policy to an available policy for a VM post-deployment. There are no changes made on the disk-level VM storage policy. You can always change the disk level VM storage policy as per your requirements.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that the [minimum level of hosts are met](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/cloud/vmware-cloud-on-aws/SaaS/operations-guide/managing-sddc-hosts-and-clusters/vsan-storage-in-vmware-cloud-on-aws/virtual-san-policies-aws.html).

|  **RAID configuration** | **Failures to tolerate (FTT)** | **Minimum hosts required** |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| RAID-1 (Mirroring) <br />Default setting.  | 1  | 3  |
| RAID-5 (Erasure Coding)  | 1  | 4  |
| RAID-1 (Mirroring)  | 2  | 5  |
| RAID-6 (Erasure Coding)  | 2  | 6  |
| RAID-1 (Mirroring)  | 3  | 7  |




## List storage policies

Run the `Get-StoragePolicy` cmdlet to list the vSAN based storage policies available to set on a VM.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

   >[!NOTE]
   >If you need access to the Azure US Gov portal, go to https://portal.azure.us/


1. Select **Run command** > **Packages** > **Get-StoragePolicies**.

1. Provide the required values or change the default values, and then select **Run**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/run-command/run-command-get-storage-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to list storage policies available. ":::

   | **Field** | **Value** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Retain up to**  | Retention period of the cmdlet output. The default value is 60.  |
   | **Specify name for execution**  | Alphanumeric name, for example, **Get-StoragePolicies-Exec1**. |
   | **Timeout**  |  The period after which a cmdlet exits if taking too long to finish.  |

1. Check **Notifications** to see the progress.




## Set storage policy on VM

Run the `Set-VMStoragePolicy` cmdlet to modify vSAN-based storage policies on a default cluster, individual VM, or group of VMs sharing a similar VM name. For example, if you have three VMs named "MyVM1", "MyVM2", and "MyVM3", supplying "MyVM*" to the VMName parameter would change the StoragePolicy on all three VMs.


> [!NOTE]
> You cannot use the vSphere Client to change the default storage policy or any existing storage policies for a VM.

1. Select **Run command** > **Packages** > **Set-VMStoragePolicy**.

1. Provide the required values or change the default values, and then select **Run**.

   | **Field** | **Value** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **VMName** | Name of the target VM. |
   | **StoragePolicyName** | Name of the storage policy to set. For example, **RAID-FTT-1**. |
   | **Retain up to**  | Retention period of the cmdlet output. The default value is 60.  |
   | **Specify name for execution**  | Alphanumeric name, for example, **changeVMStoragePolicy**.  |
   | **Timeout**  |  The period after which a cmdlet exits if taking too long to finish.  |

1. Check **Notifications** to see the progress.

## Set storage policy on all VMs in a location

Run the `Set-LocationStoragePolicy` cmdlet to Modify vSAN based storage policies on all VMs in a location where a location is the name of a cluster, resource pool, or folder. For example, if you have 3 VMs in Cluster-3, supplying "Cluster-3" would change the storage policy on all three VMs.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot use the vSphere Client to change the default storage policy or any existing storage policies for a VM.

1. Select **Run command** > **Packages** > **Set-LocationStoragePolicy**.

1. Provide the required values or change the default values, and then select **Run**.

   | **Field** | **Value** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Location** | Name of the target VM. |
   | **StoragePolicyName** | Name of the storage policy to set. For example, **RAID-FTT-1**. |
   | **Retain up to**  | Retention period of the cmdlet output. The default value is 60.  |
   | **Specify name for execution**  | Alphanumeric name, for example, **changeVMStoragePolicy**.  |
   | **Timeout**  |  The period after which a cmdlet exits if taking too long to finish.  |

1. Check **Notifications** to see the progress.



## Specify storage policy for a cluster

Run the `Set-ClusterDefaultStoragePolicy` cmdlet to specify default storage policy for a cluster,


1. Select **Run command** > **Packages** > **Set-ClusterDefaultStoragePolicy**.

1. Provide the required values or change the default values, and then select **Run**.

   | **Field** | **Value** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **ClusterName** | Name of the cluster. |
   | **StoragePolicyName** | Name of the storage policy to set. For example, **RAID-FTT-1**. |
   | **Retain up to**  | Retention period of the cmdlet output. The default value is 60.  |
   | **Specify name for execution**  | Alphanumeric name, for example, **Set-ClusterDefaultStoragePolicy-Exec1**.  |
   | **Timeout**  |  The period after which a cmdlet exits if taking too long to finish.  |

1. Check **Notifications** to see the progress.

## Create custom AVS storage policy

Run the `New-AVSStoragePolicy` cmdlet to create or overwrite an existing policy.
This function creates a new or overwrites an existing vSphere Storage Policy. Non vSAN-Based, vSAN Only, VMEncryption Only, Tag Only based and/or any combination of these policy types are supported.
> [!NOTE]
> You cannot modify existing AVS default storage policies.
> Certain options enabled in storage policies will produce warnings to associated risks.
