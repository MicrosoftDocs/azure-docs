# VMware HCX migration considerations

VMware HCX offers five options with the HCX Enterprise Edition license when migrating VMware vSphere virtual machines to the Azure VMware Solution:

- Cold Migration
- HCX vMotion
- Bulk Migration
- Replication Assisted vMotion
- OS Assisted Migration

The cost of the VMware HCX Enterprise Edition license is included in the cost of the Azure VMware Solution service.

## VMware HCX migration options

Each of these options has different advantages and disadvantages when used. You need to select the best options for your migration plan.

| **Migration Method** | **Migration Downtime** | **Scale** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Cold Migration | Long downtime | VM copy with Network File Copy (NFC) protocol, small scale |
| HCX vMotion | None | Serial migrations, small scale |
| Bulk Migration | Minimal downtime | VM shutdown (source site)/VM power-on (destination site), Parallel migrations, largest scale |
| Replication Assisted vMotion (RAV) | None | Parallel migrations, larger scale |
| OS Assisted Migration (OSAM) | Conversion downtime | Hyper-V and KVM workload migrations |

## VMware HCX architecture

The Azure VMware Solution deploys VMware HCX as an Add-On. A VMware HCX Service Mesh is used to connect two sites together, including a Layer 2 network extension. This allows VMware vSphere virtual machines to be migrated from the on-premises site to the Azure VMware Solution private cloud.
