# Backup solutions for Azure VMware Solution virtual machines (VMs)

A key principle of Azure VMware Solution is to enable you to continue to use your investments and your favorite VMware solutions running on Azure. Independent software vendor (ISV) technology support, validated with Azure VMware Solution, is an important part of this strategy. 

Our backup partners have industry-leading backup and restore solutions in VMware-based environments. Customers widely adopted these solutions for their on-premises deployments. These partners extended their solutions to Azure VMware Solution, using Azure to provide a backup repository and a storage target for long-term retention and archival.

Back up network traffic between Azure VMware Solution VMs and the backup repository in Azure travels over a high-bandwidth, low-latency link. Replication traffic across regions travels over the internal Azure backplane network, which lowers bandwidth costs for users.

>[!NOTE]
>**Support Guidance for 3P Backup and recovery solution customer(s):**
>For any issues related to 3 P backup and Recovery solutions, customers must contact the respective partner's support team directly. AVS does not provide direct support for partner products. If advanced troubleshooting becomes necessary, the partnerâ€™s support team engages AVS support as appropriate. We appreciate your understanding and recommend not opening a support request with Microsoft for partner solution-related matters.

> Azure VMware Solution supports the use of custom roles with equal or lesser privileges than the CloudAdmin role. Use the CloudAdmin role to create, modify, or delete custom roles with privileges less than or equal to their current role. Roles that have privileges greater than that of CloudAdmin is unsupported.
