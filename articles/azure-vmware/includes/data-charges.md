# Customer intent: "As a network architect, I want to understand the data charge implications of using Azure VMware Solution with ExpressRoute, so that I can optimize my cloud network costs and ensure budget adherence."

<!-- Used in faq.yml -->

Traffic in the Azure VMware Solution ExpressRoute circuit isn't metered. No billing for any Azure VMware Solution ExpressRoute circuit, or for Global Reach charges between Azure VMware Solution private clouds. This scenario includes Azure VMware Solution to on-premises, other than standard egress charges for traffic from your Azure ExpressRoute circuit connection to your on-premises site from Azure. These fees are charged according to Azure ExpressRoute pricing plans with the Metered Billing Model. If you're using the Azure ExpressRoute Unlimited Billing Model, egress traffic isn't charged. 

- **Azure VMware Solution to Azure Virtual Network** is through an internal ExpressRoute circuit and is free of cost, regardless of region location (same region or cross-region).

- **Azure VMware Solution to on-premises site** is done through Azure Virtual Network or ExpressRoute Global Reach (between the internal ExpressRoute and external ExpressRoute). It's still free aside from the standard egress charges (Metered Billing Model) from the ExpressRoute to on-premises network. For the Unlimited Billing Model, there are no data charges. 

For example:
          
- If we connect an Azure Virtual Network in Azure West Europe to an Azure VMware Solution private cloud in West Europe, there are no ExpressRoute charges other than the ExpressRoute gateway charges.
          
- If we connect an Azure Virtual Network in Azure North Europe to an Azure VMware Solution private cloud in West Europe, there are no ExpressRoute charges other than the ExpressRoute gateway charges.
          
- If you connect an Azure VMware Solution private cloud in West Europe to an Azure VMware Solution private cloud in North Europe via ExpressRoute Global Reach. There are no ExpressRoute Global Reach data transfer (egress and ingress) charges. There are charges when using an ExpressRoute gateway.
