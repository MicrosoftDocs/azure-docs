# Customer intent: "As a network administrator, I want to configure and manage connectivity between my on-premises environment and Azure VMware Solution, so that I can ensure seamless operation of our virtual machines and efficient resource management."

Azure VMware Solution offers a private cloud environment accessible from on-premises sites and Azure-based resources. Services such as Azure ExpressRoute, VPN connections, or Azure Virtual WAN deliver the connectivity. However, these services require specific network address ranges and firewall ports for enabling the services.

When you deploy a private cloud, private networks for management, provisioning, and vMotion get created. You use these private networks to access VMware vCenter Server and VMware NSX Manager and virtual machine vMotion or deployment.

[!INCLUDE [expressroute-global-reach](expressroute-global-reach.md)]

Virtual machines deployed on the private cloud are accessible to the internet through the [Azure Virtual WAN public IP](../enable-public-ip-nsx-edge.md) functionality. For new private clouds, internet access is disabled by default.
