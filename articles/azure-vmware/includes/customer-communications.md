# Customer intent: "As a cloud administrator, I want to set up activity log alerts for service notifications, so that I can stay informed about service issues and maintenance and take timely actions to ensure system reliability."

<!-- Used in introduction.md and faq.yml -->

You can find service issues, planned maintenance, health advisories, and security advisories notifications published through **Service Health** in the Azure portal. You can take timely actions when you set up activity log alerts for these notifications. For more information, see [Create Service Health alerts using the Azure portal](/azure/service-health/alerts-activity-log-service-notifications-portal#create-a-service-health-alert-using-the-azure-portal).
