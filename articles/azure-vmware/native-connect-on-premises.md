# Connect to an on-premises environment

You require network connectivity between the your Azure VMware Solution Generation 2 (Gen 2) private cloud and other networks you deployed in an Azure Virtual Network, on-premises, other Azure VMware Solution private clouds, or on the Internet. In this article, you learn how your Gen 2 private cloud gets connectivity to your on-premises environments.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have an Azure VMware Solution Gen 2 private cloud deployed successfully within your Azure Virtual Network.
- Ensure that you have a Virtual Network and a Virtual Network gateway created and fully provisioned. Follow the instructions to create a Virtual Network gateway for ExpressRoute. A Virtual Network gateway for ExpressRoute uses the GatewayType ExpressRoute, not VPN.
- Ensure you have an active ExpressRoute circuit provisioned.

## Connect to an on-premises environment

Connectivity to on-premises is performed using a standard ExpressRoute connection or Site-to-Site VPN. This is similar to the way customers establish connectivity between Azure Virtual Network and on-premises connectivity as described in the Azure Virtual Network documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> You can connect through VPN, but that information is out of scope for this article.
