# Tutorial: Scale clusters in a private cloud

To get the most out of your Azure VMware Solution private cloud experience, scale the clusters and hosts to reflect what you need for planned workloads. You can scale the clusters and hosts in a private cloud as required for your application workload.  You should address performance and availability limitations for specific services on a case-by-case basis.

[!INCLUDE [azure-vmware-solutions-limits](includes/azure-vmware-solutions-limits.md)]

In this tutorial, learn how to use the Azure portal to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Add a cluster to an existing private cloud
> * Add hosts to an existing cluster

## Prerequisites

You need an existing private cloud to complete this tutorial. If you don't already have a private cloud created, follow the [create a private cloud tutorial](tutorial-create-private-cloud.md) to create one.

If you are planning on using the AV64 SKU, define a network for the management and control plane. In your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, under **Manage**, select **Clusters** > **Add a cluster**. Then add the **Address block for AV64 clusters** (one /23 network or three /25 networks) under the **Extended address block** tab and select **Save**.

## Add a new cluster

1. In your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, under **Manage**, select **Clusters** > **Add a cluster**. Then select the required SKU from **Size of host** and specify the **Number of hosts** for the cluster. **Prices listed in image are for illustration only.**

We do not allow the mixing of AV36, AV36P, or AV52 SKUs within the same cluster. We only allow the addition of AV64 clusters to existing private clouds that are built with the AV36, AV36P, or AV52 SKUs in certain regions. [For more information](introduction.md#azure-vmware-solution-private-cloud-extension-with-av64-node-size).

2. The deployment of the new cluster will begin.

## Scale a cluster

> [!NOTE]
> Scaling down a cluster successfully requires all objects (VM/vmdk/iso/etc) on a vSAN datastore to be configured with a storage policy below or equal to [RAID level requirements](configure-storage-policy.md).
> Scaling down a cluster will place requested host(s) into maintenance mode prior to actual removal of host from vCenter inventory.

> [!CAUTION]
> Deleting a cluster terminates all running workloads and components and is an irreversible operation. Once you delete a cluster, you cannot recover the data.

1. In your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, under **Manage**, select **Clusters**.

2. Select the cluster you want to scale, select **More** (...), then select **Edit**.

3. Select **Add Host** to add a host to the cluster. Repeat that to reach the desired number of hosts, and then select **Save**.

   The addition of hosts to the cluster begins.

   >[!NOTE] 
   >The hosts will be added to the cluster in parallel.

## Next steps

If you require another Azure VMware Solution private cloud, [create another private cloud](tutorial-create-private-cloud.md) following the same networking prerequisites, cluster, and host limits.
