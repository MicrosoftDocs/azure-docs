# Move Azure VMware Solution subscription to another subscription

This article describes how to move an Azure VMware Solution subscription to another subscription. You might move your subscription for various reasons, like billing.

## Prerequisites

You should have at least contributor rights on both **source** and **target** subscriptions.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>VNet and VNet gateway can't be moved from one subscription to another. Additionally, moving your subscriptions has no impact on the management and workloads, like the vCenter Server, NSX-T Data Center, vSAN, and workload virtual machines.

## Prepare and move

1. In the Azure portal, select the private cloud you want to move.
