# Install and activate VMware HCX in Azure VMware Solution

[VMware HCX](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/hcx/vmware-hcx/4-9.html) is an application mobility platform designed for simplifying application migration, rebalancing workloads, and optimizing disaster recovery across data centers and clouds. 

VMware HCX has two component services: **HCX Cloud Manager** and **HCX Connector**. These components work together for VMware HCX operations.  

This article shows you how to install and activate the VMware HCX Cloud Manager and VMware HCX Connector components. 

HCX Cloud manager is typically deployed as the destination (cloud side), but it can also be used as the source in cloud-to-cloud deployments. HCX Connector is deployed at the source (on-premises environment). A download link is provided for deploying HCX Connector appliance from within the HCX Cloud Manager. 

This article also teaches you how to do the following tasks:

* Install VMware HCX Cloud through the Azure portal.
* Download and deploy the VMware HCX Connector in on-premises.
* Activate VMware HCX with a license key.

After HCX is deployed, follow the recommended [Next steps](#next-steps). 

## Prerequisite

## VMware HCX license edition 

HCX offers various [services](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/hcx/vmware-hcx/4-9/vmware-hcx-user-guide-4-9/vmware-hcx-services.html) based on the type of license installed with the system. Advanced delivers basic connectivity and mobility services to enable hybrid interconnect and migration services. HCX Enterprise offers more services than what standard licenses provide. Some of those services include; Mobility Groups, Replication assisted vMotion (RAV), Mobility Optimized Networking, Network Extension High availability, OS assisted Migration, and others. 

>[!Note]
> VMware HCX Enterprise is available for Azure VMware Solution customers at no additional cost.  

- HCX is now installed as Enterprise for all new HCX installations in Azure VMware solution. 
- Existing HCX Advanced customers can upgrade to HCX Enterprise using the Azure portal. Use the following steps to upgrade to HCX Enterprise using Azure portal.

    1. Under **Manage** in the left navigation, select **Add-ons**, then the **Migration using HCX** tab.

        >[!IMPORTANT]
        > If you upgraded VMware HCX from advanced to Enterprise, enable the new features in the compute profile and perform resync in service mesh to select a new feature like, Replication Assisted vMotion (RAV).

    4. Change Compute profile after HCX upgrade to HCX Enterprise.

        1. On HCX UI, select **Infrastructure** > **Interconnect**, then select **Edit**.
        1. Select services you want activated like, Replication Assisted vMotion (RAV) and OS assisted Migration, which is available with VMware HCX Enterprise only.
        1. Select **Continue**, review the settings, then select **Finish** to create the Compute Profile.

    5. If compute profile is being used in service mesh(es), resync service mesh.

        1. Go to **Interconnect** > **Service Mesh**.
        1. Select **Resync**, then verify that the changes appear in the Service Mesh configuration.

- Downgrading from HCX Enterprise Edition to HCX Advanced is possible without redeploying. 

    1. Verify that you reverted to an HCX Advanced configuration state and you aren't using the Enterprise features. 
    1. If you plan to downgrade, verify that no scheduled migrations, [Enterprise services](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/hcx/vmware-hcx/4-9/vmware-hcx-user-guide-4-9/vmware-hcx-services.html) like RAV and HCX MON, etc. are in use. Open a [support request](https://rc.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Support) to request downgrade.

1. Sign in to the on-premises VMware HCX Manager at `https://HCXManagerIP:9443` with the `admin` credentials.  Make sure to include the `9443` port number with the VMware HCX Manager IP address.

   >[!TIP]
   > You defined the **admin** user password during the VMware HCX Manager OVA file deployment. 

1. In **Licensing**, enter your key for **HCX Advanced Key** and select **Activate**. 
    >[!IMPORTANT] 
    >VMware HCX Manager must have open internet access or a proxy configured. 
1. In **Datacenter Location**, provide the nearest location for installing the VMware HCX Manager on-premises. Then select **Continue**. 
1. In **System Name**, modify the name or accept the default and select **Continue**. 
1. Select **Yes, Continue**. 
1. In **Connect your vCenter**, provide the FQDN or IP address of your vCenter server and the appropriate credentials, and then select **Continue**. 
   >[!TIP] 
   >The vCenter Server is where you deployed the VMware HCX Connector in your datacenter. 

1. In **Configure SSO/PSC**, provide your Platform Services Controller's FQDN or IP address, and select **Continue**. 
   >[!NOTE] 
   >Typically, it's the same as your vCenter Server FQDN or IP address. 
1. Verify that the information entered is correct and select **Restart**. 
   >[!NOTE] 
   > You'll experience a delay after restarting before being prompted for the next step. 

After the services restart, you'll see vCenter Server displayed as green on the screen that appears. Both vCenter Server and SSO must have the appropriate configuration parameters, which should be the same as the previous screen.
