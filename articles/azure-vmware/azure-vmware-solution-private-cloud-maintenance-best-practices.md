# Azure VMware Solution Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) maintenance best practices

Azure VMware Solution undertakes periodic maintenance of the private cloud. This maintenance includes security patches, minor and major updates to VMware software stack. This page describes the host monitoring, remediation, and recommended best practices that help keep the private cloud ready for maintenance.

## Host maintenance and lifecycle management

[!INCLUDE [vmware-software-update-frequency](includes/vmware-software-update-frequency.md)]

## Host monitoring and remediation

Azure VMware Solution continuously monitors the health of both the VMware components and underlay. When Azure VMware Solution detects a failure, it takes action to repair the failed components. When Azure VMware Solution detects a degradation or failure on an Azure VMware Solution node, it triggers the host remediation process.

Host remediation involves replacing the faulty node with a new healthy node in the cluster. Then, when possible, the faulty host is placed in VMware vSphere maintenance mode. VMware vSphere vMotion moves the VMs off the faulty host to other available servers in the cluster, potentially allowing zero downtime for live migration of workloads. If the faulty host can't be placed in maintenance mode, the host is removed from the cluster. Before the faulty host is removed, the customer workloads are migrated to a newly added host.

> [!TIP]
> **Customer communication:** An email is sent to the customer's email address before the replacement is initiated and again after the replacement is successful. 
> 
> To receive emails related to host replacement, you need to be added to any of the following Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles in the subscription: 'ServiceAdmin', 'CoAdmin', 'Owner', 'Contributor'.

Azure VMware Solution monitors the following conditions on the host:

- Processor status
- Memory status
- Connection and power state
- Hardware fan status
- Network connectivity loss
- Hardware system board status
- Errors occurred on one or more disks of a vSAN host
- Hardware voltage
- Hardware temperature status
- Hardware power status
- Storage status
- Connection failure

## Maintenance Operations Best Practices
The following actions are always recommended for ensuring host maintenance operations are carried out successfully:
- **vSAN storage utilization:** To maintain Service Level Agreement (SLA), ensure that your vSphere cluster's storage space utilization remains below 75%. If the utilization exceeds 75%, upgrades may take longer than expected or fail entirely. If your storage utilization exceeds 75%, consider adding a node to expand the cluster and prevent potential downtime during upgrades.
- **Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) rules:** DRS VM-VM anti-affinity rules must be configured in a way to have at least (N+1) hosts in the cluster, where N is the number of VMs part of DRS rule.
- **Failures To Tolerate (FTT) violation:** To prevent data loss, change VMs configured with a vSAN storage policy for Failures to Tolerate (FTT) of 0 to a vSAN storage policy compliant with [Microsoft SLA](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services?lang=1) (FTT=1 for up to five hosts in a cluster and FTT=2 for six or more hosts in a cluster) and ensure host maintenance operations can carried out seamlessly.
- **Remove VM CD-ROM mounts:** VMs mounted with "Emulate mode" CD-ROMs block host maintenance. Ensure CD-ROMs are mounted in "Passthrough mode".
- **Serial/parallel port or external device:** If you're using an image file (ISO, FLP, etc.), ensure that it's accessible from all ESXi hosts in the cluster. Store the files on a datastore that are shared between all ESXi Servers that participate in the vMotion of the virtual machine. For more information, see [Broadcom KB article](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/324829/vmotion-fails-with-the-compatibility-err.html).
- **Orphaned VMs:** In the case of an orphaned virtual machine, the Virtual Machine (VM) needs to be either re-registered if possible (if it hasn't been deleted) or removed from inventory. For more information, see [Broadcom KB article](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/312831/virtual-machines-appear-as-invalid-or-or.html).
- **SCSI shared controller:** When using SCSI bus sharing use with bus type as "Physical" for VMs. VMs connected to Virtual SCSCI controllers will be powered-off. For more information, see [Broadcom KB article](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=2147661).
- **Third-party VMs & applications:** For third-party VMs & applications:
    - Ensure that third-party solutions deployed on Azure VMware Solution are compliant and don't interfere with maintenance operations.   
    - Ensure that the VM isn’t installed with a VM-Host "Must run" DRS rule. Additionally, verify that these applications are compatible with upcoming versions of the VMware stack.
    - Consult with your solution vendor and update in advance if necessary to maintain compatibility post-upgrade.


## Alert Codes and Remediation Table

> [!NOTE]
> Azure VMware Solution tenant admins must not edit or delete the previously defined VMware vCenter Server alarms because they're managed by the Azure VMware Solution control plane on vCenter Server. These alarms are used by Azure VMware Solution monitoring to trigger the Azure VMware Solution host remediation process.
