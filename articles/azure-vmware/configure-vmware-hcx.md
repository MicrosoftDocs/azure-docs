# Configure on-premises VMware HCX Connector

After you [install the VMware HCX add-on](install-vmware-hcx.md), configure the on-premises VMware HCX Connector for your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.

In this article, learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Pair your on-premises VMware HCX Connector with your Azure VMware > Solution HCX Cloud Manager
> * Configure the network profile, compute profile, and service mesh
> * Check the appliance status and validate that migration is possible

After you complete these steps, you'll have a production-ready environment for creating virtual machines (VMs) and migration.

## Prerequisites

- Install [VMware HCX Connector](install-vmware-hcx.md).

- VMware HCX Enterprise is now available and supported on Azure VMware Solution at no extra cost. HCX Enterprise is automatically installed for all new HCX add-on requests, and existing HCX Advanced customers can upgrade to HCX Enterprise using the Azure portal. 

- If you plan to [enable VMware HCX MON](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/hcx/vmware-hcx/4-9/vmware-hcx-user-guide-4-9/extending-networks-with-vmware-hcx/hcx-network-extension-with-mobility-optimized-networking/configuring-hcx-mobility-optimized-networking.html), make sure you have:  

   - VMware NSX or vSphere Distributed Switch (vDS) on-premises for HCX Network Extension (vSphere Standard Switch not supported).

   - One or more active stretched network segments.


- Meet the [VMware software version requirements](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/hcx/vmware-hcx/4-9/vmware-hcx-user-guide-4-9/preparing-for-hcx-installations/software-version-requirements.html).

- Your on-premises vSphere environment (source environment) meets the [minimum requirements](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/hcx/vmware-hcx/4-9/vmware-hcx-user-guide-4-9/preparing-for-hcx-installations/system-requirements-for-hcx.html).

- [Azure ExpressRoute Global Reach](tutorial-expressroute-global-reach-private-cloud.md) is configured between on-premises and Azure VMware Solution private cloud ExpressRoute circuits.

- [All required ports](https://ports.broadcom.com/home/VMware-HCX) are open for communication between on-premises components and Azure VMware Solution private.

- [Define VMware HCX network segments](plan-private-cloud-deployment.md#define-vmware-hcx-network-segments).  The primary use cases for VMware HCX are workload migrations and disaster recovery.

- [Review the VMware HCX Documentation](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/hcx/vmware-hcx/4-9/vmware-hcx-user-guide-4-9/overview.html) for information on using HCX.

## Add a site pairing

In your data center, connect or pair the VMware HCX Cloud Manager in Azure VMware Solution with the VMware HCX Connector.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> According to the [Azure VMware Solution limits](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-vmware-solution-limits), a single HCX manager system can have a maximum of 25 site pairs and 10 service meshes, including inbound and outbound site pairings.

1. Sign in to your on-premises vCenter Server, and under **Home**, select **HCX**.

1. Under **Infrastructure**, select **Site Pairing** and choose the **Connect to Remote Site** option (in the middle of the screen).

1. Enter the Azure VMware Solution HCX Cloud Manager URL or IP address that you noted earlier `https://x.x.x.9` and the credentials for a user with the CloudAdmin role in your private cloud. Then select **Connect**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > To successfully establish a site pair:
   > * Your VMware HCX Connector must be able to route to your HCX Cloud Manager IP over port 443.
   >
   > * A service account from your external identity source, such as Active Directory, is recommended for site pairing connections. For more information about setting up separate accounts for connected services, see [Access and identity architecture](./architecture-identity.md).

   A screen displays the connection (pairing) between your VMware HCX Cloud Manager in Azure VMware Solution and your on-premises VMware HCX Connector.

## Create network profiles

VMware HCX Connector deploys a subset of virtual appliances (automated) that require multiple IP segments. Create your network profiles using the IP segments identified during the [planning phase](plan-private-cloud-deployment.md#define-vmware-hcx-network-segments). Create four network profiles:

   - Management
   - vMotion
   - Replication
   - Uplink
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > * For Azure VMware Solution connected via VPN, set Uplink Network Profile MTU's to 1350 to account for IPSec overhead.
   > * Azure VMware Solution defaults to 1500 MTU, which is sufficient for most ExpressRoute implementations.
   >   * If your ExpressRoute provider does not support jumbo frames, you may need to lower the MTU in ExpressRoute setups as well.
   >   * Adjust MTU settings on both HCX Connector (on-premises) and HCX Cloud Manager (Azure VMware Solution) network profiles.

1. Under **Infrastructure**, select **Interconnect** > **Multi-Site Service Mesh** > **Network Profiles** > **Create Network Profile**.

## Create a service mesh

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure port UDP 4500 is open between your on-premises VMware HCX Connector 'uplink' network profile addresses and the Azure VMware Solution HCX Cloud 'uplink' network profile addresses. (UDP 500 was required in legacy versions of HCX. See https://ports.vmware.com for the latest information.)

1. Under **Infrastructure**, select **Interconnect** > **Service Mesh** > **Create Service Mesh**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-vmware-hcx/create-service-mesh.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to create a service mesh in the vSphere Client." lightbox="media/tutorial-vmware-hcx/create-service-mesh.png":::

1. Review the prepopulated sites, and then select **Continue**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If this is your first service mesh configuration, you won't need to modify this screen.

1. Select the source and remote compute profiles from the drop-down lists, and then select **Continue**.

   The selections define the resources where VMs can consume VMware HCX services.

   > [!NOTE]
   > In a mixed-mode SDDC with an AV64 cluster, deploying service mesh appliances on the AV64 cluster is not viable or supported. Nevertheless, this doesn't impede you from conducting HCX migration or network extension directly onto AV64 clusters. The deployment container can be cluster-1, hosting the HCX appliances. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-vmware-hcx/select-compute-profile-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting the source compute profile." lightbox="media/tutorial-vmware-hcx/select-compute-profile-source.png":::

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-vmware-hcx/select-compute-profile-remote.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting the remote compute profile." lightbox="media/tutorial-vmware-hcx/select-compute-profile-remote.png":::

1. Review services to be enabled, and then select **Continue**.

1. In **Advanced Configuration - Override Uplink Network profiles**, select **Continue**.

   Uplink network profiles connect to the network through which the remote site's interconnect appliances can be reached.

1. In **Advanced Configuration - Network Extension Appliance Scale Out**, review and select **Continue**.

   You can have up to eight VLANs per appliance, but you can deploy another appliance to add another eight VLANs. You must also have IP space to account for the more appliances, and it's one IP per appliance. For more information, see [VMware HCX Configuration Limits](https://configmax.broadcom.com/guest?vmwareproduct=VMware%20HCX&release=VMware%20HCX&categories=41-0,42-0,43-0,44-0,45-0).

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-vmware-hcx/extend-networks-increase-vlan.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to increase the VLAN count." lightbox="media/tutorial-vmware-hcx/extend-networks-increase-vlan.png":::

1. In **Advanced Configuration - Traffic Engineering**, review and make any modifications that you feel are necessary, and then select **Continue**.

1. Review the topology preview and select **Continue**.

1. Enter a user-friendly name for this service mesh and select **Finish** to complete.

1. Select **View Tasks** to monitor the deployment.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-vmware-hcx/monitor-service-mesh.png" alt-text="Screenshot displaying the button to view tasks.":::

   When the service mesh deployment finishes successfully, the services show as green.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-vmware-hcx/service-mesh-green.png" alt-text="Screenshot displaying green indicators on services." lightbox="media/tutorial-vmware-hcx/service-mesh-green.png":::

1. Verify the service mesh's health by checking the appliance status.

1. Select **Interconnect** > **Appliances**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-vmware-hcx/interconnect-appliance-state.png" alt-text="Screenshot displaying options to check the status of the appliance." lightbox="media/tutorial-vmware-hcx/interconnect-appliance-state.png":::

   >[!NOTE]
   >After establishing the service mesh, you may notice a new datastore and a new host in your private cloud. This is normal behavior after establishing a service mesh.

The HCX interconnect tunnel status should display **UP** in green. Now you're ready to migrate and protect Azure VMware Solution VMs using VMware HCX. Azure VMware Solution supports workload migrations with or without a network extension that allow you to migrate workloads in your vSphere environment, create networks on-premises, and deploy VMs onto those networks. For more information, see the [VMware HCX Documentation](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/hcx/vmware-hcx/4-9.html).
