# Integrate Microsoft Defender for Cloud with Azure VMware Solution 

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides advanced threat protection across your Azure VMware Solution and on-premises virtual machines (VMs). It assesses the vulnerability of Azure VMware Solution VMs and raises alerts as needed. These security alerts can be forwarded to Azure Monitor for resolution. You can define security policies in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. For more information, see [Working with security policies](../security-center/tutorial-security-policy.md).

Microsoft Defender for Cloud offers many features, including:

- File integrity monitoring
- Fileless attack detection
- Operating system patch assessment
- Security misconfigurations assessment
- Endpoint protection assessment

The diagram shows the integrated monitoring architecture of integrated security for Azure VMware Solution VMs.

**Log Analytics agent** collects log data from Azure, Azure VMware Solution, and on-premises VMs. The log data is sent to Azure Monitor Logs and stored in a **Log Analytics Workspace**. Each workspace has its own data repository and configuration to store data.  Once the logs are collected, **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** assesses the vulnerability status of Azure VMware Solution VMs and raises an alert for any critical vulnerability. Once assessed, Microsoft Defender for Cloud forwards the vulnerability status to Microsoft Sentinel to create an incident and map with other threats.  Microsoft Defender for Cloud is connected to Microsoft Sentinel using Microsoft Defender for Cloud Connector.

## Prerequisites

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-security-integration/view-recommendations-assessments.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Microsoft Defender for Cloud security recommendations and assessments."lightbox="media/azure-security-integration/view-recommendations-assessments.png":::

## Deploy a Microsoft Sentinel workspace

Microsoft Sentinel provides security analytics, alert detection, and automated threat response across an environment. It's a cloud-native, security information event management (SIEM) solution built on top of a Log Analytics workspace.

Since Microsoft Sentinel is built on top of a Log Analytics workspace, you only need to select the workspace you want to use.

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Microsoft Sentinel**, and select it.

2. On the Microsoft Sentinel workspaces page, select **+Add**.

3. Select the Log Analytics workspace and select **Add**.

## Enable data collector for security events

1. On the Microsoft Sentinel workspaces page, select the configured workspace.

2. Under Configuration, select **Data connectors**.

3. Under the Connector Name column, select **Security Events** from the list, then select **Open connector page**.

4. On the connector page, select the events you wish to stream, then select **Apply Changes**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-security-integration/select-events-you-want-to-stream.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Security Events page in Microsoft Sentinel where you can select which events to stream."lightbox="media/azure-security-integration/select-events-you-want-to-stream.png":::

## Connect Microsoft Sentinel with Microsoft Defender for Cloud  

1. On the Microsoft Sentinel workspace page, select the configured workspace.

2. Under Configuration, select **Data connectors**.

3. Select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** from the list, then select **Open connector page**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-security-integration/connect-security-center-with-azure-sentinel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Data connectors page in Microsoft Sentinel showing selection to connect Microsoft Defender for Cloud with Microsoft Sentinel."lightbox="media/azure-security-integration/connect-security-center-with-azure-sentinel.png":::

4. Select **Connect** to connect the Microsoft Defender for Cloud with Microsoft Sentinel.

5. Enable **Create incident** to generate an incident for Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

## Create rules to identify security threats

After connecting data sources to Microsoft Sentinel, you can create rules to generate alerts for detected threats. In the following example, we create a rule for attempts to sign in to Windows server with the wrong password.

1. On the Microsoft Sentinel overview page, under Configurations, select **Analytics**.

2. Under Configurations, select **Analytics**.

3. Select **+Create** and on the drop-down, select **Scheduled query rule**.

4. On the **General** tab, enter the required information and then select **Next: Set rule logic**.

    - Name
    - Description
    - Tactics
    - Severity
    - Status

5. On the **Set rule logic** tab, enter the required information, then select **Next**.

    - Rule query (here showing our example query)
    
        ```
        SecurityEvent
        |where Activity startswith '4625'
        |summarize count () by IpAddress,Computer
        |where count_ > 3
        ```

    - Map entities
    - Query scheduling
    - Alert threshold
    - Event grouping
    - Suppression

6. On the **Incident settings** tab, enable **Create incidents from alerts triggered by this analytics rule** and select **Next: Automated response**.
 
    :::image type="content" source="../sentinel/media/create-analytics-rules/general-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Analytic rule wizard for creating a new rule in Microsoft Sentinel.":::

7. Select **Next: Review**.

8. On the **Review and create** tab, review the information, and select **Create**.

>[!TIP]
>After the third failed attempt to sign in to Windows server, the created rule triggers an incident for every unsuccessful attempt.

## View alerts

You can view generated incidents with Microsoft Sentinel. You can also assign incidents and close them once they're resolved, all from within Microsoft Sentinel.

1. Go to the Microsoft Sentinel overview page.

2. Under Threat Management, select **Incidents**.

3. Select an incident and then assign it to a team for resolution.

    :::image type="content" source="media/azure-security-integration/assign-incident.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Microsoft Sentinel Incidents page with incident selected and option to assign the incident for resolution."lightbox="media/azure-security-integration/assign-incident.png":::

>[!TIP]
>After resolving the issue, you can close it.

## Hunt security threats with queries

You can create queries or use the available predefined query in Microsoft Sentinel to identify threats in your environment. The following steps run a predefined query.

1. On the Microsoft Sentinel overview page, under Threat management, select **Hunting**. A list of predefined queries is displayed.

   >[!TIP]
   >You can also create a new query by selecting **New Query**.
