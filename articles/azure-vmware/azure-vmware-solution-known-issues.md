| After my private cloud NSX-T Data Center upgrade to version [3.2.2](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX/3.2.2/rn/vmware-nsxt-data-center-322-release-notes/index.html), the NSX-T Manager **DNS - Forwarder Upstream Server Timeout** alarm is raised | February 2023  | [Enable private cloud internet Access](architecture-design-public-internet-access.md), alarm is raised because NSX-T Manager can't access the configured CloudFlare DNS server. Otherwise, [change the default DNS zone to point to a valid and reachable DNS server.](configure-dns-azure-vmware-solution.md) | February 2023 |
| When first logging in to the vSphere Client, the **Cluster-n: vSAN health alarms are suppressed** alert is active in the vSphere Client | 2021  | The alert should be considered an informational message, since Microsoft manages the service. Select the **Reset to Green** link to clear it. | 2021 |
| When adding a cluster to my private cloud, the **Cluster-n: vSAN physical disk alarm 'Operation'** and **Cluster-n: vSAN cluster alarm 'vSAN Cluster Configuration Consistency'** alerts are active in the vSphere Client | 2021  | This alert should be considered an informational message, since Microsoft manages the service. Select the **Reset to Green** link to clear it. | 2021 |
| After my private cloud NSX-T Data Center upgrade to version [3.2.2](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX/3.2.2/rn/vmware-nsxt-data-center-322-release-notes/index.html), the NSX-T Manager **Capacity - Maximum Capacity Threshold** alarm is raised | 2023  | Alarm raised because there are more than four clusters in the private cloud with the medium form factor for the NSX-T Data Center Unified Appliance. The form factor needs to be scaled up to large. This issue should get detected through Microsoft, however you can also open a support request. | 2023 |
| When I build a VMware HCX Service Mesh with the Enterprise license, the Replication Assisted vMotion Migration option isn't available. | 2023  | The default VMware HCX Compute Profile doesn't have the Replication Assisted vMotion Migration option enabled.

| [VMSA-2023-023](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2023-0023.html) VMware vCenter Server Out-of-Bounds Write Vulnerability (CVE-2023-34048) publicized in October 2023 | October 2023  | A risk assessment of CVE-2023-03048 was conducted and it was determined that sufficient controls are in place within Azure VMware Solution to reduce the risk of CVE-2023-03048 from a CVSS Base Score of 9.8 to an adjusted Environmental Score of [6.8](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/MAC:L/MPR:H/MUI:R) or lower. Adjustments from the base score were possible due to the network isolation of the Azure VMware Solution vCenter Server (ports 2012, 2014, and 2020 aren't exposed via any interactive network path) and multiple levels of authentication and authorization necessary to gain interactive access to the vCenter Server network segment. Azure VMware Solution is currently rolling out [7.0U3o](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-vcenter-server-70u3o-release-notes/index.html) to address this issue. | March 2024 - Resolved in [ESXi 7.0U3o](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-vcenter-server-70u3o-release-notes/index.html) |
