| [VMSA-2023-023](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2023-0023.html) VMware vCenter Server Out-of-Bounds Write Vulnerability (CVE-2023-34048) publicized in October 2023 | October 2023  | A risk assessment of CVE-2023-03048 was conducted and it was determined that sufficient controls are in place within Azure VMware Solution to reduce the risk of CVE-2023-03048 from a CVSS Base Score of 9.8 to an adjusted Environmental Score of [6.8](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/MAC:L/MPR:H/MUI:R) or lower. Adjustments from the base score were possible due to the network isolation of the Azure VMware Solution vCenter Server (ports 2012, 2014, and 2020 aren't exposed via any interactive network path) and multiple levels of authentication and authorization necessary to gain interactive access to the vCenter Server network segment. Azure VMware Solution is currently rolling out [7.0U3o](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-vcenter-server-70u3o-release-notes/index.html) to address this issue. | March 2024 - Resolved in [ESXi 7.0U3o](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-vcenter-server-70u3o-release-notes/index.html) |
