|Issue | Date discovered | Workaround | Date resolved |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------ | :------------- | :------------- |
| Creating stateful firewall rules associated with Azure VMware Solution default Tier-0 NSX-T causes unwanted behavior. | May 2025 | Azure VMware Solution deploys with a stateless NSX-T Tier-0 router.  As such, stateful firewall rules are incompatible even though the NSX-T UI may allow it.  Apply stateful services and/or firewall rules at the Tier-1 router. | N/A
| AV64 hosts running vSAN Express Storage Architecture (ESA), may see a High pNIC errors due to buffer overflows. [Getting alarm in relation to "High pNic error rate detected" on hosts in vSAN clusters when using Mellanox NICs](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/392333/getting-alarm-in-relation-to-high-pnic-e.html) | June 2025 |  The alert should be considered an informational message, since Microsoft manages the service.

|[VMSA-2025-0012](https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/25738) Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-22243, CVE-2025-22244, CVE-2025-22245) have been identified in VMware NSX. | May 2025 | The vulnerability described in the Broadcom document does not apply to Azure VMware Solution due to existing compensating controls mitigate the risk of exploitation. | The upcoming version of NSX will include a patch to address this vulnerability. |
|[VMSA-2025-0010](https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/25717) Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-41225, CVE-2025-41226, CVE-2025-41227, CVE-2025-41228) have been identified in VMware ESXi and vCenter Server. | May 2025 | Microsoft, in collaboration with Broadcom/VMware, has confirmed the applicability of these vulnerabilities to Azure VMware Solution (AVS). Existing security controls, including cloudadmin role restrictions and network isolation, are deemed to significantly mitigate the impact of these vulnerabilities prior to official patching. The vulnerabilities have been adjudicated with a combined adjusted Environmental Score of [6.8](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3-1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H) within the Azure VMware Solution. Until the update is fully addressed, customers are advised to exercise additional caution when granting administrative access to guest virtual machines and to actively monitor any administrative activities performed on them. | N/A |
|[VMSA-2025-0007](https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/25683) VMware Tools update addresses an insecure file handling vulnerability (CVE-2025-22247). | May 2025 | To remediate CVE-2025-22247, apply version 12.5.2 of VMware Tools, use the Azure VMware Solution Run command ``Set-Tools-Repo.`` | May 2025 |
| ESXi hosts may experience operational issues if NSX Layer-2 DFW default rule logging is enabled. More information can be obtained in this Knowledge Base article from Broadcom: [ESXi hosts may experience operational issues if L2 DFW default rule logging is enabled.](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/326455/esxi-hosts-may-experience-operational-is.html) | May 2025 | It is not recommended to enable logging on the default Layer-2 DFW rule in a Production environment for any sustained period of time. If logging must be enabled on an L2 rule, it is advised to create a new L2 rule specific to the traffic flow in question and enable logging on that rule only. Please see [Broadcom Knowledge Base Article 326455.](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/326455/esxi-hosts-may-experience-operational-is.html).| N/A |
| With VMware HCX versions 4.10.3 and earlier, attempts to download upgrade bundles or the Connector OVA directly from the HCX Manager UI (port 443) fail due to the decommissioning of the external image depot server. More information can be obtained in this Knowledge Base article from Broadcom: [Upgrade Bundle Download from 443 UI will Fail in All HCX versions prior to 4.11](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/395372)| April 2025 | We will begin upgrading all Azure VMware Solution customers to HCX 4.11.0 in the coming weeks, this will provide customers with access to the HCX Connector upgrade bundles, which will be stored on their vSAN datastore. Until then, all customers will need to submit a support request (SR) to obtain the required upgrade bundles. | May 2025 |
|[VMSA-2025-0005](https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/25518) VMware Tools for Windows update addresses an authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2025-22230). | April 2025 | To remediate CVE-2025-22230, apply version 12.5.1 of VMware Tools, use the Azure VMware Solution Run command ``Set-Tools-Repo.`` | May 2025 |
| If you're a user of AV64, you may notice a “Status of other hardware objects” alarm on your hosts in vCenter Server. This alarm doesn't indicate a hardware issue. It's triggered when the System Event Log (SEL) reaches its capacity threshold according to vCenter Server. Despite the alarm, the host remains healthy with no hardware-related error signatures detected, and no high availability (HA) events are expected as a result. It's safe to continue operating your private cloud without interruption. The alarm has only two possible states—green and red—with no intermediate warning state. Once the status changes to red, it will remain red even if conditions improve to what would typically qualify as a warning. | April 2025 | This alarm should be treated as a warning and won't affect operability of your private cloud. Microsoft adjusts thresholds for the alarm, so it doesn't alert in vCenter Server. | May 2025 |
| After deploying an AV48 private cloud, you may see a High pNIC error rate detected. Check the host's vSAN performance view for details if alert is active in the vSphere Client.  | April 2025  | The alert should be considered an informational message, since Microsoft manages the service. Select the **Reset to Green** link to clear it. | April 2025 |

Customers are advised to take additional precautions when granting administrative access to, and monitor any administrative activities on, guest VMs until the update is fully addressed. For additional information on the vulnerability and Microsoft’s involvement, please see [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azuremigrationblog/azure-vmware-solution-broadcom-vmsa-2025-0004-remediation/4388074).

Adjustments from the base scores were possible due to the network isolation of the Azure VMware Solution vCenter Server DCERPC protocol access (ports 2012, 2014, and 2020 aren't exposed via any interactive network path) and multiple levels of authentication and authorization necessary to gain interactive access to the Azure VMware Solution vCenter Server.
