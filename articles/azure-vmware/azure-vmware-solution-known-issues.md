Adjustments from the base score were possible due to the network isolation of the Azure VMware Solution vCenter Server (ports 2012, 2014, and 2020 aren't exposed via any interactive network path) and multiple levels of authentication and authorization necessary to gain interactive access to the vCenter Server network segment.
