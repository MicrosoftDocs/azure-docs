# Application performance monitoring and troubleshooting solutions for Azure VMware Solution

A key objective of Azure VMware Solution is to maintain the performance and security of applications and services across VMware on Azure and on-premises. Getting there requires visibility into complex infrastructures and quickly pinpointing the root cause of service disruptions across the hybrid cloud.  

Our application performance monitoring and troubleshooting partners have industry-leading solutions in VMware-based environments that assure the availability, reliability, and responsiveness of applications and services. Our customers have adopted many of these solutions integrated with VMware NSX-T Data Center for their on-premises deployments. As one of our key principles, we want to enable them to continue to use their investments and VMware solutions running on Azure. Many of these Independent Software Vendors (ISV) have validated their solutions with Azure VMware Solution.
