# How Azure VMware Solution Addresses Vulnerabilities in the Infrastructure

At a high level, Azure VMware Solution is a Microsoft Azure service and therefore must follow all the same policies and requirements that Azure follows. Azure policies and procedures dictate that Azure VMware Solution must follow the [SDL](https://www.microsoft.com/securityengineering/sdl) and must meet several regulatory requirements as promised by Microsoft Azure. 

## Our approach to vulnerabilities

Azure VMware Solution takes a defense in depth approach to vulnerability and risk management. We follow the [SDL](https://www.microsoft.com/securityengineering/sdl) to ensure we're building securely from the start, including any third party solutions, and our services are continually assessed through both automation and manual reviews on a regular basis. Additionally, we also partner with third party partners on security hardening and early notifications of vulnerabilities within their solutions.

### Vulnerability management

- Engineering and Security Teams triage any signal of vulnerabilities.
- Details within the signal are adjudicated and assigned a CVSS score and risk rating according to compensating controls within the service.
- The risk rating is used against internal bug bars, internal policies and regulations to establish a timeline for implementing a fix.
- Internal engineering teams partner with appropriate parties to qualify and roll out any fixes, patches and other configuration updates necessary.
- Communications are drafted when necessary and published according to the risk rating assigned.

> [!TIP]
> Communications are surfaced through [Azure Service Health Portal](/azure/service-health/service-health-portal-update), [Known Issues](/azure/azure-vmware/azure-vmware-solution-known-issues) or Email. 

### Subset of regulations governing vulnerability and risk management

Azure VMware Solution is in scope for the following certifications and regulatory requirements. The regulations listed aren't a complete list of certifications Azure VMware Solution holds, rather it's a list with specific requirements around vulnerability management. These regulations don't rely on other regulations for the same purpose. IE, certain regional certifications may point to ISO requirements for vulnerability management.
