  - name: Compute, backup, and disaster recovery
    questions:

      - question: What are the CPU specifications in each type of host?
        answer: The servers have dual 18 core 2.3 GHz Intel CPUs.

      - question: How much memory is in each host?
        answer: The servers have 576 GB of RAM.

      - question:  What independent software vendors (ISVs) backup solutions work with Azure VMware Solution?
        answer: Commvault, Veritas, and Veeam have extended their backup solutions to work with Azure VMware Solution.  However, any backup solution that uses VMware vStorage API for Data Protection (VADP) with the HotAdd transport mode works out of the box on Azure VMware Solution. For more information, see [Backup solutions for Azure VMware Solution VMs](ecosystem-back-up-vms.md).

      - question: What about support for ISV backup solutions?
        answer: As these backup solutions are installed and managed by customers, they can reach out to the respective ISV for support. 

  - name: Networking and interconnectivity
    questions:        

      - question: Can Azure Bastion be used for connecting to Azure VMware Solution VMs?
        answer: Azure Bastion is the service recommended to connect to the jump box to prevent exposing Azure VMware Solution to the internet. You can't use Azure Bastion to connect to Azure VMware Solution VMs since they aren't Azure IaaS objects.
        
      - question: How much network bandwidth is available in each ESXi host?
        answer: Each ESXi host in Azure VMware Solution is configured with four 25-Gbps NICs, two NICs provisioned for ESXi system traffic, and two NICs provisioned for workload traffic. 

      - question: Are the SNMP infrastructure logs shared?
        answer: No.

      - question: Does ExpressRoute support packets exceeding MTU of 1500?
        answer: No. 

      - question: Can Azure Load Balancer internal be used for Azure VMware Solution VMs?
        answer: No. Azure Load Balancer internal-only supports Azure IaaS VMs. Azure Load Balancer doesn't support IP-based backend pools; only Azure VMs or virtual machine scale set objects in which Azure VMware Solution VMs aren't Azure objects.

      - question: Can an existing ExpressRoute Gateway be used to connect to Azure VMware Solution?
        answer: Yes. Use an existing ExpressRoute Gateway to connect to Azure VMware Solution as long as it doesn't exceed the limit of four ExpressRoute circuits per virtual network. To access Azure VMware Solution from on-premises through ExpressRoute, you must have ExpressRoute Global Reach since the ExpressRoute Gateway doesn't provide transitive routing between its connected circuits.

      - question: Why does Azure VMware Solution use a Public 4-byte Autonomous System Number (ASN)?
        answer: Azure VMware Solution uses the officially registered Public 4-byte ASNs to ensure there is never a conflict with your on-premises use of Private ASNs in the customer's routing path to Azure VMware Solution.

      - question: How can I use ExpressRoute to connect to Azure VMware Solution if the on-premises ExpressRoute-carrier partners/ISPs don't support 4-byte ASN?
        answer: The only way to connect to Azure VMware Solution through ExpressRoute is for your environment and the on-premises ExpressRoute-carrier partners/ISPs support 4-byte ASN or have backward compatibility from 4 byte to 2-byte ASN in the BGP prefix ASN path advertisement.        

      - question: What network IP address planning is required to incorporate private clouds with on-premises environments?
        answer: A private network /22 address space is required to deploy an Azure VMware Solution private cloud. This private address space shouldn't overlap with other virtual networks in a subscription or with on-premises networks.

      - question: How do I connect from on-premises environments to an Azure VMware Solution private cloud?
        answer: |
          You can connect to the service in one of two methods: 
          
          - With a VM or application gateway deployed on an Azure virtual network that is peered through ExpressRoute to the private cloud.
          - Through ExpressRoute Global Reach from your on-premises data center to an Azure ExpressRoute circuit.
          
      - question: Could I use HCX through public Internet communications as a workaround for the non-supportability of HCX when using VPN S2S with vWAN for on-premises communications?
        answer: Currently, the only supported method for VMware HCX is through ExpressRoute.

      - question: How do I connect a workload VM to the internet or an Azure service endpoint?
        answer: |
          In the Azure portal, enable internet connectivity for a private cloud. With NSX-T manager, create an NSX-T T1 router and a logical switch. You then use vCenter to deploy a VM on the network segment defined by the logical switch. That VM will have network access to the internet and Azure services.
          
          > [!NOTE]
          > A T0 router is created and configured as part of a private cloud deployment.
          > Any modification to that logical router or the NSX-T edge node VMs could affect connectivity to your private cloud.

      - question: Do I need to restrict access from the internet to VMs on logical networks in a private cloud?
        answer: No. Network traffic inbound from the internet directly to private clouds isn't allowed by default.  However, you're able to expose Azure VMware Solution VMs to the internet through the [Public IP](public-ip-usage.md) option in your Azure portal for your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.
          
      - question: Do I need to restrict internet access from VMs on logical networks to the internet?
        answer: Yes. You'll need to use NSX-T manager to create a firewall to restrict VM access to the internet.

      - question: Which IP range can be used for DNS service IP and DHCP server IP?
        answer: The address range shouldn't overlap with the IP range used in other virtual networks that are in your subscription and on-premises networks.

      - question: Can Azure VMware Solution use Azure Virtual WAN hosted ExpressRoute Gateways?
        answer: Yes.

      - question: Can transit connectivity be established between on-premises and Azure VMware Solution through Azure Virtual WAN over ExpressRoute Global Reach?
        answer: Azure Virtual WAN doesn't provide transitive routing between two connected ExpressRoute circuits and non-virtual WAN ExpressRoute Gateway. Using ExpressRoute Global Reach allows connectivity between on-premises and Azure VMware Solution, but goes through Microsoft's global network instead of the Virtual WAN Hub.

  - name: Storage
    questions:

      - question: What is the correct storage policy for the dedup setup?
        answer: Use the *thin_provision* storage policy for your VM template.  The default is *thick_provision*.

      - question: What is the storage capacity of each host?
        answer: Each ESXi host has two vSAN disk groups with a capacity tier of 15.2TB and a 3.2-TB NVMe cache tier (1.6 TB in each disk group).      

      - question: Is data stored on the vSAN datastores encrypted at rest?
        answer: Yes, vSAN datastores use data-at-rest encryption by default using keys stored in Azure Key Vault. The encryption solution is KMS-based and supports vCenter operations for key management.  When a host is removed from a cluster, data on SSDs is invalidated immediately.

      - question: Can I rename a datastore or cluster during creation?
        answer: No, you can't change the name of datastores or clusters.

      - question: What is the Fault tolerance of hardware failure on the vSAN?
        answer: |
          FTT-1, RAID-1 (mirroring) with Object Space reservation set to Thick Provisioning is the Default Storage policy for the SDDC.
          
          :::image type="content" source="media/vsphere-vm-storage-policies.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the vSphere Client VM Storage Policies.":::  

      - question: Why is thick provisioning the default vSAN policy in Azure VMware Solution?
        answer: Thick provisioning is reserved or pre-allocated storage space.  Thick provisioning protects systems by allowing them to function even if the vSAN datastore is full because the space is already reserved. For example, suppose you create a 10GB virtual disk with thick provisioning. In that case, the full amount of virtual disk storage capacity is pre-allocated on the physical storage where the virtual disk is created and consumes all the space allocated to it in the datastore.  It won’t allow other VMs to share the space from the datastore. A thin-provisioned virtual disk consumes the space that it needs initially and grows to the data space demand used in the datastore.

      - question: Can I create a new VM in Azure VMware Solution with thin provisioning even if the default vSAN policy is thick provisioning?
        answer: Yes. Outside of the default (thick_provision), you can create VMs with FTT1 thin provisioning. 

      - question: If we migrate a VM created with thin provisioning on the on-premises side to Azure VMware Solution, will the VM remain thin?
        answer: No. However, if the VM is migrated as thick, you can change policies on the individual VMs and individual vmdks through a combination of UI and PowerCLI.       

      - question: How many disks can fail on the vSAN before data loss occurs? 
        answer: It depends on how you plan your application workloads to run inside the SDDC (private cloud). Microsoft governs these failures regularly and replaces the hardware when such events are detected from an infrastructure perspective. As a default, a setting of FFT-1 is used, which accommodates a single host's failure.

      - question: What kind of alerts can I expect to see for vSAN? 
        answer: Microsoft provides alerts when capacity consumption exceeds 75%. Alternatively, you can also monitor capacity consumption metrics that are integrated into Azure Monitor.

      - question: How many 1.6 TB NVMe drives make up the disk groups to provide the 15.4 TB of raw SSD storage per host? 
        answer: The [AVS36 SKU](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-vmware/) includes two 1.6-TB NVMe cache and eight 1.9-TB raw storage capacity. These are then split into two disk groups. 

      - question: What is the RAID configuration of the disk groups?
        answer: The disk groups are not RAID configured. Instead, they are just a bunch of disks (JBOD) and are [directly controlled by vSAN](https://core.vmware.com/vsan-learn-and-evaluate).

  - name: Hosts, clusters, and private clouds
    questions:

      - question: Is there more than one type of host available?
        answer: No. There's only one type available.

      - question: Do I use the same tools that I use now to manage private cloud resources?
        answer: Yes. The Azure portal is used for deployment and several management operations. vCenter and NSX Manager are used to manage vSphere and NSX-T resources.

      - question: Can I manage a private cloud with my on-premises vCenter?
        answer: At launch, Azure VMware Solution won't support a single management experience across on-premises and private cloud environments. Private cloud clusters will be managed with vCenter and NSX Manager local to a private cloud.

      - question: If a cluster is scaled up, and then workload demand falls, can it be scaled back down? 
        answer: Yes, as long as you have the quota allocated against your private cloud, you can scale out your clusters. When workload demand falls, you can delete nodes from the cluster to scale it down. You can do this through the Azure VMware Solution portal.

      - question: Is the underlying infrastructure shared?
        answer: No, private cloud hosts and clusters are dedicated and securely erased before and after use.

      - question: What are the minimum and maximum number of hosts per cluster?
        answer: Clusters can scale between three (minimum) and 16 (maximum) ESXi hosts. Trial clusters are limited to three hosts.

      - question: Can I scale my private cloud clusters?
        answer: Yes, clusters scale between three (minimum) and 16 (maximum) ESXi hosts. Trial clusters are limited to three hosts.

      - question: What are trial clusters?
        answer: Trial clusters are three host clusters used for one-month evaluations of Azure VMware Solution private clouds.

      - question: Can I use High-end hosts for trial clusters?
        answer: No. High-end ESXi hosts are reserved for use in production clusters.

  - name: Identity management
    questions:
      - question: What accounts and privileges will I get with my new Azure VMware Solution private cloud?
        answer: You're provided credentials for a cloudadmin user in vCenter and admin access on NSX-T Manager. There's also a CloudAdmin group that can be used to incorporate Azure Active Directory. For more information, see [Access and Identity Concepts](concepts-identity.md).
          
      - question: Can have administrator access to ESXi hosts?
        answer: No, administrator access to ESXi is restricted to meet the security requirements of the solution.

      - question: What privileges and permissions will I have in vCenter?
        answer: You'll have CloudAdmin role privileges. For more information, see [Access and Identity Concepts](concepts-identity.md).
          
      - question: What privileges and permissions will I have on the NSX-T manager?
        answer: |
          You'll have full administrator privileges on NSX-T and can manage vSphere role-based access control as you would with NSX-T Data Center on-premises. For more information, see [Access and Identity Concepts](concepts-identity.md).
          
          > [!NOTE]
          > A T0 router is created and configured as part of a private cloud deployment. Any modification to that logical router or the NSX-T edge node VMs could affect connectivity to your private cloud.

      - question: How can I change my credentials?
        answer: For information on resetting your credentials, see [Reset vSphere credentials for Azure VMware Solution](reset-vsphere-credentials.md).
          
  - name: Billing and support
    questions:

      - question: Is there an SLA on disk replacement when failures occur? 
        answer: Any host with disk issues will be replaced. It rolls up to 99.9 SLA availability of the Azure VMware Solution service.
