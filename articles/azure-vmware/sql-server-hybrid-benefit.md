## Microsoft SQL Server

Microsoft SQL Server is a core component of many business-critical applications currently running on VMware vSphere. It's one of the most widely used database platforms in the market with customers running hundreds of SQL Server instances with VMware vSphere on-premises. 

Azure VMware Solution is an ideal solution for customers looking to migrate and modernize their vSphere-based applications to the cloud, including their SQL Server databases.

Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise licenses are required for each Azure VMware Solution ESXi host core that is used by SQL Server workloads running in a cluster. This can be further reduced by configuring the [Azure Hybrid Benefit](enable-sql-azure-hybrid-benefit.md) feature within Azure VMware Solution, using placement policies to limit the scope of ESXi host cores that need to be licensed within a cluster.
