All new Azure VMware Solution private clouds are now deployed with VMware vCenter Server version 6.7U3l and NSX-T Data Center version 2.5.2. We're not using NSX-T Data Center 3.1.1 for new private clouds because of an identified issue in NSX-T Data Center 3.1.1 that impacts customer VM connectivity. 

The VMware recommended mitigation was applied to all existing private clouds currently running NSX-T Data Center 3.1.1 on Azure VMware Solution. The workaround has been confirmed that there's no impact to customer VM connectivity.

## March 2021

All new Azure VMware Solution private clouds are deployed with VMware vCenter Server version 6.7U3l and NSX-T Data Center version 3.1.1. Any existing private clouds will be updated and upgraded **through June 2021** to the releases mentioned above.   You'll receive an email with the planned maintenance date and time. You can reschedule an upgrade. The email also provides details on the upgraded component, its effect on workloads, private cloud access, and other Azure services.  An hour before the upgrade, you'll receive a notification and then again when it finishes.

Azure VMware Solution service will do maintenance work **through March 19, 2021,** to update the vCenter Server in your private cloud to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3l version. 
VMware vCenter Server will be unavailable during this time, so you can't manage your VMs (stop, start, create, delete) or private cloud scaling (adding/removing servers and clusters). However, VMware High Availability (HA) will continue to operate to protect existing VMs.  
For more information on this vCenter version, see [VMware vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3l Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/rn/vsphere-vcenter-server-67u3l-release-notes.html).

Azure VMware Solution will apply the [VMware ESXi 6.7, Patch Release ESXi670-202011002](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/rn/esxi670-202011002.html) to existing privates **through March 15, 2021**.

Documented workarounds for the vSphere stack, as per [VMSA-2021-0002](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0002.html), will also be applied **through March 15, 2021**.
 
>[!NOTE]
>This is non-disruptive and should not impact the Azure VMware Solution service or workloads. During maintenance, various VMware vSphere alerts, such as _Lost network connectivity on DVPorts_ and _Lost uplink redundancy on DVPorts_, appear in vCenter Server and clear automatically as the maintenance progresses.

## Post update
Once complete, newer versions of VMware solution components will appear. If you notice any issues or have any questions, contact our support team by opening a support ticket.
