# Monitor and manage Recovery Services vaults

This article explains how to use the Recovery Services vault **Overview** dashboard to monitor and manage your Recovery Services vaults. When you open a Recovery Services vault from the list, the **Overview** dashboard for the selected vault, opens. The dashboard provides various details about the vault. There are *tiles* that show: the status of critical and warning alerts, in-progress and failed backup jobs, and the amount of locally redundant storage (LRS) and geo-redundant storage (GRS) used. If you back up Azure VMs to the vault, the [**Backup Pre-Check Status** tile displays any critical or warning items](#backup-pre-check-status). The following image is the **Overview** dashboard for **Contoso-vault**. The **Backup Items** tile shows there are nine items registered to the vault.

The prerequisites for this article are: an Azure subscription, a Recovery Services vault, and that there's at least one backup item configured for the vault.

Learn how to  create a Recovery Services vault using [Azure portal](backup-create-recovery-services-vault.md#create-a-recovery-services-vault), [REST API](backup-azure-arm-userestapi-createorupdatevault.md).

## Open a Recovery Services vault

To monitor alerts, or view management data about a Recovery Services vault, open the vault.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using your Azure subscription.

2. In the portal, select **All services**.

   ![Open list of Recovery Services vaults step 1](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/open-rs-vault-list.png)

3. In the **All services** dialog box, type **Recovery Services**. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input. When the **Recovery Services vaults** option appears, select it to open the list of Recovery Services vaults in your subscription.

    ![Create Recovery Services vault step 1](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/list-of-rs-vaults.png) <br/>

4. From the list of vaults, select a vault to open its **Overview** dashboard.

    ![Recovery Services vault dashboard](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/rs-vault-blade.png) <br/>

    The Overview dashboard uses tiles to provide alerts and backup job data.

## Monitor backup jobs and alerts

The Recovery Services vault **Overview** dashboard provides tiles for Monitoring and Usage information. The tiles in the Monitoring section display Critical and Warning alerts, and In progress and Failed jobs. Select a particular alert or job to open the Backup Alerts or Backup Jobs menu, filtered for that job or alert.

![Backup dashboard tasks](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/monitor-dashboard-tiles-warning.png)

[!INCLUDE [Classic alerts deprecation for Azure Backup.](../../includes/backup-azure-classic-alerts-deprecation.md)]

The Monitoring section shows the results of predefined **Backup Alerts** and **Backup Jobs** queries. The Monitoring tiles provide up-to-date information about:

* Critical and Warning alerts for Backup jobs (in the last 24 hours)
* Pre-check status for Azure VMs. For complete information on the pre-check status, see [Backup Pre-Check Status](#backup-pre-check-status).
* The Backup jobs in progress, and jobs that have failed (in the last 24 hours).

The Usage tiles provide:

* The number of Backup items configured for the vault.
* The Azure storage (separated by LRS and GRS) consumed by the vault.

Select the tiles (except Backup Storage) to open the associated menu. In the image above, the Backup Alerts tile shows three Critical alerts. Select the Critical alerts row in the Backup Alerts tile to open the Backup Alerts filtered for Critical alerts.

![Backup alerts menu filtered for critical alerts](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/critical-backup-alerts.png)

You can see the details of classic alerts by selecting the **Backup Alerts** tile.

>[!Important]
>Classic alerts for Azure Backup will be deprecated on 31 March 2026. We recommend you to [migrate to Azure Monitor Alerts](backup-azure-monitoring-alerts.md#migrate-from-classic-alerts-to-built-in-azure-monitor-alerts) for a seamless experience. View **Azure Monitor alerts** on the **Alerts** blade in the Recovery Services Vault.

### Backup Pre-Check Status

Backup Pre-Checks check your VMs' configuration for issues that can adversely affect backups. They aggregate this information so you can view it directly from the Recovery Services vault dashboard and provide recommendations for corrective measures to ensure successful file-consistent or application-consistent backups. They require no infrastructure and have no additional cost.  

Backup Pre-Checks run as part of the scheduled backup operations for your Azure VMs. They conclude with one of the following states:

* **Passed**: This state indicates that your VM's configuration should lead to successful backups and no corrective action needs to be taken.
* **Warning**: This state indicates one or more issues in the VM's configuration that *might* lead to backup failures. It provides *recommended* steps to ensure successful backups. For example, not having the latest VM Agent installed can cause backups to fail intermittently. This situation will provide a warning state.
* **Critical**: This state indicates one or more critical issues in the VM's configuration that *will* lead to backup failures and provides *required* steps to ensure successful backups. For example, a network issue caused by an update to the NSG rules of a VM, will cause backups to fail, as it prevents the VM from communicating with the Azure Backup service. This situation will provide a critical state.

Follow the steps below to start resolving any issues reported by Backup Pre-Checks for VM backups on your Recovery Services vault.

* Select the **Backup Pre-Check Status (Azure VMs)** tile on the Recovery Services vault dashboard.
* Select any VM with a Backup Pre-Check status of either **Critical** or **Warning**. This action will open the **VM details** pane.
* Select the pane notification on the top of the pane to reveal the configuration issue description and remedial steps.

## Manage Backup alerts

To access the Backup Alerts menu, in the Recovery Services vault menu, select **Backup Alerts**.
