# Back up VMware VMs with Azure Backup Server

This article describes how to back up VMware VMs running on VMware ESXi hosts/vCenter Server to Azure using Azure Backup Server (MABS).

## VMware VM protection workflow

To protect VMware VM using Azure Backup you need to:

1. Set up a secure channel so that Azure Backup Server can communicate with VMware servers over HTTPS.
1. Set up a VMware account that Azure Backup Server uses to access the VMware server.
1. Add the account credentials to Azure Backup.
1. Add the vCenter or ESXi server to Azure Backup Server.
1. Set up a protection group that contains the VMware VMs you want to back up, specify backup settings, and schedule the backup.

## Support matrix

This section provides the supported scenarios to protect VMware VMs.

### Supported VMware features

MABS provides the following features when backing up VMware virtual machines:

- Agentless backup: MABS doesn't require an agent to be installed on the vCenter or ESXi server, to back up the virtual machine. Instead, just provide the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN), and sign-in credentials used to authenticate the VMware server with MABS.
- Cloud Integrated Backup: MABS protects workloads to disk and cloud. MABS's backup and recovery workflow helps you manage long-term retention and offsite backup.
- Detect and protect VMs managed by vCenter: MABS detects and protects VMs deployed on a VMware server (vCenter or ESXi server). As your deployment size grows, use vCenter to manage your VMware environment. MABS also detects VMs managed by vCenter, allowing you to protect large deployments.
- Folder level auto protection: vCenter lets you organize your VMs in VM folders. MABS detects these folders and lets you protect VMs at the folder level and includes all subfolders. When you're protecting folders, MABS not only protects the VMs in that folder, but also protects VMs added later. MABS detects new VMs on a daily basis and protects them automatically. As you organize your VMs in recursive folders, MABS automatically detects and protects the new VMs deployed in the recursive folders.
- MABS protects VMs stored on a local disk, network file system (NFS), or cluster storage.
- MABS protects VMs migrated for load balancing: As VMs are migrated for load balancing, MABS automatically detects and continues VM protection.
- MABS can recover files/folders from a Windows VM without recovering the entire VM, which helps recover necessary files faster.

### Supported MABS versions

| MABS versions | Supported VMware VM versions for backup |
| --- | --- |
| MABS v4     | VMware server 8.0, 7.0, 6.7, or 6.5 (Licensed version) |
| MABS v3 UR2 | VMware server 7.0, 6.7, 6.5, or 6.0 (Licensed Version) |
| MABS v3 UR1 | VMware server 6.7, 6.5, 6.0, or 5.5 (Licensed Version) |

## Prerequisites and limitations

Before you start backing up a VMware virtual machine, review the following list of limitations and prerequisites.

- If you have been using MABS to protect a vCenter server (running on Windows) as a Windows Server using the FQDN of the server, you can't protect that vCenter server as a VMware server using the FQDN of the server.
  - You can use the static IP address of vCenter Server as a workaround.
  - If you want to use the FQDN, you should stop the protection as a Windows Server, remove the protection agent, and then add as a VMware Server using FQDN.
- If you use vCenter to manage ESXi servers in your environment, add vCenter (and not ESXi) to the MABS protection group.
- You can't back up user snapshots before the first MABS backup. Once MABS completes the first backup, then you can back up user snapshots.
- MABS can't protect VMware VMs with pass-through disks and physical raw device mappings (pRDM).
- MABS can't detect or protect VMware vApps.
- MABS can't protect VMware VMs with existing snapshots.
- MABS v4 doesn't support the *DataSets* feature for VMware 8.0.

## Before you start

- Verify that you're running a version of vCenter/ESXi that's supported for backup. Refer to the support matrix [here](./backup-mabs-protection-matrix.md).
- Make sure you've set up Azure Backup Server. If you haven't, [do that](backup-azure-microsoft-azure-backup.md) before you start. You should be running Azure Backup Server with the latest updates.
- Ensure the following network ports are open:
  - TCP 443 between MABS and vCenter
  - TCP 443 and TCP 902 between MABS and ESXi host

## Create a secure connection to the vCenter Server

By default, Azure Backup Server communicates with VMware servers over HTTPS. To set up the HTTPS connection, download the VMware Certificate Authority (CA) certificate, and import it on the Azure Backup Server.

### Before you begin

- If you don't want to use HTTPS, you can [disable HTTPS certificate validation for all VMware servers](backup-azure-backup-server-vmware.md#disable-https-certificate-validation).
- You typically connect from a browser on the Azure Backup Server machine to the vCenter/ESXi server using the vSphere Web Client. The first time you do this, the connection isn't secure and will show the following.
- It's important to understand how Azure Backup Server handles backups.
  - As a first step Azure Backup Server backs up data to local disk storage. Azure Backup Server uses a storage pool, a set of disks and volumes on which Azure Backup Server stores disk recovery points for its protected data. The storage pool can be directly attached storage (DAS), a fiber channel SAN, or iSCSI storage device or SAN. It's important to ensure that you have sufficient storage for local backup of your VMware VM data.
  - Azure Backup Server then backs up from the local disk storage to Azure.
  - [Get help](/system-center/dpm/create-dpm-protection-groups#figure-out-how-much-storage-space-you-need) to figure out how much storage space you need. The information is for DPM but can be used for Azure Backup Server too.

### Set up the certificate

Set up a secure channel as follows:

1. In the browser on Azure Backup Server, enter the vSphere Web Client URL. If the sign-in page doesn't appear, verify the connection and browser proxy settings.

    ![Screenshot showing the vSphere Web Client.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/vsphere-web-client.png)

2. On the vSphere Web Client sign-in page, select **Download trusted root CA certificates**.

    ![Screenshot shows how to download the trusted root CA certificate.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/vmware-download-ca-cert-prompt.png)

3. A file named **download** is downloaded. Depending on your browser, you receive a message that asks whether to open or save the file.

    ![Screenshot shows how to download CA certificate.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/download-certs.png)

4. Save the file on the Azure Backup Server machine with a .zip extension.

5. Right-click **download.zip** > **Extract All**. The .zip file extracts its contents to the **certs** folder, which contains:
   - The root certificate file with an extension that begins with a numbered sequence like .0 and .1.
   - The CRL file has an extension that begins with a sequence like `.r0` or `.r1`. The CRL file is associated with a certificate.

    ![Screenshot shows how to extract downloaded certificates.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/extracted-files-in-certs-folder.png)

6. In the **certs** folder, right-click the root certificate file > **Rename**.

    ![Screenshot shows how to rename the root certificate.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/rename-cert.png)

7. Change the root certificate's extension to .crt, and confirm. The file icon changes to one that represents a root certificate.

8. Right-click the root certificate and from the pop-up menu, select **Install Certificate**.

9. In **Certificate Import Wizard**, select **Local Machine** as the destination for the certificate, and then select **Next**. Confirm if you're asked if you want to allow changes to the computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate Import Wizard.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/certificate-import-wizard1.png)

10. On the **Certificate Store** page, select **Place all certificates in the following store**, and then select **Browse** to choose the certificate store.

    ![Screenshot shows how to choose the certificate storage.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/cert-import-wizard-local-store.png)

11. On **Select Certificate Store**, select **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** as the destination folder for the certificates, and then select **OK**.

    ![Screenshot shows how to select the certificate destination folder.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/certificate-store-selected.png)

12. On **Completing the Certificate Import Wizard**, verify the folder, and then select **Finish**.

    ![Screenshot shows how to verify if the certificate is in the proper folder.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/cert-wizard-final-screen.png)

13. After the certificate import is confirmed, sign in to the vCenter Server to confirm that your connection is secure.

### Disable HTTPS certificate validation

If you have secure boundaries within your organization, and don't want to use the HTTPS protocol between VMware servers and the Azure Backup Server machine, disable HTTPS as follows:

1. Copy and paste the following text into a .txt file.

    ```text
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Data Protection Manager\VMWare]
    "IgnoreCertificateValidation"=dword:00000001
    ```

2. Save the file on the Azure Backup Server machine with the name **DisableSecureAuthentication.reg**.

3. Double-click the file to activate the registry entry.

## Create a VMware role

The Azure Backup Server needs a user account with permissions to access v-Center Server/ESXi host. Create a VMware role with specific privileges, and then associate a user account with the role.

1. Sign in to the vCenter Server (or ESXi host if you're not using vCenter Server).
2. On the **Navigator** pane, select **Administration**.

    ![Screenshot shows how to select Administration.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/vmware-navigator-panel.png)

3. On **Administration** > **Roles**, select the add role icon (the + symbol).

    ![Screenshot shows how to add roles.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/vmware-define-new-role.png)

4. On **Create Role** > **Role name**, enter *BackupAdminRole*. The role name can be whatever you like, but it should be recognizable for the role's purpose.

5. Select the privileges as summarized in the table below, and then select **OK**.  The new role appears on the list in the **Roles** panel.
   - Select the icon next to the parent label to expand the parent and view the child privileges.
   - To select the VirtualMachine privileges, you need to go several levels into the parent child hierarchy.
   - You don't need to select all child privileges within a parent privilege.

    ![Screenshot shows how to select the parent and child privilege hierarchy.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/cert-add-privilege-expand.png)

If you have multiple ESXi hosts that aren't managed by vCenter server, or you have multiple instances of vCenter Server, you need to rerun the wizard to add the servers.

## Configure a protection group

To add VMware VMs for backup. Protection groups gather multiple VMs and apply the same data retention and backup settings to all VMs in the group, follow these steps:

1. On the Azure Backup Server console, select **Protection** > **New**.

    ![Screenshot shows how to open the Create New Protection Group wizard.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/open-protection-wizard.png)

1. On the **Create New Protection Group** wizard welcome page, select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot shows the Create New Protection Group wizard dialog box.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/protection-wizard.png)

1. On the **Select Protection group type** page, select **Servers** and then select **Next**. The **Select group members** page appears.

1. On **Select group members**, select the VMs (or VM folders) that you want to back up. Then select **Next**.

    - When you select a folder, or VMs or folders inside that folder are also selected for backup. You can uncheck folders or VMs you don't want to back up.
1. If a VM or folder is already being backed up, you can't select it. This ensures that duplicate recovery points aren't created for a VM.

    ![Screenshot shows how to select group members.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/server-add-selected-members.png)

1. On **Select Data Protection Method** page, enter a name for the protection group, and protection settings. To back up to Azure, set short-term protection to **Disk** and enable online protection. Then select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot shows how to select data protection method.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/name-protection-group.png)

1. On **Specify Short-Term Goals**, specify how long you want to keep data backed up to disk.
   - On **Retention Range**, specify how many days disk recovery points should be kept.
   - On **Synchronization frequency**, specify how often disk recovery points are taken.
       - If you don't want to set a backup interval, you can check **Just before a recovery point** so that a backup runs just before each recovery point is scheduled.
       - Short-term backups are full backups and not incremental.
       - Select **Modify** to change the times/dates when short-term backups occur.

         ![Screenshot shows how to specify short-term goals.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/short-term-goals.png)

1. On **Review Disk Allocation**, review the disk space provided for the VM backups. for the VMs.

   - The recommended disk allocations are based on the retention range you specified, the type of workload, and the size of the protected data. Make any required changes, and then select **Next**.
   - **Data size:** Size of the data in the protection group.
   - **Disk space:** The recommended amount of disk space for the protection group. If you want to modify this setting, you should allocate total space that's slightly larger than the amount that you estimate each data source grows.
   - **Colocate data:** If you turn on colocation, multiple data sources in the protection can map to a single replica and recovery point volume. Colocation isn't supported for all workloads.
   - **Automatically grow:** If you turn on this setting, if data in the protected group outgrows the initial allocation, Azure Backup Server tries to increase the disk size by 25 percent.
   - **Storage pool details:** Shows the status of the storage pool, including total and remaining disk size.

    ![Screenshot shows how to review disk allocation.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/review-disk-allocation.png)

1. On **Choose Replica Creation Method** page, specify how you want to take the initial backup, and then select **Next**.
   - The default is **Automatically over the network** and **Now**.
   - If you use the default, we recommend that you specify an off-peak time. Choose **Later** and specify a day and time.
   - For large amounts of data or less-than-optimal network conditions, consider replicating the data offline by using removable media.

    ![Screenshot shows how to choose the Replica creation method.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/replica-creation.png)

1. On **Consistency Check Options**, select how and when to automate the consistency checks. Then select **Next**.
      - You can run consistency checks when replica data becomes inconsistent, or on a set schedule.
      - If you don't want to configure automatic consistency checks, you can run a manual check. To do this, right-click the protection group > **Perform Consistency Check**.

1. On **Specify Online Protection Data** page, select the VMs or VM folders that you want to back up. You can select the members individually, or select **Select All** to choose all members. Then select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot shows how to specify the online protection data.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/select-data-to-protect.png)

1. On the **Specify Online Backup Schedule** page, specify how often you want to back up data from local storage to Azure.

    - Cloud recovery points for the data will be generated according to the schedule. Then select **Next**.
    - After the recovery point is generated, it's transferred to the Recovery Services vault in Azure.

    ![Screenshot shows how to specify the online backup schedule.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/online-backup-schedule.png)

1. On the **Specify Online Retention Policy** page, indicate how long you want to keep the recovery points that are created from the daily/weekly/monthly/yearly backups to Azure. then select **Next**.

    - There's no time limit for how long you can keep data in Azure.
    - The only limit is that you can't have more than 9999 recovery points per protected instance. In this example, the protected instance is the VMware server.

    ![Screenshot shows how to specify the online retention policy.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/retention-policy.png)

## VMware parallel backups

>[!NOTE]
> This feature is applicable for MABS V3 UR1 (and later).

With earlier versions of MABS, parallel backups were performed only across protection groups. With MABS V3 UR1 (and later), all your VMware VMs backups within a single protection group are parallel, leading to faster VM backups. All VMware delta replication jobs run in parallel. By default, the number of jobs to run in parallel is set to 8.

You can modify the number of jobs by using the registry key as shown below (not present by default, you need to add it):

**Key Path**: `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft Data Protection Manager\Configuration\ MaxParallelIncrementalJobs`<BR>
**Key Type**: DWORD (32-bit) VMware.
**Data**: number
The value should be the number (decimal) of virtual machines that you select for parallel backup.

> [!NOTE]
> You can modify the number of jobs to a higher value. If you set the jobs number to 1, replication jobs run serially. To increase the number to a higher value, you must consider the VMware performance. Consider the number of resources in use and additional usage required on VMWare vSphere Server, and determine the number of delta replication jobs to run in parallel. Also, this change will affect only the newly created protection groups. For existing protection groups you must temporarily add another VM to the protection group. This should update the protection group configuration accordingly. You can remove this VM from the protection group after the procedure is completed.

## VMware vSphere 6.7, 7.0, and 8.0

To back up vSphere 6.7, 7.0, and 8.0, follow these steps:

- Enable TLS 1.2 on the MABS Server

>[!NOTE]
>VMware 6.7 onwards had TLS enabled as communication protocol.

- Set the registry keys as follows:

```text
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v2.0.50727]
"SystemDefaultTlsVersions"=dword:00000001
"SchUseStrongCrypto"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319]
"SystemDefaultTlsVersions"=dword:00000001
"SchUseStrongCrypto"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v2.0.50727]
"SystemDefaultTlsVersions"=dword:00000001
"SchUseStrongCrypto"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319]
"SystemDefaultTlsVersions"=dword:00000001
"SchUseStrongCrypto"=dword:00000001
```

## Exclude disk from VMware VM backup

With MABS V3 UR1 (and later), you can exclude the specific disk from VMware VM backup. The configuration script **ExcludeDisk.ps1** is located in the `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Backup Server\DPM\DPM\bin folder`.

To configure the disk exclusion, follow these steps:

### Identify the VMware VM and disk details to be excluded

  1. On the VMware console, go to VM settings for which you want to exclude the disk.
  2. Select the disk that you want to exclude and note the path for that disk.

     For example, to exclude the Hard Disk 2 from the TestVM4, the path for Hard Disk 2 is **[datastore1] TestVM4/TestVM4\_1.vmdk**.

     ![Screenshot shows the hard disk to be excluded.](./media/backup-azure-backup-server-vmware/test-vm.png)

### Configure MABS Server

Navigate to the MABS server where the VMware VM is configured for protection to configure disk exclusion.

  1. Get the details of the VMware host that's protected on the MABS server.

     ```powershell
     $psInfo = get-DPMProductionServer
     $psInfo
     ```

     ```output
     ServerName   ClusterName     Domain            ServerProtectionState
     ----------   -----------     ------            ---------------------
     Vcentervm1                   Contoso.COM       NoDatasourcesProtected
     ```

  2. Select the VMware host and list the VMs protection for the VMware host.

     ```powershell
     $vmDsInfo = get-DPMDatasource -ProductionServer $psInfo[0] -Inquire
     $vmDsInfo
     ```

     ```output
     Computer     Name     ObjectType
     --------     ----     ----------
     Vcentervm1  TestVM2      VMware
     Vcentervm1  TestVM1      VMware
     Vcentervm1  TestVM4      VMware
     ```

  3. Select the VM for which you want to exclude a disk.

     ```powershell
     $vmDsInfo[2]
     ```

     ```output
     Computer     Name      ObjectType
     --------     ----      ----------
     Vcentervm1   TestVM4   VMware
     ```

  4. To exclude the disk, navigate to the `Bin` folder and run the *ExcludeDisk.ps1* script with the following parameters:

     > [!NOTE]
     > Before running this command, stop the DPMRA service on the MABS server. Otherwise, the script returns success, but doesn't update the exclusion list. Ensure there are no jobs in progress before stopping the service.

     **To add/remove the disk from exclusion, run the following command:**

     ```powershell
     ./ExcludeDisk.ps1 -Datasource $vmDsInfo[0] [-Add|Remove] "[Datastore] vmdk/vmdk.vmdk"
     ```

     **Example**:

     To add the disk exclusion for TestVM4, run the following command:

     ```powershell
     C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Backup Server\DPM\DPM\bin> ./ExcludeDisk.ps1 -Datasource $vmDsInfo[2] -Add "[datastore1] TestVM4/TestVM4\_1.vmdk"
     ```

     ```output
     Creating C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Backup Server\DPM\DPM\bin\excludedisk.xml
     Disk : [datastore1] TestVM4/TestVM4\_1.vmdk, has been added to disk exclusion list.
     ```

  5. Verify that the disk has been added for exclusion.

     **To view the existing exclusion for specific VMs, run the following command:**

     ```powershell
     ./ExcludeDisk.ps1 -Datasource $vmDsInfo[0] [-view]
     ```

     **Example**

     ```powershell
     C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Backup Server\DPM\DPM\bin> ./ExcludeDisk.ps1 -Datasource $vmDsInfo[2] -view
     ```

     ```output
     <VirtualMachine>
       <UUID>52b2b1b6-5a74-1359-a0a5-1c3627c7b96a</UUID>
       <ExcludeDisk>[datastore1] TestVM4/TestVM4\_1.vmdk</ExcludeDisk>
     </VirtualMachine>
     ```

     Once you configure the protection for this VM, the excluded disk won't be listed during protection.

     > [!NOTE]
     > If you are performing these steps for an already protected VM, you need to run the consistency check manually after adding the disk for exclusion.

### Remove the disk from exclusion

To remove the disk from exclusion, run the following command:

```powershell
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Backup Server\DPM\DPM\bin> ./ExcludeDisk.ps1 -Datasource $vmDsInfo[2] -Remove "[datastore1] TestVM4/TestVM4\_1.vmdk"
```

## ApplicationQuiesceFault

### Fall back to crash consistent backups for VMware VMs

Application consistent backups for VMware VMs running Windows can fail with the *ApplicationQuiesceFault* error if:

- The VSS providers in the VM aren't in a stable state.
- The VM is under heavy load.

To resolve this quiescing error and retry the failed application consistent backup with a crash consistent backup, use the following registry key on the MABS server running V4 UR1 or above:

```azurepowershell
Name - FailbackToCrashConsistentBackup DWORD = 1
Path- SOFTWARE\\MICROSOFT\\MICROSOFT DATA PROTECTION MANAGER\\VMWare

```
