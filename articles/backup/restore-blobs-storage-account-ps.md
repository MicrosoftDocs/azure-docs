# Restore Azure Blobs using Azure PowerShell

This article describes how to use the PowerShell to perform restores for Azure Blob from [operational](blob-backup-overview.md?tabs=operational-backup) or [vaulted](blob-backup-overview.md?tabs=vaulted-backup) backups. With operational backups, you can restore all block blobs in storage accounts with operational backup configured or a subset of blob content to any point-in-time within the retention range. With vaulted backups, you can perform restores using a recovery point created, based on your backup schedule.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for Azure blobs is available from version **Az 5.9.0**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before proceeding to restore Azure blobs using Azure Backup, see [important points](blob-restore.md#before-you-start).

In this article, you'll learn how to: 

- Restore Azure Blobs 

- Track the restore operation status 

Let's use an existing backup vault *TestBkpVault* under the resource group *testBkpVaultRG* in the examples.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$TestBkpVault = Get-AzDataProtectionBackupVault -VaultName TestBkpVault -ResourceGroupName "testBkpVaultRG"
```

## Restore Azure blobs within a storage account

**Choose a backup tier**:

# [Operational backup](#tab/operational-backup)

### Fetch the valid time range for restore

As the operational backup for blobs is continuous, there are no distinct points to restore from. Instead, we need to fetch the valid time-range under which blobs can be restored to any point-in-time. In this example, let's check for valid time-ranges to restore within the last 30 days.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$startDate = (Get-Date).AddDays(-30)
$endDate = Get-Date
```

First fetch all instances using [Get-AzDataProtectionBackupInstance](/powershell/module/az.dataprotection/get-azdataprotectionbackupinstance) command and identify the relevant instance.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$AllInstances = Get-AzDataProtectionBackupInstance -ResourceGroupName "testBkpVaultRG" -VaultName $TestBkpVault.Name
```

You can also use Az.Resourcegraph and the [Search-AzDataProtectionBackupInstanceInAzGraph](/powershell/module/az.dataprotection/search-azdataprotectionbackupinstanceinazgraph) command to search across instances in many vaults and subscriptions.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$AllInstances = Search-AzDataProtectionBackupInstanceInAzGraph -ResourceGroupName "testBkpVaultRG" -VaultName $TestBkpVault.Name -DatasourceType AzureBlob -ProtectionStatus ProtectionConfigured
```

Once the instance is identified then fetch the relevant recovery range using the [Find-AzDataProtectionRestorableTimeRange](/powershell/module/az.dataprotection/find-azdataprotectionrestorabletimerange) command.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Find-AzDataProtectionRestorableTimeRange -ResourceGroupName "testBkpVaultRG" -VaultName $TestBkpVault.Name -BackupInstanceName $AllInstances[2].BackupInstanceName -StartTime $startDate -endTime $endDate

EndTime    : 2021-04-24T08:57:36.4149422Z
ObjectType : RestorableTimeRange
StartTime  : 2021-03-25T14:27:31.0000000Z

$DesiredPIT = (Get-Date -Date "2021-04-23T02:47:02.9500000Z")
```

### Prepare the restore request

Once the point-in-time to restore is fixed, there are multiple options to restore. Use the [Initialize-AzDataProtectionRestoreRequest](/powershell/module/az.dataprotection/initialize-azdataprotectionrestorerequest) command to prepare the restore request with all relevant details.

#### Restore all the blobs to a point-in-time

You can restore all block blobs in the storage account by rolling them back to the selected point in time. Storage accounts containing large amounts of data or witnessing a high churn may take longer times to restore.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$restorerequest = Initialize-AzDataProtectionRestoreRequest -DatasourceType AzureBlob -SourceDataStore OperationalStore -RestoreLocation $TestBkpVault.Location  -RestoreType OriginalLocation -PointInTime (Get-Date -Date "2021-04-23T02:47:02.9500000Z") -BackupInstance $AllInstances[2]
```

#### Restore selected containers

You can browse and select up to 10 containers to restore.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$restorerequest = Initialize-AzDataProtectionRestoreRequest -DatasourceType AzureBlob -SourceDataStore OperationalStore -RestoreLocation $TestBkpVault.Location  -RestoreType OriginalLocation -PointInTime (Get-Date -Date "2021-04-23T02:47:02.9500000Z") -BackupInstance $AllInstances[2] -ItemLevelRecovery -ContainersList "abc","xyz"
```

#### Restore containers using a prefix match

You can restore a subset of blobs using a prefix match. You can specify up to 10 lexicographical ranges of blobs within a single container or across multiple containers to return those blobs to their previous state at a given point in time. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

- You can use a forward slash (/) to delineate the container name from the blob prefix
- The start of the range specified is inclusive, however the specified range is exclusive.

[Learn more](blob-restore.md#use-prefix-match-for-restoring-blobs) about using prefixes to restore blob ranges.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$restorerequest = Initialize-AzDataProtectionRestoreRequest -DatasourceType AzureBlob -SourceDataStore OperationalStore -RestoreLocation $TestBkpVault.Location  -RestoreType OriginalLocation -PointInTime (Get-Date -Date "2021-04-23T02:47:02.9500000Z") -BackupInstance $AllInstances[2] -ItemLevelRecovery -FromPrefixPattern "containerabc/aaa","containerabc/ccc" -ToPrefixPattern "containerabc/bbb","containerabc/ddd"
```
# [Vaulted backup](#tab/vaulted-backup)

### Trigger the restore

Use the [Start-AzDataProtectionBackupInstanceRestore](/powershell/module/az.dataprotection/start-azdataprotectionbackupinstancerestore) command to trigger the restore with the request prepared above.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Start-AzDataProtectionBackupInstanceRestore -BackupInstanceName $AllInstances[2].BackupInstanceName -ResourceGroupName "testBkpVaultRG" -VaultName $TestBkpVault.Name -Parameter $restorerequest
```

## Track a job

You can track all the jobs using the [Get-AzDataProtectionJob](/powershell/module/az.dataprotection/get-azdataprotectionjob) command. You can list all jobs and fetch a particular job detail.

You can also use Az.ResourceGraph to track all jobs across all backup vaults. Use the [Search-AzDataProtectionJobInAzGraph](/powershell/module/az.dataprotection/search-azdataprotectionjobinazgraph) command to get the relevant job which can be across any backup vault.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$job = Search-AzDataProtectionJobInAzGraph -Subscription $sub -ResourceGroupName "testBkpVaultRG" -Vault $TestBkpVault.Name -DatasourceType AzureBlob -Operation Restore
```
