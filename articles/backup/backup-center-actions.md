# Perform actions using Backup center

[!INCLUDE [backup-center-deprecation.md ](../../includes/backup-center-deprecation.md )]

Backup center allows you to perform key backup-related actions from a central interface without needing to go to an individual vault. Some actions that you can perform from Backup center are:

* Configure backup for your datasources
* Restore a backup instance
* Create a new vault
* Create a new backup policy
* Trigger an on-demand backup for a backup instance
* Stop backup for a backup instance

## Supported scenarios

* Backup center is currently supported for Azure VM backup, SQL in Azure VM backup, SAP HANA in Azure VM backup, Azure Files backup, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server backup.
* Refer to the [support matrix](backup-center-support-matrix.md) for a detailed list of supported and unsupported scenarios.

[!INCLUDE [How to open the Backup center.](../../includes/backup-center-open-console.md)]

## Configure backup

If you're backing up Azure VMs, SQL in Azure VMs, SAP HANA in Azure VMs or Azure Files, you should use a Recovery Services vault. If you're backing up Azure Databases for PostgreSQL Server, you should use a Backup vault. 

Depending on the type of datasource you wish to back up, follow the appropriate instructions as described below.

**Choose a vault type to configure backup**:

# [Recovery Services vault](#tab/recovery-services-vault)

To configure backup to a Recovery Services vault, follow these steps:

1. On the **Backup center**, select **+ Backup** at the top of the **Overview** tab.

2. Select the type of datasource you wish to back up.

    ![Select datasource to configure VM backup](./media/backup-center-actions/backup-select-datasource-vm.png)

3. Choose a Recovery Services vault and select **Proceed**. This leads you to the backup configuration experience that is identical to the one reachable from a Recovery Services vault. [Learn more about how configure backup for Azure virtual machines with a Recovery Services vault](tutorial-backup-vm-at-scale.md).

# [Backup vault](#tab/backup-vault)

To configure backup to a Backup vault, follow these steps:

1. On the **Backup center**, select **+ Backup** at the top of the **Overview** tab.
2. Select the type of datasource you wish to back up (Azure Database for PostgreSQL server in this case).

    ![Select datasource to configure Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server backup](./media/backup-center-actions/backup-select-datasource-type-postgresql.png)

3. Select **Proceed**. This leads you to the backup configuration experience that it identical to the one reachable from a Backup vault.

## Restore a backup instance

Depending on the type of datasource you wish to restore, follow the appropriate instructions as described below.

**Choose a vault type for restore**:

# [Recovery Services vault](#tab/recovery-services-vault)

To restore data from a Recovery Services vault, follow these steps:

1. On the **Backup center**, select **Restore** at the top of the **Overview** tab.

    ![Backup Center Overview to restore VM](./media/backup-center-actions/backup-center-overview-restore.png)

2. Select the type of datasource you wish to restore.

    ![Select datasource for VM restore](./media/backup-center-actions/restore-select-datasource-vm.png)

3. Choose a backup instance and select **Proceed**. This leads you to the restore settings experience that is identical to the one reachable from a Recovery Services vault.

# [Backup vault](#tab/backup-vault)

To restore data from a Backup vault, follow these steps:

1. On the **Backup center**, select **Restore** at the top of the **Overview** tab.
2. Select the type of datasource you wish to restore (Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server in this case).

    ![Select datasource for Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server restore](./media/backup-center-actions/restore-select-datasource-postgresql.png)

3. Choose a backup instance and select **Proceed**. This leads you to the restore settings experience that is identical to the one reachable from a Recovery Services vault.

## Create a new vault

You can create a new vault by going to the Backup center and selecting **+ Vault** at the top of the **Overview** tab.

## Create a new backup policy

Depending on the type of datasource you wish to back up, follow the appropriate instructions described below.

**Choose a vault type to create a backup policy**:

# [Recovery Services vault](#tab/recovery-services-vault)

To create a backup policy for backing up to a Recovery Services vault, follow these steps:

1. On the **Backup center**, select **+ Policy** at the top of the **Overview** tab.

    ![Backup Center Overview for backup policy](./media/backup-center-actions/backup-center-overview-policy.png)

2. Select the type of datasource you wish to back up.

    ![Select datasource for policy for VM backup](./media/backup-center-actions/policy-select-datasource-vm.png)

3. Choose a Recovery services vault and select **Proceed**. This leads you to the policy creation experience that is identical to the one reachable from a Recovery Services vault. [Learn more about how to create a new backup policy for Azure Virtual Machine with a Recovery services vault](backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare.md#create-a-custom-policy).

# [Backup vault](#tab/backup-vault)

To create a backup policy for  backing up to a Backup vault, follow these steps:

1. On the **Backup center**, select **+ Policy** at the top of the **Overview** tab.
2. Select the type of datasource you wish to back up (Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server in this case).

    ![Select datasource for policy for Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server backup](./media/backup-center-actions/policy-select-datasource-postgresql.png)

3. Select **Proceed**. This leads you to the policy creation experience that it identical to the one reachable from a Backup vault. [Learn more about how to create a new backup policy with a Backup vault](backup-azure-database-postgresql.md#create-backup-policy).

## Execute an on-demand backup for a backup instance

Backup center allows you to search for backup instances across your backup estate and execute backup operations on demand.

To stop protection, go to the Backup center and select the **Backup Instances** menu item. Selecting this lets you view details of all the backup instances that you have access to. You can search for the backup instance you wish to back up. Right-clicking on an item in the grid opens up a list of available actions. Select the **Backup Now** option to execute an on-demand backup.

![On-demand backup](./media/backup-center-actions/backup-center-on-demand-backup.png)

[Learn more about performing on-demand backups for Azure Virtual Machines](backup-azure-manage-vms.md#run-an-on-demand-backup).

[Learn more about performing on-demand backups for Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server](backup-azure-database-postgresql.md).

## Stop backup for a backup instance

There are scenarios when you might want to stop backup for a backup instance, such as when the underlying resource being backed up doesnâ€™t exist anymore.

To stop protection, go to the Backup center and select the **Backup Instances** menu item. Select this lets you view details of all the backup instances that you have access to. You can search for the backup instance you wish to back up. Right-clicking on an item in the grid opens up a list of available actions. Select the **Stop Backup** option to stop backup for the backup instance.

2. On the **Replicated Items** tab, select **+ Replicate**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/backup-center-actions/backup-center-start-replication-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to start the replication process." lightbox="./media/backup-center-actions/backup-center-start-replication-expanded.png":::

3. Select the type of source you want to replicate.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/backup-center-actions/backup-center-replication-source-.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to select the replication source.":::
 
4. Select a *Recovery Services vault* > **Proceed**. 

   The replication configuration experience is same as that of the one on a Recovery Services vault. Learn more [how to configure replication for Azure virtual machine](../backup/tutorial-backup-vm-at-scale.md).
