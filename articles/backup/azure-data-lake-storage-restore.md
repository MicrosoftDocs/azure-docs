# Restore Azure Data Lake Storage using Azure portal (preview)

This article describes how to restore Azure Data Lake Storage vaulted  backups (preview) using Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

Before you restore Azure Data Lake Storage, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- The Backup vault must have the **Storage account backup contributor** role assigned to the target storage account to which the backup data needs to be restored.
- Cool and cold tier blobs are restored in hot tier.
- The target storage account selected for restore must not have any container with same name.
- The target storage account must be in same location as source storage account and vault.

>[!Note]
>Vaulted backups only support restoring data to another storage account, which is different from the one that was backed up.

   - **Browse and select containers to restore**: This option allows you to browse and select up to **100 containers** to restore.

1. On the **Restore parameters** tab, select **Validate** to ensure that the required permissions to perform the restore are assigned to the backed-up storage accounts with Data Lake selections.

1. After the validation succeeds, select **Review + restore** and restore the backups to the selected Data Lake Storage.
1. On the **Review + restore** tab, select **Restore** to start the restore operation.

You can track the progress of restore under **Backup Jobs**.
