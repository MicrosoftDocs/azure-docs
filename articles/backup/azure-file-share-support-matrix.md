This section describes how your backups and restores are affected after customer-managed failovers. 

The following table lists the behavior of backups due to customer-initiated failovers:

| Failover type | Backups | Restore | Enabling protection (reprotection) of failed over account in secondary region |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
