## Daylight savings

Azure Backup doesn't support automatic clock adjustment for daylight saving time for Azure Virtual Machine (VM) backups. It doesn't shift the hour of the backup forward or backwards. To ensure the backup runs at the desired time, modify the backup policies manually as required.

## Support for customer-managed failover

This section describes how your backups and restores are affected after customer-managed failovers. 

The following table lists the behavior of backups due to customer-initiated failovers:

| Failover type | Backups | Restore | Enabling protection (reprotection) of failed over account in secondary region |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Customer-managed planned failover | Supported | Supported | Not supported |
| Customer-managed unplanned failover | Not supported | Only cross-region restore from the vault is supported. | Not supported |

## Permitted scope for copy operations(preview)

The following table lists the scope for copy operation:

| Configuration | Support |
| --- | --- |
| From any storage account | Supported |
| From storage accounts in the same Microsoft Entra tenant | Supported |
| From storage accounts with a private endpoint to the same virtual network | Unsupported |

Azure Trusted Services are allowed, but private endpoints take priority; so, this won't work.
