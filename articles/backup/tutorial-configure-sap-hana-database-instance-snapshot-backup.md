# Tutorial: Configure SAP HANA database instance snapshot backup

This tutorial describes how to configure backup for SAP HANA database instance snapshot and run an on-demand backup using Azure CLI.

Azure Backup now performs an SAP HANA storage snapshot-based backup of an entire database instance. Backup combines an Azure managed disk full or incremental snapshot with HANA snapshot commands to provide instant HANA backup and restore.

For more information on the supported scenarios, see the [support matrix](./sap-hana-backup-support-matrix.md#scenario-support) for SAP HANA.

## Before you start

Before you configure the database backup, consider the following prerequisites:

- Ensure that you have the [permissions for the backup operation](sap-hana-database-instances-backup.md#permissions-required-for-backup).
- [Create a Recovery Services vault](sap-hana-database-instances-backup.md#create-a-recovery-services-vault) for the backup and restore operations.
- [Create a backup policy](sap-hana-database-instances-backup.md#create-a-policy).
