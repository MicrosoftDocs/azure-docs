# Data Model for resource specific Diagnostic Events

> [!NOTE]
> For creating custom reporting views, it is recommended to use [system functions on Azure Monitor logs](backup-reports-system-functions.md) instead of working with the raw tables listed below.

## Differences in schema for Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults

Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults send data to a common set of tables that are listed in this article. However, there are slight differences in the schema for Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults. 

- One of the main reasons for this difference is that for Backup vaults, Azure Backup service does a 'flattening' of schemas to reduce the number of joins needed in queries, hence improving query performance. For example, if you are looking to write a query that lists all Backup vault jobs along with the friendly name of the datasource, and friendly name of the vault, you can get all of this information for the AddonAzureBackupJobs table (without needing to do a join with CoreAzureBackup to get the datasource and vault names). Flattened schemas are currently supported only for Backup vaults and not yet for Recovery Services vaults.
- Apart from the above, there are also certain scenarios that are currently applicable for Recovery Services vaults only (for example, fields related to DPM workloads). This also leads to some differences in the schema between Backup vaults and Recovery Services vaults.

To understand which fields are specific to a particular vault type, and which fields are common across vault types, refer to the **Applicable Resource Types** column provided in the below sections. For more information on how to write queries on these tables for Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults, see the [sample queries](./backup-azure-monitoring-use-azuremonitor.md#sample-kusto-queries).

## AddonAzureBackupAlerts

This table provides details about alert related fields.

> [!NOTE]
> AddonAzureBackupAlerts refers to the alerts being generated by the classic alerts solution. As classic alerts solution is on deprecation path in favour of Azure Monitor based alerts, we recommend you not to select this event AddonAzureBackupAlerts when configuring diagnostics settings. To send the fired Azure Monitor based alerts to a destination of your choice, you can create an alert processing rule and action group that routes these alerts to a logic app, webhook, or runbook that in turn sends these alerts to the required destination.
