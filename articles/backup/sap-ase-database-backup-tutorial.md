# Tutorial: Back up SAP ASE (Sybase) database using Azure Business Continuity Center

This tutorial describes how to back up an SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) (Sybase) database that's running on an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) using [Azure Business Continuity Center](../business-continuity-center/business-continuity-center-overview.md).

Learn about the [supported configurations and scenarios for SAP ASE database backup](sap-ase-backup-support-matrix.md) on Azure VMs.

## Prerequisites

Before you set up the SAP ASE database for backup, review the following prerequisites:
- Identify or create a Recovery Services vault in the same region and subscription as the VM running SAP ASE.
- Allow connectivity from the VM to the internet, so that it can reach Azure.
- The combined length of the SAP ASE Server VM name and the Resource Group name must have **<= 84** characters for Azure Resource Manager (ARM) VMs (and 77 characters for classic VMs) as the service reserves some characters. 
- VM must have python **>= 3.6.15** (recommended- Python3.10) with requests module installed. The default sudo python3 must run python 3.6.15 or higher. Validate by running python3 and **sudo python3** in your system to check the python version. To change the default version, link python3 to python 3.6.15 or higher.
- [Run the SAP ASE backup configuration script (preregistration script)](sap-ase-database-backup-run-preregistration-quickstart.md) in the virtual machine that hosts the SAP ASE database. This script gets the ASE system ready for backup.
- Assign the following privileges and settings for the backup operation:
  
  | Privilege/ Setting | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | Operator role | Enable this **ASE database role** for the database user to create a custom database user for the backup and restore operations and pass it in the preregistration script. |
  | **Map external file** privilege | Enable this role to allow database file access. |
  | **Own any database** privilege |Allows differential backups. The **Allow incremental dumps** for the database should be **True**. |
  | **Trunc log on chkpt** privilege | Disable this privilege for all databases that you want to protect using the **ASE Backup**. Allows you to back up the database log to recovery services vault. Learn more about the [`SAP note - 2921874 - "trunc log on chkpt" in databases with HADR - SAP ASE - SAP for Me`](https://me.sap.com/notes/0002921874). |

  >[!Note]
  >Log backups aren't supported for the Master database. For other system databases, log backups can only be supported if the database's log files are stored separately from its data files. By default, system databases are created with both data and log files in the same database device, which prevents log backups. To enable log backups, the database administrator must change the location of the log files to a separate device.

- Use the Azure built-in roles to configure backup- assignment of roles and scope to the resources. The following Contributor role allows you to run the **Configure Protection** operation on the database VM:

  | Resource (Access control) | Role | User, group, or service principal |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Source Azure VM running the ASE database | Virtual Machine Contributor | Allows you to configure the backup operation. |


## Create a custom role for Azure Backup

To create a custom role for Azure Backup, run the following bash commands:

>[!Note]
>After each of these commands, ensure that you run the command *`go`* to execute the statement.

1. Sign in to the database using the single sign-on (SSO) role user.

   ```bash
    isql -U sapsso -P <password> -S <sid> -X
   ```

2. Create a role.

   ```bash
    create role azurebackup_role
   ```

3. Grant operator role to the new role.

   ```bash
    grant role oper_role to azurebackup_role
   ```

4. Enable granular permissions.

   ```bash
    sp_configure 'enable granular permissions', 1
   ```

5. Sign in to the database using the `SA` role user.

   ```bash
    isql -U sapsa -P <password> -S <sid> -X
   ```

6. Switch to the master database.

   ```bash
    use master
   ```

7. Grant **map external file** privilege to the new role.

   ```bash
    grant map external file to azurebackup_role
   ```

8. Sign in again using the SSO role user.

   ```bash
    isql -U sapsso -P <password> -S <sid> -X
   ```

9. Create a user.

   ```bash
    sp_addlogin backupuser, <password>
   ```

10. Grant the custom role to the user.

    ```bash
     grant role azurebackup_role to backupuser

    ```
11. Set the custom role as the default for the user.

    ```bash
     sp_modifylogin backupuser, "add default role", azurebackup_role
    ```

12. Grant **own any database** privilege to the custom role as **SA** user.

    ```bash
     grant own any database to azurebackup_role
    ```

13. Sign in to the database as **SA** user again.

    ```bash
     isql -U sapsa -P <password> -S <sid> -X
    ```
14. Enable file access.

    ```bash
     sp_configure "enable file access", 1
    ```

15. Enable differential backup on the database.

    ```bash
     use master
     go
     sp_dboption <database_name>, 'allow incremental dumps', true
     go
    ```

16. Disable **trunc log on chkpt** on the database.

    ```bash
     use master
     go
     sp_dboption <database_name>, 'trunc log on chkpt', false
     go
    ```

## Establish network connectivity

For all operations, an SAP ASE database running on an Azure VM requires connectivity to the Azure Backup service, Azure Storage, and Microsoft Entra ID. You can achieve this connectivity by using private endpoints or by allowing access to the required public IP addresses or Fully Qualified Domain Names
 (FQDNs). If you don't allow proper connectivity to the required Azure services, it might lead to failure in operations, such as database discovery, configuring backup, performing backups, and restoring data.

The following table lists the various alternatives you can use to establish connectivity:

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Private endpoints | Allow backups over private IPs in the virtual network. <br><br> Provide granular control on the network and vault side. | 	Incurs [standard private endpoint costs](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/private-link/). |
| Network Security Group (NSG) service tags | Easier to manage because the range changes are automatically merged. <br><br> No extra costs. | Used with NSGs only. <br><br> Provides access to the entire service. |
| Azure Firewall FQDN tags | Easier to manage since the required FQDNs are automatically managed. | Used with Azure Firewall only. |
| Allow access to service FQDNs/IPs | No extra costs. <br><br> Works with all network security appliances and firewalls. <br><br> You can also use service endpoints for Storage. However, for Azure Backup and Microsoft Entra ID, you need to assign the access to the corresponding IPs/FQDNs. | A broad set of IPs or FQDNs might be required to be accessed. |
| [Virtual Network Service Endpoint](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview) | Used for Azure Storage. <br><br> Provides large benefit to optimize performance of data plane traffic. | Can't be used for Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Backup service. |
| Network Virtual Appliance | Used for Azure Storage, Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Backup service. <br><br> **Data plane** <br> - Azure Storage: `*.blob.core.windows.net`, `*.queue.core.windows.net`, `*.blob.storage.azure.net` <br><br> **Management plane** <br> - Microsoft Entra ID: Allow access to FQDNs mentioned in sections 56 and 59 of [Microsoft 365 Common and Office Online](/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true#microsoft-365-common-and-office-online). <br> - Azure Backup service: `.backup.windowsazure.com` <br><br> Learn more [about Azure Firewall service tags](/azure/firewall/fqdn-tags). | Adds overhead to data plane traffic and decrease throughput/performance. |

The following sections detail about the usage of the connectivity options.

### Private endpoints

Private endpoints allow you to connect securely from servers in a virtual network to your Recovery Services vault. The private endpoint uses an IP from the Virtual Network (VNET) address space for your vault. The network traffic between your resources in the virtual network and the vault travels over your virtual network and a private link on the Microsoft backbone network. This operation eliminates exposure from the public internet. Learn  more on [private endpoints for Azure Backup](private-endpoints.md).

>[!Note]
>- Private endpoints are supported for Azure Backup and Azure storage. Microsoft Entra ID has support for private endpoints. Until they are generally available, Azure backup supports setting up proxy for Microsoft Entra ID so that no outbound connectivity is required for ASE VMs. For more information, see the [proxy support section](backup-azure-sap-hana-database.md#use-an-http-proxy-server-to-route-traffic).
>- The download operation for SAP ASE Pre-registration script (ASE workload scripts) requires Internet access. However, on VMs with Private Endpoint (PE) enabled, the pre-registration script can't download these workload scripts directly. So, itâ€™s necessary to download the script on a local VM or another VM with internet access, and then use SCP or any other transfer method to move it to the PE enabled VM.

### Network Security Group tags

If you use Network Security Groups (NSG), use the AzureBackup service tag to allow outbound access to Azure Backup. In addition to the Azure Backup tag, you must allow connectivity for authentication and data transfer by creating similar [NSG rules](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview#service-tags) for Microsoft Entra ID and Azure Storage (Storage). 

To create a rule for the Azure Backup tag, follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to **Network security groups** and select **the network security group**.
2. On the **Settings** pane, select **Outbound security rules**.
3. Select **Add**.
4. Enter all the required details for [creating a new rule](/azure/virtual-network/manage-network-security-group#security-rule-settings). Ensure the **Destination** is set to **Service Tag** and **Destination service tag** is set to `AzureBackup`.
5.	Select **Add** to save the newly created outbound security rule.

You can similarly create NSG outbound security rules for Azure Storage and Microsoft Entra ID. Learn more about [service tags](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview).

### Azure Firewall tags

If you're using Azure Firewall, create an application rule by using the AzureBackup [Azure Firewall FQDN tag](/azure/firewall/fqdn-tags). This rule allows all outbound access to Azure Backup.
 
>[!Note]
>Azure Backup currently doesn't support the TLS inspection enabled Application Rule on Azure Firewall.

### Allow access to service IP ranges

If you choose to allow access service IPs, see the [IP ranges in the JSON file](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519). You need to allow access to IPs corresponding to Azure Backup, Azure Storage, and Microsoft Entra ID.

### Allow access to service FQDNs

You can also use the following FQDNs to allow access to the required services from your servers:

| Service | Domain names to be accessed | Ports |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Backup | `*.backup.windowsazure.com` | 443 |
| Azure Storage | `*.blob.core.windows.net` <br><br> `*.queue.core.windows.net` <br><br> `*.blob.storage.azure.net` | 443 |
| Microsoft Entra ID | `*.login.microsoft.com` <br><br> Allow access to FQDNs under sections 56 and 59 according to [this article](/office365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges#microsoft-365-common-and-office-online). | 443 <br><br> As applicable. |

#### Use an HTTP proxy server to route traffic

>[!Note]
>Currently, the HTTP Proxy for Microsoft Entra ID traffic is only supported for the SAP ASE database. If you need to remove outbound connectivity requirements (for Azure Backup and Azure Storage traffic) for database backups via Azure Backup in ASE VMs, use other options, such as private endpoints.

#### Use an HTTP proxy server for Microsoft Entra ID traffic

To use an HTTP proxy server to route traffic for Microsoft Entra ID, follow these steps:

1. In the database, go to the `opt/msawb/bin` folder.
2. Create a new JSON file named `ExtensionSettingsOverrides.json`.
3. Add a key-value pair to the JSON file as follows:

      ```json
      {
         "UseProxyForAAD":true,
         "UseProxyForAzureBackup":false,
         "UseProxyForAzureStorage":false,
         "ProxyServerAddress":"http://xx.yy.zz.mm:port"
      }
      ```

4. Change the permissions and ownership of the file as follows:

      ```bash
      chmod 750 ExtensionSettingsOverrides.json
      chown root:msawb ExtensionSettingsOverrides.json
      ```

>[!Note]
>No restart of any service is required. The Azure Backup service will attempt to route the Microsoft Entra ID traffic via the proxy server mentioned in the JSON file.

#### Use outbound rules

If the **Firewall** or **NSG** setting block the `management.azure.com` domain from Azure Virtual Machine, snapshot backups fail.

Create the following outbound rule and allow the domain name to back up the database. Learn [how to create the outbound rules](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-access-azureml-behind-firewall).

- **Source**: IP address of the VM.
- **Destination**: Service Tag.
- **Destination Service Tag**: `AzureResourceManager`

[!INCLUDE [How to create a Recovery Services vault](../../includes/backup-create-rs-vault.md)]

## Enable Cross Region Restore
     
In the Recovery Services vault, you can enable [Cross Region Restore](backup-azure-recovery-services-vault-overview.md) that allows you to restore the database to a secondary region. Learn [how to turn on Cross Region Restore](backup-create-rs-vault.md#set-cross-region-restore).

:::image type="content" source="./media/sap-ase-database-backup/enable-cross-region-restore.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to enable Cross Region Restore in the Recovery Services vault. " lightbox="./media/sap-ase-database-backup/enable-cross-region-restore.png":::

## Discover the SAP ASE databases

To discover the SAP ASE databases, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Business Continuity Center**, and then select **+ Configure protection**.

1. On the **Configure protection** pane, select **Resource managed by** as **Azure**, **Datasource type** as **SAP ASE (Sybase) in Azure VM**, and **Solution** as **Azure Backup**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-ase-database-backup-tutorial/select-data-source-type.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the selection of the data source type." lightbox="./media/sap-ase-database-backup-tutorial/select-data-source-type.png":::
 
1. Select **Continue**.
1. On the **Start: Configure Backup** pane,  under **Vault**, click **Select vault**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-ase-database-backup-tutorial/select-vault.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to select a vault to configure backup." lightbox="./media/sap-ase-database-backup-tutorial/start-database-discovery.png":::


1. On the **Select a Vault** pane, under **Filter by name**, type the vault name that hosts the SAP ASE database.
1. Select the vault from the list, and then click **Select**.
1. On the **Start: Configure Backup** pane, select **Continue**.
1. On the **Backup Goal** pane, select **Start Discovery** to initiate discovery of unprotected Linux VMs in the vault region.

     :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-ase-database-backup-tutorial/start-database-discovery.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to start the discovery of the database." lightbox="./media/sap-ase-database-backup-tutorial/start-database-discovery.png":::

   >[!Note]
   >- After discovery, unprotected VMs appear in the portal, listed by name and resource group.
   >- If a VM isn't listed as expected, check if it's already backed up in a vault.
   >- Multiple VMs can have the same name if they belong to different resource groups.
 
1. On the **Select Virtual Machines** pane, download the prepost script that provides permissions for the Azure Backup service to access the SAP ASE VMs for database discovery.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-ase-database-backup-tutorial/select-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to select a database for backup configuration from the discovered list." lightbox="./media/sap-ase-database-backup-tutorial/select-database.png"::: 

1. Run the script on each VM hosting SAP ASE databases that you want to back up.
1. After you run the script on the VMs, on the **Select Virtual Machines** pane, select the *VMs*, and then select **Discover DBs**.

   Azure Backup discovers all SAP ASE databases on the VM. During discovery, Azure Backup registers the VM with the vault, and installs an extension on the VM. No agent is installed on the database.

## Configure the SAP ASE (Sybase) database backup

After the database discovery process is complete, Azure Backup redirects to the **Backup Goal** pane, allowing you to configure backup settings for the selected VM hosting the SAP ASE database.

To configure the backup operation for the SAP ASE database, follow these steps:

1.	On the **Backup Goal** pane, under **Step 2**, select **Configure Backup**.
 
     :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-ase-database-backup-tutorial/configure-backup.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to start the backup configuration." lightbox="./media/sap-ase-database-backup-tutorial/configure-backup.png":::

1. On the **Configure Backup** pane, on the **Backup policy** tab, under **Backup policy**, select **Create a new policy** for the databases. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-ase-database-backup-tutorial/create-backup-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to start creating the backup policy." lightbox="./media/sap-ase-database-backup-tutorial/create-backup-policy.png":::

   A backup policy defines when backups are taken, and how long they're retained.

   - A policy is created at the vault level.
   - Multiple vaults can use the same backup policy, but you must apply the backup policy to each vault.

1. On the **Create policy** pane, under **Policy name**, enter a name for the new policy.

     :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-ase-database-backup-tutorial/add-backup-policy-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to provide a name for the new backup policy." lightbox="./media/sap-ase-database-backup-tutorial/add-backup-policy-name.png":::
 

1. Under **Full backup**, select **Edit**.
1. On the **Full Backup policy** pane, select a **Backup Frequency**, and then select **Daily** or **Weekly** as required.

   - **Daily**: Select the **hour** and **time zone** in which the backup job begins.

     >[!Note]
     >- You must run a full backup. You can't turn off this option.
     >- Go to Full Backup policy to view the policy settings.
     >- You can't create differential backups for daily full backups.

   - **Weekly**: Select the **day of the week**, **hour**, and **time zone** in which the backup job runs.

   The following screenshot shows the backup schedule for full backups.

     :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-ase-database-backup/set-backup-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the configuration of backup rules." lightbox="./media/sap-ase-database-backup/set-backup-rules.png":::


1. On the **Retention Range**, define the retention range for the full backup.
   >[!Note]
   >- By default, all options are selected. Clear any retention range limits you don't want to use, and set those that you want.
   >- The minimum retention period for any type of backup (full/differential/log) is seven days.
   >- Recovery points are tagged for retention based on their retention range. For example, if you select a daily full backup, only one full backup is triggered each day.
   >- The backup for a specific day is tagged and retained based on the weekly retention range and setting.
   >- The monthly and yearly retention ranges behave in a similar way.

1. Select **OK** to save the policy configuration.
1. On the **Create Policy** pane, under **Differential Backup**, select **Edit** to add a differential policy.

1. On the **Differential Backup policy** pane, select **Enable** to open the frequency and retention controls.

   >[!Note]
   >- At most, you can trigger one differential backup per day.
   >- Differential backups can be retained for a maximum of 180 days. If you need longer retention, you must use full backups.

1. Select **OK** to save the policy configuration.
1. On the **Backup policy** pane,  under **Log backup**, select **Edit** to add a transactional log backup policy.

1. On the **Log Backup policy** pane, select **Enable** to set the frequency and retention controls.

     >[!Note]
     >- Log backups only begin to flow after a successful full backup is completed.
     >- Each log backup is chained to the previous full backup to form a recovery chain. This full backup is retained until the retention of the last log backup has expired. This might mean that the full backup is retained for an extra period to make sure all the logs can be recovered. Let's assume a user has a weekly full backup, daily differential and 2-hour logs. All of them are retained for 30 days. But the weekly full can be cleaned up/deleted only after the next full backup is available, that is, after 30 + seven days. For example, if a weekly full backup is performed on November 16th, it remains stored until December 16th in accordance with the retention policy. The final log backup for this full backup occurs on November 22nd, before the next scheduled full backup. Since this log backup remains accessible until December 22nd, the November 16th full backup cannot be deleted until that date. As a result, the November 16th full backup is retained until December 22nd.

1. Select **OK** to save the log backup policy configuration.
1. On the **Create Policy** pane, select **OK** to complete the backup policy creation.
1. On the **Configure Backup** pane, on the **Backup policy** tab, under **Backup Policy**, select the new policy from the dropdown list, and then select **Add**.
1. Select **Configure backup**.
1. On the **Select items to backup** pane, select the Databases for protection, and then select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-ase-database-backup/select-database-items-for-backup.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the selection of the database items for backup." lightbox="./media/sap-ase-database-backup/select-database-items-for-backup.png":::
  

1. On the **Configure Backup** pane, on the **Review** tab, review  the backup configuration.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-ase-database-backup/select-enable-backup.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the completion of backup configuration." lightbox="./media/sap-ase-database-backup/select-enable-backup.png":::

1. Select **Enable Backup** to start the backup operation.

## Run an on-demand backup for SAP ASE database

To run on-demand backups for SAP ASE database, follow these steps:

1.	Go to **Business Continuity Center**, and then select **Vaults**.
1. On the **Vaults** pane, select the Recovery Services vault from the list that is used to configure backup.
1. On the selected **Recovery Services vault**, select **Backup items**.
1.	On the **Backup Item** pane, select the **Backup Management Type** as **SAP ASE (Sybase) in Azure VM**.
1.	Select **view details** of Database for on-demand backup.
1.	Select **Backup now** for taking on-demand backup.
