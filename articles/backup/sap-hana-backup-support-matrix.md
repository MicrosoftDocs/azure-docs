# Support matrix for backup of SAP HANA databases on Azure VMs

Azure Backup supports the backup of SAP HANA databases to Azure. This article summarizes the scenarios supported and limitations present when you use Azure Backup to back up SAP HANA databases on Azure VMs.

> [!NOTE]
> The frequency of log backup can now be set to a minimum of 15 minutes. Log backups only begin to flow after a successful full backup for the database has completed.

## Scenario support

| **Encryption** | SSLEnforce, HANA data encryption |            |
| **HANA Instances**         | A single SAP HANA instance on a  single Azure VM – scale up only | Multiple SAP HANA instances on a  single VM. You can protect only one of these multiple instances at a time.                  |
| **HANA database types**    | Single Database Container (SDC)  ON 1.x, Multi-Database Container (MDC) on 2.x | MDC in HANA 1.x                                              |
| **HANA database size**     | HANA database of size upto 40 TB (this isn't the memory size of the HANA system).               |                                                              |

| **Number of full backups per day**     |   One scheduled backup.  <br><br>   Three on-demand backups. <br><br> We recommend not to trigger more than three backups per day. However, to allow user retries in case of failed attempts, hard limit for on-demand backups is set to nine attempts.  |
| **HANA deployments** | HANA System Replication (HSR) |           |
| **Special configurations** |                                                              | SAP HANA + Dynamic Tiering <br>  Cloning through LaMa        |
| **Compression** | You can enable HANA Native compression via the Backup policy. [See the SAP HANA document](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_PLATFORM/6b94445c94ae495c83a19646e7c3fd56/86943e9f8d5343c59577755edff8296b.html). |       |
| **Multi-streaming backup** | You can increase your streaming backup throughput from *420 MBps* to *1.5 GBps*. [Learn more](#support-for-multistreaming-data-backups). |      |
| **File System types** | File Systems `ext3` and `xfs` are supported for SAP HANA database instance snapshots backup. | Other File Systems aren't supported. |

>[!NOTE]
>- Azure Backup doesn’t automatically adjust for daylight saving time changes when backing up a SAP HANA database running in an Azure VM. We recommend you to modify the policy manually as needed.
>- You can now [monitor the backup and restore](./sap-hana-db-manage.md#monitor-manual-backup-jobs-in-the-portal) jobs (to the same machine) triggered from HANA native clients (SAP HANA Studio/ Cockpit/ DBA Cockpit) in the Azure portal.

## Support for multistreaming data backups

- **Parameters to enable SAP HANA settings for multistreaming**: 
  - *parallel_data_backup_backint_channels*
  - *data_backup_buffer_size (optional)*

  >[!Note]
  >By setting the above HANA parameters will lead to increased memory and CPU utilization. We recommend that you monitor the memory consumption and CPU utilization as overutilization might negatively impact the backup and other HANA operations.

- **Backup performance for databases**: The performance gain will be more prominent for larger databases.

- **Database size applicable for multistreaming**: The number of multistreaming channels applies to all data backups *larger than 128 GB*. Data backups smaller than 128 GB always use only one channel.

- **Supported backup throughput**: Multistreaming currently supports the data backup throughput of up to *1.5 GBps*. Recovery throughput is slower than the backup throughput.

- **VM configuration applicable for multistreaming**: To utilize the benefits of multistreaming, the VM needs to have a minimum configuration of *16 vCPUs* and *128 GB* of RAM.
- **Limiting factors**: Throughput of *total disk LVM striping* and *VM network*, whichever hits first.
