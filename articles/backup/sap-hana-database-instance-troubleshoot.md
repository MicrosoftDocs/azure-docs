### UserErrorVMIdentityRequiresUpdateVMRole

**Error message**: Azure VM's system-assigned managed identity not authorized to attach disks on virtual machine.

**Recommended action**: Assign the Virtual Machine Contributor role to the Azure VM's system-assigned managed identity on target Azure VM and retry the operation. For more information, see the [Azure workload backup troubleshooting scripts](https://aka.ms/DBSnapshotRBACPermissions).

### UserErrorVMIdentityRequiresReadVMRole

**Error message**: Azure VM's system-assigned managed identity not authorized to read virtual machine storage profile.

**Recommended action**: Assign the Virtual Machine Contributor role to the Azure VM's system-assigned managed identity on the target 
Azure VM and retry the operation. For more information, see the [Azure workload backup troubleshooting scripts](https://aka.ms/DBSnapshotRBACPermissions).

### UserErrorDiskTypeNotSupportedForWkloadBackup

**Error message**: Unmanaged disk not supported for workload snapshot backups.

**Recommended action**: Create a managed disk from the disk vhd and retry the operation.

### Error code: UserErrorMaxDisksSupportedForWkloadBackupExceeded

**Error message**: Disks count exceeded maximum disks supported for workload backup.

**Recommended action**: Check the [support matrix for workload snapshot backups](sap-hana-backup-support-matrix.md#scenario-support). Then reduce the disk count accordingly and retry the operation.

### UserErrorWLBackupFilesystemTypeNotSupported

**Error message**: File system type not supported for workload snapshot backups.

**Recommended action**: Check the [support matrix for workload snapshot backups](sap-hana-backup-support-matrix.md#scenario-support). Then copy datasources to a volume with supported filesystem type and retry the operation.

### UserErrorWLBackupDeviceTypeNotSupported

**Error message**: Device type not supported for workload snapshot backups.

**Recommended action**: Check the [support matrix for workload snapshot backups](sap-hana-backup-support-matrix.md#scenario-support). Then move datasource to supported device type and retry the operation.

### UserErrorWLOnOSVolumeNotSupported

**Error message**: Workload data on OS volume is not supported for snapshot based backups.

**Recommended action**: To use snapshot backups, move the workload data to another non-OS volume.

### UserErrorVMIdentityRequiresGetDiskSASRole

**Error message**: Azure VM's system-assigned identity is not authorized to get disk shared access signature (SAS URI).

**Recommended action**: Assign the Disk Snapshot Contributor role to the Azure VM's system-assigned managed identity at disk scope. For more information, see the [Azure workload backup troubleshooting scripts](https://aka.ms/DBSnapshotRBACPermissions). Then retry the operation.

### UserErrorSnapshotTargetRGNotFoundOrVMIdentityRequiresPermissions

**Error message**: Either the snapshot resource group does not exist or the Azure VM's system-assigned managed identity is not authorized to create snapshots in snapshot resource group.

**Recommended action**: Ensure that the snapshot resource group specified in the database instance snapshot policy exists, and required actions are assigned to the Azure VM's system-assigned managed identity. For more information, see the [Azure workload backup troubleshooting scripts](https://aka.ms/DBSnapshotRBACPermissions).

### UserErrorVMIdentityRequiresPermissionsForSnapshot

**Error message**: Azure VM's system-assigned managed identity does not have adequate permissions for snapshot based workload backup.

**Recommended action**: Assign required role actions for the Azure VM identity mentioned in additional error details. For more information, see the [Azure workload backup troubleshooting scripts](https://aka.ms/DBSnapshotRBACPermissions).

### UserErrorSnapshotOperationsUnsupportedWithInactiveDatabase

**Error message**: Snapshot backups are not supported on inactive database(s).

**Recommended action**: Ensure that all databases are up and running, then retry the operation.

### Error code: UserErrorDeleteSnapshotRoleOrResourceGroupMissing

**Error message**: Azure Backup does not have permissions to delete workload backup snapshots or the snapshot resource group does not exist.

**Recommended action**: Assign the Disk Snapshot Contributor role to the Backup Management Service at snapshot resource group scope. For more information, see the [Azure workload backup troubleshooting scripts](https://aka.ms/DBSnapshotRBACPermissions). Then retry the operation.

### UserErrorConflictingFileSystemPresentOnTargetMachine

**Error message**: Can't attach snapshot because disks/filesystem with the same identity are present on the target machine.

**Recommended action**: Select another target machine for snapshot restore. For more information, see the [SAP HANA database backup troubleshooting article](https://aka.ms/HANASnapshotTSGuide).

### UserErrorDiskAttachLimitReached

**Error message**: The limit on maximum number of attached disks on the VM is reached.

**Recommended action**: Detach unused disks or perform restore on a different machine. For more information, see the [SAP HANA database backup troubleshooting article](https://aka.ms/HANASnapshotTSGuide).

### Error code: UserErrorPITSnapshotDeleted

**Error message**: The selected snapshot recovery point is deleted or not present in the resource group.

**Recommended action**: Select another snapshot recovery point. For more information, see the [SAP HANA database backup troubleshooting article](https://aka.ms/HANASnapshotTSGuide).

### UserErrorRestoreDiskIncompatible

**Error message**: The restored disk type is not supported by the target vm.

**Recommended action**: Upgrade the VM or use a compatible target vm for restore. For more information, see the [SAP HANA database backup troubleshooting article](https://aka.ms/HANASnapshotTSGuide).

### UserErrorSnasphotRestoreContextMissingForDBRecovery 
 
**Error message**: Snapshot based point in time restore operation could not be started because one of the previous restore steps is not complete

**Cause**: Snapshot attach and mount or SystemDB recovery isn't done on the target VM.

**Recommended action**:  Retry the operation after completing a snapshot attach and mount operation on the target machine. 

### UserErrorInvalidScenarioForSnapshotPointInTimeRecovery 

**Cause**:  The snapshot point-in-time restore operation failed as the underlying database on the target machine is protected with Azure Backup.

**Recommended action**: Retry the restore operation after you stop protection of the databases on the target machine and ensure that the *Backint path is empty*. [Learn more about Backint path](https://aka.ms/HANABackupConfigurations).

### OperationCancelledBecauseSameOperationQueuedUserError

**Error code**: `OperationCancelledBecauseSameOperationQueuedUserError`

**Error message**: This error happens to prevent multiple backups triggering on the same database/datasource. The next backup should finish successfully once the concurrent task/backup  is completed. 

**Cause**: In some cases, where there are large numbers of databases in the same container, backups will trigger and get queued. The queue will cause the backup to start with a delay. So, it'll not be evident from start time and end time which task is concurrent.

**Recommended action**: You need to reduce frequency on certain databases or distribute it to another container instead of having a single container.

### UserErrorWLBackupFilesystemTypeNotSupported

**Error code**: `UserErrorWLBackupFilesystemTypeNotSupported`

**Error message**: File Systems `ext3` and `xfs` are currently supported. The operation fails for any other File System.

**Recommended action**: Ensure that you're using the supported File System

## Appendix

**Perform restoration actions in SAP HANA studio**

1. Recover System database from data snapshot using HANA Studio. See this [SAP documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_COCKPIT/afa922439b204e9caf22c78b6b69e4f2/9fd053d58cb94ac69655b4ebc41d7b05.html).
1. Run the pre-registration script to reset the user credentials.
1. Once done, recover all tenant databases from a data snapshot using HANA Studio. See this [HANA documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_COCKPIT/afa922439b204e9caf22c78b6b69e4f2/b2c283094b9041e7bdc0830c06b77bf8.html).
