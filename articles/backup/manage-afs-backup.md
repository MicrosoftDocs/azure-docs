# Manage Azure Files backups

This article describes common tasks for managing and monitoring backed-up Azure Files using [Azure Backup](./backup-overview.md). 

Azure Backup offers a simple, reliable, and secure way to protect your enterprise File Shares using [snapshot](azure-file-share-backup-overview.md?tabs=snapshot) and [vaulted](azure-file-share-backup-overview.md?tabs=vault-standard) backups, ensuring data recovery for accidental or malicious deletion.

## Monitor Azure Files backup jobs

When you trigger a backup or restore operation, the backup service creates a job for tracking. You can monitor the progress of all jobs on the **Jobs** pane.

To open the **Jobs** pane, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Business Continuity Center** and select **Jobs** under the **Monitoring** section.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-afs-backup/jobs-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Backup Jobs in the Monitoring section." lightbox="./media/manage-afs-backup/jobs-list.png":::

   The **Backup Jobs** pane lists the status of all jobs.

1. On the **Backup Jobs** pane, select **Azure Files (Azure Storage)** as the datasource type and select any row to see details of the particular job.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-afs-backup/azure-files-backup-jobs.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the list of jobs." lightbox="./media/manage-afs-backup/azure-files-backup-jobs.png":::
   
    >[!NOTE]
    >For *snapshot tier*, the data transferred to the vault is reported as *0*.

## Monitor Azure Files backup operations by using Azure Backup reports

Azure Backup provides a reporting solution that uses [Azure Monitor logs](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial) and [Azure workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview). These resources help you get rich insights into your backups. You can use these reports to gain visibility into Azure Files backup items, jobs at item level and details of active policies. Using the Email Report feature available in Backup Reports, you can create automated tasks to receive periodic reports via email. [Learn](./configure-reports.md#get-started) how to configure and view Azure Backup reports.

## Create a new policy

You can create a new policy to back up Azure Files from the **Protection policies** section of **Azure Business Continuity Center**. All policies created when you configured backup for File Shares show up with the **Policy Type** as **Azure File Share**.

To create a new backup policy, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Business Continuity Center** > **Protection policies**, and then select **+ Create Policy** > **Create Backup Policy**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-afs-backup/azure-files-backup-add-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the option to start creating a new backup policy." lightbox="./media/manage-afs-backup/azure-files-backup-add-policy.png":::

1. On the **Start: Create Policy** pane, select **Azure Files (Azure Storage)** as the datasource type, select the vault under which the policy should be created, and then select **Continue**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-afs-backup/azure-file-share-select-vault-for-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing to select Azure Files as the policy type.":::

1. Once the **Backup policy** pane for **Azure File Share** opens, specify the policy name.

1. Select the appropriate backup tier based on your data protection requirements.

   - **Snapshot**:  Enables only snapshot-based backups that are stored locally and can only provide protection for accidental deletion.
   - **Vault-Standard**: Provides comprehensive data protection.

1. In **Backup schedule**,  select an appropriate frequency for the backups - **Daily** or **Hourly**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-afs-backup/backup-frequency-types.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the frequency types for backups.":::

   - **Daily**: Triggers one backup per day. For daily frequency, select the appropriate values for:

     - **Time**: The timestamp when the backup job needs to be triggered.
     - **Time zone**: The corresponding time zone for the backup job.

   - **Hourly**: Triggers multiple backups per day. For hourly frequency, select the appropriate values for:
   
     - **Schedule**: The time interval (in hours) between the consecutive backups.
     - **Start time**: The time when the first backup job of the day needs to be triggered.
     - **Duration**: Represents the backup window (in hours), that is, the time span in which the backup jobs need to be triggered as per the selected schedule.
     - **Time zone**: The corresponding time zone for the backup job.
     
     For example, you have the RPO (recovery point objective) requirement of 4 hours and your working hours are 9 AM to 9 PM. To meet these requirements, the configuration for backup schedule would be:
    
     - Schedule: Every 4 hours
     - Start time: 9 AM 
     - Duration: 12 hours 
     
     :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-afs-backup/hourly-backup-frequency-values-scenario.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing an example of hourly backup frequency values.":::

     Based on your selection, the backup job details (the time stamps when backup job would be triggered) display on the backup policy pane.

   >[!Note]
   >If you select the **Vault-Standard** as the backup tier, snapshots are taken as per the configured backup schedule. However, the data is transferred to the vault from the last snapshot of the day.

1. In **Retention range** section, specify appropriate *Snapshot retention* and *Vault retention* values for backups - tagged as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.

1. After defining all attributes of the policy, select **Create**.
  
### View policy

To view the existing backup policies:

1. Go to **Business Continuity Center** > **Protection policies** under the **Manage** section, and then select **Azure Backup** as a solution.

   All Backup policies configured across your vault appear.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-afs-backup/azure-files-backup-policies-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the all backup policies." lightbox="./media/manage-afs-backup/azure-files-backup-policies-list.png":::

1. To view policies specific to **Azure Files (Azure Storage)**, select **Azure File Share** as the datasource type.

## Modify policy

You can modify a backup policy to change the backup frequency or retention range. Also, you can switch *backup tier* from *Snapshot* to *Vault-Standard*.

To modify a policy, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Business Continuity Center** > **Protection policies** under the **Manage** section, and then select **Azure Backup** as a solution.

   All Backup policies configured across your vaults appear.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-afs-backup/azure-files-backup-policies-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing all Backup policies in vault." lightbox="./media/manage-afs-backup/azure-files-backup-policies-list.png":::

1. To view policies specific to Azure Files, select **Azure Files (Azure Storage)** as the datasource type.

   Select the policy you want to update.

1. On the **Modify policy** pane, edit the *backup schedule*, *retention*, or *backup tier* as required, and then select **Update**.

   >[!Note]
   >The change of *backup tier* will retain the existing snapshots *AS-IS* as per the configured retention in the current policy. The future backups will be moved to the vault and retained as per the vault retention you configure. The change of *backup tier* is an irreversible operation and switching from vault to snapshot tier requires reconfiguration of the backup. 
   
   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-afs-backup/save-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to modify a backup policy for Azure Files." lightbox="./media/manage-afs-backup/save-policy.png":::

   An *Update in Progress* message appears in the **Modify policy** pane. Once the policy changes successfully, the *Successfully updated the backup policy* message appears.
## Stop protection on a File Share

There are two ways to stop protecting Azure Files:

* Stop all future backup jobs, and *delete all recovery points*.
* Stop all future backup jobs, but *leave the recovery points*.

There might be a cost associated with leaving the recovery points in storage, because the underlying snapshots that Azure Backup creates are retained. The benefit of leaving the recovery points is that you can restore the File Share later. For information about the cost of leaving the recovery points, see the [pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/backup/). If you decide to delete all the recovery points, you can't restore the File Share.

To stop protection for Azure Files, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Business Continuity Center** > **Protected Items**, and then select **Azure Backup** as a **Solution** and  **Azure Files (Azure Storage)** as the **Datasource type**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-afs-backup/azure-file-share-backup-instances.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to select Azure Files as the data type." lightbox="./media/manage-afs-backup/azure-file-share-backup-instances.png":::

1. Select the backup item for which you want to stop protection. The list of actions available for the item appears. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-afs-backup/select-backup-items-stop-protection.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the list of actions available for the item." lightbox="./media/manage-afs-backup/select-backup-items-stop-protection.png":::

1. Select the **Stop backup** option.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-afs-backup/stop-backup.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to stop backup." lightbox="./media/manage-afs-backup/stop-backup.png":::

1. On the **Stop Backup** pane, select **Retain Backup Data** or **Delete Backup Data**. Then select **Stop backup**.

    ![Select Retain Backup Data or Delete Backup Data](./media/manage-afs-backup/retain-or-delete-backup-data.png)

## Resume protection on a File Share

If the **Retain Backup Data** option was selected when protection for the File Share was stopped, it's possible to resume protection. If the **Delete Backup Data** option was selected, protection for the File Share can't resume.

To resume protection for the Azure Files, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Business Continuity Center** > **Protected Items**, and then select **Azure Backup** as a **Solution** and  **Azure Files (Azure Storage)** as the **Datasource type**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-afs-backup/azure-file-share-backup-instances.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to select Azure Files as the datasource type." lightbox="./media/manage-afs-backup/azure-file-share-backup-instances.png":::

1. Select the backup item for which you want to resume protection. The list of actions available for the item appears. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-afs-backup/select-backup-items-resume-protection.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the list of actions available for the item to resume protection." lightbox="./media/manage-afs-backup/select-backup-items-resume-protection.png":::

1. Select the **Resume backup** option.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-afs-backup/resume-backup.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to resume backup." lightbox="./media/manage-afs-backup/resume-backup.png":::

1. The **Backup Policy** pane opens. To resume backup, select a policy of your choice.

1. After you select a backup policy, select **Save**.

   An **Update in Progress** message appears in the portal. After the backup successfully resumes, you'll see the message _Successfully updated backup policy for the Protected Azure Files._

   ![Successfully updated backup policy](./media/manage-afs-backup/successfully-updated.png)

## Delete backup data

You can delete the backup of a File Share during the **Stop backup** job, or anytime after you stop the protection. It might be beneficial to wait days or even weeks before you delete the recovery points. When you delete backup data, you can't choose specific recovery points to delete. If you decide to delete your backup data, you delete all recovery points associated with the File Share.

The following procedure assumes that the protection was stopped for the File Share.

To delete backup data for the Azure Files:

1. After the backup job is stopped, the **Resume backup** and **Delete backup data** options are available in the **Backup Item** dashboard. Select the **Delete backup data** option.

   ![Delete backup data](./media/manage-afs-backup/delete-backup-data.png)

1. The **Delete Backup Data** pane opens. To confirm deletion, enter the name of the File Share. Optionally, provide more information in the **Reason** or **Comments** boxes. After you're sure about deleting the backup data, select **Delete**.

   ![Confirm delete data](./media/manage-afs-backup/confirm-delete-data.png)

## Unregister a storage account

To protect your File Shares in a particular storage account by using a different Recovery Services vault, first [stop protection for all File Shares](#stop-protection-on-a-file-share) with the **Delete backup data** option in that storage account. Then unregister the account from the current Recovery Services vault used for protection.

The following procedure assumes that the protection was stopped for all File Shares in the storage account you want to unregister.

To unregister the storage account:

1. Open the Recovery Services vault where your storage account is registered.
1. On the **Overview** pane, select the **Backup Infrastructure** option under the **Manage** section.

   ![Select Backup Infrastructure](./media/manage-afs-backup/backup-infrastructure.png)

1. The **Backup Infrastructure** pane opens. Select **Storage Accounts** under the **Azure Storage Accounts** section.

   ![Select Storage Accounts](./media/manage-afs-backup/storage-accounts.png)

1. After you select **Storage Accounts**, a list of storage accounts registered with the vault appears.
1. Right-click the storage account you want to unregister, and select **Unregister**.
