# Quickstart: Configure vaulted backup for Azure Blobs using Azure Backup via Azure PowerShell

This quickstart describes how to configure vaulted backup for Azure Blobs using Azure PowerShell. You can also [configure backup using REST API](backup-azure-dataprotection-use-rest-api-backup-blobs.md).

[!INCLUDE [blob-vaulted-backup-introduction.md](../../includes/blob-vaulted-backup-introduction.md)]

## Prerequisites

Before you configure blob vaulted backup, ensure that:

- You install the Azure PowerShell version **Az 5.9.0**.
- You review the [support matrix](../backup/blob-backup-support-matrix.md) to learn about the Azure Blob region availability, supported scenarios, and limitations.
- You have a Backup vault to configure Azure Blob backup. If you haven't created the Backup vault, [create one](../backup/backup-blobs-storage-account-ps.md#create-a-backup-vault).

## Create a backup policy

[!INCLUDE [blob-vaulted-backup-create-policy-ps.md](../../includes/blob-vaulted-backup-create-policy-ps.md)]


## Configure backup

[!INCLUDE [blob-vaulted-backup-configure-policy-ps.md](../../includes/blob-vaulted-backup-configure-policy-ps.md)]

## Prepare the request to configure blob backup

[!INCLUDE [blob-vaulted-backup-prepare-request-ps.md](../../includes/blob-vaulted-backup-prepare-request-ps.md)]

## Next step

[Restore Azure blobs using Azure PowerShell](/azure/backup/restore-blobs-storage-account-ps).
