# Data Model for Legacy diagnostic events

This article describes the Log Analytics data model for Azure Backup that's added to the Azure Diagnostics table (if your vaults are configured with diagnostics settings to send data to a Log Analytics workspace in Azure Diagnostics mode). You can use this data model to write queries on Log Analytics data to create custom alerts or reporting dashboards.

>[!Note]
>We recommend you to [use the new resource-specific mode](backup-azure-diagnostic-events.md#steps-to-move-to-new-diagnostics-settings-for-a-log-analytics-workspace) to query data in Log Analytics or [use system functions](backup-reports-system-functions.md).

In this article, you'll learn about:

## V1 schema vs V2 schema

Earlier, diagnostics data for Azure Backup Agent and Azure VM backup was sent to Azure Diagnostics table in a schema referred to as ***V1 schema***. Subsequently, new columns were added to support other scenarios and workloads, and diagnostics data was pushed in a new schema referred to as ***V2 schema***.  

For the backward-compatibility reasons, diagnostics data for Azure Backup agent and Azure VM backup is currently sent to Azure Diagnostics table in both V1 and V2 schema (with V1 schema now on a deprecation path). You can identify which records in Log Analytics are of V1 schema by filtering records for SchemaVersion_s=="V1" in your log queries.

See the third column 'Description' in the [data model](#use-the-azure-backup-data-model) described above to identify which columns belong to V1 schema only.

### Modify the queries to use the V2 schema

As the V1 schema is on a deprecation path, we recommend you to use only the V2 schema in all your custom queries on Azure Backup diagnostic data.

To update your queries to remove dependency on V1 schema, follow these steps:

1. Identify if your query is using any field that's only applicable to the V1 schema. Assume you have a query to list all the backup items and their associated protected servers as follows:

    ````Kusto
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where Category=="AzureBackupReport"
    | where OperationName=="BackupItemAssociation"
    | distinct BackupItemUniqueId_s, ProtectedServerUniqueId_s
    ````

    The above query uses the field ProtectedServerUniqueId_s, which is only applicable to V1 schema. The V2 schema equivalent of this field is ProtectedContainerUniqueId_s (refer tables above). The field BackupItemUniqueId_s is applicable even to V2 schema and the same field can be used in this query.

2. Update the query to use the V2 schema field names. It's a recommended practice to use the filter **where SchemaVersion_s=="V2"** in all your queries, so that only records corresponding to V2 schema are parsed by the query:

    ````Kusto
    AzureDiagnostics
    | where Category=="AzureBackupReport"
    | where OperationName=="BackupItemAssociation"
    | where SchemaVersion_s=="V2"
    | distinct BackupItemUniqueId_s, ProtectedContainerUniqueId_s
    ````

## Next step

After the data model review is complete, start [creating custom queries](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/tutorial-logs-dashboards) in Azure Monitor logs to build your own dashboard.
