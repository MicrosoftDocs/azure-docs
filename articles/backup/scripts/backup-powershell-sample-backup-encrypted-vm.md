# Back up an encrypted Azure virtual machine with PowerShell

This script creates a Recovery Services vault with geo-redundant storage (GRS) for an encrypted Azure VM. It applies the default protection policy, enabling daily backups retained for 365 days. Also, it triggers an initial recovery point, stored for 30 days.
