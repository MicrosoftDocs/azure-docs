# Restore Azure Files

This article describes how to use the Azure portal to restore an entire File Share or specific files from a restore point created by [Azure Backup](./backup-overview.md).

Azure Backup offers a simple, reliable, and secure way to protect your enterprise File Shares using [snapshot](azure-file-share-backup-overview.md?tabs=snapshot) and [vaulted](azure-file-share-backup-overview.md?tabs=vault-standard) backups, ensuring data recovery for accidental or malicious deletion.

## Restore the Azure Files

This section describes how to restore:

- A full Azure files
- Individual files or folders

>[!Note]
>Vaulted backup currently supports only full share recovery to an alternate location. The target File Share selected for restore needs to be empty.

**Choose a restore option**:

# [Full share recovery](#tab/full-share-recovery)

You can use this restore option to restore the complete File Share in the original location or an alternate location.

To restore the complete File Share, follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to **Business Continuity Center** > **Protection inventory** > **Protected items**, and then select **Recover**.
1. On the **Recover** pane, select the **Azure Files (Azure Storage)** as the **Datasource type**, and then click **Select** under **Protected item**.

   The **Select restore point** context pane opens that lists the restore points available for the selected File Share. 

1. On the **Select restore point** pane, select the restore point you want to use to perform the restore operation, and then click **Select**.


    >[!NOTE]
    >By default, the **Select restore point** pane lists restore points from the last 30 days. If you want to check the restore points created during a specific duration, specify the range by selecting the appropriate **Start Time** and **End Time** and select **Refresh**.

1. The next step is to choose the **Restore Location**. In the **Recovery Destination** section, specify where or how to restore the data. Select one of the following two options by using the toggle button:

    * **Original Location**: Restore the complete File Share to the same location as the original source.
    * **Alternate Location**: Restore the complete File Share to an alternate location and keep the original File Share as is.

### Restore Azure files to the original location (full share recovery)

To restore Azure files in the original location, follow these steps:

1. Select **Original Location** as the **Recovery Destination**, and select whether to skip or overwrite if there are conflicts, by choosing the appropriate option from the **In case of Conflicts** drop-down list.

1. Select **Restore** to start the restore operation.

>[!Note]
>To restore data to the original location, choose a recovery point with the recovery tier **Snapshot** or **Snapshot and Vault-tier**. If the snapshot corresponding to the selected recovery point is not found, the restore fails. 

### Restore to an alternate location (full share recovery)

1. Select **Alternate Location** as the **Recovery Destination**.
1. Select the destination storage account where you want to restore the backed-up content from the **Storage Account** drop-down list.

## Track a restore operation

After you trigger the restore operation, the backup service creates a job for tracking. Azure Backup displays notifications about the job in the portal. To view operations for the job, select the notifications hyperlink.

You can also monitor restore progress from the Recovery Services vault:

1. Go to **Business Continuity Center** and select **Monitoring + Reporting** > **Jobs** from the menu.
1. On the **Jobs** pane, filter the jobs for the required solution and datasource type.
