# Troubleshoot problems while backing up Azure file shares

This article provides troubleshooting information to address any issues you come across while configuring backup or restoring Azure file shares using the Azure Backup Service.

## Common configuration issues

### Could not find my storage account to configure backup for the Azure file share

- Wait until discovery is complete.
- Check if any file share under the storage account is already protected with another Recovery Services vault.

  >[!NOTE]
  >All file shares in a Storage Account can be protected only under one Recovery Services vault. You can use [this script](scripts/backup-powershell-script-find-recovery-services-vault.md) to find the Recovery Services vault where your storage account is registered.

- Ensure that the file share isn't present in any of the unsupported Storage Accounts. You can refer to the [Support matrix for Azure file share backup](azure-file-share-support-matrix.md) to find supported Storage Accounts.
- Ensure that the storage account and recovery services vault are present in the same region.
- Ensure that the combined length of the storage account name and the resource group name don't exceed 84 characters in the case of new Storage accounts and 77 characters in the case of classic storage accounts.
- Check the firewall settings of storage account to ensure that the exception "_Allow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage account_" is granted. You can refer [this](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md?tabs=azure-portal#manage-exceptions) link for the steps to grant exception.


### Error in portal states discovery of storage accounts failed

If you have a partner subscription (CSP-enabled), ignore the error. If your subscription isn't CSP-enabled, and your storage accounts can't be discovered, contact support.

### Selected storage account validation or registration failed

Retry the registration. If the problem persists, contact support.

### Could not list or find file shares in the selected storage account

- Ensure that the Storage Account exists in the Resource Group and hasn't been deleted or moved after the last validation or registration in the vault.
- Ensure that the file share you're looking to protect hasn't been deleted.
- Ensure that the Storage Account is a supported storage account for file share backup. You can refer to the [Support matrix for Azure file share backup](azure-file-share-support-matrix.md) to find supported Storage Accounts.
- Check if the file share is already protected in the same Recovery Services vault.
- Check the Network Routing setting of storage account to ensure that routing preference is set as Microsoft network routing.

### Backup file share configuration (or the protection policy configuration) is failing

- Retry the configuration to see if the issue persists.
- Ensure that the file share you want to protect hasn't been deleted.
- If you're trying to protect multiple file shares at once, and some of the file shares are failing, try configuring backup for the failed file shares again.

### Unable to delete the Recovery Services vault after unprotecting a file share

In the Azure portal, open your **Vault** > **Backup Infrastructure** > **Storage accounts**. Select **Unregister** to remove the storage accounts from the Recovery Services vault.

>[!NOTE]
>A Recovery Services vault can only be deleted after unregistering all storage accounts registered with the vault.

## Common backup or restore errors

>[!NOTE]
>Refer to [this document](./backup-rbac-rs-vault.md#minimum-role-requirements-for-the-azure-file-share-backup) to ensure you have sufficient permissions for performing backup or restore operations.

### FileShareNotFound- Operation failed as the file share is not found

## Common Soft Delete Related Errors

### UserErrorRestoreAFSInSoftDeleteState- This restore point is not available as the snapshot associated with this point is in a File Share that is in soft-deleted state

Error Code: UserErrorRestoreAFSInSoftDeleteState

Error Message: This restore point is not available as the snapshot associated with this point is in a File Share that is in soft-deleted state.

You can't perform a restore operation when the file share is in soft deleted state. Undelete the file share from Files portal  or using the [Undelete script](scripts/backup-powershell-script-undelete-file-share.md) and then try to restore.

### UserErrorRestoreAFSInDeleteState- Listed restore points are not available as the associated file share containing the restore point snapshots has been deleted permanently

Error Code: UserErrorRestoreAFSInDeleteState

Error Message: Listed restore points are not available as the associated file share containing the restore point snapshots has been deleted permanently.

Check if the backed-up file share is deleted. If it was in soft deleted state, check if the soft delete retention period is over and it wasn't recovered back. In either of these cases, you'll lose all your snapshots permanently and wonâ€™t be able to recover the data.

>[!NOTE]
> We recommend you don't delete the backed-up file share, or if it's in soft deleted state, undelete before the soft delete retention period ends, to avoid losing all your restore points.

### UserErrorBackupAFSInSoftDeleteState - Backup failed as the Azure File Share is in soft-deleted state

Error Code: UserErrorBackupAFSInSoftDeleteState

Error Message: Backup failed as the Azure File Share is in soft-deleted state

Undelete the file share from the **Files portal** or by using the [Undelete script](scripts/backup-powershell-script-undelete-file-share.md) to continue the backup and prevent permanent deletion of data.

### UserErrorBackupAFSInDeleteState- Backup failed as the associated Azure File Share is permanently deleted

Error Code: UserErrorBackupAFSInDeleteState

Error Message: Backup failed as the associated Azure File Share is permanently deleted

Check if the backed-up file share is permanently deleted. If yes, stop the backup for the file share to avoid repeated backup failures. To learn how to stop protection see [Stop Protection for Azure file share](./manage-afs-backup.md#stop-protection-on-a-file-share)
