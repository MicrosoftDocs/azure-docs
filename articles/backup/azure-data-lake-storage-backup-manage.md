# Manage vaulted backup for Azure Data Lake Storage using Azure portal (preview)

This article describes how to manage vaulted backup for Azure Data Lake Storage (preview) using Azure portal.

## Monitor an Azure Data Lake Storage backup job (preview)

The Azure Backup service creates a job for a scheduled backup or when you trigger an on-demand backup operation, allowing you to monitor the job progress.

To check the backup job status, follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](), go to the **Backup vault** > **Backup jobs**.

1. On the **Backup jobs** pane, select the required time range and apply filters to narrow down the list of jobs.

   The **Backup jobs** dashboard shows the operation and status for the past seven days.

## Modify the Azure Data Lake Storage backup instance (preview)

After the backup configuration, you can update the policy associated with a backup instance. For vaulted backups, you can also modify the selected backup containers.

To modify the backup instance, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Backup vault**.
1. On the **Backup Items** tile, select **Azure Data Lake Storage (Preview)** as the **Datasource type**.
1. On the **Backup instance** pane, select the backup instance for which you want to change the Backup policy, and then select **Edit backup instance**.

1. On the **Edit backup instance** pane, under **Select policy**, select the appropriate policy from the dropdown list to apply it to the storage account blobs.

1. Select **Save**.

## Stop protection for Azure Data Lake Storage (preview)

You can stop the vaulted backup for the storage account as per your requirements.

>[!Caution]
>When you remove backups, the object replication policy is removed from the source. The stop protection operation dissociates the storage account from the Backup vault and doesnâ€™t disable any configured change feed.

To stop backup for a storage account, follow these steps: 

1. Go to the **Backup vault**.
1. On the **Backup Items** tile, select **Azure Data Lake Storage (Preview)** as the **Datasource type**. 
1. On the **Backup instance** pane, select the backup instance for which you want to stop backup from the list.
1. On the selected backup instance pane, select **Stop Backup**.

>[!Note]
>After the backup is stopped, you can disable other storage data protection capabilities (enabled for configuring backups) from the **data protection** pane of the storage account.
