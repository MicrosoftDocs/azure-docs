# Manage SQL server databases in Azure VMs with REST API

This article explains how to manage and monitor the SQL server databases that are backed-up by [Azure Backup](backup-overview.md).

>[!Note]
>See the [SQL backup support matrix](sql-support-matrix.md) to know about the supported configurations and scenarios.

## Monitor jobs

The Azure Backup service triggers jobs that run in the background. This includes scenarios, such as triggering backup, restore operations, and disabling backup. You can track these jobs using their IDs. Learn more about [managing backup and restore jobs](backup-azure-arm-userestapi-managejobs.md).

### Fetch job information from operations

An operation, such as triggering backup, returns a *jobID* in response.

For example, the final response of a [trigger backup REST API](backup-azure-sql-vm-rest-api.md#trigger-an-on-demand-backup-for-the-database) operation is as follows:

```json
{
  "id": "cd2a3b13-d392-4e81-86ac-02ea91cc70b9",
  "name": "cd2a3b13-d392-4e81-86ac-02ea91cc70b9",
  "status": "Succeeded",
  "startTime": "2018-05-28T11:43:21.6516182Z",
  "endTime": "2018-05-28T11:43:21.6516182Z",
  "properties": {
    "objectType": "OperationStatusJobExtendedInfo",
    "jobId": "c22eca5d-0c1c-48a0-a40d-69bef708d92a"
  }
}
```

You can identify the Backup job is identified by the **jobId** field and track as [mentioned here](/rest/api/backup/job-details) using a GET request.

### Track the job

```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/{vaultName}/backupJobs/{jobName}?api-version=2016-12-01
```

The `{jobName}` is the *jobId* mentioned above. The response is 200 (OK) with the **status** field indicating the status of the job. Once it's *Completed* or *CompletedWithWarnings*, the **extendedInfo** section shows more job details.

```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000/resourceGroups/SQLServerSelfHost/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/SQLServer2012/backupJobs/c22eca5d-0c1c-48a0-a40d-69bef708d92a?api-version=2016-12-01
```

#### Response

Name  | Type  |  Description
--- | --- | ----
200 OK |  JobResource  | OK

#### Response example

Once the *GET* URI is submitted, a 200 response is returned.

  }
} 
}
```

## Modify policy

To change the policy that protects the database, use the same format as enabling protection. However, provide the new policy ID in the request body and submit the request. For example, to change the policy of *testVM* from *HourlyLogPolicy* to *ProdPolicy*, provide the *ProdPolicy* ID in the request body.

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "backupManagementType": "AzureWorkload",
    "workloadType": "SQLDataBase",
    "policyId": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000/resourceGroups/SQLServerSelfHost/providers/microsoft.recoveryservices/vaults/SQLServer2012/backupPolicies/ProdPolicy"
  },
  "location": "westcentralus"
}
```

The response will follow the same format as mentioned for enabling protection.

## Stop protection and retain existing data

To remove protection from a protected database and retain the data already backed-up, remove the policy in the request body you used to enable backup and submit the request. Once you remove the association with the policy, backups are no longer triggered, and no new recovery points are created.

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "protectedItemType": "AzureVmWorkloadSQLDatabase",
    "protectionState": "ProtectionStopped",
    "sourceResourceId":
"/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000/resourceGroups/SQLServerPMDemo/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/sqlserver-0",
    "policyId": ""
  }
}
```

### Sample response

Stopping protection for a database is an asynchronous operation. The operation creates another operation that needs to be tracked. It returns two responses: 202 (Accepted) when another operation is created, and 200 when that operation is complete.

Response header when operation is successfully accepted:

```http

Body:
{
  "id": "aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb",
  "name": "TestOBJ",
  "status": "Succeeded",
  "startTime": "2021-11-26T05:36:36.5262731Z",

    "jobId": "68178d86-d564-460b-9643-829046aac1b1"
  }
}
```

Then, track the resulting operation using the location header or Azure-AsyncOperation header with a *GET* command:

```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/{vaultName}/backupoperations/0000aaaa-11bb-cccc-dd22-eeeeee333333?api-version=2016-12-01
```

### Response body

```json
{
  "id": "aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb",
  "name": "TestOBJ",
  "status": "Succeeded",
  "startTime": "2021-11-26T05:36:36.5262731Z",
  "endTime": "2021-11-26T05:36:36.5262731Z",
  "properties": {
    "objectType": "OperationStatusJobExtendedInfo",
    "jobId": "68178d86-d564-460b-9643-829046aac1b1"
  }
}
```

## Stop protection and delete backup data

To remove the protection from a protected file share and delete the backup data as well, perform a delete operation.

```http
DELETE https://management.azure.com/Subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/{vaultName}/backupFabrics/{fabricName}/protectionContainers/{containerName}/protectedItems/{protectedItemName}?api-version=2019-05-13
```

The parameters *containerName* and *protectedItemName* are as set in the configure backup step in [this article](backup-azure-sql-vm-rest-api.md).

### Responses

Delete protection is an asynchronous operation. The operation creates another operation that needs to be tracked separately. It returns two responses: 202 (Accepted) when another operation is created, and 204 (NoContent) when that operation is complete.
