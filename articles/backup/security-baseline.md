# Azure security baseline for Azure Backup

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Azure Backup. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Backup. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Backup have been excluded.

 
To see how Azure Backup completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Backup security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: The endpoints used by Azure Backup (including the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services agent) are all managed by Microsoft. You are responsible for any additional controls you wish to deploy to your on-premises systems.

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

**Guidance**: If you are using the MARS agent on an Azure Virtual Machine, associate that VM with a network security group use the description to specify the business need for the rule

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 1.11: Use automated tools to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes

**Guidance**: If you are using the MARS agent on an Azure Virtual Machine that is being protected by an network security group or Azure Firewall, use Azure Activity Log to monitor configuration of the NSG or Firewall. You may create alerts within Azure Monitor that will trigger when changes to these resources take place.

## Logging and Monitoring

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Monitoring](../security/benchmarks/security-control-logging-monitoring.md).*

### 2.2: Configure central security log management

**Guidance**: For control plane audit logging, enable Azure Activity Log diagnostic settings and send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace, Azure event hub, or Azure storage account for archive. Using Azure Activity Log data, you can determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed at the control plane level for your Azure resources.

Also, ingest logs via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by Azure Backup. In Azure Monitor, use Log Analytics workspaces to query and perform analytics, and use storage accounts for long-term/archival storage. Alternatively, you can on-board data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM).

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 2.3: Enable audit logging for Azure resources

**Guidance**: For control plane audit logging, enable Azure Activity Log diagnostic settings and send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace, Azure event hub, or Azure storage account for archive. Using Azure Activity Log data, you can determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed at the control plane level for your Azure resources.

Additionally, Azure Backup sends diagnostics events that can be collected and used for the purposes of analysis, alerting and reporting. You can configure diagnostics settings for a Recovery Services vault via the Azure portal. You can  send one or more diagnostics events to a Storage Account, Event Hub, or a Log Analytics workspace.

### 2.7: Enable alerts for anomalous activities

**Guidance**: Azure Backup provides built-in monitoring and alerting capabilities in a Recovery Services vault. These capabilities are available without any additional management infrastructure. You can also increase the scale of your monitoring and reporting by using Azure Monitor.

Alerts are primarily scenarios where users are notified so that they can take relevant action. The Backup Alerts section shows alerts generated by Azure Backup service. These alerts are defined by the service and you cannot custom create any alerts.

You can also onboard a Log Analytics workspace to Azure Sentinel as it provides a security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. This allows for playbooks (automated solutions) to be created and used to remediate security issues. Additionally, you can create custom log alerts in your Log Analytics workspace using Azure Monitor.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.2: Change default passwords where applicable

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) does not have the concept of default passwords. Other Azure resources requiring a password forces a password to be created with complexity requirements and a minimum password length, which differs depending on the service. You are responsible for third-party applications and marketplace services that may use default passwords.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

Additionally, to help you keep track of dedicated administrative accounts, you may use recommendations from Azure Security Center or built-in Azure Policies, such as:

- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription

- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

Additional information is available at the referenced links.

## Data Protection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data Protection](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-protection.md).*

### 4.1: Maintain an inventory of sensitive Information

**Guidance**: Use tags to assist in tracking Azure resources that store or process sensitive information.

- [How to create and use tags](../azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources.md)

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 4.2: Isolate systems storing or processing sensitive information

**Guidance**: When backing up Azure Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) Virtual Machines, Azure Backup provides independent and isolated backups to guard against accidental destruction of original data. Backups are stored in a Recovery Services vault with built-in management of recovery points.

Implement separate subscriptions and optionally management groups for development, test, and production Recovery Services Vaults. Resources should be separated by virtual networks or subnets, tagged appropriately, and secured by an network security groups or Azure Firewall. Resources storing or processing sensitive data should be sufficiently isolated. For Virtual Machines storing or processing sensitive data, implement policy and procedure(s) to turn them off when not in use.

**Responsibility**: Customer

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: None

### 4.8: Encrypt sensitive information at rest

**Guidance**: Azure Backup supports encryption for at-rest data. For on-premises backup, encryption-at-rest is provided using the passphrase you provide when backing up to Azure. For cloud workloads, data is encrypted-at-rest using Storage Service Encryption (SSE). Microsoft does not decrypt the backup data at any point.

When backing up with the MARS agent or using a Recovery Services vault encrypted with a customer-managed key, only you have access to the encryption key. Microsoft never maintains a copy and doesn't have access to the key. If the key is misplaced, Microsoft can't recover the backup data.

## Data Recovery

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data Recovery](../security/benchmarks/security-control-data-recovery.md).*

### 9.2: Perform complete system backups and backup any customer-managed keys

**Guidance**: Locally redundant storage (LRS) replicates your data three times (it creates three copies of your data) in a storage scale unit in a datacenter. All copies of the data exist within the same region. LRS is a low-cost option for protecting your data from local hardware failures. Geo-redundant storage (GRS) is the default and recommended replication option. GRS replicates your data to a secondary region, hundreds of kilometers away from the primary location of the source data. GRS costs more than LRS, but GRS provides a higher level of durability for your data even if there's a regional outage.

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources.

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that the customer's data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party.  Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.

### 10.5: Incorporate security alerts into your incident response system

**Guidance**: Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the Continuous Export feature. Continuous Export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. You may use the Azure Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel.
