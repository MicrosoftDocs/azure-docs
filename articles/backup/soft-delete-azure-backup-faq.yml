    questions:
      - question: |
          Do I need to enable the soft delete feature on every vault?
        answer: |
          No, it's a built-in feature and enabled by default for all the Recovery Services vaults.

      - question: |
          Can I configure the number of days for which my data will be retained in soft-deleted state after the delete operation is complete?
        answer: |
          No, it's fixed to 14 days of additional retention after the delete operation.

      - question: |
          Do I need to pay the cost for this additional 14-day retention?
        answer: |
          No, this 14-day additional retention comes free of cost as a part of soft-delete functionality.

      - question: |
          Can I perform a restore operation when my data is in soft delete state?
        answer: |
          No, you need to undelete the soft deleted resource in order to restore. The undelete operation will bring the resource back into the **Stop protection with retain data state** where you can restore to any point in time. Garbage collector remains paused in this state.

      - question: |
          Will my snapshots follow the same lifecycle as my recovery points in the vault?
        answer: |
          Yes.

      - question: |
          How can I trigger the scheduled backups again for a soft-deleted resource?
        answer: |
          Undelete followed by a resume operation will protect the resource again. The resume operation associates a backup policy to trigger the scheduled backups with the selected retention period. Also, the garbage collector runs as soon as the resume operation completes. If you wish to perform a restore from a recovery point that's past its expiration date, you're advised to do it before triggering the resume operation.

      - question: |
          Can I delete my vault if there are soft-deleted items in the vault?
        answer: |
          The Recovery Services vault can't be deleted if there are backup items in soft-deleted state in the vault. The soft-deleted items are permanently deleted 14 days after the delete operation. If you can't wait for 14 days, then [disable soft delete](backup-azure-security-feature-cloud.md#enable-and-disable-soft-delete), undelete the soft deleted items, and delete them again to permanently get deleted. After ensuring there are no protected items and no soft deleted items, the vault can be deleted.  

      - question: |
          Can I delete the data earlier than the 14 days soft-delete period after deletion?
        answer: |
          No. You can't force-delete the soft-deleted items. They're automatically deleted after 14 days. This security feature is enabled to safeguard the backed-up data from accidental or malicious deletes.  You should wait for 14 days before performing any other action on the item.  Soft-deleted items won't be charged.  If you need to reprotect the items marked for soft-delete within 14 days in a new vault, then contact Microsoft support.

      - question: |
          Can soft delete operations be performed in PowerShell or CLI?
        answer: |
          Soft delete operations can be performed using PowerShell. Currently, CLI isn't supported.
