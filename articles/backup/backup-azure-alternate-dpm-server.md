# Recover data from Azure Backup Server

This article describes how to recover data from Azure Backup Server.

[!INCLUDE [The functionality of Azure Backup trim process.](../../includes/backup-trim-process-notification.md)]


You can use Azure Backup Server to recover the data you've backed-up to a Recovery Services vault. The process for doing so is integrated into the Azure Backup Server management console, and is similar to the recovery workflow for other Azure Backup components.

> [!NOTE]
> This article is applicable for [System Center Data Protection Manager 2012 R2 with UR7 or later](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3065246), combined with the [latest Azure Backup agent](https://aka.ms/azurebackup_agent).

## Recover the data

To recover data from an Azure Backup Server, follow these steps:

1. On the **Recovery** tab of the Azure Backup Server management console, select **'Add External DPM'** (at the top left of the screen).

2. Download new **vault credentials** from the vault associated with the **Azure Backup Server** where the data is being recovered, choose the Azure Backup Server from the list of Azure Backup Servers registered with the Recovery Services vault, and provide the **encryption passphrase** associated with the server whose data is being recovered.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Only Azure Backup Servers associated with the same registration vault can recover each otherâ€™s data.


    Once the External Azure Backup Server is successfully added, you can browse the data of the external server and the local Azure Backup Server from the **Recovery** tab.
3. Browse the available list of production servers protected by the external Azure Backup Server and select the appropriate data source.

4. Select **the month and year** from the **Recovery points** drop down, select the required **Recovery date** for when the recovery point was created, and select the **Recovery time**.

    A list of files and folders appears in the bottom pane, which can be browsed and recovered to any location.

5. Right-click the appropriate item and select **Recover**.

6. Review the **Recover Selection**. Verify the data and time of the backup copy being recovered, as well as the source from which the backup copy was created. If the selection is incorrect, select **Cancel** to navigate back to recovery tab to select appropriate recovery point. If the selection is correct, select **Next**.

7. Select **Recover to an alternate location**. **Browse** to the correct location for the recovery.

8. Choose the option related to **create copy**, **Skip**, or **Overwrite**.

   * **Create copy** - creates a copy of the file if there's a name collision.
   * **Skip** - if there's a name collision, it doesn't recover the file, which leaves the original file.
   * **Overwrite** - if there's a name collision, it overwrites the existing copy of the file.

     Choose the appropriate option to **Restore security**. You can apply the security settings of the destination computer where the data is being recovered or the security settings that were applicable to product at the time the recovery point was created.

     Identify whether a **Notification** is sent, once the recovery successfully completes.

9. The **Summary** screen lists the options chosen so far. Once you select **Recover**, the data is recovered to the appropriate on-premises location.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The recovery job can be monitored in the **Monitoring** tab of the Azure Backup Server.
