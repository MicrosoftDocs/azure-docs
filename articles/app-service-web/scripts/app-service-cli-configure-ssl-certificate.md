# Bind a custom SSL certificate to a web app

This sample script creates a web app in App Service with its related resources, then binds the SSL certificate of a custom domain name to it. For this sample, you will need:

* Access to your domain registrar's DNS configuration page.
* A valid .PFX file and its password for the SSL certificate you want to upload and bind.
