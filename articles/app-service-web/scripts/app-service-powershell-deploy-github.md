# Create a web app and deploy code from GitHub

This sample script creates a web app in App Service with its related resources, and then deploys your web app code from a public GitHub repository (without continuous deployment). For GitHub deployment with continuous deployment, see [Create a web app with continuous deployment from GitHub](app-service-powershell-continuous-deployment-github.md).

If needed, install the Azure PowerShell using the instruction found in the [Azure PowerShell guide](/powershell/azure/overview). Also, you need a link to GitHub repository that contains the web app code.

## Sample script

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/app-service/deploy-github/deploy-github.ps1?highlight=1-2 "Create a web app and deploy code from GitHub")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group, web app, and all related resources.

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Force
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [New-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermresourcegroup) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [New-AzureRmAppServicePlan](/powershell/module/azurerm.websites/new-azurermappserviceplan) | Creates an App Service plan. |
| [New-AzureRmWebApp](/powershell/module/azurerm.websites/new-azurermwebapp) | Creates a web app. |
| [Set-AzureRmResource](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/set-azurermresource) | Modifies a resource in a resource group. |

## Next steps
