# Scale a web app manually

In this scenario you will learn to create a resource group, app service plan and web app. You will then scale the App Service Plan from a single instance to multiple instances.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/scale-manual/scale-manual.sh "Manual Scale")]

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, web app, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az appservice plan create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/appservice/plan#create) | Creates an App Service plan. This is like a server farm for your Azure web app. |
| [az webapp create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/webapp#create) | Creates an Azure web app. |
| [az appservice plan update](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/appservice/plan#update) | Updates properties of the App Service plan. |

## Next steps
