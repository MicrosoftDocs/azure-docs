# Map a custom domain to a web app

This sample script creates a web app in App Service with its related resources, and then maps `www.<yourdomain>` to it.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]
