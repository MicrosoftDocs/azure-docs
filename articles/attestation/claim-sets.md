# Claim sets

Claims generated in the process of attesting enclaves using Microsoft Azure Attestation can be divided into the below categories:

- **Incoming claims**: The claims generated by Microsoft Azure Attestation after parsing the attestation evidence and can be used by policy authors to define authorization rules in a custom policy

- **Outgoing claims**: The claims generated by Azure Attestation and contains all claims that end up in the attestation token

- **Property claims**: The claims created as an output by Azure Attestation. It contains all the claims that represent properties of the attestation token, such as encoding of the report, validity duration of the report, and so on.

## Common claims across all attestation types

### Incoming claims 

Below claims are generated by Azure Attestation and can be used by policy authors to define authorization rules in a custom policy for all attestation types.

- **x-ms-ver**: JWT schema version (expected to be "1.0")
- **x-ms-attestation-type**: String value representing attestation type 
- **x-ms-policy-hash**: Hash of Azure Attestation evaluation policy computed as BASE64URL(SHA256(UTF8(BASE64URL(UTF8(policy text)))))
- **x-ms-policy-signer**: JSON object with a "jwk” member representing the key a customer used to sign their policy. This is applicable when customer uploads a signed policy

Below claims are considered deprecated but are fully supported. It is recommended to use the non-deprecated claim names.

Deprecated claim | Recommended claim 
--- | --- 
ver | x-ms-ver
tee | x-ms-attestation-type
maa-policyHash | x-ms-policy-hash
policy_hash | x-ms-policy-hash
policy_signer | x-ms-policy-signer

### Outgoing claims

Azure Attestation includes the below claims in the attestation token for all attestation types. 

- **x-ms-ver**: JWT schema version (expected to be "1.0")
- **x-ms-attestation-type**: String value representing attestation type 
- **x-ms-policy-hash**: String value containing SHA256 hash of the policy text computed by BASE64URL(SHA256(UTF8(BASE64URL(UTF8(policy text)))))
- **x-ms-policy-signer**: Contains a JWK with the public key or the certificate chain present in the signed policy header. x-ms-policy-signer is only added if the policy is signed

Below claim names are leverged from [IETF JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)

- **"jti" (JWT ID) Claim** - Unique identifier for the JWT
- **"iss" (Issuer) Claim** - The principal that issued the JWT 
- **"iat" (Issued At) Claim** - The time at which the JWT was issued at 
- **"exp" (Expiration Time) Claim** - Expiration time after which the JWT must not be accepted for processing
- **"nbf" (Not Before) Claim** - Not Before time before which the JWT must not be accepted for processing 

Below claim names are leverged from [IETF EAT draft specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rats-eat-03#page-9)

- **"Nonce claim" (nonce)** - An untransformed direct copy of an optional nonce value provided by a client 


## Claims specific to SGX attestation

### Incoming claims 

Below claims are generated by Azure Attestation and can be used by policy authors to define authorization rules in a custom policy for SGX attestation.

- **x-ms-sgx-is-debuggable**: A Boolean, which indicates whether or not the enclave has debugging enabled or not
- **x-ms-sgx-product-id**: Product id value of the SGX enclave 
- **x-ms-sgx-mrsigner**: hex encoded value of the “mrsigner” field of the quote
- **x-ms-sgx-mrenclave**: hex encoded value of the “mrenclave” field of the quote
- **x-ms-sgx-svn**: security version number encoded in the quote 

### Outgoing claims 

Below claims are generated and included in the attestation token by the service for SGX attestation.

- **x-ms-sgx-is-debuggable**: A Boolean, which indicates whether or not the enclave has debugging enabled or not
- **x-ms-sgx-product-id**: Product id value of the SGX enclave 
- **x-ms-sgx-mrsigner**: hex encoded value of the “mrsigner” field of the quote
- **x-ms-sgx-mrenclave**: hex encoded value of the “mrenclave” field of the quote
- **x-ms-sgx-svn**: security version number encoded in the quote 
- **x-ms-sgx-ehd**: enclave held data formatted as BASE64URL(enclave held data)
- **x-ms-sgx-collateral**: JSON object describing the collateral used to perform attestation. The value for the x-ms-sgx-collateral claim is a nested JSON object with the following key/value pairs:
    - **qeidcertshash**: SHA256 value of Qupting Enclave (QE) Identity issuing certs
    - **qeidcrlhash**: SHA256 value of QE Identity issuing certs CRL list
    - **qeidhash**: SHA256 value of the QE Identity collateral
    - **quotehash**: SHA256 value of the evaluated quote
    - **tcbinfocertshash**: SHA256 value of the TCB Info issuing certs
    - **tcbinfocrlhash**: SHA256 value of the TCB Info issuing certs CRL list
    - **tcbinfohash**: SHA256 value of the TCB Info collateral

Below claims are considered deprecated but are fully supported and will continue to be included in the future. It is recommended to use the non-deprecated claim names.

Deprecated claim | Recommended claim
--- | --- 
$is-debuggable | x-ms-sgx-is-debuggable
$sgx-mrsigner | x-ms-sgx-mrsigner
$sgx-mrenclave | x-ms-sgx-mrenclave
$product-id | x-ms-sgx-product-id
$svn | x-ms-sgx-svn
$tee | x-ms-attestation-type
maa-ehd | x-ms-sgx-ehd
aas-ehd | x-ms-sgx-ehd

### Outgoing claims specific to TPM and VBS attestation

- **cnf (Confirmation)**: The "cnf" claim is used to identify the proof-of-possession key. Confirmation claim as defined in RFC 7800, contains the public part of the attested enclave key represented as a JSON Web Key (JWK) object (RFC 7517)
- **rp_data (relying party data)**: Relying party data, if any, specified in the request, used by the relying party as a nonce to guarantee freshness of the report. rp_data is only added if there is rp_data

### Property claims

  - **Default value(time)**: One day in minutes.
  - **Maximum value(time)**: One year in minutes.
