# Introducing Azure Security Center for IoT

Unify security management and enable end-to-end threat detection and analysis across hybrid cloud workloads and your Azure IoT solution.

## Secure your entire IoT solution from IoT devices to Azure cloud

Choose from our seamless agentless solution or take advantage of agent-based comprehensive security, Azure Security Center for IoT provides threat prevention and analysis for every device, IoT Edge and IoT Hub, across your IoT assets.

As billions of new devices are connected to the internet, and integrated into our daily lives and our businesses, your security operations teams must ensure their security strategies evolve quickly enough to cover each new attack surface. Like any other system, to comprehensively secure your IoT solution, it requires  protection at every stage of implementation.

Azure Security Center for IoT simplifies hybrid workload protection by delivering unified visibility and control, adaptive threat prevention, and intelligent threat detection and response across workloads running on edge, on-premises, in Azure, and in other clouds.

### Unified visibility and control

Get a unified view of security across all of your on-premises and cloud workloads, including your Azure IoT solution. Onboard new devices, and apply security policies across your workloads (Leaf devices, Microsoft Edge devices, IoT Hub) to ensure compliance with security standards and improved security posture.

### Adaptive threat prevention

Use Azure Security Center for IoT to continuously monitor the security of machines, networks, and Azure services. Choose from hundreds of built-in security assessments or create your own in the central Azure Security Center for IoT Hub dashboard. Optimize your security settings and improve your security score with actionable recommendations across virtual machines, networks, apps, and data. With newly added IoT capabilities, you can now reduce the attack surface for your Azure IoT solution and remediate issues before they can be exploited.

### Intelligent threat detection and response

Use advanced analytics and the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph to get an edge over evolving cyber-attacks. Built-in behavioral analytics and machine learning identify attacks and zero-day exploits. Monitor your IoT solution for incoming attacks and post-breach activity. Streamline device investigation and remediation with interactive tools and contextual threat intelligence.
