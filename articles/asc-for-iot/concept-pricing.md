# Pricing and associated costs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Security Center for IoT is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

This article explains Azure Security Center (ASC) for IoT pricing model, summarizes all associated costs and explains how to manage them.

## Pricing

The ASC for IoT pricing model is comprised of two parts, and is billed once an IoT Hub is [enabled](quickstart-onboard-iot-hub.md) in ASC for IoT:

- Cost by device - built-in security capabilities based on analysis of IoT Hub logs.

- Cost by message - enhanced security capabilities based on security messages from IoT Edge or leaf devices.

  >[!Note]
  > Security messages will also incur quota consumption on IoT Hub.

For more information, see [Security Center pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/security-center/).

## Associated costs

ASC for IoT has two types of associated costs, which are not part of the direct pricing:

- IoT Hub quota consumption

- Log Analytics storage costs

You can reduce associated costs by opting out of certain features, by changing your settings.

To change your settings:

1. Open IoT Hub.

2. Under **Security**, click **Overview**.

3. Click **Settings**.

The following table provides a summary of associated costs and implications of each option.

|     | Usage | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **IoT Hub quota consumption** |  |
| [Export device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-bulk-identity-mgmt#export-devices) job (twin export) | Once a day | Disable _twin metadata collection_ |
| **Log Analytics storage** |  |
| Device recommendation and alerts| Security recommendation and alerts generated by the service | Not optional |
| Raw security data| Raw security data from IoT devices, collected by security agents | Disable _store raw device security events_ |

>[!Important]
> Opting out has severe implications to available security features.
  
| Opt out | Implications |
| --- | --- |
| _Twin metadata collection_ | Disable [custom alerts](quickstart-create-custom-alerts.md) |
| | Disable IoT Edge manifest recommendations |
| | Disable device identity-based recommendations and alerts |
| _Store raw device security events_ | Details on device OS baseline recommendations are not available |
| | Details on [alert](concept-security-alerts.md) and [recommendation](concept-recommendations.md) investigations are not available |
