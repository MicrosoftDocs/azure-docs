# Azure Security Center for IoT security alerts

Azure Security Center for IoT continuously analyzes your IoT solution using advanced analytics and threat intelligence to alert you to malicious activity.
In addition, you can create custom alerts based on your knowledge of expected device behavior.
An alert acts as an indicator of potential compromise, and should be investigated and remediated.

In this article, you will find a list of built-in alerts which can be triggered on your IoT Hub and/or IoT devices.
In addition to built-in alerts, Azure Security Center for IoT allows you to define custom alerts based on expected IoT Hub and/or device behavior.
For more details, see [customizable alerts](concept-customizable-security-alerts.md).

## Built-in alerts for IoT devices
