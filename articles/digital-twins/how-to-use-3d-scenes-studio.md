# Build 3D scenes with 3D Scenes Studio (preview) for Azure Digital Twins

Azure Digital Twins [3D Scenes Studio (preview)](https://explorer.digitaltwins.azure.net/3dscenes) is an immersive 3D environment, where business and frontline workers can consume and investigate operational data from their Azure Digital Twins solutions with visual context.

## Prerequisites

To use 3D Scenes Studio, you need the following resources.

* An Azure Digital Twins instance. For instructions, see [Set up an instance and authentication](how-to-set-up-instance-cli.md).
    * Obtain *Azure Digital Twins Data Owner* or *Azure Digital Twins Data Reader* access to the instance. For instructions, see [Set up user access permissions](how-to-set-up-instance-cli.md#set-up-user-access-permissions).
    * Take note of the *host name* of your instance for later use.
* An Azure storage account. For instructions, see [Create a storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=azure-portal).
    * Take note of the *URL* of your storage account for later use.
* A private container in the storage account. For instructions, see [Create a container](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal.md#create-a-container).
    * Take note of the *name* of your storage container for later use.
* Permissions for your storage resources, including:
    * At least *Reader* control plane access
    * A data access role of *Storage Blob Data Owner* or *Storage Blob Data Contributor*

    You can grant required roles at either the storage account level or the container level. For instructions and more information about permissions to Azure storage, see [Assign an Azure role](../storage/blobs/assign-azure-role-data-access.md?tabs=portal#assign-an-azure-role). 
* Configure CORS for your storage account (see details in the following subsection).

### Configure CORS

You need to configure [CORS](/rest/api/storageservices/cross-origin-resource-sharing--cors--support-for-the-azure-storage-services) for your storage account, so that 3D Scenes Studio is able to access your storage container. 

These CORS headers are always required:
* Authorization
* x-ms-version
* x-ms-blob-type

These other CORS headers are required if you're planning on using private links functionality:
* Content-Type
* Content-Length
* x-ms-copy-source
* x-ms-requires-sync

Following is the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli) command that sets the methods, origins, and headers previously listed for CORS in your storage account. The command contains one placeholder for the name of your storage account.

```azurecli
az storage cors add --services b --methods GET OPTIONS POST PUT --origins https://explorer.digitaltwins.azure.net --allowed-headers Authorization Content-Type Content-Length x-ms-version x-ms-blob-type x-ms-copy-source x-ms-requires-sync --account-name <your-storage-account>
```

Now you have all the necessary resources to work with scenes in 3D Scenes Studio.

## Initialize your 3D Scenes Studio environment

In this section, you set the environment in *3D Scenes Studio* and customize your scene for the sample graph that's in your Azure Digital Twins instance.

1. Navigate to the [3D Scenes Studio](https://explorer.digitaltwins.azure.net/3dscenes). The studio opens, connected to the Azure Digital Twins instance that you accessed last in the Azure Digital Twins Explorer.
1. Select the **Edit** icon next to the instance name to configure the instance and storage container details.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/studio-edit-environment-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of 3D Scenes Studio highlighting the edit environment icon, which looks like a pencil." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/studio-edit-environment-1.png":::

    1. The **Azure Digital Twins instance URL** should start with *https://*, followed by the *host name* of your instance from the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.
    
    1. For the **Azure Storage account URL**, enter the URL of your storage container from the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. For the **Azure Storage container name**, enter the name of your storage container from the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.
    
    1. Select **Save**.
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/studio-edit-environment-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of 3D Scenes Studio highlighting the Save button for the environment." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/studio-edit-environment-2.png":::

## Create, edit, and view scenes 

The 3D representation of an environment in 3D Scenes Studio is called a *scene*. A scene consists of a 3D file and a configuration file, created for you automatically.

To create a scene, start with a segmented 3D file in *.GLTF* or *.GLB* format. You can view and download a sample 3D file from this link: [RobotArms.glb](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-digital-twins-getting-started/blob/main/3dscenes/RobotArms.glb). 

>[!TIP]
>3D Scenes Studio supports animation. If you use a 3D model file that contains animations, they play in the scene.

You can use 3D Scenes Studio with a 3D file that's already present in your storage container, or you can upload the file directly to 3D Scenes Studio, which adds it to the container automatically. Here are the steps to use a 3D file to create a new scene.

1. From the home page of 3D Scenes Studio, select the **Add 3D scene** button to start creating a new scene. 

1. Enter a **Name** and **Description** for the scene.
1. If you want the scene to show up in [globe view](#view-scenes-in-globe-view), toggle **Show on globe** to **On**. Enter **Latitude** and **Longitude** values for the scene.
1. Select one of the following tabs in the **Link 3D file** section:
    1. **Choose file** to enter the URL of a 3D file that's already in your storage container
    1. **Upload file** to upload a 3D file from your computer

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/add-scene.png" alt-text="Screenshot of 3D Scenes Studio, Create new scene dialog." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/add-scene.png":::
1. Select **Create**.
 
### Edit scenes

To edit or delete a scene after it's created, use the **Actions** icons next to the scene in the 3D Scenes Studio home page.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/edit-delete-scene.png" alt-text="Screenshot of 3D Scenes Studio, highlighting actions for a scene." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/edit-delete-scene.png":::

Editing a scene reopens all of the scene properties you set while creating it, allowing you to change them and update the scene.

### View scenes in globe view

The home page of 3D Scenes Studio shows a **List view** of your scenes. 

You can also select **Globe view** to see your scenes placed visually on a globe.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/globe-view-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of 3D Scenes Studio, Globe is highlighted on the home screen." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/globe-view-1.png":::

The resulting globe view looks like this:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/globe-view-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of 3D Scenes Studio, showing scenes in Globe view." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/globe-view-2.png":::

### View scenes individually

You can select an individual scene from the home page to open it in **Build** mode. Here, you can see the 3D mesh for the scene and edit its [elements](#add-elements) and [behaviors](#add-behaviors).

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/scene-build.png" alt-text="Screenshot of 3D Scenes Studio, showing a scene in the builder." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/scene-build.png":::

You can switch to **View** mode to enable filtering on specific elements and visualization of element behaviors that you created.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/scene-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of 3D Scenes Studio, showing a scene in the viewer." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/scene-view.png":::

You can view **All properties** of an element from here, and their values over time if [data history](concepts-data-history.md) is enabled on your instance. To view property history, select the **Open data history explorer** icon.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/scene-view-data-history.png" alt-text="Screenshot of 3D Scenes Studio, showing the icon to open the data history explorer." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/scene-view-data-history.png":::

This selection opens the **Data history explorer** for the property. For more information about using the data history explorer, see [Validate and explore historized properties](how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer.md#validate-and-explore-historized-properties). 

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/data-history-explorer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of data history explorer for 3D Scenes Studio." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/data-history-explorer.png":::

### Embed scenes in custom applications

The viewer component can also be embedded into custom applications outside of 3D Scenes Studio, and can work along with third party components.

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-3d-embed.md](../../includes/digital-twins-3d-embed.md)]

## Add elements

An *element* is a self-defined set of 3D meshes that is linked to data on one or more underlying digital twins.

One way to create a new element is to select **New element** from the **Elements** tab in the **Build** view for a scene.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-element-start-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of 3D Scenes Studio in the builder for a scene. The New element button is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-element-start-button.png":::

Alternatively, you can select a mesh component directly from the visualization and create a new element that is connected to it already.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-element-start-mesh.png" alt-text="Screenshot of 3D Scenes Studio in the builder for a scene. The mesh for a tank is highlighted and there's an option to Create new element." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-element-start-mesh.png":::

Creating a new element opens the **New element** panel, where you can fill in element information.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-element-panel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of New element options in 3D Scenes Studio." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-element-panel.png":::

### Name and primary twin

A *primary twin* is the main digital twin counterpart for an element. You connect the element to a twin in your Azure Digital Twins instance so that the element can represent your twin and its data within the 3D visualization.

In the **New element** panel, the **Primary twin** dropdown list contains names of all the twins in the connected Azure Digital Twins instance. Next to this field, you can select the **Inspect properties** icon to view the twin data, or the **Advanced twin search** icon to find other twins by querying property values.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-element-primary-twin.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New element options in 3D Scenes Studio. The Primary twin dropdown list is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-element-primary-twin.png":::

Select a twin to link to this element. Linking the twin to this element automatically applies the digital twin ID (`$dtId`) as the element **Name**. You can rename the element if you want, to make it understandable for both builders and consumers of the 3D scene.

>[!TIP]
>[Azure Digital Twins Explorer](concepts-azure-digital-twins-explorer.md) can help you find the right twin to link to an element, by showing you a visual graph of your twins and letting you query for specific twin conditions.

### Meshes

The **Meshes** tab is where you specify which components of the visual 3D mesh represent this element.

If you started element creation by selecting a mesh in the visualization, that mesh is already filled in here. You can select meshes in the visualization now to add them to the element.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-element-meshes.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New element options in 3D Scenes Studio. The Meshes tab is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-element-meshes.png":::

### Behaviors

A *behavior* is a scenario for your scene. Select **Add behavior** on this tab. From there, you can either select an existing behavior to add it to this element, or select **New behavior** to enter the flow for creating a new behavior.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-element-behaviors.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New element options in 3D Scenes Studio. The Behaviors tab is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-element-behaviors.png":::

For more information about creating new behaviors, see [Add behaviors](#add-behaviors).

### Other twins

On the **other twins** tab, you can add secondary digital twin data sources for an element. You can add other twins to an element if the data on the primary twin isn't enough to define all the behaviors you want for the element, so you need access to the data of other twins.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-element-other-twins.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New element options in 3D Scenes Studio. The Other twins tab is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-element-other-twins.png":::

You can't add other twins during new element creation. For instructions on adding other twins, see [Twins](#twins) as a behavior option.

Once there are other twins added to the element, you're able to view and modify them on this tab.

## Add behaviors

A *behavior* is a scenario for your scene that uses particular data on the related element's digital twin to drive viewer visualizations.

One way to create a new behavior is to select **New behavior** from the **Behaviors** tab of the **Build** view for a scene.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-start-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of 3D Scenes Studio in the builder for a scene. The New behavior button is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-start-button.png":::

Alternatively, you can select an element from the **Elements** tab, and create a new behavior from [that element's Behaviors tab](#behaviors).

Creating a new behavior opens the **New behavior** panel, where you can fill in behavior information.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-panel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of New behavior options in 3D Scenes Studio." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-panel.png":::

### Name and scene layers

Start by choosing a **Display name** for the behavior.

>[!TIP]
>Choose a name that is clear to end users viewing the scene, because this behavior name is displayed as part of the scene visualization. 

For the **Scene layers** dropdown menu, you can add this behavior to an existing layer or create a new layer to help organize this behavior. For more information on layers, see [Manage layers](#manage-layers).

### Elements

In the **Elements** tab, select which elements this behavior should target. 

If you started the behavior creation process from a specific element, that element is already selected here. Otherwise, you can choose elements here for the first time.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-elements.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New behavior options in 3D Scenes Studio. The Elements tab is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-elements.png":::

### Twins

On the **Twins** tab, you can modify the set of twins whose data is available to this behavior, including the targeted elements' primary twins and any other twins.

You can add secondary digital twin data sources for an element. After configuring other twins, you'll be able to use properties from those twins in your behavior expressions for this element. You should only add other twins when there are other twins with data beyond your primary twin that you want to use in your [visual rules](#visual-rules) and [widgets](#widgets) for this behavior.

To add a new twin data source, select **Add twin** and **Create twin**.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-twins.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New behavior options in 3D Scenes Studio. The Twins tab is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-twins.png":::

Adding a new twin data source opens a **New twin** panel, where you can name the new twin and select a twin from your Azure Digital Twins instance to map.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-twins-new-twin.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New twin panel in 3D Scenes Studio." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-twins-new-twin.png":::

>[!TIP]
>[Azure Digital Twins Explorer](concepts-azure-digital-twins-explorer.md) can help you see twins that might be related to the primary twin for this element. You can query your graph using `SELECT * FROM digitaltwins WHERE $dtId="<primary-twin-id>`, and then use the [double-click expansion feature](how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer.md#control-twin-graph-expansion) to explore related twins.

### Visual rules 

In the **Visual rules** tab, you can configure data-driven overlays on your elements to indicate their health or status in the viewer.

To create a rule, start by selecting **Add Rule**.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-visual-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New behavior options in 3D Scenes Studio. The Visual Rules tab is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-visual-rules.png":::

Choose a **Display name** for the rule.

Next, choose whether the rule is dependent on a **Single property** or a **Custom (advanced)** property expression. For a **Single property**, you get a dropdown list of numeric properties on the primary twin. For **Custom (advanced)**, you get a text box where you can write a custom JavaScript expression using one or more properties. The result of your expression must match the result type that you specify in the **Type** field. For more information about writing custom expressions, see [Use custom (advanced) expressions](#use-custom-advanced-expressions).

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-visual-property-error-note.md](../../includes/digital-twins-visual-property-error-note.md)]

Once you define your property expression, select **Add condition** to define the conditional visual effects.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-visual-rules-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New visual rule options in 3D Scenes Studio. The described fields are highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-visual-rules-2.png":::

In the **Add condition** options, enter a **Label** for the condition in the visualization.

Then, set the **Values** to identify value boundaries for the condition (the exact selection changes depending on the property type). For numerical properties, the min of each value range is inclusive, and the max is exclusive.

Under **Actions**, define what happens in the scene visualization when the condition is met. You can use **Mesh coloring** to control the color of the property expression in the viewer, or **Badge** to display a badge of a certain color and icon when the condition for the property expression is met.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-visual-rules-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New visual rule options in 3D Scenes Studio. The Add condition options are highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-visual-rules-3.png":::

When you're done, select **Save**.

### Widgets 

Widgets are managed on the **Widgets** tab. *Widgets* are data-driven visuals that provide more context and data, to help you understand the scenario that the behavior represents. Configuring widgets helps you make sure the right data is discoverable when a certain condition is active.

Select **Add widget** to bring up the **Widget library**, where you can select from different type of available widgets. 

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-widgets-library.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New behavior options in 3D Scenes Studio. The Widgets tab is highlighted and the Widget library is visible." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-widgets-library.png":::

Here are the types of widget that you can create:
 
* **Gauge**: For visually representing numerical data points

    Enter a **Display name** and **Unit of measure**, then choose whether the gauge reflects a **Single property** or a **Custom (advanced)** property expression. For a **Single property**, you get a dropdown list of numeric properties on the primary twin. For **Custom (advanced)**, you get a text box where you can write a custom JavaScript expression using one or more properties. The expression should have a numeric outcome. For more information about writing custom expressions, see [Use custom (advanced) expressions](#use-custom-advanced-expressions).

    Once you define your property expression, set value ranges to appear in certain colors on the gauge. The min of each value range is inclusive, and the max is exclusive.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-widgets-gauge.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new gauge-type widget in 3D Scenes Studio." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-widgets-gauge.png":::

    [!INCLUDE [digital-twins-visual-property-error-note.md](../../includes/digital-twins-visual-property-error-note.md)]

* **Link**: For including externally referenced content via a linked URL

    Enter a **Label** and destination **URL**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-widgets-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new link-type widget in 3D Scenes Studio." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-widgets-link.png":::

    Link URLs can also include calculation expressions with this syntax: `${<calculation-expression>}`. The previous screenshot contains an expression for accessing a property of the primary twin. Expressions are computed and displayed dynamically in the [viewer](#view-scenes-individually).

* **Value**: For directly displaying twin property values

    Enter a **Display name** and select a **Property expression** that you want to display. This property expression can be a **Single property** of the primary twin, or a **Custom (advanced)** property expression. Custom expressions should be JavaScript expressions using one or more properties of the twin, and you select which outcome type the expression produces. If your custom property expression outputs a string, you can also use JavaScript's template literal syntax to include a dynamic expression in the string output. Format the dynamic expression with this syntax: `${<calculation-expression>}`. Then, wrap the whole string output with backticks (`` ` ``). For more information about writing custom expressions, see [Use custom (advanced) expressions](#use-custom-advanced-expressions).

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-widgets-value.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new value-type widget in 3D Scenes Studio." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-widgets-value.png":::

    [!INCLUDE [digital-twins-visual-property-error-note.md](../../includes/digital-twins-visual-property-error-note.md)]

    Following is an example of a value widget that checks if the `InFlow` value of the primary twin exceeds 99. If so, it outputs a string with an expression containing the twin's `$dtId`. Otherwise, there's no expression in the output, so no backticks are required. 

    Here's the value expression: `` PrimaryTwin.InFlow > 99 ? `${PrimaryTwin.$dtId} has an InFlow problem`  : 'Everything looks good' ``. The computed result of the expression (the `$dtId`) is shown in the widget in the viewer.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-widgets-value-expression.png" alt-text="Screenshots showing the notification text being entered on the value widget dialog, and how the widget appears in the Viewer." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-widgets-value-expression.png":::

* **Data history**: For displaying property values over time. This widget works with Azure Digital Twins' [data history feature](concepts-data-history.md), so it's only available if you [enable data history](how-to-create-data-history-connection.md) for the instance being used in this 3D scene. Once a data history connection exists for the instance, you're able to display that data with this widget.
    
    The widget fills the **Connection string** field automatically, by targeting data in the Azure Data Explorer instance already connected to this Azure Digital Twins instance.

    Enter a **Display name**, and add one or more **time series** datasets based on properties of the primary twin. You can also customize how the time series data appears in the widget chart.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-widgets-data-history.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new data history widget in 3D Scenes Studio." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-widgets-data-history.png":::

    [!INCLUDE [digital-twins-visual-property-error-note.md](../../includes/digital-twins-visual-property-error-note.md)]

### Use custom (advanced) expressions

While defining [visual rules](#visual-rules) and [widgets](#widgets) in your behaviors, you might want to use custom expressions to define a property condition.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-custom-property-expression.png" alt-text="Screenshot of defining a custom expression in 3D Scenes Studio." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/new-behavior-custom-property-expression.png":::

These expressions use the JavaScript language, and allow you to use one or more properties of associated twins to define custom logic. The result of your expression must match the result type that you specify in the **Type** field.

The following chart indicates which JavaScript operators are supported in 3D Scenes Studio custom expressions.

| Operator type | Supported? |
| --- | --- |
| Assignment operators | No |
| Comparison operators | Yes |
| Arithmetic operators | Yes |
| Bitwise operators | Yes |
| Logical operators | Yes |
| String operators | Yes |
| Conditional (ternary) operator | Yes |
| Command operator | No |
| Unary operators | No |
| Relational operators | No |

## Manage layers 

You can create *layers* in your scene to help organize your [behaviors](#add-behaviors). Layers act like tags on the behaviors, enabling you to define which behaviors need to be seen together, thus creating custom views of your scene for different roles or tasks.

One way to create layers is to use the **Scene layers** button in the **Build** view for a scene.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/layers-start-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of 3D Scenes Studio builder for a scene. The Scene layers button is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/layers-start-button.png":::

Selecting **New layer** prompts you to enter a name for the new layer you want to create.

Alternatively, you can create layers while [creating or modifying a behavior](#name-and-scene-layers). The behavior pane is also where you can add the behavior to a layer you already created.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/layers-start-behavior.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Modify Behavior options in 3D Scenes Studio. A Scene layer is being selected." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/layers-start-behavior.png":::

When looking at your scene in the viewer, you can use the **Select layers** button to choose which layers show up in the visualization. Behaviors that aren't part of any layer are grouped under **Default layer**.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/layers-select-viewer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of 3D Scenes Studio in View mode. The layer selection is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/layers-select-viewer.png":::

## Configure minimum refresh rate

You can manually configure the **minimum refresh rate** for the 3D scene viewer, to exercise some control over how often data is pulled and the resulting effect on performance. You can configure the minimum refresh rate to be anywhere between 10 seconds and one hour.

In the builder for a scene, select the **Scene configuration** button.

## Share your environment

A *3D Scenes Studio environment* is formed from a unique pairing of an **Azure Digital Twins instance** and an **Azure storage container**. You can share your entire environment with someone, including all of your scenes, or share a specific scene.

To share your environment with someone else, start by giving them the following permissions to your resources:
* *Azure Digital Twins Data Reader* access (or greater) on the Azure Digital Twins instance
* *Storage Blob Data Reader* access (or greater) to the storage container
    * *Storage Blob Data Reader* allows them to view your scenes.
    * *Storage Blob Data Owner* or *Storage Blob Data Contributor* allows them to edit your scenes.

Then, follow the instructions in the rest of this section to share either your [entire environment](#share-general-environment) or a [specific scene](#share-a-specific-scene).

### Share general environment 

Once someone has the required permissions, there are two ways to give them access to your entire environment. You can do either of the following things:
* Use the Share button on the 3D Scenes Studio homepage to copy the **URL of your 3D Scenes Studio environment**. (The URL includes the URLs of both your Azure Digital Twins instance and your storage container.)
    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/copy-url.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Share environment button in 3D Scenes Studio." lightbox="media/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio/copy-url.png":::

    Share it with the recipient, who can paste this URL directly into their browser to connect to your environment.
* Share the **URL of your Azure Digital Twins instance** and the **URL of your Azure storage container** that you used when [initializing your 3D Scenes Studio environment](#initialize-your-3d-scenes-studio-environment). The recipient can access [3D Scenes Studio](https://explorer.digitaltwins.azure.net/3dscenes) and initialize it with these same URL values to connect to your same environment.

After you give them access, the recipient can view and interact with your scenes in the studio.

### Share a specific scene

You can also share your environment with a link directly to a specific scene. To share a specific scene, open the scene in **View** mode.

Use the **Share scene** icon to generate a link to your scene. You can choose whether you want to link to preserve your current layer and element selections.

When the recipient pastes this URL into their browser, the specified scene opens in the viewer, with any chosen layers or elements selected.

>[!NOTE]
>When a scene is shared with someone in this way, the recipient is able to leave this scene and view other scenes in your environment if they choose.
