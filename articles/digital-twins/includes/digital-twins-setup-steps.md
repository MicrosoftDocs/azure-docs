Full setup for a new Azure Digital Twins instance consists of two parts:
1. Creating the instance
2. Setting up user access permissions: Azure users need to have the **Azure Digital Twins Data Owner** role on the Azure Digital Twins instance to be able to manage it and its data. In this step, you as an Owner/administrator of the Azure subscription will assign this role to the person who will be managing your Azure Digital Twins instance. This may be yourself or someone else in your organization.
 
>[!IMPORTANT]
>To complete this full article and completely set up a usable instance, you need permissions to manage both resources and user access on the Azure subscription. The first step can be completed by anyone who's able to create resources on the subscription, but the second step requires user access management permissions (or the cooperation of someone with these permissions). You can read more about this in the [Prerequisites: Required permissions](#prerequisites-permission-requirements) section for the user access permission step.
