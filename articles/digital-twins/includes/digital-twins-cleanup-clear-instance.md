* If you want to continue using the Azure Digital Twins instance from this article, but clear out **all** of its models, twins, and relationships, run the following [az dt job deletion](/cli/azure/dt/job/deletion) CLI command: 

    ```azure-cli
    az dt job deletion create -n <name-of-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance> -y
    ```
    
    If you only want to delete **some** of these elements, you can use the [az dt twin relationship delete](/cli/azure/dt/twin/relationship#az-dt-twin-relationship-delete), [az dt twin delete](/cli/azure/dt/twin#az-dt-twin-delete), and [az dt model delete](/cli/azure/dt/model#az-dt-model-delete) commands to selectively delete only the elements you want to remove.
