>[!NOTE]
>Currently, Azure Digital Twins Explorer fully supports DTDL v2 models and supports limited functionality for DTDL v3 models. 
>
>DTDL v3 models can be viewed in the Models panel, and twins created with DTDL v3 models can be viewed and edited (including twins with array properties). However, DTDL v3 models don't show up in the Model Graph panel, and they **can't be imported** using Azure Digital Twins Explorer. To import DTDL v3 models to your instance, use another developer interface like the [APIs and SDKs](../concepts-apis-sdks.md) or the [Azure CLI](../concepts-cli.md).
