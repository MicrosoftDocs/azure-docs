# Tutorial: Create an Azure Digital Twins graph using the Azure CLI

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-tutorial-selector.md](includes/digital-twins-tutorial-selector.md)]

In this tutorial, you build a graph in Azure Digital Twins using models, twins, and relationships. The tool for this tutorial is the [Azure Digital Twins command set for the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/dt).

You can use the CLI commands to perform essential Azure Digital Twins actions such as uploading models, creating and modifying twins, and creating relationships. You can also look at the [reference documentation for az dt command set](/cli/azure/dt) to see the full set of CLI commands.

In this tutorial, you will...

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this tutorial, you need to first complete the following prerequisites.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

### Download the sample models

The tutorial uses two prewritten models that are part of the C# [end-to-end sample project](/samples/azure-samples/digital-twins-samples/digital-twins-samples/) for Azure Digital Twins. The model files are located here: 
* [Room.json](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/digital-twins-samples/blob/main/AdtSampleApp/SampleClientApp/Models/Room.json)
* [Floor.json](https://github.com/azure-Samples/digital-twins-samples/blob/main/AdtSampleApp/SampleClientApp/Models/Floor.json)

To get the files on your machine, use the navigation links in the previous list and copy the file bodies into local files on your machine with the same names (*Room.json* and *Floor.json*).

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-h3.md)]

[!INCLUDE [CLI setup for Azure Digital Twins](includes/digital-twins-cli.md)]

### Prepare an Azure Digital Twins instance

To work with Azure Digital Twins in this article, you first need to set up an Azure Digital Twins instance and the required permissions for using it. If you already have an Azure Digital Twins instance set up from previous work, you can use that instance.

Otherwise, follow the instructions in [Set up an instance and authentication](how-to-set-up-instance-cli.md#create-the-azure-digital-twins-instance). The instructions also contain steps to verify that you completed each step successfully and are ready to move on to using your new instance.

After you set up your Azure Digital Twins instance, make a note of the following values that you'll need to connect to the instance later:
* The instance's **host name**
* The **Azure subscription** that you used to create the instance

>[!TIP]
>If you know the friendly name of your instance, you can use the following CLI command to get the host name and subscription values:
>
>```azurecli-interactive
>az dt show --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-name>
>```
>
>They appear in the output like this:

## Model a physical environment with DTDL

Now that the CLI and Azure Digital Twins instance are set up, you can begin building a graph of a scenario. 

The first step in creating an Azure Digital Twins solution is defining twin [models](concepts-models.md) for your environment. 

Models are similar to classes in object-oriented programming languages; they provide user-defined templates for [digital twins](concepts-twins-graph.md) to follow and instantiate later. They're written in a JSON-like language called *Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL)*, and can define a twin's properties, relationships, and components.

> [!NOTE]
> DTDL also allows for the definition of commands on digital twins. However, commands aren't currently supported in the Azure Digital Twins service.

Navigate on your machine to the *Room.json* file that you created in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. Open it in a code editor, and change it in the following ways:

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-tutorial-model-create.md](includes/digital-twins-tutorial-model-create.md)]

### Upload models to Azure Digital Twins

After designing models, you need to upload them to your Azure Digital Twins instance. Doing so configures your Azure Digital Twins service instance with your own custom domain vocabulary. Once you upload the models, you can create twin instances that use them.

1. If you're using a local installation of the Azure CLI, you can skip this step. If you're using Cloud Shell, you need to upload your model files to Cloud Shell's storage so the files are available when you run the Cloud Shell command that uses them. Select **Manage Files** and then **Upload**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-instance/cloud-shell/cloud-shell-upload.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Cloud Shell browser window showing selection of the Upload icon.":::
    
    Navigate to the *Room.json* file on your machine and select "Open." Then, repeat this step for *Floor.json*.

1. Next, use the [az dt model create](/cli/azure/dt/model#az-dt-model-create) command as shown in the following example to upload your updated Room model to your Azure Digital Twins instance. The second command uploads another model, Floor, which you'll also use in the next section to create different types of twins. There's a placeholder for the instance's host name (you can also use the instance's friendly name with a slight decrease in performance), and a placeholder for a path to each model file. If you're using Cloud Shell, *Room.json* and *Floor.json* are in the main storage directory, so you can just use the file names directly in the following commands where a path is required.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az dt model create --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --models <path-to-Room.json>
    az dt model create --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --models <path-to-Floor.json>
    ```
    
    The output from each command shows information about the successfully uploaded model.

    >[!TIP]
    >You can also upload all models within a directory at the same time by using the `--from-directory` option for the model create command. For more information, see [Optional parameters for az dt model create](/cli/azure/dt/model#az-dt-model-create-optional-parameters).

1. Verify the models were created with the [az dt model list](/cli/azure/dt/model#az-dt-model-list) command as shown in the following example. Doing so prints a list of all models uploaded to the Azure Digital Twins instance with their full information. There's one placeholder for the instance's host name (you can also use the instance's friendly name with a slight decrease in performance).

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az dt model list --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --definition
    ```
    
    Look for the edited Room model in the results:
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-command-line/cli/output-get-models.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Cloud Shell showing result of the model list command, which includes the updated Room model." lightbox="media/tutorial-command-line/cli/output-get-models.png":::

### Errors

The CLI also handles errors from the service. 

Rerun the `az dt model create` command to try reuploading one of the same models you uploaded, for a second time:

```azurecli-interactive
az dt model create --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --models Room.json
```

As models can't be overwritten, running this command on the same model now returns an error code of `ModelIdAlreadyExists`.

## Create digital twins

Now that some models are uploaded to your Azure Digital Twins instance, you can create [digital twins](concepts-twins-graph.md) based on the model definitions. Digital twins represent the entities within your business environmentâ€”things like sensors on a farm, rooms in a building, or lights in a car. 

To create a digital twin, you use the [az dt twin create](/cli/azure/dt/twin#az-dt-twin-create) command. You must reference the model that the twin is based on, and can optionally define initial values for any properties in the model. You don't have to pass any relationship information at this stage.

1. Run this code in the CLI to create several twins, based on the Room model you updated earlier and another model, Floor. Recall that Room has three properties, so you can provide arguments with the initial values for these properties. (Initializing property values is optional in general, but they're needed for this tutorial.) There's one placeholder for the instance's host name (you can also use the instance's friendly name with a slight decrease in performance).

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az dt twin create --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --dtmi "dtmi:example:Room;2" --twin-id room0 --properties '{"RoomName":"Room0", "Temperature":70, "HumidityLevel":30}'
    az dt twin create --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --dtmi "dtmi:example:Room;2" --twin-id room1 --properties '{"RoomName":"Room1", "Temperature":80, "HumidityLevel":60}'
    az dt twin create --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --dtmi "dtmi:example:Floor;1" --twin-id floor0
    az dt twin create --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --dtmi "dtmi:example:Floor;1" --twin-id floor1
    ```

    >[!NOTE]
    >If you're using anything other than Cloud Shell in the Bash environment, you might need to escape certain characters in the inline JSON so that it parses correctly. 
    >
    >For more information, see [Use special characters in different shells](concepts-cli.md#use-special-characters-in-different-shells).
    
    The output from each command shows information about the successfully created twin (including properties for the room twins that were initialized with them).

1. You can verify that the twins were created with the [az dt twin query](/cli/azure/dt/twin#az-dt-twin-query) command as shown in the following example. The query shown finds all the digital twins in your Azure Digital Twins instance. There's one placeholder for the instance's host name (you can also use the instance's friendly name with a slight decrease in performance).
    
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az dt twin query --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --query-command "SELECT * FROM DIGITALTWINS"
    ```
    
    Look for the room0, room1, floor0, and floor1 twins in the results. Here's an excerpt showing part of the result of this query.
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-command-line/cli/output-query-all.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Cloud Shell showing partial result of twin query, including room0 and room1." lightbox="media/tutorial-command-line/cli/output-query-all.png":::

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-query-latency-note.md](includes/digital-twins-query-latency-note.md)]

### Modify a digital twin

You can also modify the properties of a twin that you created. 

1. Run the following [az dt twin update](/cli/azure/dt/twin#az-dt-twin-update) command to change room0's RoomName from Room0 to PresidentialSuite. There's one placeholder for the instance's host name (you can also use the instance's friendly name with a slight decrease in performance).

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az dt twin update --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --twin-id room0 --json-patch '{"op":"add", "path":"/RoomName", "value": "PresidentialSuite"}'
    ```
    
    >[!NOTE]
    > We recommend that you use the CLI in the Bash environment for this tutorial. If you use the PowerShell environment, you might need to escape the quotation mark characters in order for the `--json-patch` JSON value to be parsed correctly.
    
    The output from this command shows the twin's current information, and you should see the new value for the `RoomName` in the result.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-command-line/cli/output-update-twin.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Cloud Shell showing result of the update command, which includes a RoomName of PresidentialSuite." lightbox="media/tutorial-command-line/cli/output-update-twin.png":::

1. You can verify the update succeeded by running the [az dt twin show](/cli/azure/dt/twin#az-dt-twin-show) command to see room0's information. There's one placeholder for the instance's host name (you can also use the instance's friendly name with a slight decrease in performance).

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az dt twin show --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --twin-id room0
    ```
    
    The output should reflect the updated name.

## Create a graph by adding relationships

Next, you can create some relationships between these twins, to connect them into a [twin graph](concepts-twins-graph.md). Twin graphs are used to represent an entire environment. 

The types of relationships that you can create from one twin to another are defined within the [models](#model-a-physical-environment-with-dtdl) that you uploaded earlier. The [model definition for Floor](https://github.com/azure-Samples/digital-twins-samples/blob/main/AdtSampleApp/SampleClientApp/Models/Floor.json) specifies that floors can have a type of relationship called `contains`. Since the model definition specifies this relationship, it's possible to create a `contains`-type relationship from each Floor twin to the corresponding room that it contains.

To add a relationship, use the [az dt twin relationship create](/cli/azure/dt/twin/relationship#az-dt-twin-relationship-create) command. Specify the twin that the relationship is coming from, the type of relationship, and the twin that the relationship is connecting to. Lastly, give the relationship a unique ID. If a relationship was defined to have properties, you can initialize the relationship properties in this command as well.

1. Run the following code to add a `contains`-type relationship from each of the Floor twins you created earlier to the corresponding Room twin. The relationships are named relationship0 and relationship1. There's one placeholder for the instance's host name (you can also use the instance's friendly name with a slight decrease in performance).

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az dt twin relationship create --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --relationship-id relationship0 --relationship contains --twin-id floor0 --target room0
    az dt twin relationship create --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --relationship-id relationship1 --relationship contains --twin-id floor1 --target room1
    ```
    
    >[!TIP]
    >The `contains` relationship in the [Floor model](https://github.com/azure-Samples/digital-twins-samples/blob/main/AdtSampleApp/SampleClientApp/Models/Floor.json) was also defined with two properties, `ownershipUser` and `ownershipDepartment`, so you can also provide arguments with the initial values for these properties when you create the relationships.
    > To create a relationship with these properties initialized, add the `--properties` option to either of the above commands, like this:
    > ```azurecli-interactive
    > ... --properties '{"ownershipUser":"MyUser", "ownershipDepartment":"MyDepartment"}'
    > ``` 
    
    The output from each command shows information about the successfully created relationship.

1. You can verify the relationships with any of the following commands, which print the relationships in your Azure Digital Twins instance. Each command has one placeholder for the instance's host name (you can also use the instance's friendly name with a slight decrease in performance).
    * To see all relationships coming off of each floor (viewing the relationships from one side):
        ```azurecli-interactive
        az dt twin relationship list --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --twin-id floor0
        az dt twin relationship list --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --twin-id floor1
        ```
    * To see all relationships arriving at each room (viewing the relationship from the "other" side):
        ```azurecli-interactive
        az dt twin relationship list --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --twin-id room0 --incoming
        az dt twin relationship list --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --twin-id room1 --incoming
        ```
    * To look for these relationships individually, by ID:
        ```azurecli-interactive
        az dt twin relationship show --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --twin-id floor0 --relationship-id relationship0
        az dt twin relationship show --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --twin-id floor1 --relationship-id relationship1
        ```

The twins and relationships that you set up in this tutorial form the following conceptual graph:

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-command-line/app/sample-graph.png" alt-text="A diagram showing a conceptual graph. floor0 is connected via relationship0 to room0, and floor1 is connected via relationship1 to room1." border="false" lightbox="media/tutorial-command-line/app/sample-graph.png":::

## Query the twin graph to answer environment questions

A main feature of Azure Digital Twins is the ability to [query](concepts-query-language.md) your twin graph easily and efficiently to answer questions about your environment. In the Azure CLI, querying is done with the [az dt twin query](/cli/azure/dt/twin#az-dt-twin-query) command.

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-query-latency-note.md](includes/digital-twins-query-latency-note.md)]

Run the following queries in the CLI to answer some questions about the sample environment. Each command has one placeholder for the instance's host name (you can also use the instance's friendly name with a slight decrease in performance).

1. What are all the entities from my environment represented in Azure Digital Twins? (query all)

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az dt twin query --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --query-command "SELECT * FROM DIGITALTWINS"
    ```

    This query allows you to take stock of your environment at a glance, and make sure everything is represented as you want it to be within Azure Digital Twins. The result of this query is an output containing each digital twin with its details. Here's an excerpt:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-command-line/cli/output-query-all.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Cloud Shell showing partial result of twin query, including room0 and room1." lightbox="media/tutorial-command-line/cli/output-query-all.png":::

    >[!TIP]
    >You might recognize that this command is the same command you used in the [Create digital twins](#create-digital-twins) section earlier to find all the Azure Digital Twins in the instance.

1. What are all the rooms in my environment? (query by model)

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az dt twin query --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --query-command "SELECT * FROM DIGITALTWINS T WHERE IS_OF_MODEL(T, 'dtmi:example:Room;2')"
    ```

    You can restrict your query to twins of a certain type, to get more specific information about what's represented. The result of this shows room0 and room1, but doesn't show floor0 or floor1 (since they're floors, not rooms).
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-command-line/cli/output-query-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Cloud Shell showing result of model query, which includes only room0 and room1." lightbox="media/tutorial-command-line/cli/output-query-model.png":::

1. What are all the rooms on floor0? (query by relationship)

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az dt twin query --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --query-command "SELECT room FROM DIGITALTWINS floor JOIN room RELATED floor.contains where floor.\$dtId = 'floor0'"
    ```

    You can query based on relationships in your graph, to get information about how twins are connected or to restrict your query to a certain area. This query also illustrates that a twin's ID (like floor0 in the previous query) is queried using the metadata field `$dtId`. Only room0 is on floor0, so it's the only room in the result for this query.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-command-line/cli/output-query-relationship.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Cloud Shell showing result of relationship query, which includes room0." lightbox="media/tutorial-command-line/cli/output-query-relationship.png":::

    > [!NOTE]
    >When using Cloud Shell to run a query with metadata fields like this one that begin with `$`, you should escape the `$` with a backslash to let Cloud Shell know it's not a variable and should be consumed as a literal in the query text. The escaped metadata field is reflected in the previous screenshot.

1. What are all the twins in my environment with a temperature above 75? (query by property)

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az dt twin query --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --query-command "SELECT * FROM DigitalTwins T WHERE T.Temperature > 75"
    ```

    You can query the graph based on properties to answer different kinds of questions, including finding outliers in your environment that might need attention. Other comparison operators (*<*,*>*, *=*, or *!=*) are also supported. room1 shows up in the results here, because it has a temperature of 80.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-command-line/cli/output-query-property.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Cloud Shell showing result of property query, which includes only room1." lightbox="media/tutorial-command-line/cli/output-query-property.png":::

1. What are all the rooms on floor0 with a temperature above 75? (compound query)

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az dt twin query --dt-name <Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-hostname-or-name> --query-command "SELECT room FROM DIGITALTWINS floor JOIN room RELATED floor.contains where floor.\$dtId = 'floor0' AND IS_OF_MODEL(room, 'dtmi:example:Room;2') AND room.Temperature > 75"
    ```

    You can also combine the earlier queries like you would in SQL, using combination operators such as `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`. This query uses `AND` to make the previous query about twin temperatures more specific. The result now only includes rooms with temperatures above 75 that are on floor0â€”which in this case, is none of them. The result set is empty.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-command-line/cli/output-query-compound.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Cloud Shell showing result of compound query, which doesn't include any items." lightbox="media/tutorial-command-line/cli/output-query-compound.png":::

## Clean up resources

After completing this tutorial, you can choose which resources you want to remove, depending on what you want to do next.

* If you plan to continue to the next tutorial, you can keep the resources you set up here and reuse the Azure Digital Twins instance without clearing anything in between.

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-cleanup-clear-instance.md](includes/digital-twins-cleanup-clear-instance.md)]

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-cleanup-basic.md](includes/digital-twins-cleanup-basic.md)]

You might also want to delete the model files you created on your local machine.

## Next steps 

In this tutorial, you got started with Azure Digital Twins by building a graph in your instance using the Azure CLI. You created models, digital twins, and relationships to form a graph. You also ran some queries on the graph, to get an idea of what kinds of questions Azure Digital Twins can answer about an environment.

Continue to the next tutorial to combine Azure Digital Twins with other Azure services to complete a data-driven, end-to-end scenario:
