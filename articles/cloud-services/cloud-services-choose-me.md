# Should I Choose Cloud Services?

Azure provides different hosting models for running applications. Each one provides a different set of services, so which one you choose depends on exactly what you're trying to do. Is Cloud Services the choice for you?

| Compute Options    | Audience   |
| ------------------ | --------   |
