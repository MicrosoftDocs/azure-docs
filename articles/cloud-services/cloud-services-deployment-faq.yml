title: 'Deployment issues for Azure Cloud Services (classic): Frequently asked questions (FAQs)'
summary: |
  This article includes frequently asked questions about deployment issues for [Microsoft Azure Cloud Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cloud-services). You can also consult the [Cloud Services Virtual Machine (VM) Size page](cloud-services-sizes-specs.md) for size information.

    questions:
      - question: |
          Why does deploying a cloud service to the staging slot sometimes fail with a resource allocation error if there's already an existing deployment in the production slot?
        answer: |
          If a cloud service has a deployment in either slot, the entire cloud service is pinned to a specific cluster. This means that if a deployment already exists in the production slot, a new staging deployment can only be allocated in the same cluster as the production slot.
          
          Allocation failures occur when the cluster where your cloud service is located doesn't have enough physical compute resources to satisfy your deployment request.
          
          For help with mitigating such allocation failures, see [Cloud Service allocation failure: Solutions](cloud-services-allocation-failures.md#solutions).
          
      - question: |
          Why does scaling up or scaling out a cloud service deployment sometimes result in allocation failure?
        answer: |
          When a cloud service is deployed, it usually gets pinned to a specific cluster. This means scaling up/out an existing cloud service must allocate new instances in the same cluster. If the cluster is nearing capacity or the desired VM size/type isn't available, the request may fail.
          
          For help with mitigating such allocation failures, see [Cloud Service allocation failure: Solutions](cloud-services-allocation-failures.md#solutions).
          
      - question: |
          Why does deploying a cloud service into an affinity group sometimes result in allocation failure?
        answer: |
          The fabric in any cluster in that region can allocate a new deployment to an empty cloud service, unless the cloud service is pinned to an affinity group. Attempted deployments to the same affinity group occur on the same cluster. If the cluster is nearing capacity, the request may fail.
          
          For help with mitigating such allocation failures, see [Cloud Service allocation failure: Solutions](cloud-services-allocation-failures.md#solutions).
          
      - question: |
          Why does changing VM size or adding a new VM to an existing cloud service sometimes result in allocation failure?
        answer: |
          The clusters in a datacenter may have different configurations of machine types (for example, A series, Av2 series, D series, Dv2 series, G series, H series, etc.), but not all the clusters would necessarily have all the kinds of VMs. For example, if you try to add a D series VM to a cloud service that is already deployed in an A series-only cluster, you experience an allocation failure. This failure also happens if you try to change VM SKU sizes (for example, switching from an A series to a D series).
          
          For help with mitigating such allocation failures, see [Cloud Service allocation failure: Solutions](cloud-services-allocation-failures.md#solutions).
          
          To check the sizes available in your region, see [Microsoft Azure: Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services).
          
      - question: |
          Why does deploying a cloud service sometime fail due to limits/quotas/constraints on my subscription or service?
        answer: |
          Deployment of a cloud service may fail if the resources that are required to be allocated exceed the default or maximum quota allowed for your service at the region/datacenter level. For more information, see [Cloud Services limits](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md#azure-cloud-services-limits).
          
          You could also track the current usage/quota for your subscription at the portal: Azure portal => Subscriptions => \<appropriate subscription> => "Usage + quota".
          
          Resource usage/consumption-related information can also be retrieved via the Azure Billing APIs. See [Azure consumption API overview](../cost-management-billing/automate/automation-overview.md).
          
      - question: |
          How can I change the size of a deployed cloud service VM without redeploying it?
        answer: |
          You can't change the VM size of a deployed cloud service without redeploying it. The VM size is built into the CSDEF, which can only be updated with a redeployment.
          
          For more information, see [How to update a cloud service](cloud-services-update-azure-service.md).
          
      - question: |
          Why am I not able to deploy Cloud Services through the classic deployment model or PowerShell when using Azure Resource Manager Storage account? 
        answer: |
          Since the Cloud Service is a Classic resource that isn't directly compatible with the Azure Resource Manager model, you can't associate it with the Azure Resource Manager Storage accounts. Here are few options: 
          
          - Deploying through REST API.
          
              When you deploy through the classic deployment model, you could get around the limitation by specifying a SAS URL to the blob storage, which works with both Classic and Azure Resource Manager Storage account. Read more about the 'PackageUrl' property [here](/previous-versions/azure/reference/ee460813(v=azure.100)).
          
          - Deploying through [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
          
              This solution works from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as the call goes through a proxy/shim that allows communication between Azure Resource Manager and Classic resources. 
          
      - question: |
          Why does Azure portal require me to provide a storage account for deployment?
        answer: |
          In the classic portal, the package was uploaded to the management API layer directly, and then the API layer would temporarily put the package into an internal storage account. This process causes performance and scalability problems because the API layer wasn't designed to be a file upload service. In the Azure portal (Resource Manager deployment model), we bypassed the interim step of first uploading to the API layer, resulting in faster and more reliable deployments.
          
          As for the cost, it's small and you can reuse the same storage account across all deployments. You can use the [storage cost calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/#storage1) to determine the cost to upload the service package (CSPKG), download the CSPKG, then delete the CSPKG.
