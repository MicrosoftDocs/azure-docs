# Default TEMP folder size is too small on a cloud service (classic) web/worker role


[!INCLUDE [Cloud Services (classic) deprecation announcement](includes/deprecation-announcement.md)]

The default temporary directory of a cloud service worker or web role has a maximum size of 100 MB, which may become full at some point. This article describes how to avoid running out of space for the temporary directory.

## Why do I run out of space?
The standard Windows environment variables TEMP and TMP are available to code that is running in your application. Both TEMP and TMP point to a single directory that has a maximum size of 100 MB. Any data stored in this directory isn't persisted across the lifecycle of the cloud service. If the role instances in a cloud service are recycled, the directory is cleaned.

## Suggestion to fix the problem
Implement one of the following alternatives:

* Configure a local storage resource, and access it directly instead of using TEMP or TMP. To access a local storage resource from code that is running within your application, call the [RoleEnvironment.GetLocalResource](/previous-versions/azure/reference/ee772845(v=azure.100)) method.
* Configure a local storage resource, and point the TEMP and TMP directories to point to the path of the local storage resource. This modification should be performed within the [RoleEntryPoint.OnStart](/previous-versions/azure/reference/ee772851(v=azure.100)) method.

The following code example shows how to modify the target directories for TEMP and TMP from within the OnStart method:

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime;

namespace WorkerRole1
{
    public class WorkerRole : RoleEntryPoint
    {
        public override bool OnStart()
        {
            // The local resource declaration must have been added to the
            // service definition file for the role named WorkerRole1:
            //
            // <LocalResources>
            //    <LocalStorage name="CustomTempLocalStore"
            //                  cleanOnRoleRecycle="false"
            //                  sizeInMB="1024" />
            // </LocalResources>

            string customTempLocalResourcePath =
            RoleEnvironment.GetLocalResource("CustomTempLocalStore").RootPath;
            Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("TMP", customTempLocalResourcePath);
            Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("TEMP", customTempLocalResourcePath);

            // The rest of your startup code goes hereâ€¦

            return base.OnStart();
        }
    }
}
```
