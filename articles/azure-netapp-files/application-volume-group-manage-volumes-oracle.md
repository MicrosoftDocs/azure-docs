# Manage volumes in an application volume group for Oracle

You can manage a volume from its volume group. You can resize, delete, or change throughput for the volume. 

## Steps

1. From your NetApp account, select **Application volume groups**.   
    Select a volume group to display the volumes in the group. 

2. Select the volume you want to resize, delete, or change throughput. The volume overview will be displayed. 

3. From **Volume Overview**, you can select:

    * **Edit**    
        You can change individual volume properties:
        * Protocol type
        * Hide snapshot path
        * Snapshot policy
        * Unix permissions

        > [!NOTE] 
        > Changing the protocol type involves reconfiguration at the Linux host. When using dNFS, it's not recommended to mix volumes using NFSv3 and NFSv4.1.  

        > [!NOTE] 
        > Using Azure NetApp Files built-in automated snapshots doesn't create database consistent backups. Instead, use data protection software such as [AzAcSnap](azacsnap-introduction.md), [SnapCenter](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/protect-azure/protect-applications-azure-netapp-files.html), or other [validated partner solutions](../storage/solution-integration/validated-partners/backup-archive-disaster-recovery/partner-overview.md) that support snapshot-based data protection for Oracle. 

    * **Change Throughput**   
        You can adapt the throughput of the volume.
