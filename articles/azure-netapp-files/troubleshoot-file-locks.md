# Troubleshoot file locks on an Azure NetApp Files volume

In case you encounter (stale) file locks on NFS, SMB, or dual-protocol volumes that need to be cleared, Azure NetApp Files allows you to break these locks.

You can break file locks for all files in a volume or break all file locks initiated by a specified client. Breaking file locks may be disruptive.   

## Break file locks

1. Navigate to the volume you want to break file locks on. In the **Volume** menu under **Support & Troubleshooting**, navigate to **Break File Locks**. 
1. To break file locks for a specific client connected to a volume, enter an IP address in the **Client IP**. To break file locks for all clients connected to a volume, leave the **Client IP** field empty.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > It is your responsibility to provide the _correct_ client IP address. 

1. Select **Break File Locks**.
