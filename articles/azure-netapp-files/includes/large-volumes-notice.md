# Customer intent: As a cloud administrator, I want to understand the volume quota options for Azure NetApp Files, so that I can select the appropriate volume size and ensure compliance with regional capacity requirements.

Regular volumes quotas are between 50 GiB and 100 TiB. Large volume quotas range from 50 TiB to 1 PiB in size. If you intend for the volume quota to fall in the large volume range, select **Yes**. Volume quotas are entered in GiB.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Before using large volumes, you must first [register the feature](../large-volumes-requirements-considerations.md#register-the-feature) and request [an increase in regional capacity quota](../azure-netapp-files-resource-limits.md#request-limit-increase).
>
>Regular volumes cannot be converted to large volumes. Large volumes can't be resized to less than 50 TiB. To understand the requirements and considerations of large volumes, see [Requirements and considerations for large volumes](../large-volumes-requirements-considerations.md). For other limits, see [Resource limits](../azure-netapp-files-resource-limits.md#resource-limits).

* **Breakthrough mode**

    If you're using breakthrough mode to increase throughput, select the box.

    You must first be registered to use breakthrough mode. For registration and other considerations, see [breakthrough mode](../large-volumes-requirements-considerations.md#register-for-breakthrough-mode).
