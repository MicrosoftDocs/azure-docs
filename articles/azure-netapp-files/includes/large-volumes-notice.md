Regular volumes quotas are between 50 GiB and 100 TiB. Large volume quotas range from 50 TiB to 1 PiB in size. If you intend for the volume quota to fall in the large volume range, select **Yes**. Volume quotas are entered in GiB.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If this is your first time using large volumes, you must first [register the feature](../large-volumes-requirements-considerations.md#register-the-feature) and request [an increase in regional capacity quota](../azure-netapp-files-resource-limits.md#request-limit-increase).
>
>Regular volumes cannot be converted to large volumes. Large volumes can't be resized to less than 50 TiB. To understand the requirements and considerations of large volumes, see [Requirements and considerations for large volumes](../large-volumes-requirements-considerations.md). For other limits, see [Resource limits](../azure-netapp-files-resource-limits.md#resource-limits).
