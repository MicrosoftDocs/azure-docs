>[!IMPORTANT]
> Large volumes are currently in preview. If this is your first time using large volumes, you must first [register the feature](../azure-netapp-files-understand-storage-hierarchy.md#large-volumes) and request [an increase in regional capacity quota](../azure-netapp-files-resource-limits.md#request-limit-increase).
>
>Volumes are considered large if they are between 50 TiB and 500 TiB in size. Regular volumes cannot be converted to large volumes. Large volumes cannot be resized to less than 50 TiB. To understand the requirements and considerations of large volumes, refer to for using [Requirements and considerations for large volumes](../large-volumes-requirements-considerations.md).
