# azure-netapp-files/replication.md
# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to understand Azure NetApp Files volume replication across different regional pairs, so that I can plan and implement resilient data storage solutions for multi-region applications.

Azure NetApp Files volume replication is supported between various [Azure regional pairs](../../reliability/cross-region-replication-azure.md#paired-regions) and nonstandard pairs. Azure NetApp Files volume replication is currently available between the following regions.

Snapshot policies and replication schedules influence the number of snapshots. Snapshot policies and replication schedules, combined with the amount of data that changes between snapshots, influence the size of snapshots.
