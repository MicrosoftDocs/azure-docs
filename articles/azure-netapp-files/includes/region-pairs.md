# azure-netapp-files/replication.md
# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to understand Azure NetApp Files volume replication across different regional pairs, so that I can plan and implement resilient data storage solutions for multi-region applications.

> There can be a discrepancy in the size and number of snapshots between the source and the destination. This discrepancy is expected. Snapshot policies and replication schedules influence the number of snapshots. Snapshot policies and replication schedules, combined with the amount of data that changes between snapshots, influence the size of snapshots.
