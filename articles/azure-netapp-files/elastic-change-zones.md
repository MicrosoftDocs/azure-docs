# Change availability zones for Elastic zone-redundant capacity pools in Azure NetApp Files

With Elastic zone-redundant storage, you can easily change the availability zone of a capacity pool and its volumes based on needs, for example co-locating storage in the same availability zone to reduce latency.

>[!NOTE]
>Capacity pools fail over to a new zone automatically in the event of a zone outage. 

## Considerations

* Manually changing the availability zone for a capacity pool can be a long-running operation. 
* Change the availability zone for an Elastic zone-redundant capacity pool changes it for all volumes in the pool. You can't change the availability zone of individual volumes.
