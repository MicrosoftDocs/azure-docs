# Create a NetApp account

Creating a NetApp account enables you to set up a capacity pool so that you can create a volume. You use the Azure NetApp Files pane to create a new NetApp account.

## Before you begin

You must register your subscription for using the NetApp Resource Provider. For more information, see [Register the NetApp Resource Provider](azure-netapp-files-register.md).

## Steps

1. Log into the Azure portal.
1. Access the Azure NetApp Files pane by using one of the following methods:
   * Search for **Azure NetApp Files** in the Azure portal search box.
   * Select **All services** in the navigation, and then filter to Azure NetApp Files.

   To make the Azure NetApp Files pane a favorite, select the star icon next to it.

1. Select **+ Add** to create a new NetApp account.
   The **New NetApp account** window appears.

1. Provide the following information for your NetApp account:
   * **Account name**: Specify a unique name for the subscription.
   * **Subscription**: Select a subscription from your existing subscriptions.
   * **Resource group**: Use an existing resource group or create a new one.
   * **Location**: Select the region where you want the account and its child resources to be located.

1. Select **Create**.
   The NetApp account you created now appears in the Azure NetApp Files pane.

> [!NOTE]
> If you didn't register your subscription for using the NetApp Resource Provider, you receive the following error when you try to create the first NetApp account:
>
> `{"code":"DeploymentFailed","message":"At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list deployment operations for details. Please see https://aka.ms/arm-debug for usage details.","details":[{"code":"NotFound","message":"{\r\n \"error\": {\r\n \"code\": \"InvalidResourceType\",\r\n \"message\": \"The resource type could not be found in the namespace 'Microsoft.NetApp' for api version '20xx-xx-xx'.\"\r\n }\r\n}"}]}`
