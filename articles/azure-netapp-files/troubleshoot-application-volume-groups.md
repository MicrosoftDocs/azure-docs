# Troubleshoot application volume group errors for Azure NetApp Files

This article describes errors or warnings you might experience when using application volume groups and suggests possible remedies.

## Application volume group for SAP HANA 

|     Error Message    |     Resolution    |
|-|-|
| Out of storage capacity when creating a volume group with close proximity to compute. <br> Error message: `No storage available with network locality that matches the provided Proximity Placement Group.`  |  The error indicates that there are insufficient resources available under the user-provided proximity placement group (PPG). <br> You should use the SAP HANA pinning process by using the **[SAP HANA VM pinning request form](https://aka.ms/HANAPINNING)** to ensure that enough resources are available. |
|  Deployment failed with error message: <br> `Template parameter Token type is not valid. Expected 'Integer'. Actual 'Float'.`  |   When application volume group calculates the size, it will show the values for all volumes in the **Volumes** tab. For very small HANA systems, some of the volumes are displayed as floating point values. The deployment will fail if the final size is not an integer GB number. <br> If you look into volume details for these volumes, the floating point values will be rounded automatically to integer to avoid this deployment error. |
