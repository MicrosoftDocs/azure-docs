# Understand lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) basics in Azure NetApp Files

Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) is a standard directory access protocol that was developed by an international committee called the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). LDAP is intended to provide a general-purpose, network-based directory service that you can use across heterogeneous platforms to locate network objects. 

LDAP models define how to communicate with the LDAP directory store, how to find an object in the directory, how to describe the objects in the store, and the security that is used to access the directory. LDAP allows customization and extension of the objects that are described in the store. Therefore, you can use an LDAP store to store many types of diverse information. Many of the initial LDAP deployments focused on the use of LDAP as a directory store for applications such as email and web applications and to store employee information. Many companies are replacing or have replaced Network Information Service (NIS) with LDAP as a network directory store.

An LDAP server provides UNIX user and group identities for use with NAS volumes. In Azure NetApp Files, Active Directory is the only currently supported LDAP server that can be used. This support includes both Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and Microsoft Entra Domain Services.

LDAP requests can be broken down into two main operations.

* **LDAP binds** are logins to the LDAP server from an LDAP client. The bind is used to authenticate to the LDAP server with read-only access to perform LDAP lookups. Azure NetApp Files acts as an LDAP client.   
* **LDAP lookups** are used to query the directory for user and group information, such as names, numeric IDs, home directory paths, login shell paths, group memberships and more.

LDAP can store the following information that is used in dual-protocol NAS access:  

* User names
* Group names
* Numeric user IDs (UIDs) and group IDs (GIDs)
* Home directories
* Login shell
* Netgroups, DNS names, and IP addresses
* Group membership

Currently, Azure NetApp Files only uses LDAP for user and group information, not netgroup or host information.

LDAP offers various benefits for your UNIX users and groups as an identity source.

* **LDAP is future-proof.**  
    As more NFS clients add support for NFSv4.x, NFSv4.x ID domains that contain an up-to-date list of users and groups accessible from clients and storage are needed to ensure optimal security and guaranteed access when access is defined. Having an identity-management server that provides one-to-one name mappings for SMB and NFS users alike greatly simplifies life for storage administrators, not just in the present, but for years to come. 
* **LDAP is scalable.**  
    LDAP servers offer the ability to contain millions of user and group objects, and with Microsoft Active Directory, multiple servers can be used to replicate across multiple sites for both performance and resiliency scale. 
* **LDAP is secure.**  
    LDAP offers security in the form of how a storage system can connect to the LDAP server to make requests for user information. LDAP servers offer the following bind levels:
    * Anonymous (disabled by default in Microsoft Active Directory; not supported in Azure NetApp Files)  
    * Simple password (plain text passwords; not supported in Azure NetApp Files)  
    * [Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/sasl-mechanisms/sasl-mechanisms.xhtml#:~:text=The%20Simple%20Authentication%20and%20Security,support%20to%20connection%2Dbased%20protocols.) â€“ Encrypted bind methods including TLS, SSL, Kerberos, and so on. Azure NetApp Files supports LDAP over TLS, LDAP signing (using Kerberos), LDAP over SSL. 
* **LDAP is robust.**  
    NIS, NIS+, and local files offer basic information such UID, GID, password, home directories, and so on. However, LDAP offers those attributes and many more. The additional attributes that LDAP uses makes dual-protocol management much more integrated with LDAP versus NIS. Only LDAP is supported as an external name service for identity management with Azure NetApp Files. 
* **Microsoft Active Directory is built on LDAP.**  
    By default, Microsoft Active Directory uses an LDAP back-end for its user and group entries. However, this LDAP database doesn't contain UNIX style attributes. These attributes are added when the LDAP schema is extended through Identity Management for UNIX (Windows 2003R2 and later), Service for UNIX (Windows 2003 and earlier), or third-party LDAP tools such as *Centrify*. Because Microsoft uses LDAP as a back-end, it makes LDAP the perfect solution for environments that choose to leverage dual-protocol volumes in Azure NetApp Files. 
    > [!NOTE]
    > Azure NetApp Files currently only supports native Microsoft Active Directory for LDAP services.

## LDAP basics in Azure NetApp Files 

The following section discusses the basics of LDAP as it pertains to Azure NetApp Files.

* LDAP information is stored in flat files in an LDAP server and is organized by way of an LDAP schema. You should configure LDAP clients in a way that coordinates their requests and lookups with the schema on the LDAP server.
* LDAP clients initiate queries by way of an LDAP bind, which is essentially a login to the LDAP server using an account that has read access to the LDAP schema. The LDAP bind configuration on the clients is configured to use the security mechanism that is defined by the LDAP server. Sometimes, they're user name and password exchanges in plain text (simple). In other cases, binds are secured through Simple Authentication and Security Layer methods (`sasl`) such as Kerberos or LDAP over TLS. Azure NetApp Files uses the SMB machine account to bind using SASL authentication for the best possible security.
* User and group information that is stored in LDAP is queried by clients by using standard LDAP search requests as defined in [RFC 2307](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2307). In addition, newer mechanisms, such as [RFC 2307bis](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-howard-rfc2307bis-02), allow more streamlined user and group lookups. Azure NetApp Files uses a form of RFC 2307bis for its schema lookups in Windows Active Directory. 
* LDAP servers can store user and group information and netgroup. However, Azure NetApp Files currently can't use netgroup functionality in LDAP on Windows Active Directory.
* LDAP in Azure NetApp Files operates on port 389. This port currently can't be modified to use a custom port, such as port 636 (LDAP over SSL) or port 3268 (Active Directory Global Catalog searches).
* Encrypted LDAP communications can be achieved using [LDAP over TLS](configure-ldap-over-tls.md#considerations) (which operates over port 389) or LDAP signing, both of which can be configured on the Active Directory connection.
* Azure NetApp Files supports LDAP queries that take no longer than 3 seconds to complete. If the LDAP server has many objects, that time out might be exceeded, and authentication requests can fail. In those cases, consider specifying an [LDAP search scope](https://ldap.com/the-ldap-search-operation/) to filter queries for better performance.
* Azure NetApp Files also supports specifying preferred LDAP servers to help accelerate requests. Use this setting if you want to ensure the LDAP server closest to your Azure NetApp Files region is being used.
* If no preferred LDAP server is set, the Active Directory domain name is queried in DNS for LDAP service records to populate the list of LDAP servers available for your region located within that SRV record. You can manually query LDAP service records in DNS from a client using [`nslookup`](/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/verify-srv-dns-records-have-been-created) or [`dig`](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-dig-command-examples-usage-syntax/) commands. 

    For example: 
    ```
    C:\>nslookup
    Default Server:  localhost
    Address:  ::1
    
    > set type=SRV
    > _ldap._tcp.contoso.com.
    
    Server:  localhost
    Address:  ::1
    
    _ldap._tcp.contoso.com   SRV service location:
              priority       = 0
              weight         = 0
              port           = 389
              svr hostname   = oneway.contoso.com
    _ldap._tcp.contoso.com   SRV service location:
              priority       = 0
              weight         = 100
              port           = 389
              svr hostname   = ONEWAY.Contoso.com
    _ldap._tcp.contoso.com   SRV service location:
              priority       = 0
              weight         = 100
              port           = 389
              svr hostname   = oneway.contoso.com
    _ldap._tcp.contoso.com   SRV service location:
              priority       = 0
              weight         = 100
              port           = 389
              svr hostname   = parisi-2019dc.contoso.com
    _ldap._tcp.contoso.com   SRV service location:
              priority       = 0
              weight         = 100
              port           = 389
              svr hostname   = contoso.com
    oneway.contoso.com       internet address = x.x.x.x
    ONEWAY.Contoso.com       internet address = x.x.x.x
    oneway.contoso.com       internet address = x.x.x.x
    parisi-2019dc.contoso.com        internet address = y.y.y.y
    contoso.com      internet address = x.x.x.x
    contoso.com      internet address = y.y.y.y
    ```
* LDAP servers can also be used to perform custom name mapping for users. For more information, see [Understand name mapping using LDAP](lightweight-directory-access-protocol-name-mapping.md). 
* LDAP query time outs 

    By default, LDAP queries time out if they can't be completed. If an LDAP query fails due to a time out, the user and/or group lookup fails, and access to the Azure NetApp Files volume may be denied, depending on the permission settings of the volume. Refer to [Create and manage Active Directory connections](create-active-directory-connections.md#ldap-query-timeouts) to understand Azure NetApp Files LDAP query time out settings.
