# Understand cross-zone-region replication in Azure NetApp Files

Azure NetApp Files supports using cross-zone and cross-region replication on the same source volume. With this added layer of protection, you can protect your volumes with a second protection volume in the following combinations:

* Cross-region andâ€‹ cross-zone replication target volumes

* Two cross-region replication target volumes

* Two cross-zone replication target volumes in any combination of availability zones, including in-zone replication

## Requirements 

* Cross-zone-region replication adheres to the same requirements as [cross-zone replication](cross-zone-replication-requirements-considerations.md) and [cross-region replication](cross-region-replication-requirements-considerations.md).

* If you use cross-region replication, you must adhere to supported [cross-region replication pairs](#supported-region-pairs).

* Cross-zone-region replication can be performed under a single subscription or [across subscriptions](cross-region-replication-create-peering.md#register-for-cross-subscription-replication).
