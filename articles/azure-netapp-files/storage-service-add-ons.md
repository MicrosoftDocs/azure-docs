# Storage service add-ons for Azure NetApp Files

The **Storage service add-ons** portal menu of Azure NetApp Files provides a “launching pad” for available third-party, ecosystem add-ons to the Azure NetApp Files storage service. 

## Access storage service add-ons  

When you select a category (for example, **NetApp add-ons**) under **Storage service add-ons**, the portal displays tiles for available add-ons in that category. Selecting an add-on tile in the category takes you to a landing page for quick access of that add-on and directs you to the add-on installation page.
