# Customer intent: As a cloud administrator, I want to restore a backup to a new volume in Azure NetApp Files, so that I can recover data without affecting existing volumes while ensuring proper capacity and protocol settings are maintained.

# Restore a backup to a new volume

When you restore a backup, a new volume is created using the same protocol type as the original. This article explains how to perform a restore.

## Considerations

* You can restore backups only within the same NetApp account. Restoring backups across NetApp accounts isn't supported. 

* You can restore backups to a different capacity pool within the same NetApp account.

* You can restore a backup only to a new volume. You can't overwrite the existing volume with the backup. 

* The new volume created by the restore operation can't be mounted until the restore completes. 

* You should trigger the restore operation when there are no baseline backups. Otherwise, the restore might increase the load on the Azure Blob account where your data is backed up. 

* For volumes greater than 10 TiB, it can take multiple hours to transfer all the data from the backup media.

* When restoring a [large volume](large-volumes.md), the new volume must also be a large volume. When restoring a regular volume, the new volume must also be a regular volume. 

* Restoring a backup to a new volume isn't dependent on the networking type used by the source volume. You can restore the backup of a volume configured with Basic networking to a volume configured with Standard networking and vice versa.

* In the Volume overview page, refer to the **Originated from** field to see the name of the snapshot used to create the volume. 

* See [Restoring volume backups from vaulted snapshots](snapshots-introduction.md#restoring-volume-backups-from-vaulted-snapshots) for more information. 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Running multiple concurrent volume restores using Azure NetApp Files backup may increase the time it takes for each individual, in-progress restore to complete. If time is a factor, prioritize and sequentialize the most important volume first. Wait until the restore operations complete before starting lower priority volume restores.  

See [Requirements and considerations for Azure NetApp Files backup](backup-requirements-considerations.md) for more considerations about using Azure NetApp Files backup. See [Resource limits for Azure NetApp Files](azure-netapp-files-resource-limits.md) for information about minimums and maximums. 

## Steps

>[!IMPORTANT]
>All backups must be migrated to backup vaults. You are unable to perform any operation on or with a backup until you have migrated the backup to a backup vault. For more information about this procedure, see [Manage backup vaults](backup-vault-manage.md).

1. Select **Backup Vault**. Navigate to **Backups**.

2. From the backup list, select the backup to restore. Select the three dots (`â€¦`) to the right of the backup, then select **Restore to new volume** from the Action menu.

3. In the Create a Volume page, provide information for the fields in the page as applicable. 

    * The **Protocol** field is pre-populated from the original volume and cannot be changed.    
        If you restore a volume from the backup list at the NetApp account level, you must specify the protocol. The **Protocol** field must match the protocol of the original volume. Otherwise, the restore operation fails with the following error:  
        `Protocol Type value mismatch between input and source volume of backupId <backup-id of the selected backup>. Supported protocol type : <Protocol Type of the source volume>`

    * The **Quota** value must be **at least 20% greater** than the size of the backup from which the restore is triggered. Once the restore is complete, the volume can be resized depending on the size used. 

    * The **Capacity pool** that the backup is restored into must have sufficient unused capacity to host the new restored volume. Otherwise, the restore operation fails.

    Select **Review + Create** to begin restoring the backup to a new volume.

4. The Volumes page displays the new volume. In the Volumes page, the **Originated from** field identifies the name of the snapshot used to create the volume.
