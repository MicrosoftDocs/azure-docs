# Troubleshoot capacity pool errors

This article describes resolutions to issues you might have when managing capacity pools, including the pool change operation. 

## Issues managing a capacity pool 

|     Error condition    |     Resolution    |
|-|-|
| Issues creating a capacity pool |  Make sure that the capacity pool count doesn't exceed the limit. See [Resource limits for Azure NetApp Files](azure-netapp-files-resource-limits.md). If the count is less than the limit and you still experience issues, file a support ticket and specify the capacity pool name. |
| Issues deleting a capacity pool  |  Make sure that you remove all Azure NetApp Files volumes and snapshots in the subscription where you're trying to delete the capacity pool. <br> If you already removed all volumes and snapshots and you still can't delete the capacity pool, references to resources might still exist without showing in the portal. In this case, file a support ticket, and specify that you've performed the above recommended steps. |
| Volume creation or modification fails with `Requested throughput not available` error | Available throughput for a volume is determined by its capacity poolâ€™s size and the service level. If you do not have sufficient throughput, you should increase the pool size or adjust the existing volume throughput. | 

## Issues when changing the capacity pool of a volume 

|     Error condition    |     Resolution    |
|-|-|
| The capacity pool size is too small for total volume size. |  The error is a result of the destination capacity pool not having the available capacity for the volume being moved. <br> Increase the size of the destination pool, or choose another pool that is larger. See [Resize a capacity pool or a volume](azure-netapp-files-resize-capacity-pools-or-volumes.md). |
|  The pool change cannot be completed because a volume called `'{source pool name}'` already exists in the target pool `'{target pool name}'` | This error occurs because the volume with same name already exists in the target capacity pool. Select another capacity pool that doesn't have a volume with same name. | 
| Error changing volume's pool. Pool: `'{target pool name}'` not available or does not exit | You can't change a volume's capacity pool when the destination capacity pool isn't healthy. Check the status of the destination capacity pool. If the pool is in a failed state (not "Succeeded"), try performing an update on the capacity pool by adding a tag name and value pair, then save. |
| Cannot change the volume's pool because the selected pool is the same as the existing pool: `'{Pool Name}'` | Confirm you're moving the volume to the correct destination capacity pool and try again. |
| Cannot change a volume from a Double Encrypted Pool to a Single Encrypted Pool or from a Single Encrypted Pool to a Double Encrypted Pool | The destination pool must be of the same encryption type as the source pool. |

## Issues for double-encryption capacity pools  

|     Error condition    |     Resolution    |
|-|-|
| Out of storage capacity when creating or resizing volumes under double-encryption capacity pools: `There are currently insufficient resources available to create [or extend] a volume in this region. Please retry the operation. If the problem persists, contact Support.` |  The error indicates insufficient resources in the region to support hardware-level data encryption. Retry the operation after some time. Resources may have been freed in the cluster, region, or zone in the interim. |
