# Search backups of Azure NetApp Files volumes

The names used for snapshots are preserved when the snapshots are backed up. Snapshot names include the prefix `daily`, `weekly`, or `monthly`. They also include the timestamp when the snapshot was created.

If a volume is deleted, its backups are retained. The backups are listed in the associated backup vault, under the **Backups** section. This list includes all backups within the backup vault in the region. It can be used to restore a backup to a volume in another NetApp account under the same subscription.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>All existing backups must be migrated to backup vaults. You can search for backups, but you are unable to perform any operations on a backup until the backup has been migrated to a backup vault. For more information about this procedure, see [Manage a backup vault](backup-vault-manage.md).

## Search backups from backup vault 

1. Select **Backups**.
1. In the **Search Backups** field, enter the backup name that you want to search for.  

    A partial search is supported; you don’t have to specify the entire backup name. The search filters the backups based on the search string.

## Search backups at volume level 

You can display and search backups at the volume level:

1. Select **Volumes**.

1. If you have migrated to a backup vault, navigate to **Backup Vault**. Select the backup vault.
    If you have not yet migrated to a backup vault, navigate to **Backups**.   
    The **Type** column shows whether the backup is generated by a *Scheduled* (policy-based) or a *manual* backup.

3. In the **Search Backups** field, enter the backup name that you want to search for.  

    A partial search is supported; you don’t have to specify the entire backup name. The search filters the backups based on the search string.
