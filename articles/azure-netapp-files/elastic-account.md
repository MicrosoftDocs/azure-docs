# Create a NetApp Elastic account in Azure NetApp Files (preview)

Creating a NetApp account enables you to set up a capacity pool so that you can create a volume. You use the Azure NetApp Files pane to create a new NetApp account.

## Before you begin

* You must register your subscription for using the NetApp Resource Provider. For more information, see [Register the NetApp Resource Provider](azure-netapp-files-register.md).
* There are two types of NetApp accounts. If you plan to use Elastic zone-redundant storage, you must use a [NetApp Elastic account](elastic-zone-redundant-concept.md).

## Register for the Elastic zone-redundant storage

Elastic zone-redundant storage is currently in preview. To register for Elastic zone-redundant storage, submit a [waitlist request](https://forms.cloud.microsoft/r/RcEfunRDrz). If you plan to use backups with Elastic zone-redundant storage, you must note that in the waitlist request.  

Waitlists requests are reviewed weekly. An Azure NetApp Files representative will contact you after your request has been reviewed. 

## Create an Elastic account

1. Access the Azure NetApp Files pane by using one of the following methods:
   * Search for **Azure NetApp Files** in the Azure portal search box.
