# Create an SMB volume for Azure NetApp Files

Azure NetApp Files supports creating volumes using NFS (NFSv3 and NFSv4.1), SMB3, or dual protocol (NFSv3 and SMB). A volume's capacity consumption counts against its pool's provisioned capacity. 

This article shows you how to create an SMB3 volume. For NFS volumes, see [Create an NFS volume](azure-netapp-files-create-volumes.md). For dual-protocol volumes, see [Create a dual-protocol volume](create-volumes-dual-protocol.md).

## Before you begin 

* You must have already set up a capacity pool. See [Set up a capacity pool](azure-netapp-files-set-up-capacity-pool.md).     
* A subnet must be delegated to Azure NetApp Files. See [Delegate a subnet to Azure NetApp Files](azure-netapp-files-delegate-subnet.md).

## Configure Active Directory connections 

Before creating an SMB volume, you need to create an Active Directory connection. If you haven't configured Active Directory connections for Azure NetApp files, follow instructions described in [Create and manage Active Directory connections](create-active-directory-connections.md).

## Add an SMB volume

1. Click the **Volumes** blade from the Capacity Pools blade. 

    ![Navigate to Volumes](../media/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-navigate-to-volumes.png)

2. Click **+ Add volume** to create a volume.  
    The Create a Volume window appears.

3. In the Create a Volume window, click **Create** and provide information for the following fields under the Basics tab:   
    * **Volume name**      
        Specify the name for the volume that you are creating.   

        A volume name must be unique within each capacity pool. It must be at least three characters long. You can use any alphanumeric characters.   

        You can't use `default` or `bin` as the volume name.

    * **Capacity pool**  
        Specify the capacity pool where you want the volume to be created.

    * **Quota**  
        Specify the amount of logical storage that is allocated to the volume.  

        The **Available quota** field shows the amount of unused space in the chosen capacity pool that you can use towards creating a new volume. The size of the new volume must not exceed the available quota.  

    * **Throughput (MiB/S)**   
        If the volume is created in a manual QoS capacity pool, specify the throughput you want for the volume.   

        If the volume is created in an auto QoS capacity pool, the value displayed in this field is (quota x service level throughput).   

    * **Virtual network**  
        Specify the Azure virtual network (VNet) from which you want to access the volume.  

        The VNet you specify must have a subnet delegated to Azure NetApp Files. The Azure NetApp Files service can be accessed only from the same VNet or from a VNet that is in the same region as the volume through VNet peering. You can also access the volume from  your on-premises network through Express Route.   

    * **Subnet**  
        Specify the subnet that you want to use for the volume.  
        The subnet you specify must be delegated to Azure NetApp Files. 
        
        If you haven't delegated a subnet, you can click **Create new** on the Create a Volume page. Then in the Create Subnet page, specify the subnet information, and select **Microsoft.NetApp/volumes** to delegate the subnet for Azure NetApp Files. In each VNet, only one subnet can be delegated to Azure NetApp Files.

        ![Create subnet](../media/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-create-subnet.png)

    * If you want to apply an existing snapshot policy to the volume, click **Show advanced section** to expand it, specify whether you want to hide the snapshot path, and select a snapshot policy in the pull-down menu. 

        For information about creating a snapshot policy, see [Manage snapshot policies](azure-netapp-files-manage-snapshots.md#manage-snapshot-policies).

        ![Show advanced selection](../media/azure-netapp-files/volume-create-advanced-selection.png)

4. Click **Protocol** and complete the following information:  
    * Select **SMB** as the protocol type for the volume. 
    * Select your **Active Directory** connection from the drop-down list.
    * Specify the name of the shared volume in  **Share name**.
    * If you want to enable encryption for SMB3, select **Enable SMB3 Protocol Encryption**.   
        This feature enables encryption for in-flight SMB3 data. SMB clients not using SMB3 encryption will not be able to access this volume.  Data at rest is encrypted regardless of this setting.  
        See [SMB Encryption FAQs](azure-netapp-files-faqs.md#smb-encryption-faqs) for additional information. 

        The **SMB3 Protocol Encryption** feature is currently in preview. If this is your first time using this feature, register the feature before using it: 

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        Register-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFSMBEncryption
        ```

        Check the status of the feature registration: 

        > [!NOTE]
        > The **RegistrationState** may be in the `Registering` state for up to 60 minutes before changing to`Registered`. Wait until the status is `Registered` before continuing.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFSMBEncryption
        ```
        
        You can also use [Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/feature?preserve-view=true&view=azure-cli-latest) `az feature register` and `az feature show` to register the feature and display the registration status.  
    * If you want to enable Continuous Availability for the SMB volume, select **Enable Continuous Availability**.    

        > [!IMPORTANT]   
        > The SMB Continuous Availability feature is currently in public preview. You need to submit a waitlist request for accessing the feature through the **[Azure NetApp Files SMB Continuous Availability Shares Public Preview waitlist submission page](https://aka.ms/anfsmbcasharespreviewsignup)**. Wait for an official confirmation email from the Azure NetApp Files team before using the Continuous Availability feature.   
        > 
        > You should enable Continuous Availability only for SQL Server and [FsLogix User Profile Containers](../virtual-desktop/create-fslogix-profile-container.md). Using SMB Continuous Availability shares for workloads other than SQL Server and FsLogix User Profile Containers is *not* supported. This feature is currently supported on Windows SQL Server. Linux SQL Server is not currently supported. If you are using a non-administrator (domain) account to install SQL Server, ensure that the account has the required security privilege assigned. If the domain account does not have the required security privilege (`SeSecurityPrivilege`), and the privilege cannot be set at the domain level, you can grant the privilege to the account by using the **Security privilege users** field of Active Directory connections. See [Create an Active Directory connection](create-active-directory-connections.md#create-an-active-directory-connection).

    <!-- [1/13/21] Commenting out command-based steps below, because the plan is to use form-based (URL) registration, similar to CRR feature registration -->
    <!-- 
        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        Register-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFSMBCAShare
        ```

        Check the status of the feature registration: 

        > [!NOTE]
        > The **RegistrationState** may be in the `Registering` state for up to 60 minutes before changing to`Registered`. Wait until the status is `Registered` before continuing.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFSMBCAShare
        ```
        
        You can also use [Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/feature?preserve-view=true&view=azure-cli-latest) `az feature register` and `az feature show` to register the feature and display the registration status.

5. Click **Review + Create** to review the volume details.  Then click **Create** to create the SMB volume.

    The volume you created appears in the Volumes page. 
 
    A volume inherits subscription, resource group, location attributes from its capacity pool. To monitor the volume deployment status, you can use the Notifications tab.

## Control access to an SMB volume  

Access to an SMB volume is managed through permissions.  

### Share permissions  

By default, a new volume has the **Everyone / Full Control** share permissions. Members of the Domain Admins group can change the share permissions as follows:  

1. Map the share to a drive.  
2. Right-click the drive, select **Properties**, then go to the **Security** tab.

[ ![Set share permissions](../media/azure-netapp-files/set-share-permissions.png)](../media/azure-netapp-files/set-share-permissions.png#lightbox)

### NTFS file and folder permissions  

You can set permissions for a file or folder by using the **Security** tab of the object's properties in the Windows SMB client.
