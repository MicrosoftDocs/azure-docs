Open the Azure Portal using the special URL:  [https://aka.ms/arcdata](https://aka.ms/arcdata).

Search for your data controller by name in the search bar and click on it.

For now, there are not many things that you can do here.  The 'New database' option is not functional by design.  More options will be added here in future releases.
