# Use the AI Toolkit for Azure IoT Edge

[!INCLUDE [workbench-deprecated](../../../includes/aml-deprecating-preview-2017.md)] 

Bring the power of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced analytics to the edge. With the AI Toolkit for Azure IoT Edge, you can deploy AI and machine learning where your data lives. Operationalize your model as a Docker container with a REST API, and then push the model to an edge device with Azure IoT Hub. AI Toolkit for Azure IoT Edge brings intelligence, elastic compute, and the power of the cloud to places with limited, intermittent, or no connectivity.

The AI Toolkit for Azure IoT Edge is a collection of scripts, code, and deployable containers. Examples include predictive maintenance, image classification, and speech processing, as well as custom model deployment through Azure Machine Learning and Azure IoT Hub. Models included with the toolkit may be used as-is, but all source code and data are available for developers to customize based on their needs.

The AI Toolkit for Azure IoT Edge public GitHub repository can be found at [aka.ms/AI-toolkit](http://aka.ms/AI-toolkit).
