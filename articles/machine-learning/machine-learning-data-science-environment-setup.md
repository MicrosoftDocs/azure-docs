# Set up data science environments for use in the Cortana Analytics Process

The Cortana Analytics Process uses a variety of data science environments for the storage, processing and analysis of data. They includes Azure Blob Storage, several types of Azure virtual machines, HDInsight (Hadoop) clusters, and Azure Machine Learning workspaces. The decision about which environment to use depends on the type and quantity of data to be modeled with machine learning, and the target destination for that data in the cloud. 

* For guidance on the questions to consider when making this decision, see [Plan Your Azure Machine Learning Data Science Environment](machine-learning-data-science-plan-your-environment.md). 
* For a catalog of some of the scenarios you might encounter when doing advanced analytics, see [Scenarios for the Advanced Analytics Process and Technology in Azure Machine Learning](machine-learning-data-science-plan-sample-scenarios.md)

This menu links to topics that describe how to set up the various data science environments used by the Cortana Analytics Process (CAPS).
