| Create a Data Processing Flow from Business Requirements                                  | [Determining the Question, following the TDSP](https://buckwoody.wordpress.com/2017/08/31/the-keys-to-effective-data-science-projects-the-question/) | With the development environment installed and configured, and the understanding of the technologies and processes in place, it’s time to put everything together using the TDSP to perform an analysis. We need to start by defining the question, selecting the data sources, and the rest of the steps in the Team Data Science Process. Keep in mind the DevOps process as we work through this process. In this article, you learn how to take the requirements from your organization and create a data flow map through your application to define your solution using the Team Data Science Process.
