#Explore data in the Team Data Science Process

This document covers how to explore data in four different environments typically used in the Team Data Science Process:

- **Azure blob container** data is explored using the [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) Python package.
- **SQL Server data** data is explored by using SQL and by using a programming language like Python.
- **Hive table** data is explored using Hive queries.
- **Azure Machine Learning (AML) Studio** data is explored using AML modules.

This **menu** links to the topics that describe how to use these tools to explore data from various storage environments.
