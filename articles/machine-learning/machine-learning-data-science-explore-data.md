# Explore data in the Team Data Science Process
This document covers how to explore data in four different storage environments that are typically used in the Data Science Process:

* **Azure blob container** data is explored using the [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) Python package.
* **SQL Server** data is explored by using SQL and by using a programming language like Python.
* **Hive table** data is explored using Hive queries.
* **Azure Machine Learning (AML) Studio** data is explored using AML modules.

The following **menu** links to the topics that describe how to use these tools to explore data from various storage environments.
