#Explore data in the Cortana Analytics Process

This **menu** links to topics that describe how to use tools to explore data from various storage environments. This task is a step in the Cortana Analytics Process (CAP).

[AZURE.INCLUDE [cap-explore-data-selector](../../includes/cap-explore-data-selector.md)]

This document covers how to explore data that is stored three locations typically used in the Cortana Analytics Process:

- **Azure blob container data** is is explored using the [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) Python package.
- **SQL Server data** is explored by using SQL and by using a programming language like Python.
- **Hive table data** is explored using Hive queries.
