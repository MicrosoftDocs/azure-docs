## Transcript

Welcome to "Is your data is ready for data science?"" the second video in the series *Data Science for Beginners*.  

Before data science can give you the answers you want, you have to give it some high quality raw materials to work with. Just like making a pizza, the better the ingredients you start with, the better the final product.

## Criteria for data

So, in the case of data science, there are some ingredients that we need to pull together.

We need data that is:
  *	Relevant
  *	Connected
  *	Accurate
  *	Enough

## Is your data relevant?

So the first ingredient - we need data that's relevant.

Look at the table on the left. We met seven people outside of Boston bars, measured their blood alcohol level, the Red Sox’ batting average in their last game, and the price of milk in the nearest convenience store.

This is all perfectly legitimate data. It’s only fault is that it isn’t relevant. There's no obvious relationship between these numbers. If I gave you the current price of milk and the Red Sox batting average, there's no way you could guess my blood alcohol content.

Now look at the table on the right. This time we measured each person’s body mass and counted the number of drinks they’ve had.  The numbers in each row are now relevant to each other. If I gave you my body mass and the number of margaritas I've had, you could make a guess at my blood alcohol content.

## Do you have connected data?

The next ingredient is connected data.

Here is some relevant data on the quality of hamburgers: grill temperature, patty weight and rating in the local food magazine. But notice the gaps in the table on the left.
