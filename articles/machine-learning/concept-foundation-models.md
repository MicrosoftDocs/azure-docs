## What is 'Foundation Models in AzureML'?
In recent years, advancements in AI have led to the rise of large foundation models that are trained on a vast quantity of data and that can be easily adapted to a wide variety of applications across various industries. This emerging trend gives rise to a unique opportunity for enterprises to build and use these foundation models in their deep learning workloads.

<br>'Foundation Models in AzureML'<br> provides AzureML native capabilities that enable customers to build and operationalize open-source foundation models at scale. It includes the following capabilities -

* A comprehensive repository of top 30+ language models from Hugging Face, made available in the model catalog via AzureML built-in registry
* Support for base model inferencing using pretrained models
* Ability to finetune the models using your own training data. Finetuning is supported for the following language tasks - Text Classification, Token Classification, Question Answering, Summarization and Translation
* Ability to evaluate the models using your own test data
* State of the art performance and throughput in Azure hardware
