# OpenAI GPT-4V

## Introduction
OpenAI GPT-4V tool enables you to leverage OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision, also referred to as GPT-4V or gpt-4-vision-preview in the API, to take images as input and answer questions about them.

## Prerequisites

- Create OpenAI resources

    Sign up account [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/)
    Login and [Find personal API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

- Get Access to GPT-4 API

    To use GPT-4 with vision, you need access to GPT-4 API. Learn more about [How to get access to GPT-4 API](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7102672-how-can-i-access-gpt-4)

## Connection

Setup connections to provisioned resources in prompt flow.
