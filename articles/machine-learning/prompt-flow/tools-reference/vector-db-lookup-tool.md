# Vector DB Lookup tool (preview)

Vector DB Lookup is a vector search tool that allows users to search top k similar vectors from vector database. This tool is a wrapper for multiple third-party vector databases. The list of current supported databases is as follows.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Azure Cognitive Search | Microsoft's cloud search service with built-in AI capabilities that enrich all types of information to help identify and explore relevant content at scale. |
| Qdrant | Qdrant is a vector similarity search engine that provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search and manage points (i.e. vectors) with an additional payload. |
| Weaviate | Weaviate is an open source vector database that stores both objects and vectors. This allows for combining vector search with structured filtering. |

This tool will support more vector databases.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Prompt flow is currently in public preview. This preview is provided without a service-level agreement, and is not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

The tool searches data from a third-party vector database. To use it, you should create resources in advance and establish connection between the tool and the resource.

  - **Azure Cognitive Search:**
    - Create resource [Azure Cognitive Search](../../../search/search-create-service-portal.md).
    - Add "Cognitive search" connection. Fill "API key" field with "Primary admin key" from "Keys" section of created resource, and fill "API base" field with the URL, the URL format is `https://{your_serive_name}.search.windows.net`.

  - **Qdrant:**
    - Follow the [installation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quick-start/) to deploy Qdrant to a self-maintained cloud server.
    - Add "Qdrant" connection. Fill "API base" with your self-maintained cloud server address and fill "API key" field.

  - **Weaviate:**
    - Follow the [installation](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation) to deploy Weaviate to a self-maintained instance.
    - Add "Weaviate" connection. Fill "API base" with your self-maintained instance address and fill "API key" field.

> [!NOTE]
> When legacy tools switching to code first mode, if you encounter "'embeddingstore.tool.vector_db_lookup.search' is not found" error, please refer to the [Troubleshoot Guidance](./troubleshoot-guidance.md).

## Inputs

The tool accepts the following inputs:
- **Azure Cognitive Search:**

  | Name | Type | Description | Required |
  | ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
  | connection | CognitiveSearchConnection | The created connection for accessing to Cognitive Search endpoint. | Yes |
  | index_name | string | The index name created in Cognitive Search resource. | Yes |
  | text_field | string | The text field name. The returned text field will populate the text of output. | No |
  | vector_field | string | The vector field name. The target vector is searched in this vector field. | Yes |
  | search_params | dict | The search parameters. It's key-value pairs. Except for parameters in the tool input list mentioned above, additional search parameters can be formed into a JSON object as search_params. For example, use `{"select": ""}` as search_params to select the returned fields, use `{"search": ""}` to perform a [hybrid search](../../../search/search-get-started-vector.md#hybrid-search). | No |
  | search_filters | dict | The search filters. It's key-value pairs, the input format is like `{"filter": ""}` | No |
  | vector | list | The target vector to be queried, which can be generated by Embedding tool. | Yes |
  | top_k | int | The count of top-scored entities to return. Default value is 3 | No |

  | text_field | string | The text field name. The returned text field will populate the text of output. | No |
  | search_params | dict | The search parameters can be formed into a JSON object as search_params. For example, use `{"params": {"hnsw_ef": 0, "exact": false, "quantization": null}}` to set search_params. | No |
  | search_filters | dict | The search filters. It's key-value pairs, the input format is like `{"filter": {"should": [{"key": "", "match": {"value": ""}}]}}` | No |
  | vector | list | The target vector to be queried, which can be generated by Embedding tool. | Yes |
  | top_k | int | The count of top-scored entities to return. Default value is 3 | No |

- **Weaviate:**

  | Name | Type | Description | Required |
  | ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
  | connection | WeaviateConnection | The created connection for accessing to Weaviate. | Yes |
  | class_name | string | The class name. | Yes |
  | text_field | string | The text field name. The returned text field will populate the text of output. | No |
  | vector | list | The target vector to be queried, which can be generated by Embedding tool. | Yes |
  | top_k | int | The count of top-scored entities to return. Default value is 3 | No |
