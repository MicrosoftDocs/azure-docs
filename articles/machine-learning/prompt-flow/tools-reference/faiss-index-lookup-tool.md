# Faiss Index Lookup tool

Faiss Index Lookup is a tool tailored for querying within a user-provided Faiss-based vector store. In combination with our Large Language Model (LLM) tool, it empowers users to extract contextually relevant information from a domain knowledge base.

## Prerequisites
- Prepare an accessible path on Azure Blob Storage. Here's the guide if a new storage account needs to be created:  [Azure Storage Account](../../../storage/common/storage-account-create.md).
- Create related Faiss-based index files on Azure Blob Storage. We support the LangChain format (index.faiss + index.pkl) for the index files, which can be prepared either by employing promptflow-vectordb SDK or following the quick guide from [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/integrations/faiss). Please refer to [the sample notebook for creating Faiss index](https://aka.ms/pf-sample-build-faiss-index) for building index using promptflow-vectordb SDK.
- Based on where you put your own index files, the identity used by the promptflow runtime should be granted with certain roles. Please refer to [Steps to assign an Azure role](../../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps.md):

    | Location | Role |
    | ---- | ---- |
    | workspace datastores or workspace default blob | AzureML Data Scientist |
    | other blobs | Storage Blob Data Reader |
> [!NOTE]
> When legacy tools switching to code first mode, if you encounter "'embeddingstore.tool.faiss_index_lookup.search' is not found" error, please refer to the [Troubleshoot Guidance](./troubleshoot-guidance.md).

## Inputs

The tool accepts the following inputs:

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| path | string | URL or path for the vector store.<br><br>blob URL format:<br>https://`<account_name>`.blob.core.windows.net/`<container_name>`/`<path_and_folder_name>`.<br><br>AML datastore URL format:<br>azureml://subscriptions/`<your_subscription>`/resourcegroups/`<your_resource_group>`/workspaces/`<your_workspace>`/data/`<data_path>`<br><br>relative path to workspace datastore `workspaceblobstore`:<br>`<path_and_folder_name>`<br><br> public http/https URL (for public demonstration):<br>http(s)://`<path_and_folder_name>` | Yes |
| vector | list[float] | The target vector to be queried, which can be generated by the LLM tool. | Yes |
| top_k | integer | The count of top-scored entities to return. Default value is 3. | No |

## Outputs

The following is an example for JSON format response returned by the tool, which includes the top-k scored entities. The entity follows a generic schema of vector search result provided by promptflow-vectordb SDK. For the Faiss Index Search, the following fields are populated:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| text | string | Text of the entity |
| score | float |  Distance between the entity and the query vector |
| metadata | dict | Customized key-value pairs provided by user when creating the index |

```json
[
  {
    "metadata": {
      "link": "http://sample_link_0",
      "title": "title0"
    },
    "original_entity": null,
    "score": 0,
    "text": "sample text #0",
    "vector": null
  },
  {
    "metadata": {
      "link": "http://sample_link_1",
      "title": "title1"
    },
    "original_entity": null,
    "score": 0.05000000447034836,
    "text": "sample text #1",
    "vector": null
  },
  {
    "metadata": {
      "link": "http://sample_link_2",
      "title": "title2"
    },
    "original_entity": null,
    "score": 0.20000001788139343,
    "text": "sample text #2",
    "vector": null
  }
]

```
