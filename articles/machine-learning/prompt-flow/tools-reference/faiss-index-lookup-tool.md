# Faiss Index Lookup tool (preview)

Faiss Index Lookup is a tool tailored for querying within a user-provided Faiss-based vector store. In combination with our Large Language Model (LLM) tool, it empowers users to extract contextually relevant information from a domain knowledge base.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Prompt flow is currently in public preview. This preview is provided without a service-level agreement, and are not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.

## Requirements

- embeddingstore==0.0.93026209 --extra-index-url https://azuremlsdktestpypi.azureedge.net/embeddingstore

## Prerequisites

- Prepare an accessible path on Azure Blob Storage. Here's the guide if a new storage account needs to be created:  [Azure Storage Account](../../../storage/common/storage-account-create.md).
- Create related Faiss-based index files on Azure Blob Storage. We support the LangChain format (index.faiss + index.pkl) for the index files, which can be prepared either by employing our EmbeddingStore SDK or following the quick guide from [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/integrations/faiss). Refer to the instructions of `Vector DB QnA Step 1` for building index using EmbeddingStore SDK.
- The identity used by the Prompt flow runtime should be granted with certain roles to access the vector store, based on which kind of path you provide. Refer to [Steps to assign an Azure role](../.../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps.md):
  - Workspace relative path, blob url on workspace default storage, and AML Datastore url: `AzureML Data Scientist`
  - Other blob urls: `Storage Blob Data Reader role`

## Inputs

The tool accepts the following inputs:

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| path | string | blob/datastore url or workspace relative path for the vector store.<br><br>blob url format:<br>https://`<account_name>`.blob.core.windows.net/`<container_name>`/`<path_and_folder_name>`.<br><br>AML datastore url format:<br>azureml://subscriptions/`<your_subscription>`/resourcegroups/`<your_resource_group>`/workspaces/`<your_workspace>`/data/`<data_path>`<br><br>relative path to workspace datastore `workspaceblobstore`:<br>`<path_and_folder_name>` | Yes |
| vector | list[float] | The target vector to be queried, which can be generated by the LLM tool. | Yes |
| top_k | integer | The count of top-scored entities to return. Default value is 3. | No |

## Outputs

The following is an example for JSON format response returned by the tool, which includes the top-k scored entities. The entity follows a generic schema of vector search result provided by our EmbeddingStore SDK. For the Faiss Index Search, the following fields are populated:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| text | string | Text of the entity |
| score | float |  Distance between the entity and the query vector |
| metadata | dict | Customized key-value pairs provided by user when creating the index |


```json

    "metadata": {
