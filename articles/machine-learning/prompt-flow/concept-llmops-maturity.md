> [!TIP]
> Score from [LLMOps Maturity Model Assessment](/assessments/e14e1e9f-d339-4d7e-b2bb-24f056cf08b6/): maturing (10-14).

**Description:** Your organization has started to systematize LLM operations, with a focus on structured development and experimentation. However, there's room for more sophisticated integration and optimization.

To improve your capabilities and skills, learn how to develop more complex prompts and begin integrating them effectively into applications. During this journey, you’ll want to implement a systematic approach for LLM application deployment, possibly exploring CI/CD integration. Once you understand the core, you can begin employing more advanced evaluation metrics like groundedness, relevance, and similarity. Ultimately, you’ll want to focus on content safety and ethical considerations in LLM usage.
