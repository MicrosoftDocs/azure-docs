# Tools in prompt flow?

Tools are the fundamental building blocks of a flow in Azure Machine Learning prompt flow.

Each tool is a simple, executable unit with a specific function, allowing users to perform various tasks.
By combining different tools, users can create a flow that accomplishes a wide range of goals.

One of the key benefit of prompt flow tools is their seamless integration with third-party APIs and python open source packages.
This not only improves the functionality of large language models but also makes the development process more efficient for developers.

## Types of tools

Prompt flow provides different kinds of tools:
- LLM tool: The LLM tool allows you to write custom prompts and leverage large language models to achieve specific goals, such as summarizing articles, generating customer support responses, and more.
- Python tool: The Python tool enables you to write custom Python functions to perform various tasks, such as fetching web pages, processing intermediate data, calling third-party APIs, and more.
- Prompt tool: The prompt tool allows you to prepare a prompt as a string for more complex use cases or for use in conjunction with other prompt tools or python tools.
