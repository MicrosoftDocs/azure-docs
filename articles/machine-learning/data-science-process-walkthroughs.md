# Team Data Science Process walkthroughs

The end-to-end walkthroughs itemized here each demonstrate the steps in the Team Data Science Process for **specific scenarios** and illustrate how to combine cloud and on-premise tools and services into a workflow or pipeline to create an intelligent application.

## Using SQL Server
In [The Team Data Science Process in action: using SQL Server](machine-learning-data-science-process-sql-walkthrough.md)  walkthrough shows you how to build and deploy a machine learning model using SQL Server and a publicly available dataset, the [NYC Taxi Trips](http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/) dataset


## Using HDInsight Hadoop clusters
In [The Team Data Science Process in action: using HDInsight Hadoop clusters](machine-learning-data-science-process-hive-walkthrough.md) walkthrough, we use an [Azure HDInsight Hadoop cluster](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/) to store, explore and feature engineer data from a publicly available [NYC Taxi Trips](http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/) dataset. 


## The Team Data Science Process in action - Using Azure HDInsight Hadoop Clusters on a 1 TB dataset
In [The Team Data Science Process in action - Using Azure HDInsight Hadoop Clusters on a 1 TB dataset](machine-learning-data-science-process-hive-criteo-walkthrough.md) walkthrough, we present an end-to-end scenario that uses an [Azure HDInsight Hadoop cluster](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/) to store, explore, feature engineer, and down sample data from one of the publicly available [Criteo](http://labs.criteo.com/downloads/download-terabyte-click-logs/) datasets.

## Data Science using Spark on Azure HDInsight
In the [Data Science using Spark on Azure HDInsight](machine-learning-data-science-spark-overview.md) walkthrough, we use the Team Data Science Process in an end-to-end scenario using an [Azure HDInsight Spark cluster](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/) to store, explore and feature engineer data from the publicly available [NYC Taxi Trips](http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/) dataset. 


## Scalable Data Science in Azure Data Lake
The [Scalable Data Science in Azure Data Lake: An end-to-end Walkthrough](machine-learning-data-science-process-data-lake-walkthrough.md) shows how to use Azure Data Lake to do data exploration and binary classification tasks on a sample of the NYC taxi trip and fare dataset to predict whether or not a tip will be paid by a fare. 

## Data Science End-to-End Walkthrough using SQL Server R Services
The [Data Science End-to-End Walkthrough using SQL Server R Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt612857.aspx) uses a well-known public data set, the New York City taxi dataset. You use a combination of R code, SQL Server data, and custom SQL functions to build a classification model that indicates the probability that the driver will get a tip on a particular taxi trip. You also deploy your R model to SQL Server and use server data to generate scores based on the model.

## In-Database Advanced Analytics for SQL Developers

The goal of the [In-Database Advanced Analytics for SQL Developers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt683480.aspx) walkthrough is to provide SQL programmers with hands-on experience building an advanced analytics solution using SQL Server R Services. You learn how to incorporate R into an application or BI solution by wrapping R code in stored procedures.
