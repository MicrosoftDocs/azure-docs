# What is the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python?

The Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python empowers data scientists and AI developers build end-to-end machine learning workflows upon Azure Machine Learning services. 

Use this SDK to quickly build, train, and deploy highly accurate machine learning and deep learning models for various domains.

**Try these next steps for this package:**
1. [Install the SDK and get started](quickstart-set-up-in-python.md).
2. [Follow the tutorial](tutorial-build-train-deploy-with-azure-machine-learning.md) to learn how build, train, and deploy a model with Azure Machine Learning in Python.
3. Look up classes and modules in [the reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure-machine-learning/).


The Azure Machine Learning services CLI was built on top of this SDK. Read the [overview for the machine learning CLI](reference-azure-machine-learning-sdk.md) to learn more.
