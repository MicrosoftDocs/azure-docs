# Python packages for Azure Machine Learning

This section contains the reference documentation for proprietary Python packages from Microsoft for Azure Machine Learning.

You can use these libraries and functions in combination with other open-source or third-party packages, but to use the proprietary packages, your Python code must run against a service or on a computer that provides the interpreters.

The Azure Machine Learning packages are Python pip-installable extensions for Azure Machine Learning that enable data scientists and AI developers to quickly build and deploy highly accurate machine learning and deep learning models for various domains.
 
## Azure ML Package for Computer Vision

With Azure ML Package for Computer Vision, you can build, fine-tune, and deploy deep learning models for image classification, object detection, and image similarity.
