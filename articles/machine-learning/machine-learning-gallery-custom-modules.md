# Discover custom machine learning modules in the Cortana Intelligence Gallery

[AZURE.INCLUDE [machine-learning-gallery-item-selector](../../includes/machine-learning-gallery-item-selector.md)]

## Custom modules for Machine Learning Studio

A number of 
**[Custom Modules](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/notebooks)** 
are available in the Cortana Intelligence Gallery that expand the capabilities of Azure Machine Learning Studio to allow you to develop even more advanced predictive analytics solutions.

## Discover

To browse for custom modules in the Gallery, open the [Gallery](http://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com), point your mouse at **More** at the top of the Gallery home page, and select **Custom Modules**. 

![Select Custom Modules from the Gallery home page](media/machine-learning-gallery-custom-modules/select-custom-modules-in-gallery.png)

The Custom Modules page displays a list of the most popular modules; click **See all** to view all modules.

From this page you can browse all the custom modules in the Gallery, or you can search by selecting filter criteria on the left of the page and entering search terms at the top. Click any module to open the module's details page and read information about what the module does and how to use it. 

You can comment, provide feedback, or ask questions through the comments section on the custom module details page.
You can even share it with friends or colleagues using the share capabilities of LinkedIn or Twitter.
You may also email a link to the module to invite other users to view the page.

## Download

You can download a copy of any custom module and use it in your own experiments.

### From the Gallery

To download a copy of a custom module from the Gallery:

1. Open the module's details page in the Gallery
2. Click **Open in Studio**

	![Open custom module in Machine Learning Studio](media\machine-learning-gallery-custom-modules\open-custom-module-in-studio.png)

	Each custom module includes a sample experiment that demonstrates how to use the module. When you click **Open in Studio**, this sample experiment is loaded into your Machine Learning Studio workspace and opened (if you're not already signed in to Studio, you will be prompted to sign in using your Microsoft account before the experiment is copied to your workspace). When you download a custom module this way, the module is not added to your module palette in Studio, it is just made available in the sample experiment.

3. In the sample experiment, right-click the custom module and select **Copy**
4. Create a new experiment or open an existing one
5. Right-click the experiment canvas and select **Paste**


This pastes a copy of the custom module into your experiment. To use the module in other experiments, just repeat the copy/paste process. 

### In Machine Learning Studio

You can also download the same custom modules while you're working in Machine Learning Studio:

1. In Machine Learning Studio, click **+NEW**

2. Select **Module** - a list of modules is displayed that you can choose from, or you can find a specific module using the search box

3. Point your mouse at a module and select **Import Module** (to see information about the module, select **View in Gallery** which takes you to the details page for the module in the Gallery)

	The module is copied to your workspace and placed in your module palette alongside all the other built-in or custom Studio modules.

5. Create a new experiment or open an existing one

6. In the module palette to the left of the experiment canvas, click **Custom** to expand the list of custom modules in your workspace

	![Custom module list in Studio palette](media\machine-learning-gallery-custom-modules\custom-module-in-studio-palette.png)

7. Select the module you imported and drag it to your experiment


You can now use this custom module like any other module in Machine Learning Studio.
