# Languages supported on the Data Science Virtual Machine 

The Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) comes with several pre-built languages and development tools for building your artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Here are some of the notable ones.

## Python (Windows Server 2016 edition)

|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Language versions supported | Python 2.7 and 3.7 |
| Supported DSVM editions      | Windows Server 2016     |
| How is it configured / installed on the DSVM?  | Two global `conda` environments are created: <br /> * The `root` environment located at `/anaconda/` is Python 3.7. <br/> * The `python2` environment located at `/anaconda/envs/python2` is Python 2.7.       |
| Links to samples      | Sample Jupyter notebooks for Python are included.     |
| Related tools on the DSVM      | PySpark, R, Julia.      |

> [!NOTE]
> Builds of Windows Server 2016 that were created before March 2018 contain Python 3.5 and Python 2.7. Python 2.7 is the conda **root** environment, and **py37** is the Python 3.7 environment.

### How to use and run it    

* Run at a command prompt:

  Open a command prompt and use one of the following methods, depending on the version of Python you want to run:

    ```
    # To run Python 2.7
    activate python2
    python --version
    
    # To run Python 3.7
    activate 
    python --version 
    ```
    
* Use in an IDE:

  Use Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS), installed in the Visual Studio Community edition. By default, the only environment that's set up automatically in PTVS is Python 3.6. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > To point PTVS at Python 2.7, you must create a  custom environment in PTVS. To set this environment path in the Visual Studio  Community Edition, go to **Tools** -> **Python Tools** -> **Python Environments** and select **+ Custom**. Then, set the location to **c:\anaconda\envs\python2** and select **Auto Detect**.

* Use in Jupyter:

  Open Jupyter and select **New** to create a new notebook. You can set the kernel type as _Python [Conda Root]_ for Python 3.7 and _Python [Conda env:python2]_ for Python 2.7.

* Install Python packages:

  The default Python environments on the DSVM are global environments that are readable by all users. But only administrators can write and install global packages. To install packages to the global environment, activate to the root or python2 environment by using the `activate` command as an administrator. Then, you can use a package manager like `conda` or `pip` to install or update packages.

## Python (Linux edition)

|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Language versions supported | Python 2.7 and 3.5 |
| Supported DSVM editions      | Linux   |
| How is it configured / installed on the DSVM?  | Two global `conda` environments are created: <br /> * `root` environment located at `/anaconda/` is Python 2.7. <br/> * `py35` environment located at `/anaconda/envs/py35`is Python 3.5.       |
| Links to samples      | Sample Jupyter notebooks for Python are included.     |
| Related tools on the DSVM      | PySpark, R, Julia      |
### How to use and run it    

* Run in a terminal:

  Open the terminal and do one of the following, depending on the version of Python you want to run:

    ```
    # To run Python 2.7
    source activate 
    python --version
    
    # To run Python 3.5
    source activate py35
    python --version
    
    ```
* Use in an IDE:

  Use PyCharm, installed in the Visual Studio Community edition. 

* Use in Jupyter:

  Open Jupyter and select **New** to create a new notebook. You can set the kernel type as **Python [Conda Root]** for Python 2.7 and **Python [Conda env:py35]** for the Python 3.5 environment. 

* Install Python packages:

  The default Python environments on the DSVM are global environments readable by all users. But only administrators can write and install global packages. To install packages to the global environment, activate to the root or py35 environment by using the `source activate` command as an administrator or as a user with sudo permissions. Then, you can use a package manager like `conda` or `pip` to install or update packages.


## R

|    |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Language versions supported | Microsoft R Open 3.x (100% compatible with CRAN-R)<br /> Microsoft R Server 9.x Developer edition (a scalable enterprise-ready R platform)|
| Supported DSVM editions      | Linux, Windows     |
| How is it configured / installed on the DSVM?  | Windows: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft\ML Server\R_SERVER` <br />Linux: `/usr/lib64/microsoft-r/3.3/lib64/R`    |
| Links to samples      | Sample Jupyter notebooks for R are included.     |
| Related tools on the DSVM      | SparkR, Python, Julia      |
### How to use and run it    

**Windows**:

* Run at a command prompt:

  Open a command prompt and type `R`.

* Use in an IDE:

  Use RTools for Visual Studio (RTVS) installed in the Visual Studio Community edition or RStudio. These are available on the Start menu or as a desktop icon. 

* Use in Jupyter

  Open Jupyter and select **New** to create a new notebook. You can set the kernel type as **R** to use the Jupyter R kernel (IRKernel).

* Install R packages:

  R is installed on the DSVM in a global environment that's readable by all users. But only administrators can write and install global packages. To install packages to the global environment, run R by using one of the preceding methods. Then, you can run the R package manager `install.packages()` to install or update packages.

**Linux**:

* Run in terminal:

  Open a terminal and run `R`.  

* Use in an IDE:

  Use RStudio, installed on the Linux DSVM.  

* Use in Jupyter:

  Open Jupyter and select **New** to create a new notebook. You can set the kernel type as **R** to use the Jupyter R kernel (IRKernel). 

* Install R packages:

  R is installed on the DSVM in a global environment that's readable by all users. But only administrators can write and install global packages. To install packages to the global environment, run R by using one of the preceding methods. Then, you can run the R package manager `install.packages()` to install or update packages.
