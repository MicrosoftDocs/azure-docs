# Store access credentials on the Data Science Virtual Machine securely

A common challenge in building cloud applications is how to manage the credentials that need to be in your code for authenticating to cloud services. Keeping these credentials secure is an important task. Ideally, they never appear on developer workstations or get checked in to source control. 

[Managed identities for Azure resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-service-identity/overview) makes solving this problem simpler by giving Azure services an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You can use this identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without having any credentials in your code. 

One way to secure credentials is to use MSI in combination with [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/), a managed Azure service to store secrets and cryptographic keys securely. You can access a key vault by using the managed identity and retrieve the authorized secrets and cryptographic keys from the key vault. 

The managed identities for Azure resources and Key Vault documentation is a comprehensive resource for in-depth information on these services. The rest of this article walks through the basic use of MSI and Key Vault on the Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) to access Azure resources. 

## Create a managed identity on the DSVM 


```
# Prerequisite: You have already created a Data Science VM in the usual way.

# Create an identity principal for the VM.
az vm assign-identity -g <Resource Group Name> -n <Name of the VM>
# Get the principal ID of the DSVM.
az resource list -n <Name of the VM> --query [*].identity.principalId --out tsv
```


## Assign Key Vault access permission to a VM principal
```
# Prerequisite: You have already created an empty Key Vault resource on Azure by using the Azure portal or Azure CLI. 

# Assign only get and set permission but not the capability to list the keys.
az keyvault set-policy --object-id <Principal ID of the DSVM from previous step> --name <Key Vault Name> -g <Resource Group of Key Vault>  --secret-permissions get set
```

## Access a secret in the key vault from the DSVM

```
# Get the access token for the VM.
x=`curl http://localhost:50342/oauth2/token --data "resource=https://vault.azure.net" -H Metadata:true`
token=`echo $x | python -c "import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])"`

# Access the key vault by using the access token. 
curl https://<Vault Name>.vault.azure.net/secrets/SQLPasswd?api-version=2016-10-01 -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"
```

## Access storage keys from the DSVM

```
# Prerequisite: You have granted your VM's MSI access to use storage account access keys based on instructions from the article at https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-service-identity/tutorial-linux-vm-access-storage. This article describes the process in more detail.

y=`curl http://localhost:50342/oauth2/token --data "resource=https://management.azure.com/" -H Metadata:true`
ytoken=`echo $y | python -c "import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])"`
curl https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<ResourceGroup of Storage account>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<Storage Account Name>/listKeys?api-version=2016-12-01 --request POST -d "" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ytoken"

# Now you can access the data in the storage account from the retrieved storage account keys.
```
## Access the key vault from Python

```python
from azure.keyvault import KeyVaultClient
from msrestazure.azure_active_directory import MSIAuthentication

"""MSI Authentication example."""

# Get credentials.
credentials = MSIAuthentication(
    resource='https://vault.azure.net'
)

# Create a Key Vault client.
key_vault_client = KeyVaultClient(
credentials
)

key_vault_uri = "https://<key Vault Name>.vault.azure.net/"

secret = key_vault_client.get_secret(
key_vault_uri,  # Your key vault URL.
"SQLPasswd",       # The name of your secret that already exists in the key vault.
""              # The version of the secret; empty string for latest.
)
print("My secret value is {}".format(secret.value))
```

## Access the key vault from Azure CLI

```
# With managed identities for Azure resources set up on the DSVM, users on the DSVM can use Azure CLI to perform the authorized functions. Here are commands to access the key vault from Azure CLI without having to log in to an Azure account. 
# Prerequisites: MSI is already set up on the DSVM as indicated earlier. Specific permission, like accessing storage account keys, reading specific secrets, and writing new secrets, is provided to the MSI. 

# Authenticate to Azure CLI without requiring an Azure account. 
az login --msi

# Retrieve a secret from the key vault. 
az keyvault secret show --vault-name <Vault Name> --name SQLPasswd

# Create a new secret in the key vault.
az keyvault secret set --name MySecret --vault-name <Vault Name> --value "Helloworld"

# List access keys for the storage account.
az storage account keys list -g <Storage Account Resource Group> -n <Storage Account Name>
```
