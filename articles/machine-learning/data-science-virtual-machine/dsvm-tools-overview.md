# Get to know your Data Science Virtual Machine

The Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) includes an extensive list of popular data science, machine learning/AI tools, and data platforms. The tool configurations are rigorously tested by Data Scientists and Developers at Microsoft and by the broader Data Science community to ensure stability and general viability.

The DSVM also includes multiple code samples and walkthroughs in the form of Jupyter Notebooks that can be executed locally. There is also documentation for these samples to aid comprehension. 

The tools, platforms, utilities, and samples that are included in the Data Science VM are organized into the following sections:

1. **[Deep Learning & AI Frameworks](dsvm-deep-learning-ai-frameworks.md)**
2. **[ML & Data Science Tools](dsvm-ml-data-science-tools.md)**
3. **[Programming Languages](dsvm-languages.md)**
4. **[Development Tools and IDEs](dsvm-tools-development.md)**
5. **[Data Ingestion Tools](dsvm-tools-ingestion.md)**
6. **[Data Exploration and Visualization Tools](dsvm-tools-explore-and-visualize.md)**
7. **[Data Platforms](dsvm-data-platforms.md)**
8. **[Samples and Walkthroughs](dsvm-samples-and-walkthroughs.md)**
