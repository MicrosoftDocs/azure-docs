# Productivity tools on the Data Science Virtual Machine

In addition to the data science and programming tools, the DSVM contains productivity tools to help you capture and share insights with your colleagues. Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise is the most productive and most secure Office experience for enterprises, allowing your teams to work together seamlessly from anywhere, anytime. With Power BI Desktop you can go from data to insight to action. And the Microsoft Edge browser is a modern, fast, and secure Web browser.
