# Introduction to the Geo Artificial Intelligence Data Science Virtual Machine

The Azure **Geo AI Data Science VM** (Geo-DSVM) delivers geospatial analytics capabilities from Microsoft's Data Science VM. Specifically, this VM extends the AI and data science toolkits in the [Data Science VM](overview.md) by adding ESRI's market-leading [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview) Geographic Information System.

The Geo AI Data Science VM is a product offering arising out of the collaboration between ESRI and Microsoft. The result is a powerful environment that provides the ability to:

- explore data with the most popular AI and data science tools
- apply statistical analysis to data with geographical or spatial aspects
- train models for predictive analytics using machine learning and deep learning algorithms
- create rich visualization

It is supported on the Windows 2016 Data Science Virtual Machine. Python and R interfaces to ArcGIS are also pre-configured on the Geo-DSVM enabling programmatic access to geospatial analytics within your AI applications. Jupyter Notebook samples are also provided to help get started with building AI applications infused with geospatial intelligence.


## Why Geo AI Data Science VM? 

Integrating geography and location information with your data brings a powerful new dimension to understanding a world increasingly instrumented with IOT devices. A wide range of applications exists in virtually every segment of civil society, whether commercial, governmental, academic, or not-for-profit activities. Geospatial analytics provides robust tools for gathering, managing and analyzing geographic and location-based data and powerful visualization that can enable unique insights into the significance of such data. 

The [Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)](overview.md) from Microsoft is a popular experimentation and modeling environment on Azure, that provides a host of AI, Machine Learning, and data science tools. These platforms and tools are all conveniently pre-configured to help you be immediately productive. 

By combining the predictive capabilities of the Data Science VM with the scalability of the Azure Cloud and the Geospatial analytics software from [ESRI](https://www.esri.com), data scientists and geo-spatial analysts now have a productive platform from which to obtain new intelligence from their data and identify new opportunities.
