# Downloadable Infographic: Machine learning basics with algorithm examples

Download this easy-to-understand infographic overview of machine learning basics to learn about popular algorithms used to answer common machine learning questions. Algorithm examples help the machine learning beginner understand which algorithms to use and what they're used for.

## Popular algorithms in Machine Learning Studio

[Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/) comes with a large library of algorithms for predictive analytics. This infographic identifies four popular families of algorithms - regression, anomaly detection, clustering, and classification - and provides links to working examples in the
[Azure AI Gallery](https://gallery.azure.ai/). The Gallery contains example experiments and tutorials that demonstrate how these algorithms can be applied in many real-world solutions.
