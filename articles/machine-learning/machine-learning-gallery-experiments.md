# Discover experiments in the Cortana Intelligence Gallery
[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-gallery-item-selector](../../includes/machine-learning-gallery-item-selector.md)]

## Experiments for Machine Learning Studio
The Gallery contains a wide variety of
**[Experiments](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/experiments)**
that have been developed in [Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://studio.azureml.net). These range from quick proof-of-concept experiments that demonstrate a specific machine learning technique, to fully-developed solutions for complex machine learning problems.

> [!NOTE]
> An ***experiment*** is a canvas in Azure Machine Learning Studio that lets you construct a predictive analysis model by connecting together data with various analytical modules. You can try different ideas, do trial runs, and eventually publish your model as a web service in Azure. For an example of creating a simple experiment, see [Machine learning tutorial: Create your first experiment in Azure Machine Learning Studio](machine-learning-create-experiment.md). For a more complete walkthrough of creating a predictive analytics solution, see [Walkthrough: Develop a predictive analytics solution for credit risk assessment in Azure Machine Learning](machine-learning-walkthrough-develop-predictive-solution.md).

## Download
You can download a copy of any experiment from the Gallery into your Studio workspace and then modify your copy to create your own solutions.
There are two ways to get a copy of the experiment:

* **From the Gallery** - If you find an experiment you like in the Gallery, you can easily download a copy and open it in your Machine Learning Studio workspace.
* **From within Machine Learning Studio** - In Studio, you can use any experiment in the Gallery as a template to create a new experiment.

### From the Gallery
To download a copy of an experiment from the Gallery:

1. Open the experiment's details page in the Gallery
2. Click **Open in Studio**
   
    ![Open experiment from the Gallery](media\\machine-learning-gallery-experiments\\open-experiment-from-gallery.png)

When you click **Open in Studio**, the experiment is loaded into your Machine Learning Studio workspace and opened (if you're not already signed in to Studio, you will be prompted to sign in using your Microsoft account before the experiment is copied to your workspace).

### From within Machine Learning Studio
You can also open the same sample experiments while you're working in Machine Learning Studio:

1. In Machine Learning Studio, click **+NEW**
2. Select **Experiment** - you can choose from a list of Gallery experiments contributed by Microsoft, or you can find a specific experiment using the search box
3. Point your mouse at an experiment and select **Open in Studio** - the experiment is copied to your workspace and opened (to see information about the experiment, select **View in Gallery** which takes you to the details page for the experiment in the Gallery)
   
    ![Open Gallery experiment from inside Machine Learning Studio](media\\machine-learning-gallery-experiments\\open-experiment-from-studio.png)

You can now customize, iterate, and deploy this experiment like any other experiment you create in Machine Learning Studio.

### Update your experiment
If you need to make changes to the workflow (modules, parameters, etc.) in an experiment you published to the Gallery,
go back to the experiment in Machine Learning Studio, make your changes, and publish it again. Your existing published experiment will be updated with your changes.

If you just need to change any of the following information for your experiment,
or you need to delete the experiment from the Gallery,
you can make all of these changes in the Gallery:

* Experiment name
* Summary or description text
* Tags specified
* Image used
* Visibility setting (public or unlisted)
* Delete experiment from the Gallery

These changes can be made in the Gallery from the experiment's details page or from your profile page.

#### From your experiment's details page

### Suggestions for publishing and for quality documentation
* While you can assume that the reader has prior data science experience, it still helps to simplify your language and explain things in detail wherever possible.
* Not all readers will be familiar with the Cortana Intelligence Suite, given that it's relatively new.
  So provide enough information and step-by-step explanations to help readers navigate through your work.
* Visuals including experiment graphs or screenshots of data can be very helpful for readers to interpret and use your content the right way. See the [Publishing Guidelines and Examples collection](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Collection/Publishing-Guidelines-and-Examples-1) for more information on how to include images in your documentation.
* If you include a dataset in your experiment (it's not being imported through the Import Data module), it's part of your experiment and will get published to the Gallery. Therefore, ensure that the dataset you're publishing has appropriate licensing terms for sharing and downloading by anyone. Gallery contributions are covered under the Azure [Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/website-terms-of-use/).

## Frequently Asked Questions
**What are the image requirements when submitting or editing an image for my experiment?**

The images you submit along with your experiment will be used to create an experiment tile for your contribution. It's recommended that the images be < 500Kb in size, with an aspect ratio of 3:2. A resolution of 960x640 is recommended

**What happens to the dataset I used in the experiment? Does the dataset get published to the Gallery as well?**

If your dataset is part of your experiment and not being imported through the Import Data module, it's part of your experiment and gets published to the Gallery with your experiment. For this reason make sure that the dataset you're publishing with the experiment has the appropriate licensing terms that allow sharing and downloading by anyone.

**I have an experiment that uses an Import Data module to pull data from HDInsight or SQL. It uses my credentials to retrieve the data. How can I publish such an experiment and be assured that my credentials will not be shared?**

At this time we do not allow publishing of experiments that use credentials.

**How do I enter multiple tags?**

After you enter a tag, press the tab key to enter another tag.
