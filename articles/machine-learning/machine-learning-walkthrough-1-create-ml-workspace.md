# Walkthrough Step 1: Create a Machine Learning workspace

This is the first step of the walkthrough, [Develop a predictive analytics solution in Azure Machine Learning](machine-learning-walkthrough-develop-predictive-solution.md).


1.	**Create a Machine Learning workspace**
2.	[Upload existing data](machine-learning-walkthrough-2-upload-data.md)
3.	[Create a new experiment](machine-learning-walkthrough-3-create-new-experiment.md)
4.	[Train and evaluate the models](machine-learning-walkthrough-4-train-and-evaluate-models.md)
5.	[Deploy the web service](machine-learning-walkthrough-5-publish-web-service.md)
6.	[Access the web service](machine-learning-walkthrough-6-access-web-service.md)

----------

To use Machine Learning Studio, you need to have a Microsoft Azure Machine Learning workspace. This workspace contains the tools you need to create, manage, and publish experiments.  

##To create a workspace  

1.	Sign in to the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).
2.	In the  Azure services panel, click **MACHINE LEARNING**.  
![Create workspace][1]

3.	Click **CREATE AN ML WORKSPACE**.
4.	On the **QUICK CREATE** page, enter your workspace information and then click **CREATE AN ML WORKSPACE**.

After your Machine Learning workspace is created, you will see it listed on the **machine learning** page in the Azure classic portal. 
For more details on creating your workspace, see [Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace](machine-learning-create-workspace.md).

> [AZURE.TIP] You can share the experiments you're working on by inviting others to your workspace. You can do this in Machine Learning Studio on the **SETTINGS** page. You just need the Microsoft account or organizational account for each user.
