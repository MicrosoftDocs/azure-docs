> [!TIP]
> After you sign in, you see a list of subscriptions associated with your Azure account. The subscription information with `isDefault: true` is the currently activated subscription for Azure CLI commands. This subscription must be the same one that contains your Azure Machine Learning workspace. You can find the subscription information on the overview page for your workspace in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
> 
> To select another subscription to use for Azure CLI commands, run the `az account set -s <subscription>` command and specify the subscription name or ID to switch to. For more information about subscription selection, see [Use multiple Azure subscriptions](/cli/azure/manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli).
