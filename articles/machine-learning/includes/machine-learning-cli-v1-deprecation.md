> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of the Azure CLI commands in this article use the `azure-cli-ml`, or v1, extension for Azure Machine Learning. Support for the v1 extension will end on September 30, 2025. You will be able to install and use the v1 extension until that date.
>
> We recommend that you transition to the `ml`, or v2, extension before September 30, 2025. For more information on the v2 extension, see [Azure ML CLI extension and Python SDK v2](../concept-v2.md).
