Azure Machine Learning provides a shared quota pool from which users across various regions can access quota to perform testing for a limited time, depending upon availability. 
When you use the studio to deploy Llama-2, Phi, Nemotron, Mistral, Dolly, and Deci-DeciLM models from the model catalog to a managed online endpoint, Azure Machine Learning allows you to access its shared quota pool for a short time so that you can perform testing. For more information on the shared quota pool, see [Azure Machine Learning shared quota](how-to-manage-quotas.md#azure-machine-learning-shared-quota).
