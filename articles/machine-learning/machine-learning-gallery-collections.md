# Discover and share collections in Cortana Intelligence Gallery
[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-gallery-item-selector](../../includes/machine-learning-gallery-item-selector.md)]

## Collections
You can use a [collection](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/collections) to group experiments, APIs, and other Gallery items that you use for a specific solution or concept. You can group them to use, to save for later reference, or to share.

## Discover
To browse collections [in the Gallery](http://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com), under **More**, select **Collections**.

![Select Collections on the Gallery home page](media/machine-learning-gallery-collections/select-collections-in-gallery.png)

The **[Collections](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/collections)** page displays a list of recently added and popular collections. To view all collections, select **See all**. To search for a specific collection, select **See all**, and then select filter criteria. You also can enter search terms in the **Search** box at the top of the Gallery page.

You can get more information about a collection on the collection details page. To open a collection details page, select the collection. On a collection details page, in the **Comments** section, you can comment, provide feedback, or ask questions about the collection. You can even share the collection with friends or colleagues on Twitter or LinkedIn. You also can email a link to the collection details page, to invite other users to view the page.

## Contribute
You can create a collection that has items that you own or items that have been contributed by the community. An item in a collection can be any Gallery item that addresses a specific solution or concept.

For example, you can use a collection to group items on a specific topic, or you can group a multi-step experiment that solves a complex problem. The initial collections contributed by Microsoft consist of multi-step machine learning experiment templates. You can use the templates to help solve real-world problems, such as online fraud detection, text classification, retail forecasting, or predictive maintenance.

### Create a collection

1. Sign in to the Gallery by using your Microsoft account.

2.  Select your image at the top of the page, and then select your name.
  
    ![Select your account name](media/machine-learning-gallery-collections/click-account-name.png)

3. Select **New Item**.
   
    ![Select "New Item"](media/machine-learning-gallery-collections/click-new-item.png)
4. On the **Description** page, for **ITEM TYPE**, select **Collection**. Enter a name for your collection, a brief summary, a detailed description, and any tags that might help other users find your collection.
   
    ![Enter information for a new collection](media/machine-learning-gallery-collections/create-collection-page-1.png)
5. On the **Image Selection** page, select an image that is displayed with the collection. You can upload your own image file, or select a stock image. Choose an image that might help users identify the content and purpose of the collection.
   
    ![Enter information for a new collection](media/machine-learning-gallery-collections/create-collection-page-2.png)
6. On the **Settings** page, for **Visibility**, select whether the collection is **Public** (anyone can view the collection) or **Unlisted** (only people with a direct link to the collection can view it).
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > After you set a collection to **Public** and then select **Create**, you cannot later change the collection to **Unlisted**.
