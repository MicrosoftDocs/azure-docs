1. In this tutorial, we'll use the Fortanix Docker registry for the sample application. Fill in the details from the following information. Use your private docker registry to keep the output image.

    - **Application name**: Python Application Server
    - **Description**: Python Flask Server
    - **Input image name**: docker.io/fortanix/python-flask
    - **Output image name**: docker.io/fortanx/python-flask-sgx
    - **ISVPRODID**: 1
    - **ISVSVM**: 1
    - **Memory size**: 1 GB
    - **Thread count**: 128

      *Optional*: Run the application.
    - **Docker Hub**: [https://hub.docker.com/u/fortanix](https://hub.docker.com/u/fortanix)
    - **App**: fortanix/python-flask

      Run the following command:

      ```bash
         sudo docker run fortanix/python-flask
      ```

1. Add a certificate. Enter the following values, and then select **NEXT**:

## Create an image

A Fortanix CCM Image is a software release or version of an application. Each image is associated with one enclave hash (MRENCLAVE).

1. After you create an Enclave OS application, on the **Add Image** page, enter the **REGISTRY CREDENTIALS** for **Output image name**. These credentials are used to access the private docker registry where the image will be pushed. Since the input image is stored in a public registry, there is no need to provide credentials for the input image.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-fortanix-confidential-computing-manager-node-agent/nitro-create-enclave-os-image.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to create an AWs Nitro image.":::

1. Provide the image tag. Use “latest” if you want to use the latest image builds.
1. If you selected the **Image Type** as **Intel SGX**, enter the following details:
    - **ISVPRODID** is a numeric product identifier. A user must choose a unique value in the range of 0-65535 for their  applications.
    - **ISVSVN** is a numeric security version to be assigned to the Enclave. This number should be incremented if security relevant change is made to the application.
    - **Memory size** – Choose the memory size from the drop-down to change the memory size of the enclave.
    - **Thread count** – Change the thread count to support the application.

1. Select **Create** to proceed.
1. Upon completing the image creation, you will see a notification that the image was successfully created and your application will be listed in the Applications screen.

## Domain and image approval

An application whose domain is approved, will get a TLS Certificate from Fortanix Confidential Computing Manager. This certificate will have the domain as a subject name which will allow all requests from this domain to be served by the application. If this domain is not approved, the image will run but it will not be issued any TLS certificate from Fortanix Confidential Computing Manager.

Switch to the **Tasks** menu on the left and select **Approve** to approve the pending requests to allow the domain and image.

## Enroll the compute node agent in Azure

### Create and copy join token

In Fortanix Confidential Computing Manager, you'll create a token. This token allows a compute node in Azure to authenticate itself. You'll need to give this token to your Azure virtual machine.

1. Select the **Infrastructure** → **Compute Nodes** menu item from the CCM left navigation bar and click the **+ ENROLL NODE** button.
1. Click **COPY** to copy the Join Token. This Join Token is used by the compute node to authenticate itself.

### Enroll nodes into Fortanix Node Agent in Azure Marketplace

Creating a Fortanix Node Agent will deploy a virtual machine, network interface, virtual network, network security group, and a public IP address into your Azure resource group. Your Azure subscription will be billed hourly for the virtual machine. Before you create a Fortanix Node Agent, review the Azure [virtual machine pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/) for DCsv2-Series. Delete Azure resources when not in use.

1. Go to the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/) and sign in with your Azure credentials.
1. In the search bar, type **Fortanix Confidential Computing Node Agent**. Select the App that shows up in the search box called **Fortanix Confidential Computing Node Agent** to go to the offering's home page.

    ![search marketplace](media/how-to-fortanix-confidential-computing-manager-node-agent/search-fortanix-marketplace.png)
1. Select **Get It Now**, fill in your information if necessary, and select **Continue**. You'll be redirected to the Azure portal.
1. Select **Create** to go to the Fortanix Confidential Computing Node Agent deployment page.
1. On this page, you'll be entering information to deploy a virtual machine. Specifically, this VM is a DCsv2-Series Intel SGX-enabled virtual machine from Azure with Fortanix Node Agent software installed. The Node Agent will allow your converted image to run securely on Intel SGX nodes in Azure.  Select the **subscription** and **resource group** where you want to deploy the virtual machine and associated resources.

> [!NOTE]
> There are constraints when deploying DCsv2-Series virtual machines in Azure. You may need to request quota for additional cores. Read about [confidential computing solutions on Azure VMs](./virtual-machine-solutions.md) for more information.

1. Select an available region.
1. Select the **OS Type**.
1. Leave the default **OS Disk Size** as 200 and select a VM size (Standard_DC4s_v2 will suffice for this tutorial).
1. Enter a name for your virtual machine in **Compute Node Name**.
1. Enter a username and password (or SSH Key) for authenticating into the virtual machine.
1. Paste the token generated earlier in **Join Token**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-fortanix-confidential-computing-manager-node-agent/create-node-agent.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to create a node agent.":::
   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-fortanix-confidential-computing-manager-node-agent/create-node-agent-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to create a node agent-1.":::
   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-fortanix-confidential-computing-manager-node-agent/create-node-agent-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to create a node agent-2.":::

1. Select **Review + create**. Ensure the validation passes and then select **Create**. When all the resources deploy, the compute node is now enrolled in Fortanix Confidential Computing Manager.

## Run the application image on the enrolled compute node

Run the application by executing the following command. Ensure you change the Node Agent Host IP, Port, and Converted Image Name as inputs for your specific application.

1. Install docker on the enrolled compute node. To install docker, use the command:

   ```bash
       sudo apt install docker.io
   ```

1. Run the application image on the node by using the following command:

   ```bash
       sudo docker run `
           --privileged --volume /dev:/dev `
           -v /var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket:/var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket `
           -e NODE_AGENT_BASE_URL=http://52.152.206.164:9092/v1/ fortanix-private/python-flask-sgx
   ```

Where:

- `52.152.206.164` is the Node Agent Host IP.
- `9092` is the default port on which the Node Agent listens to.
- `fortanix/python-flask-sgx` is the converted app that can be found in the Images menu under the **Image Name** column in the **Images** table in the Fortanix Confidential Computing Manager Web Portal.

## Verify and monitor the running application

1. Return to [Fortanix Confidential Computing Manager](https://ccm.fortanix.com/console).
1. Ensure you're working inside the **Account** where you enrolled the node.
1. Select the **Applications** menu on the left navigation pane.
1. Verify that there's a running application with an associated compute node.

## Clean up resources

When they are no longer needed, you can delete the resource group, virtual machine, and associated resources. Deleting the resource group will unenroll the nodes associated with your converted image.

Select the resource group for the virtual machine, then select **Delete**. Confirm the name of the resource group to finish deleting the resources.

To delete the Fortanix Confidential Computing Manager account you created, go the [Accounts Page](https://ccm.fortanix.com/accounts) in the Fortanix Confidential Computing Manager. Hover over the account you want to delete. Select the vertical black dots in the upper right-hand corner and select **Delete Account**.
