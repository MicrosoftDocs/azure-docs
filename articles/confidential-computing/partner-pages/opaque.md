## Overview

Opaque is the confidential AI platform unlocking sensitive data to securely accelerate AI into production. Created by world-renowned researchers at the Berkeley RISELab, Opaque’s user-friendly platform empowers organizations to run cloud-scale, general purpose AI workloads on encrypted data. Opaque supports popular languages and frameworks for AI, including Python and Spark, and enables governed data sharing with cryptographic verification of privacy and sovereignty. Opaque customers deploy high-performance AI faster and eliminate the tradeoff between innovation and security.

Opaque provides a suite of business applications in Opaque Workspaces and Opaque Gateway that plug into your existing data stack and extends existing infrastructure, enabling you to build a confidential data pipeline with a hardware root of trust.

## Opaque Workspaces

The solution provides a centralized data platform that eliminates the need for compliance-driven, time-consuming tasks like anonymization and manual access approvals so that teams can operationalize their data for AI and analytics in days, not weeks, or months. Leverage confidential computing to protect data while sharing across teams and harnessed for AI, to ensure only expected participants can view the original data and results of the computation. The top 3 business outcomes that enterprises experience from deploying Opaque Workspaces are:
  - Faster time to insights into confidential data
  - Risk mitigation by secure data processing in use
  - Reduced costs by optimizing data security/compliance

## Opaque Gateway

Organizations need a privacy-preserving AI solution that bridges the gap between protecting privacy and realizing the full potential of LLMs (Large Language Models). To protect privacy throughout the stages of a generative AI lifecycle, strict techniques must be implemented to securely and efficiently perform all security-critical operations that directly touch a model and all confidential data that is used for training and inferencing.

Opaque Gateway serves as a privacy layer around your LLM of choice. With Opaque Gateway, you can securely and provably sanitize LLM prompts seamlessly to hide sensitive data from external parties and LLM providers. Opaque’s Confidential Computing technology ensures that no third party, not even Opaque Gateway, gets any visibility into the underlying prompt or data being sanitized.
