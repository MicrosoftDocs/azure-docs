# BeeKeeperAI, Inc.


## Overview

BeeKeeperAI safely accelerates artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm development and deployment by using [Azure confidential computing](../index.yml)  capabilities within a zero trust and sightless computing environment.

Their EscrowAI collaboration platform enables algorithm developers to compute securely and ethically on real-world, protected data. The platform enables optimal algorithm development, deployment, and ongoing monitoring for use cases that require:

- Data that can't be deidentified (genomic, retinal, social determinants of health)
- Small datasets that are difficult to deidentify (rare disease)
- Data that is too sensitive to risk exposure (mental health)
- Deidentification efforts that are time consuming or too costly

EscrowAI is a SaaS offering available in the Azure Cloud environment requiring little time to activate. You can try it today from the [Azure Marketplace solution](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/beekeeperaiinc1643748994169.beekeeper_ai?tab=Overview).
