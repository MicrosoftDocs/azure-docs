# Quickstart: Create Intel SGX VM in the Azure portal

This tutorial guides you through the process of deploying Intel SGX VMs using Azure portal. Otherwise, we recommend following [Azure Marketplace](quick-create-marketplace.md) templates.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/) before you begin.

> [!NOTE]
> Free trial accounts do not have access to the VMs in this tutorial. Please upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription.


## Sign in to Azure

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. At the top, select **Create a resource**.

1. On the left hand side pane, select, select **Compute**.

1. Select **Create Virtual Machine**.

## Configure an Intel SGX Virtual Machine

1. In the **Basics** tab, select your **Subscription** and **Resource Group**.

1. For **Virtual machine name**, enter a name for your new VM.

1. Type or select the following values:

   * **Region**: Select the Azure region that's right for you.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Intel SGX VMs run on specialized hardware in specific regions. For the latest regional availability, look for DCsv2-series or DCsv3/DCdsv3-series in [available regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=virtual-machines).

1. Configure the operating system image that you would like to use for your virtual machine.

    * **Choose Image**: For this tutorial, select Ubuntu 20.04 LTS - Gen2. You may also select Ubuntu 18.04 LTS - Gen2, or Windows Server 2019.
    
    * **Update to Generation 2**: Underneath Image, select **Configure VM generation**, in the fly out, then select **Generation 2**.

1. Choose a virtual machine with Intel SGX capabilities by clicking on **+ Add filter** to create a filter, select **Type** for Filter type, and check only **Confidential compute** from the list in the next dropdown.

    > [!TIP]
    > You should see sizes **DC(number)s_v2**, **DC(number)s_v3** and **DC(number)ds_v3**. [Learn more](virtual-machine-solutions-sgx.md).

1. Fill in the following information:

   * **Authentication type**: Select **SSH public key** if you're creating a Linux VM. 

        > [!NOTE]
        > You have the choice of using an SSH public key or a Password for authentication. SSH is more secure. For instructions on how to generate an SSH key, see [Create SSH keys on Linux and Mac for Linux VMs in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/mac-create-ssh-keys).

    * **Username**: Enter the Administrator name for the VM.

    * **SSH public key**: If applicable, enter your RSA public key.
    
    * **Password**: If applicable, enter your password for authentication.

    * **Public inbound ports**: Choose **Allow selected ports** and select **SSH (22)** and **HTTP (80)** in the **Select public inbound ports** list. If you're deploying a Windows VM, select **HTTP (80)** and **RDP (3389)**.  

    >[!Note]
    > Allowing RDP/SSH ports is not recommended for production deployments.  

     ![Inbound ports](media/quick-create-portal/inbound-port-virtual-machine.png)


1. Make changes in the **Disks** tab.

   * **DCsv2-series** supports **Standard SSD**, **Premium SSD** is supported across DC1, DC2 and DC4. 
   * **DCsv3 and DCdsv3-series** supports **Standard SSD**, **Premium SSD** and **Ultra Disk**

1. Make any changes you want to the settings in the following tabs or keep the default settings.

    * **Networking**
    * **Management**
    * **Guest config**
    * **Tags**

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. In the **Review + create** pane, select **Create**.

> [!NOTE]
> Proceed to the next section and continue with this tutorial if you deployed a Linux VM. If you deployed a Windows VM, [follow these steps to connect to your Windows VM](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/connect-logon) and then [install the OE SDK on Windows](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedDocs/install_oe_sdk-Windows.md).


## Connect to the Linux VM

Open your SSH client of choice, like Bash on Linux or PowerShell on Windows. The `ssh` command is typically included in Linux, macOS, and Windows. If you are using Windows 7 or older, where Win32 OpenSSH is not included by default, consider installing [WSL](/windows/wsl/about) or using [Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview.md) from the browser. In the following command, replace the VM user name and IP address to connect to your Linux VM.

```bash
ssh azureadmin@40.55.55.555
```

You can find the Public IP address of your VM in the Azure portal, under the Overview section of your virtual machine.

For more information about connecting to Linux VMs, see [Create a Linux VM on Azure using the Portal](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal).

## Install Azure DCAP Client

[Azure Data Center Attestation Primitives (DCAP)](../security/fundamentals/trusted-hardware-identity-management.md#what-is-the-azure-dcap-library), a replacement for Intel Quote Provider Library (QPL), fetches quote generation collateral and quote validation collateral directly from the THIM Service.

The [Trusted Hardware Identity Management (THIM)](../security/fundamentals/trusted-hardware-identity-management.md) service handles cache management of certificates for all trusted execution environments (TEE) residing in Azure and provides trusted computing base (TCB) information to enforce a minimum baseline for attestation solutions. 

DCsv3 and DCdsv3 only support [ECDSA-based Attestation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/attestation-services.html) and the users are required to install [Azure DCAP](https://github.com/Microsoft/Azure-DCAP-Client) client to interact with THIM and fetch TEE collateral for quote generation during attestation process. DCsv2 continues to support [EPID-based Attestation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/attestation-services.html). 

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can delete the resource group, virtual machine, and all its related resources. 

Select the resource group for the virtual machine, then select **Delete**. Confirm the name of the resource group to finish deleting the resources.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed and connected to your Intel SGX VM. For more information, see [Solutions on Virtual Machines](virtual-machine-solutions-sgx.md). 

Discover how you can build confidential computing applications, by continuing to the Open Enclave SDK samples on GitHub.

Microsoft Azure Attestation is free and ECDSA-based attestation framework, for remotely verifying the trustworthiness of multiple TEEs and integrity of the binaries running inside it. Learn [more](/azure/attestation/overview)
