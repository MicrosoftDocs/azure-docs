# Harden a Linux image to remove sudo users

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux Images

This "how to" shows you steps to remove sudo users from the Linux image and deploy a confidential virtual machine (confidential VM) in Azure.

The objective of this article is to create an admin-less Linux image for confidential VM deployments. Removing the guest admin has immense security value, it reduces admin privileges across OS.

Understanding different types of users in Unix/Linux systems:
- Admin user (sudoer): Regular users with extra permissions. These users can perform certain tasks that modify system configurations.

- Regular user: Regular users are nonadministrative users. They don't have permission to modify system configurations or install system-wide software.

In the context of admin-less Linux images, the aim is to deploy systems without sudo users.

> [!NOTE]
> The configuration alone does not ensure prevention of users from being added to the sudo group. Any service with root or sudo privileges has the potential to escalate privileges.

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
- An Ubuntu image - you can choose one from the [Azure Marketplace](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/cli-ps-findimage).

### Remove sudo users and prepare a generalized Linux image

The proposed solution results in a Linux image without sudo users.

Steps to create a generalized image that removes the sudo users are as follows:

1. Download an Ubuntu image.
[Create a custom image for Azure confidential VM](/azure/confidential-computing/how-to-create-custom-image-confidential-vm)

2. Mount the image.

    There are several ways to do this  [Attach the disk](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/attach-disk-portal?tabs=ubuntu#mount-the-disk:~:text=new%20filesystem%20immediately.-,Mount%20the%20disk,-Create%20a%20directory), the example uses the loop device to mount the image. It can either be a disk attached or a loop device [Mount the image](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/man8/mount.8.html).

    $imagedevice is the root filesystem's partition on the device that contains the image.
    ```
    mount /dev/$imagedevice /mnt/dev/$imagedevice
    ```

    This process is commonly used to access and work with disk images. Here, it is used to remove the sudo users on the Ubuntu image.

3. Chroot into the vhd filesystem to run the following command, which lists users under the sudo group.
    ```
    sudo chroot /mnt/dev/$imagedevice/ getent group sudo
    ```

4. Validate step 3 by listing out the users in the sudoers.d home directory and in /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow files.
If there are any users with sudo privileges, they are listed here,

    ```
    sudo ls /mnt/dev/$imagedevice/etc/sudoers.d

    sudo cat /mnt/dev/$imagedevice/etc/passwd

    sudo cat /mnt/dev/$imagedevice/etc/shadow
    ```

5. Remove sudo privileges: Use the deluser command to remove sudo privilege for the user,
    ```
    sudo chroot /mnt/dev/$imagedevice/ deluser -r [sudo_username]
    ```

6. Repeat step 4 to validate that the user has no sudo privilege on the vhd.

7. Unmount the image.
    ```
    umount /mnt/dev/$imagedevice
    ```

The image prepared does not include any sudo users that can be used for creating the confidential VMs.

Follow the steps [Create a custom image for Azure confidential VM](/azure/confidential-computing/how-to-create-custom-image-confidential-vm) to create an Azure confidential VM.
Use the admin-less image in step 4 of [Create a custom image for Azure confidential VM](/azure/confidential-computing/how-to-create-custom-image-confidential-vm) while doing azcopy and the rest of the steps remains the same.
