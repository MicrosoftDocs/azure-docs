[Read more about the journey of bringing the support for Socket.IO on Azure.](https://socket.io/blog/socket-io-on-azure-preview/)

Since we public previewed the support for Socket.IO a few months back, we have received positive feedback from Socket.IO community. One user who migrated a Socket.IO app over the weekend even shared with us that it's "shockingly good."

Users enjoy the fact that they can offload scaling a Socket.IO app without changing anything to the core app logic. We're happy to share that the support for Socket.IO is now generally available and suitable for use in production.
