# Build a real-time code-streaming app by using Socket.IO and host it on Azure

Building a real-time experience like the co-creation feature in [Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/word) can be challenging.

Through its easy-to-use APIs, [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) has proven itself as a library for real-time communication between clients and a server. However, Socket.IO users often report difficulty around scaling Socket.IO's connections. With Web PubSub for Socket.IO, developers no longer need to worry about managing persistent connections.

[!INCLUDE [Connection string security](includes/web-pubsub-connection-string-security.md)]

## Overview

This article shows how to build an app that allows a coder to stream coding activities to an audience. You build this application by using:

>[!div class="checklist"]
> * Monaco Editor, the code editor that powers Visual Studio Code.
> * [Express](https://expressjs.com/), a Node.js web framework.
> * APIs that the Socket.IO library provides for real-time communication.
> * Host Socket.IO connections that use Web PubSub for Socket.IO.

### The finished app

The finished app allows the user of a code editor to share a web link through which people can watch the typing.

To keep the procedures focused and digestible in around 15 minutes, this article defines two user roles and what they can do in the editor:

* A writer, who can type in the online editor and the content is streamed
* Viewers, who receive real-time content typed by the writer and can't edit the content

### Architecture

|  Item  | Purpose           | Benefits         |
|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|
|[Socket.IO library](https://socket.io/) | Provides a low-latency, bidirectional data exchange mechanism between the back-end application and clients | Easy-to-use APIs that cover most real-time communication scenarios
|Web PubSub for Socket.IO | Hosts WebSocket or poll-based persistent connections with Socket.IO clients | Support for 100,000 concurrent connections; simplified application architecture

## Prerequisites

To follow all the steps in this article, you need:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * An [Azure](https://portal.azure.com/) account. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.
> * The [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) (version 2.29.0 or later) or [Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/quickstart.md) to manage Azure resources.
> * Basic familiarity with [Socket.IO's APIs](https://socket.io/docs/v4/).

## Create a Web PubSub for Socket.IO resource

Use the Azure CLI to create the resource:

```bash
az webpubsub create -n <resource-name> \
                    -l <resource-location> \
                    -g <resource-group> \
                    --kind SocketIO \
                    --sku Free_F1
```

## Get a connection string

A connection string allows you to connect with Web PubSub for Socket.IO.

Run the following commands. Keep the returned connection string somewhere, because you'll need it when you run the application later in this article.

```bash
az webpubsub key show -n <resource-name> \ 
                      -g <resource-group> \ 
                      --query primaryKey \
                      -o tsv
```

## Write the application's server-side code

Start writing your application's code by working on the server side.

### Build an HTTP server

1. Create a Node.js project:

    ```bash
    mkdir codestream
    cd codestream
    npm init
    ```

2. Install the server SDK and Express:

    ```bash
    npm install @azure/web-pubsub-socket.io
    npm install express
    ```

3. Import required packages and create an HTTP server to serve static files:

    ```javascript
    /*server.js*/

    // Import required packages
    const express = require('express');
    const path = require('path');

    // Create an HTTP server based on Express
    const app = express();
    const server = require('http').createServer(app);

    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
    ```

4. Define an endpoint called `/negotiate`. A writer client hits this endpoint first. This endpoint returns an HTTP response. The response contains an endpoint that the client should use to establish a persistent connection. It also returns a `room` value that the client is assigned to.

    ```javascript
    /*server.js*/
    app.get('/negotiate', async (req, res) => {
        res.json({
            url: endpoint
            room_id: Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 7),
        });
    });

    // Make the Socket.IO server listen on port 3000
    io.httpServer.listen(3000, () => {
        console.log('Visit http://localhost:%d', 3000);
    });
    ```

### Create the Web PubSub for Socket.IO server

1. Import the Web PubSub for Socket.IO SDK and define options:

    [!INCLUDE [Connection string security comment](includes/web-pubsub-connection-string-security-comment.md)]

    ```javascript
    /*server.js*/
    const { useAzureSocketIO } = require("@azure/web-pubsub-socket.io");

    const wpsOptions = {
        hub: "codestream",
        connectionString: process.argv[2]
    }
    ```

2. Create a Web PubSub for Socket.IO server:

    ```javascript
    /*server.js*/

    const io = require("socket.io")();
    useAzureSocketIO(io, wpsOptions);
    ```

The two steps are slightly different from how you would normally create a Socket.IO server, as described in [this Socket.IO documentation](https://socket.io/docs/v4/server-installation/). With these two steps, your server-side code can offload managing persistent connections to an Azure service. With the help of an Azure service, your application server acts *only* as a lightweight HTTP server.

### Implement business logic

Now that you've created a Socket.IO server hosted by Web PubSub, you can define how the clients and server communicate by using Socket.IO's APIs. This process is called implementing business logic.

1. After a client is connected, the application server tells the client that it's logged in by sending a custom event named `login`.

    ```javascript
    /*server.js*/
    io.on('connection', socket => {
        socket.emit("login");
    });
    ```

2. Each client emits two events that the server can respond to: `joinRoom` and `sendToRoom`. After the server gets the `room_id` value that a client wants to join, you use `socket.join` from Socket.IO's API to join the target client to the specified room.

    ```javascript
    /*server.js*/
    socket.on('joinRoom', async (message) => {
        const room_id = message["room_id"];
        await socket.join(room_id);
    });
    ```

3. After a client is joined, the server informs the client of the successful result by sending a `message` event. When the client receives a `message` event with a type of `ackJoinRoom`, the client can ask the server to send the latest editor state.

    ```javascript
    /*server.js*/
    socket.on('joinRoom', async (message) => {
        // ...
        socket.emit("message", {
            type: "ackJoinRoom", 
            success: true 
        })
    });
    ```

    ```javascript
    /*client.js*/
    socket.on("message", (message) => {
        let data = message;
        if (data.type === 'ackJoinRoom' && data.success) {
            sendToRoom(socket, `${room_id}-control`, { data: 'sync'});
        }
        // ... 
    });
    ```

4. When a client sends a `sendToRoom` event to the server, the server broadcasts the *changes to the code editor state* to the specified room. All clients in the room can now receive the latest update.

    ```javascript
    socket.on('sendToRoom', (message) => {
        const room_id = message["room_id"]
        const data = message["data"]

        socket.broadcast.to(room_id).emit("message", {
            type: "editorMessage",
            data: data
        });
    });
    ```

## Write the application's client-side code

Now that the server-side procedures are finished, you can work on the client side.

### Initial setup

You need to create a Socket.IO client to communicate with the server. The question is which server the client should establish a persistent connection with. Because you're using Web PubSub for Socket.IO, the server is an Azure service. Recall that you defined a [/negotiate](#build-an-http-server) route to serve clients an endpoint to Web PubSub for Socket.IO.

```javascript
/*client.js*/

async function initialize(url) {
    let data = await fetch(url).json()

    updateStreamId(data.room_id);

    let editor = createEditor(...); // Create an editor component

    var socket = io(data.url, {
        path: "/clients/socketio/hubs/codestream",
    });

    return [socket, editor, data.room_id];
}
```

The `initialize(url)` function organizes a few setup operations together:

* Fetches the endpoint to an Azure service from your HTTP server
* Creates a Monaco Editor instance
* Establishes a persistent connection with Web PubSub for Socket.IO

### Writer client

As mentioned [earlier](#the-finished-app), you have two user roles on the client side: writer and viewer. Anything that the writer types is streamed to the viewer's screen.  

1. Get the endpoint to Web PubSub for Socket.IO and the `room_id` value:

    ```javascript
    /*client.js*/
    
    let [socket, editor, room_id] = await initialize('/negotiate');
    ```

2. When the writer client is connected with the server, the server sends a `login` event to the writer. The writer can respond by asking the server to join itself to a specified room. Every 200 milliseconds, the writer client sends the latest editor state to the room. A function named `flush` organizes the sending logic.

    ```javascript
    /*client.js*/

    socket.on("login", () => {
        updateStatus('Connected');
        joinRoom(socket, `${room_id}`);
        setInterval(() => flush(), 200);
        // Update editor content
        // ...
    });
    ```

3. If a writer doesn't make any edits, `flush()` does nothing and simply returns. Otherwise, the *changes to the editor state* are sent to the room.

    ```javascript
    /*client.js*/

    function flush() {
        // No changes from editor need to be flushed
        if (changes.length === 0) return;

        // Broadcast the changes made to editor content
        sendToRoom(socket, room_id, {
            type: 'delta',
            changes: changes
            version: version++,
        });

        changes = [];
        content = editor.getValue();
    }
    ```

4. When a new viewer client is connected, the viewer needs to get the latest *complete state* of the editor. To achieve this, a message that contains `sync` data is sent to the writer client. The message asks the writer client to send the complete editor state.

    ```javascript
    /*client.js*/

    socket.on("message", (message) => {
        let data = message.data;
        if (data.data === 'sync') {
            // Broadcast the full content of the editor to the room
            sendToRoom(socket, room_id, {
                type: 'full',
                content: content
                version: version,
            });
        }
    });
    ```

### Viewer client

1. Like the writer client, the viewer client creates its Socket.IO client through `initialize()`. When the viewer client is connected and receives a `login` event from the server, it asks the server to join itself to the specified room. The query `room_id` specifies the room.

    ```javascript
    /*client.js*/

    let [socket, editor] = await initialize(`/register?room_id=${room_id}`)
    socket.on("login", () => {
        updateStatus('Connected');
        joinRoom(socket, `${room_id}`);
    });
    ```

2. When a viewer client receives a `message` event from the server and the data type is `ackJoinRoom`, the viewer client asks the writer client in the room to send the complete editor state.

    ```javascript
    /*client.js*/

    socket.on("message", (message) => {
        let data = message;
        // Ensures the viewer client is connected
        if (data.type === 'ackJoinRoom' && data.success) { 
            sendToRoom(socket, `${id}`, { data: 'sync'});
        } 
        else //...
    });
    ```

3. If the data type is `editorMessage`, the viewer client *updates the editor* according to its actual content.

    ```javascript
    /*client.js*/

    socket.on("message", (message) => {
        ...
        else 
            if (data.type === 'editorMessage') {
            switch (data.data.type) {
                case 'delta':
                    // ... Let editor component update its status
                    break;
                case 'full':
                    // ... Let editor component update its status
                    break;
            }
        }
    });
    ```

4. Implement `joinRoom()` and `sendToRoom()` by using Socket.IO's APIs:

    ```javascript
    /*client.js*/

    function joinRoom(socket, room_id) {
        socket.emit("joinRoom", {
            room_id: room_id,
        });
    }

    function sendToRoom(socket, room_id, data) {
        socket.emit("sendToRoom", {
            room_id: room_id,
            data: data
        });
    }
    ```

## Run the application

### Locate the repo

The preceding sections covered the core logic related to synchronizing the editor state between viewers and the writer. You can find the complete code in the [examples repository](https://aka.ms/awps/sio/sample/codestream).

### Clone the repo

You can clone the repo and run `npm install` to install project dependencies.

### Start the server

```bash
node server.js <web-pubsub-connection-string>
```

This is the connection string that you received in [an earlier step](#get-a-connection-string).

### Play with the real-time code editor

Open `http://localhost:3000` on a browser tab. Open another tab with the URL displayed on the first webpage.

If you write code on the first tab, you should see your typing reflected in real time on the other tab. Web PubSub for Socket.IO facilitates message passing in the cloud. Your `express` server only serves the static `index.html` file and the `/negotiate` endpoint.
