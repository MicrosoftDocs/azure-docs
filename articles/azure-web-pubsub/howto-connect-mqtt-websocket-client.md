# How to connect MQTT clients to Azure Web PubSub

MQTT is a lightweight pub/sub messaging protocol designed for devices with constrained resources.

In this article, we introduce how to connect MQTT clients to the service, so that the clients can publish and subscribe messages.

## Connection parameters

WebSocket connection URI: `wss://{serviceName}.webpubsub.azure.com/clients/mqtt/hubs/{hub}?access_token={token}`.

* {hub} is a mandatory parameter that provides isolation for different applications.
* {token} is required by default. Alternatively, you can include the token in the `Authorization` header in the format `Bearer {token}`. You can bypass the token requirement by enabling anonymous access to the hub. <!--TODO MQTT allow anonymous access to the hub-->

If client library doesn't accept a URI, then you probably need to split the information in the URI into multiple parameters:

* Host: `{serviceName}.webpubsub.azure.com`
* Path: `/clients/mqtt/hubs/{hub}?access_token={token}`
* Port: 443
* Transport: WebSockets with [TLS](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security).

[!INCLUDE [MQTT-Connection-parameters](includes/mqtt-connection-parameters.md)]

By default MQTT clients don't have any permissions to publish or subscribe to any topics. You need to grant [permissions](#permissions) to MQTT clients.

## Permissions

A client can publish to other clients only when it's *authorized* to do so. A client's permissions can be granted when it's being connected or during the lifetime of the connection.

| Role | Permission |
|---|---|
| Not specified | The client can send event requests. |
| `webpubsub.joinLeaveGroup` | The client can join or leave any group. |
| `webpubsub.sendToGroup` | The client can publish messages to any group. |
| `webpubsub.joinLeaveGroup.<group>` | The client can join or leave group `<group>`. |
| `webpubsub.sendToGroup.<group>` | The client can publish messages to group `<group>`. |
| | |

## Authentication and authorization

There are two workflows supported by Web PubSub to authenticate and authorize MQTT clients, so that they have proper permissions.

These workflows can be used individually or in combination. If they're used in together, the auth result in the latter workflow would be honored by the service.

### 1. JWT workflow

This is the default workflow, shown as follows:

![Diagram of MQTT auth workflow with JWT.](./media/howto-connect-mqtt-websocket-client/mqtt-jwt-auth-workflow.png)

1. The client negotiates with your auth server. The auth server contains the authorization middleware, which handles the client request and signs a JWT for the client to connect to the service.
1. The auth server returns the JWT to the client.
1. The client tries to connect to the Web PubSub service with the JWT returned from the auth server. The token can be in either the query string, as `/clients/mqtt/hubs/{hub}?access_token={token}`, or the `Authorization` header, as `Authorization: Bearer {token}`.

#### Supported claims
You could also configure properties for the client connection when generating the access token by specifying special claims inside the JWT:

| Description | Claim type | Claim value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The [permissions](#permissions) the client connection initially has | `role` | the role value defined in [permissions](#permissions) | Specify multiple `role` claims if the client has multiple permissions. |
| The lifetime of the token | `exp` | the expiration time | The `exp` (expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on or after which the token MUST NOT be accepted for processing. |
| The initial groups that the client connection joins once it connects to Azure Web PubSub | `group` | the group to join | Specify multiple `group` claims if the client joins multiple groups. |
| The `userId` for the client connection | `sub` | the userId | Only one `sub` claim is allowed. |

You could also add custom claims into the access token, and these values are preserved as the `claims` property in [connect upstream request body](./reference-mqtt-cloud-events.md#system-connect-event).

[Server SDKs](./howto-generate-client-access-url.md#generate-from-service-sdk) provides APIs to generate the access token for MQTT clients. Note that you must specify the client protocol to `Mqtt`.

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

1. Follow [Getting started with server SDK](./reference-server-sdk-js.md#getting-started) to create a `WebPubSubServiceClient` object `service`

> [!NOTE]
> Generating MQTT client access URL is supported since [version 1.1.3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/web-pubsub/v/1.1.3?activeTab=versions).

2. Generate Client Access URL by calling `WebPubSubServiceClient.getClientAccessToken`:

     ```js
     let token = await serviceClient.getClientAccessToken({ clientProtocol: "mqtt" });
     ```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

1. Follow [Getting started with server SDK](./reference-server-sdk-csharp.md#getting-started) to create a `WebPubSubServiceClient` object `service`

> [!NOTE]
> Generating MQTT client access URL is supported since [version 1.4.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Messaging.WebPubSub/1.4.0).

2. Generate Client Access URL by calling `WebPubSubServiceClient.GetClientAccessUri`:

     ```csharp
     var url = service.GetClientAccessUri(clientProtocol: WebPubSubClientProtocol.Mqtt);
     ```

# [Python](#tab/python)

1. Follow [Getting started with server SDK](./reference-server-sdk-python.md#install-the-package) to create a `WebPubSubServiceClient` object `service`

> [!NOTE]
> Generating MQTT client access URL is supported since [version 1.2.0](https://pypi.org/project/azure-messaging-webpubsubservice/1.2.0/).

2. Generate Client Access URL by calling `WebPubSubServiceClient.get_client_access_token`:

     ```python
     token = service.get_client_access_token(client_protocol="MQTT")
     ```

# [Java](#tab/java)

1. Follow [Getting started with server SDK](./reference-server-sdk-java.md#getting-started) to create a `WebPubSubServiceClient` object `service`

> [!NOTE]
> Generating MQTT client access URL is supported since [version 1.3.0](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-messaging-webpubsub/1.3.0).


2. Generate Client Access URL by calling `WebPubSubServiceClient.getClientAccessToken`:

     ```java
     GetClientAccessTokenOptions option = new GetClientAccessTokenOptions();
     option.setWebPubSubClientProtocol(WebPubSubClientProtocol.MQTT);
     WebPubSubClientAccessToken token = service.getClientAccessToken(option);
     ```

### 2. Upstream server workflow

The MQTT client sends an MQTT CONNECT packet after it establishes a WebSocket connection with the service, then the service calls an API in the upstream server. The upstream server can auth the client according to the username and password fields in the MQTT connection request, and the TLS certificate from the client.

![Diagram of MQTT auth workflow with upstream server](./media/howto-connect-mqtt-websocket-client/mqtt-upstream-auth-workflow.png)

This workflow needs explicit configuration.
* [Tutorial - Authenticate and authorize MQTT clients based on client certificates](./tutorial-upstream-auth-mqtt-client.md)
* For details about how to use upstream server to auth the clients, see [How to configure event handler](./howto-develop-eventhandler.md)

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing failure of connection, or unable to publish or subscribe messages, please check the reason code / return code from the service, or see [How to troubleshoot with resource logs](./howto-troubleshoot-resource-logs.md).
