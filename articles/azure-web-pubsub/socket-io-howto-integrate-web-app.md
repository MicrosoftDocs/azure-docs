# How-to: Build a real-time collaborative whiteboard using Web PubSub for Socket.IO and deploy it to Azure App Service

A new class of applications is reimagining what modern work could be. While [Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/word) brings editors together, [Figma](https://www.figma.com) gathers up designers on the same creative endeavor. This class of applications builds on a user experience that makes us feel connected with our remote collaborators. From a technical point of view, user's activities need to be synchronized across users' screens at a low latency.

## Overview
In this how-to guide, we take a cloud-native approach and use Azure services to build a real-time collaborative whiteboard and we deploy the project as a Web App to Azure App Service. The whiteboard app is accessible in the browser and allows anyone can draw on the same canvas.

## Prerequisites
 
In order to follow the step-by-step guide, you need
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * An [Azure](https://portal.azure.com/) account. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.
> * [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) (version 2.39.0 or higher) or [Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/quickstart.md) to manage Azure resources.

## Create Azure resources using Azure CLI
### Sign in
1. Sign in to Azure CLI by running the following command.
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az login
    ```

1. Create a resource group on Azure.
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group create \
      --location "westus" \  
      --name "<resource-group-name>"
    ```

### Create a Web App resource
1. Create a free App Service plan.
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az appservice plan create \ 
      --resource-group "<resource-group-name>" \ 
      --name "<app-service-plan-name>" \ 
      --sku FREE
      --is-linux
    ```

1. Create a Web App resource 
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az webapp create \
      --resource-group "<resource-group-name>" \
      --name "<webapp-name>" \ 
      --plan "<app-service-plan-name>" \
      --runtime "NODE:16-lts"
    ```

### Create a Web PubSub for Socket.IO
1. Create a Web PubSub resource.
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az webpubsub create \
      --name "<socketio-name>" \
      --resource-group "<resource-group-name>" \
      --kind SocketIO
      --sku Premium_P1
    ```

1. Show and store the value of `primaryConnectionString` somewhere for later use.

    [!INCLUDE [Connection string security comment](includes/web-pubsub-connection-string-security-comment.md)]

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az webpubsub key show \
      --name "<socketio-name>" \
      --resource-group "<resource-group-name>"
    ```

## Get the application code
Run the following command to get a copy of the application code.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/socket.io-webapp-integration
  ```

## Deploy the application to App Service
1. App Service supports many deployment workflows. For this guide, we're going to deploy a ZIP package. Run the following commands to install and build the project.
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build

    # bash
    zip -r app.zip *

    # Powershell
    ```

1. Compress into a zip

    Use Bash
    ```bash
    zip -r app.zip *
    ```

    Use PowerShell
    ```PowerShell
    Compress-Archive -Path * -DestinationPath app.zip
    ```

1. Set Azure Web PubSub connection string in the application settings. Use the value of  `primaryConnectionString` you stored from an earlier step.
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az webapp config appsettings set \
    --resource-group "<resource-group-name>" \
    --name "<webapp-name>" \
    --setting Web_PubSub_ConnectionString="<primaryConnectionString>"
    ```
    
1. Use the following command to deploy it to Azure App Service.
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az webapp deployment source config-zip \
    --resource-group "<resource-group-name>" \
    --name "<webapp-name>" \
    --src app.zip
    ```

## View the whiteboard app in a browser
Now head over to your browser and visit your deployed Web App. The url usually is `https://<webapp-name>.azurewebsites.net` . It's recommended to have multiple browser tabs open so that you can experience the real-time collaborative aspect of the app. Or better, share the link with a colleague or friend.
