# Azure Web PubSub basic concepts

Azure Web PubSub Service helps you build real-time messaging web applications. The clients connect to the service using the [standard WebSocket protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455), and the service empowers the clients to publish and subscribe messages. Moreover, the service exposes [REST APIs](/rest/api/webpubsub) as well as SDKs for you to manage these clients.
