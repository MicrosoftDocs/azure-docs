# Quickstart: Connect to the Azure Web PubSub instance from the browser

Previously we talked about how to create the Web PubSub instance [from the portal](./howto-develop-create-instance.md) or [using Azure CLI](./quickstart-cli-create.md). This quickstart shows you how to get started easily with a [Pub/Sub live demo](https://azure.github.io/azure-webpubsub/demos/clientpubsub.html).

[!INCLUDE [try a simple live demo](includes/try-live-demo.md)]

## Next steps

This quickstart provides you a basic idea of the Web PubSub service. In this quickstart, we leverage the *Client URL Generator* to generate a temporarily available client URL to connect to the service.
