# Monitoring Azure Web PubSub data reference

This article provides a reference of log and metric data collected to analyze the performance and availability of Azure Web PubSub. See the [Monitor Azure Web PubSub](howto-azure-monitor.md) article for details on collecting and analyzing monitoring data for Azure Web PubSub.

## Metrics

Metrics provide insights into the operational state of the service. The available metrics are:

|Metric|Unit|Recommended Aggregation Type|Description|Dimensions|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Connection Close Count|Count|Sum|The count of connections closed by various reasons.|ConnectionCloseCategory|
|Connection Count|Count|Max / Avg|The number of connections to the service.|No Dimensions|
|Connection Open Count|Count|Sum|The count of new connections opened.|No Dimensions|
|Connection Quota Utilization|Percent|Max / Avg|The percentage of connections relative to connection quota.|No Dimensions|
|Inbound Traffic|Bytes|Sum|The inbound traffic to the service.|No Dimensions|
|Outbound Traffic|Bytes|Sum|The outbound traffic from the service.|No Dimensions|
|Server Load|Percent|Max / Avg|The percentage of server load.|No Dimensions|
