# Troubleshooting call end response codes for Calling SDK, Call Automation SDK, PSTN, Chat SDK, and SMS SDK

This article describes troubleshooting call end response codes for Calling SDK, Call Automation, and PSTN calling.

## Troubleshooting tips

Consider the following tips when troubleshooting: 
- Your application isn't receiving an `IncomingCall Event Grid` event: Make sure the application endpoint is [validated with Event Grid](../../../../event-grid/webhook-event-delivery.md) when creating an event subscription. The provisioning status for your event subscription is marked as succeeded if the validation was successful. 
- For error `The field CallbackUri is invalid`: Call Automation doesn't support HTTP endpoints. Make sure the callback URL you provide supports HTTPS.
- The `PlayAudio` action doesn't play anything: Currently only Wave file (.wav) format is supported for audio files. The audio content in the wave file must be mono (single-channel), 16-bit samples with a 16,000 (16 KHz) sampling rate.
- Actions on PSTN endpoints aren't working: For `CreateCall`, `Transfer`, `AddParticipant`, and `Redirect` to phone numbers, you need to set the `SourceCallerId` in the action request. Unless you're using direct routing, the source caller ID must be a phone number owned by your Communication Services resource for the action to succeed.
