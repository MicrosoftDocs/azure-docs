# cameraPermissionDenied UFD
The `cameraPermissionDenied` UFD event with a `true` value occurs when the SDK detects that the camera permission was denied either at browser layer or at Operating System level.

| cameraPermissionDenied                | Details                |
| --------------------------------------|------------------------|
| UFD type                              | MediaDiagnostics       |
| value type                            | DiagnosticFlag         |
| possible values                       | true, false            |

## Example code to catch a cameraPermissionDenied UFD event
```typescript
call.feature(Features.UserFacingDiagnostics).media.on('diagnosticChanged', (diagnosticInfo) => {
    if (diagnosticInfo.diagnostic === 'cameraPermissionDenied') {
       if (diagnosticInfo.value === true) {
           // show a warning message on UI
       } else {
           // The cameraPermissionDenied UFD recovered, notify the user
       }
    }
});
```
## How to mitigate or resolve
Your application should invoke `DeviceManager.askDevicePermission` before the call starts to check whether the permission was granted or not.
If the permission to use the camera is denied, the application should display a message on your user interface.
Additionally, your application should acquire camera browser permission before listing the available camera devices.
If there's no permission granted, the application is unable to get the detailed information of the camera devices on the user's system.

The camera permission can also be revoked during a call, so your application should also subscribe to events from the User Facing Diagnostics events to display a message on the user interface.
Users can then take steps to resolve the issue on their own, such as enabling the browser permission or checking whether they disabled the camera access at OS level.

> [!NOTE]
> Some browser platforms cache the permission results.

If a user denied the permission at browser layer previously, invoking `askDevicePermission` API doesn't trigger the permission UI prompt, but it can know the permission was denied.
Your application should show instructions and ask the user to reset or grant the browser camera permission manually.
