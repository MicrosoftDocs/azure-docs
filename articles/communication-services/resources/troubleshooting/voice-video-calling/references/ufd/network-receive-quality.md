# networkReceiveQuality UFD
The `networkReceiveQuality` UFD event with a `Bad` value indicates the presence of network quality issues for incoming streams, as detected by the ACS Calling SDK.
This event suggests that there may be problems with the network connection between the local endpoint and remote endpoint.
When this UFD event fires with a`Bad` value, the user may experience degraded audio quality.

| networkReceiveQualityUFD | Details                |
| -------------------------|------------------------|
| UFD type                 | NetworkDiagnostics     |
| value type               | DiagnosticQuality      |
| possible values          | Good, Poor, Bad        |

## Example
```typescript
call.feature(Features.UserFacingDiagnostics).network.on('diagnosticChanged', (diagnosticInfo) => {
    if (diagnosticInfo.diagnostic === 'networkReceiveQuality') {
       if (diagnosticInfo.value === DiagnosticQuality.Bad) {
           // network receive quality bad, show a warning message on UI
       } else if (diagnosticInfo.value === DiagnosticQuality.Poor) {
           // network receive quality poor, notify the user
       } else if (diagnosticInfo.value === DiagnosticQuality.Good) {
           // network receive quality recovered, notify the user
       }
    }
});
```
## How to mitigate or resolve
From the perspective of the ACS Calling SDK, network issues are considered external problems.
To solve network issues, you need to understand the network topology and identify the nodes that are causing the problem.
These parts involve network infrastructure, which is outside the scope of the ACS Calling SDK.

Your application should subscribe to events from the User Facing Diagnostics.
Display a message on your user interface that informs users of network quality issues and potential audio quality degradation.
