# CreateView timeout
When the calling SDK expects to receive video frames but there are no incoming video frames,
the SDK detects this issue and throws an createView timeout error.

This error is unexpected from SDK's perspective. This error indicates a discrepancy between signaling and media transport.
## How to detect using SDK
When there's a `create view timeout` issue, the  [`createView`](/javascript/api/azure-communication-services/@azure/communication-calling/videostreamrenderer?view=azure-communication-services-js&preserve-view=true#@azure-communication-calling-videostreamrenderer-createview) API throws an error.

## Reasons behind createView timeout failures and how to mitigate the issue
### The video sender's browser is in the background
Some mobile devices don't send any video frames when the browser is in the background or a user locks the screen.
The  [`createView`](/javascript/api/azure-communication-services/@azure/communication-calling/videostreamrenderer?view=azure-communication-services-js&preserve-view=true#@azure-communication-calling-videostreamrenderer-createview) API detects no incoming video frames and considers this situation a subscription failure, therefore, it throws a createView timeout error.
No further detailed information is available because currently the SDK doesn't support notifying receivers that the sender's browser is in the background.

Your application can implement its own detection mechanism and notify the participants in a call when the sender's browser goes back to foreground.
The participants can subscribe the video again.
A feasible but less elegant approach for handling this createView timeout error is to continuously retry invoking the  [`createView`](/javascript/api/azure-communication-services/@azure/communication-calling/videostreamrenderer?view=azure-communication-services-js&preserve-view=true#@azure-communication-calling-videostreamrenderer-createview) API until it succeeds.

### The video sender dropped from the call unexpectedly
Some users might end the call by terminating the browser process instead of by hanging up.
The server is unaware that the user dropped the call until the timeout of 40 seconds ended.
The participant remains on roster list until the server removes it at the end of the timeout (40 seconds).
If other participants try to subscribe to a video from the user who dropped from the call unexpectedly, they get an error as no incoming video frames are received.
No further detailed information is available. The server maintains the participants in the roster list even if no answer is received from them, until the timeout period ends.


### The video sender has network issues
If the video sender has network issues during the time other participants are subscribing to their video the video, subscription may fail.
This error is unexpected on the video receiver's side.
For example, if the sender experiences a temporary network disconnection, other participants are unable to receive video frames from the sender. 

A workaround approach for handling this createView timeout error is to continuously retry invoking  [`createView`](/javascript/api/azure-communication-services/@azure/communication-calling/videostreamrenderer?view=azure-communication-services-js&preserve-view=true#@azure-communication-calling-videostreamrenderer-createview) API until it succeeds when this network event is happening.

### The video receiver has network issues
Similar to the sender's network issues, if a video receiver has network issues the video subscription may fail.
This issue could be due to high packet loss rate or temporary network connection errors.
The SDK can detect network disconnection and fires a [`networkReconnect`](../../../../concepts/voice-video-calling/user-facing-diagnostics.md?pivots=platform-web#network-values) UFD event.
However, in a WebRTC call, the default `STUN connectivity check` triggers a disconnection event if there's no response from the other party after around 10-15 seconds.




This means if there's a [`networkReconnect`](../../../../concepts/voice-video-calling/user-facing-diagnostics.md?pivots=platform-web#network-values) UFD, the receiver side might not have received packets for already 15 seconds.

If there are network issues from the connection on the receiver's side, your application should subscribe to the video after [`networkReconnect`](../../../../concepts/voice-video-calling/user-facing-diagnostics.md?pivots=platform-web#network-values) UFD is recovered.
You'll likely have limited control over network issues. Thus, we advise monitoring the network information and presenting the information on the user interface. You should also consider monitoring your client [media quality and network status](../../../../concepts/voice-video-calling/media-quality-sdk.md?pivots=platform-web) and make necessary changes to your client as needed. For instance, you might consider automatically turning off incoming video streams when you notice that the client is experience degraded network performance.
