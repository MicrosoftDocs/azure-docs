## Understanding calling codes and subcodes 
### When are error codes received?
Error codes for Call Automation can come either as synchronous responses to API calls or asynchronous responses via the provided callback URI. In the synchronous situation, if an API call is made and it'sn't accepted, ACS will provide an error code describing why the API call was rejected. In asynchronous scenarios if an API call is made and is accepted but something still goes wrong, both a callback event and an error code are received. An example of a common callback event for call failures would be the `callDisconnected` event that is surfaced whenever a call is disconnected. Once the `callDisconnected` event is received, there won't be any more callback events for that given call. For a list of call signaling callback events see ([this page](../../../../../concepts/call-automation/call-automation.md#call-automation-webhook-events)), and for a list of callback events for media actions see ([this page](../../../../../how-tos/call-automation/control-mid-call-media-actions.md)). 

### Error Code Syntax 
Error codes, subcodes, and corresponding result categories help developers identify and diagnose errors. Error code details include: 

**Code** - are 3 digit integers representing client or server response status. The code categories: 
- Successful responses (200-299) 
- Client error (400-499) 
- Server error (500-599) 
- Global error (600-699) 

**Subcode** - Are defined as an integer, where each number indicates a unique reason, specific to a group of scenarios or specific scenario outcome. 

**Message** - Describes the outcome and provides hints how to mitigate the problem if an outcome is a failure. 

In addition to the code and subcode, more detailed troubleshooting information can be found in the call logs. To learn more about how to enable and access calling logs, see [this page](../../../../../concepts/analytics/enable-logging.md) for detailed guidance. 

## Call Automation SDK error codes

The following table contains the most common codes and subcodes. If your error isn't in this table, refer to the generic codes and subcodes to get more information about your specific scenario.

### Call Automation error codes

| Callback Event                   | Code | Subcode | Description                                                                                             | Mitigation |
|----------------------------------|------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| CreateCallFailed / AnswerFailed | 404  | 8522    | A generic error code that indicates that the resource isn't found. Resources can include calls and participants. | Double check call status: the call may have already ended, or the participant has left the call. |
| CreateCallFailed / AnswerFailed | 400  | 8523    | A generic error code that indicates that something in the request body is invalid. | Check to make sure all of the parameters are valid. Refer to the error message to determine which parameter is throwing the error. |
| AnswerFailed                    | 400  | 8501    | Action Not Supported Call Not Established | The action associated with the error message was activated while the call was not active. Ensure that new call actions aren't initiated after the call has been disconnected. This error could also result from actions invoked while the call is active if they're close to the call disconnected time. |
| AnswerFailed                    | 400  | 8500    | Invalid Media Mode | Check the status of your media operations to see if any of them are already active, or if target participant is already in a media operation. If there's an active media operation, wait for the operation to finish and then retry. |
| CallDisconnected                | 400  | 8559    | Action Not Supported Only One Single Dialout App Allowed | Duplicate start recording request, recording already initiated or in progress. Double check recording status to ensure it's inactive before submitting a new start recording call. |
| AnswerFailed                    | 400  | 8528    | Action not supported call terminated | The action associated with the error message was activated while the call was terminated. Ensure that new call actions aren't initiated after the call is terminated. This error could also result from actions invoked while the call is active if they're close to the call termination time. |
| CreateCallFailed / ConnectFailed | 409 | 8519    | Conflict | Check to make sure multiple actions aren't being performed on the same resource in parallel. Refer to error message to identify which two actions are in conflict. |
| CreateCallFailed               | 403  | 7507    | Call Source Identity Invalid | Application identity from authorization token didn't match application identity in call source. Check to make sure you're using the connection string from the ACS resource the incoming call webhook was configured in (the phone number has to be owned by the same ACS resource answering the call). |
| CreateCallFailed               | 403  | 7504    | Insufficient Application Permissions | Generic code for insufficient permissions, check error message for context on what resource is lacking permissions. |
| AnswerFailed                    | 400  | 8585    | Action Not Valid In Current Call State | Call isn't established or is disconnected: wait for the call to be established before retrying the media action. |
| CreateCallFailed               | 405  | 8520    | Functionality not supported at this time | Expected Error: Workflow not currently supported. Check our release blog to see if there's an updated SDK that has enabled these functionalities. See the Call Automation known limitations page for a list of not supported workflows. |
| CreateCallFailed               | 412  | 8583    | Precondition Failed | Reference [this page](../../../../../how-tos/call-automation/control-mid-call-media-actions.md#media-action-compatibility-table) listing incompatible media actions to ensure you aren't running or queueing incompatible actions. |
| CreateCallFailed               | 400  | 8567    | ACS Resource Service Principal Not Enabled | The Azure Cognitive Service Resource isn't configured properly. See this [page](../../../../../concepts/call-automation/azure-communication-services-azure-cognitive-services-integration.md) for a guide on setting up your Azure Cognitive Service Resource. |
| CreateCallFailed               | 405  | 8522    | Missing configuration | Check error message for more context on which configuration needs to be established. This configuration needs to happen when invoking the AnswerCall API. |
| CallDisconnected               | 200  | 0       | Call ended successfully by the local participant. | No action needed; call ended as expected. |
| CallDisconnected               | 200  | 4521    | Participant abruptly disconnected (e.g., closed app, tab, or browser without hanging up). | Recommend graceful hang-up logic in client. Use client logs to verify if app was force-closed. |
| CallDisconnected               | 200  | 5000    | Participant removed by another participant. | Check call control logic for removal operations. Confirm if the removal was intentional. |
| CallDisconnected               | 200  | 5010    | Call ended because only one participant remained. | This is expected behavior. Rejoin with multiple participants if call was meant to continue. |
| CallDisconnected               | 200  | 5013    | Call ended because no one else joined the group call. | Check timing of participant joins. |
| CallDisconnected               | 200  | 7000    | Call ended by Azure Communication Services Call Automation or a server-side bot. | Confirm if bot logic triggered end of call. Review bot implementation and call flow. |
| CallDisconnected               | 200  | 7015    | Call ended by service after successful transfer. | No action needed; call was terminated as part of expected transfer behavior. |
| CallDisconnected               | 487  | 0       | Call ended successfully as caller canceled the call. | No action needed. Ensure cancellation is intentional. |
| CallDisconnected               | 487  | 10003   | Call was accepted by another endpoint (e.g. different bot answered the call). Ensure bots only answer calls directed to them.| Application logic should check for endpoint priority or re-route logic. |
| CallDisconnected               | 487  | 10024   | Call was declined by all callee endpoints. | No action needed. |
| CallDisconnected               | 500  | 10045   | Azure Communication Services infrastructure error. | Capture logs and contact support if issue persists. |

| CreateCallFailed               | 480  | 560480  | No answer from callee. | Confirm user availability. |
| CreateCallFailed               | 487  | 540487  | Call canceled by the originator. | No action needed. Verify the source application canceled the call as intended. |
| ConnectFailed                  | 408  | 10057   | Timeout during meeting join or call acceptance. | Validate participant's presence and client readiness. |
| ConnectFailed                  | 429  | 10110   | Maximum call duration exceeded. | Review call duration policies. Consider scheduling reconnection if needed. |
| ConnectFailed                  | 480  | 10076   | Target user registered but offline. | Target must be online. Confirm app status or fallback to voicemail or async message. |
| ConnectFailed                  | 484  | 560484  | Invalid or incomplete callee address. | Validate callee identifier (e.g., phone number, ACS ID). Correct and retry. |

## SIP and Q.850 Diagnostic Codes in Callback Events

Call Automation callback events now support **low-level diagnostic data** via `SipDetails` and `Q850Details` fields, added to the existing `ResultInformation` object.  
These diagnostics surface protocol-level insights from the **telecom signaling layer**, helping troubleshoot issues such as call drops, unreachable destinations, or unexpected rejections in PSTN and SIP/VoIP scenarios.

---

### Availability

> [!NOTE]
> The presence of `SipDetails` and `Q850Details` is **entirely dependent** on whether the involved SBC or telecom carrier provides this information.  
>
> If the Session Border Control (SBC)/carrier returns relevant diagnostics after a corresponding call automation signaling request, the resulting event will include `SipDiagnosticInfo` within `ResultInformation`.

---

### Affected Events

The following events may include `SipDiagnosticInfo` in their `ResultInformation`:

- `RemoveParticipantsFailed`
- `AddParticipantsFailed`
- `CreateCallFailed`
- `AnswerFailed`
- `CallDisconnected`
- `TransferFailed`
- `CanAddParticipantFailed`

In practice, **any callback event containing `ResultInformation`** can carry these diagnostics when provided by the SBC/carrier.

---

### Structure

Each diagnostic is represented as an object:

| Property  | Type    | Description                                   |
|-----------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `Code`    | Integer | SIP or Q.850 code (e.g., `486`, `16`)         |
| `Message` | String  | Human-readable reason (e.g., "Busy Here")     |

These fields are optional and appear only when supplied by the SBC/carrier.

---

### Example

```json
{
  "ResultInformation": {
    "Code": 500,
    "SubCode": 560503,
    "Message": "Unexpected server error",
    "SipDetails": {
      "Code": 486,
      "Message": "Busy Here"
    },
    "Q850Details": {
      "Code": 17,
      "Message": "User busy"
    }
  }
}
```
