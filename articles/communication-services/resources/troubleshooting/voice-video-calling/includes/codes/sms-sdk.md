## SMS error codes

The SMS SDK uses the following error codes to help you troubleshoot SMS issues. The error codes are exposed through the `DeliveryStatusDetails` field in the SMS delivery report. 

| Code | Message | Advice |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2000 | Message Delivered Successfully. |  |
| 4000 | Message is rejected due to fraud detection. | Ensure you aren't exceeding the maximum number of messages allowed for your number. |
| 4001 | Message is rejected due to invalid Source/From number format| Ensure the To number is in E.164 format and From number format is in E.164 or Short code format. |
| 4002 | Message is rejected due to invalid Destination/To number format. | Ensure the To number is in E.164 format |
| 4003 | Message failed to deliver due to unsupported destination. | Check if the destination you're trying to send to is supported. |
| 4004 | Message failed to deliver since Destination/To number doesn't exist. | Ensure the To number you're sending to is valid. |
| 4005 | Message blocked by Destination carrier. |  |
| 4006 | The Destination/To number isn't reachable. | Try resending the message at a later time. |
| 4007 | The Destination/To number opted out of receiving messages from you. | Mark the Destination/To number as opted out so that no further message attempts are made to the number. |
