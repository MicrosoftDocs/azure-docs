# Teams License requirements to use Azure Communication Services support for Teams users

To use Azure Communication Services support for Teams users, you need a Microsoft Entra instance with users that have a valid Teams license. Furthermore, license must be assigned to the administrators or relevant users. Also, note that [MSA accounts (personal Microsoft accounts)](/entra/external-id/microsoft-account) are not supported.

### How to find assigned service plans and products?

You can find your current service plans and licenses using [licenseDetails](/graph/api/resources/licensedetails) Microsoft Graph API that returns licenses assigned to a user. Or you can find product names in [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/LicensesMenuBlade/Products) or the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).
