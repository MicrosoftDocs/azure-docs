4. Choose the **Country/region** where you would like to provision the phone number. Country/region availability is based on the billing location for your Azure subscription. More information on what numbers are available for each country/region can be found [here](../../../concepts/numbers/sub-eligibility-number-capability.md). Next you'll choose the [number type](../../../concepts/telephony/plan-solution.md#phone-number-types-in-azure-communication-services). You can select from two phone number types: **Local**, and **Toll-free**.

5. Select **Search** to pull up numbers that meet your selected criteria. You have various filters to search for the number that fits your needs, including:

   - **Use case**: This is for whether you are using this number to call from an application (A2P) or from a human agent (P2P).
   - **Calling**: This is for determining the Calling capabilities you would like for your phone number: Making calls and/or receiving calls. 
   - **SMS**: This is for determining the SMS capabilities you would like for your phone number: Sending and/or receiving SMS messages.
   - **Custom**: You can also add custom filters to get a certain prefix or set of digits in your phone number.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The prices shown are the **monthly recurring charges** which cover the cost of leasing the selected phone number to you. Not included in this view is the **Pay-as-you-go costs** which are incurred when you make or receive calls. The price lists are [available here](../../../concepts/pricing.md). These costs depend on number type and destinations called. For example, price-per-minute for a call from a Seattle regional number to a regional number in New York and a call from the same number to a UK mobile number may be different.

7. Select **Next** to review your purchase. To complete your purchase, select **Buy now**.
