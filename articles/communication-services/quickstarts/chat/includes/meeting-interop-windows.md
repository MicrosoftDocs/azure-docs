This article describes how to chat in a Teams meeting using the Azure Communication Services Chat SDK for C#.

## Sample code

Download this code at GitHub Azure Samples [Join your chat app to a Teams meeting](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-dotnet-quickstarts/tree/main/ChatTeamsInteropQuickStart).

## Prerequisites 

* Aâ€¯[Teams deployment](/deployoffice/teams-install). 
* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).  
* Install [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with Universal Windows Platform development workload.  
* A deployed Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](../../create-communication-resource.md). 
* A Teams Meeting Link.

## Joining the meeting chat 

A Communication Services user can join a Teams meeting anonymously using the Calling SDK. Joining the meeting also adds them as a participant to the meeting chat. In chat they can send and receive messages with other users in the meeting. The user doesn't have access to chat messages that were sent before they joined the meeting. They can't send or receive messages after the meeting ends. To enable users to join the Teams meetings and start chatting, complete the following steps.

## Run the code

You can build and run the code on Visual Studio. The supported solution platforms are: `x64`,`x86`, and `ARM64`. 

1. Open an instance of PowerShell, Windows Terminal, Command Prompt, or equivalent and navigate to the directory that you'd like to clone the sample to.
2. `git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Communication-Services-dotnet-quickstarts.git`
3. Open the project `ChatTeamsInteropQuickStart/ChatTeamsInteropQuickStart.csproj` in Visual Studio.
4. Install the following NuGet packages versions (or higher):

   ``` csharp
   Install-Package Azure.Communication.Calling -Version 1.0.0-beta.29
   Install-Package Azure.Communication.Chat -Version 1.1.0
   Install-Package Azure.Communication.Common -Version 1.0.1
   Install-Package Azure.Communication.Identity -Version 1.0.1

   ```

5. With the Communication Services resource procured in prerequisites, add the connectionstring to the **ChatTeamsInteropQuickStart/MainPage.xaml.cs** file. 

   ``` csharp
   //Azure Communication Services resource connection string, i.e., = "endpoint=https://your-resource.communication.azure.net/;accesskey=your-access-key";
   private const string connectionString_ = "";
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > * Select the proper platform from the **Solution Platforms** dropdown list in Visual Studio <b>before</b> running the code, such as `x64`
   > * Make sure you enable *Developer Mode* in Windows [(Developer Settings)](/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development)
   >  
   >  *The next steps don't work if the platform isn't configured correctly.*

6. Press **F5** to start the project in debugging mode.
7. Paste a valid teams meeting link on the **Teams Meeting Link** box (see the next section).
8. End users click **Join Teams meeting** to start chatting.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once the calling SDK establishes a connection with the teams meeting [See Communication Services calling Windows app](../../voice-video-calling/getting-started-with-calling.md), the key functions to handle chat operations are: `StartPollingForChatMessages` and `SendMessageButton_Click`. Both code snippets are in the `ChatTeamsInteropQuickStart\MainPage.xaml.cs` file 

```csharp
        /// <summary>
        /// Background task that keeps polling for chat messages while the call connection is established
        /// </summary>
        private async Task StartPollingForChatMessages()
        {
            CommunicationTokenCredential communicationTokenCredential = new(user_token_);
            chatClient_ = new ChatClient(EndPointFromConnectionString(), communicationTokenCredential);
            await Task.Run(async () =>
            {
                keepPolling_ = true;

                ChatThreadClient chatThreadClient = chatClient_.GetChatThreadClient(thread_Id_);
                int previousTextMessages = 0;
                while (keepPolling_)
                {
                    try
                    {
                        CommunicationUserIdentifier currentUser = new(user_Id_);
                        AsyncPageable<ChatMessage> allMessages = chatThreadClient.GetMessagesAsync();
                        SortedDictionary<long, string> messageList = new();
                        int textMessages = 0;
                        string userPrefix;
                        await foreach (ChatMessage message in allMessages)
                        {
                            if (message.Type == ChatMessageType.Html || message.Type == ChatMessageType.Text)
                            {
                                textMessages++;
                                userPrefix = message.Sender.Equals(currentUser) ? "[you]:" : "";
                                messageList.Add(long.Parse(message.SequenceId), $"{userPrefix}{StripHtml(message.Content.Message)}");
                            }
                        }

                        //Update UI just when there are new messages
                        if (textMessages > previousTextMessages)
                        {
                            previousTextMessages = textMessages;
                            await Dispatcher.RunAsync(CoreDispatcherPriority.Normal, () =>
                            {
                                TxtChat.Text = string.Join(Environment.NewLine, messageList.Values.ToList());
                            });

                        }
                        if (!keepPolling_)
                        {
                            return;
                        }

                        await SetInCallState(true);
                        await Task.Delay(3000);
                    }
                    catch (Exception e)
                    {
                        await Dispatcher.RunAsync(CoreDispatcherPriority.Normal, () =>
                        {
                            _ = new MessageDialog($"An error occurred while fetching messages in PollingChatMessagesAsync(). The application will shutdown. Details : {e.Message}").ShowAsync();
                            throw e;
                        });
                        await SetInCallState(false);
                    }
                }
            });
        }
        private async void SendMessageButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            SendMessageButton.IsEnabled = false;
            ChatThreadClient chatThreadClient = chatClient_.GetChatThreadClient(thread_Id_);
            _ = await chatThreadClient.SendMessageAsync(TxtMessage.Text);
            
            TxtMessage.Text = "";
            SendMessageButton.IsEnabled = true;
        }
```

## Get a Teams meeting link

Retrieve the Teams meeting link using Graph APIs, as described in [Graph documentation](/graph/api/onlinemeeting-createorget?tabs=http&view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). This link is returned as part of the `onlineMeeting` resource, accessible under the [`joinWebUrl` property](/graph/api/resources/onlinemeeting?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). 

You can also get the required meeting link from the **Join Meeting** URL in the Teams meeting invite itself.

A Teams meeting link looks like the following URL:

   ```html
   https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/meeting_chat_thread_id/1606337455313?context=some_context_here`.
   ```

If your Teams link has a different format, you need to retrieve the thread ID using the Graph API.
