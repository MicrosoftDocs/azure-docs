## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-jdk-install) version 8 or above.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- Create an Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Create an Azure Communication Services resource](../../create-communication-resource.md). You need to record your resource **endpoint and connection string** for this article.
- A [User Access Token](../../identity/access-tokens.md). Be sure to set the scope to **chat**, and **note the token string as well as the user_id string**. You can also use the Azure CLI and run the following command with your connection string to create a user and an access token.

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az communication identity token issue --scope chat --connection-string "yourConnectionString"
  ```

  For details, see [Use Azure CLI to Create and Manage Access Tokens](../../identity/access-tokens.md?pivots=platform-azcli).

## Set up

### Create a new Java application

Open your terminal or command window and navigate to the directory where you would like to create your Java application. Run the following command to generate the Java project from the `maven-archetype-quickstart` template.

```console
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.communication.quickstart -DartifactId=communication-quickstart -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false
```

The `generate` goal is created a directory with the same name as the `artifactId`. Under this directory, the `src/main/java directory` contains the project source code, the `src/test/java` directory contains the test source, and the `pom.xml` file is the project's Project Object Model, or [POM](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html).

Update your application's POM file to use Java 8 or higher:

```xml
<properties>
    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
    <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
```

### Add the package references for the Chat SDK

In your POM file, reference the `azure-communication-chat` package with the Chat APIs:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-communication-chat</artifactId>
    <version><!-- Please refer to https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure/azure-communication-chat for the latest version --></version>
</dependency>
```

For authentication, your client needs to reference the `azure-communication-common` package:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-communication-common</artifactId>
    <version><!-- Please refer to https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure/azure-communication-common for the latest version --></version>
</dependency>
```

## Object model

The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the Azure Communication Services Chat SDK for Java.

| Name                                  | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ChatClient | This class is needed for the Chat functionality. You instantiate it with your subscription information, and use it to create, get, and delete threads. |
| ChatAsyncClient | This class is needed for the asynchronous Chat functionality. You instantiate it with your subscription information, and use it to create, get, and delete threads. |
| ChatThreadClient | This class is needed for the Chat Thread functionality. You obtain an instance via the ChatClient, and use it to send/receive/update/delete messages, add/remove/get users, send typing notifications and read receipts. |
| ChatThreadAsyncClient | This class is needed for the asynchronous Chat Thread functionality. You obtain an instance via the ChatAsyncClient, and use it to send/receive/update/delete messages, add/remove/get users, send typing notifications and read receipts. |

## Create a chat client
To create a chat client, use the Communications Service endpoint and the access token that was generated as part of prerequisite steps. User access tokens enable you to build client applications that directly authenticate to Azure Communication Services. Once you generate these tokens on your server, pass them back to a client device. You need to use the CommunicationTokenCredential class from the Common SDK to pass the token to your chat client.

Learn more about [Chat Architecture](../../../concepts/chat/concepts.md)

When adding the import statements, be sure to only add imports from the com.azure.communication.chat and com.azure.communication.chat.models namespaces, and not from the com.azure.communication.chat.implementation namespace. In the App.java file that was generated via Maven, you can use the following code to begin with:

```Java
package com.communication.quickstart;

import com.azure.communication.chat.*;
import com.azure.communication.chat.models.*;
import com.azure.communication.common.*;
import com.azure.core.http.rest.PagedIterable;

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class App
{
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws IOException
    {
        System.out.println("Azure Communication Services - Chat Quickstart");

        // Your unique Azure Communication service endpoint
        String endpoint = "<replace with your resource endpoint>";

        // User access token fetched from your trusted service
        String userAccessToken = "<USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>";

        // Create a CommunicationTokenCredential with the given access token, which is only valid until the token is valid
        CommunicationTokenCredential userCredential = new CommunicationTokenCredential(userAccessToken);

        // Initialize the chat client
        final ChatClientBuilder builder = new ChatClientBuilder();
        builder.endpoint(endpoint)
            .credential(userCredential);
        ChatClient chatClient = builder.buildClient();
    }
}
```

## Start a chat thread

Use the `createChatThread` method to create a chat thread.
`createChatThreadOptions` is used to describe the thread request.

- Use the `topic` parameter of the constructor to give a topic to this chat; Topic can be updated after the chat thread is created using the `UpdateThread` function.
- Use `participants` to list the thread participants to be added to the thread. `ChatParticipant` takes the user you created in [User Access Token](../../identity/access-tokens.md).

`CreateChatThreadResult` is the response returned from creating a chat thread.
It contains a `getChatThread()` method, which returns the `ChatThread` object that can be used to get the thread client from which you can get the `ChatThreadClient` for performing operations on the created thread: add participants, send message, etc.
The `ChatThread` object also contains the `getId()` method, which retrieves the unique ID of the thread.

```Java
CommunicationUserIdentifier identity1 = new CommunicationUserIdentifier("<USER_1_ID>");
CommunicationUserIdentifier identity2 = new CommunicationUserIdentifier("<USER_2_ID>");

ChatParticipant firstThreadParticipant = new ChatParticipant()
    .setCommunicationIdentifier(identity1)
    .setDisplayName("Participant Display Name 1");

ChatParticipant secondThreadParticipant = new ChatParticipant()
    .setCommunicationIdentifier(identity2)
    .setDisplayName("Participant Display Name 2");

CreateChatThreadOptions createChatThreadOptions = new CreateChatThreadOptions("Topic")
    .addParticipant(firstThreadParticipant)
    .addParticipant(secondThreadParticipant);

CreateChatThreadResult result = chatClient.createChatThread(createChatThreadOptions);
String chatThreadId = result.getChatThread().getId();
```

## List chat threads

Use the `listChatThreads` method to retrieve a list of existing chat threads.

```java
PagedIterable<ChatThreadItem> chatThreads = chatClient.listChatThreads();

chatThreads.forEach(chatThread -> {
    System.out.printf("ChatThread id is %s.\n", chatThread.getId());
});
```

## Get a chat thread client

The `getChatThreadClient` method returns a thread client for a thread that already exists. It can be used for performing operations on the created thread: add participants, send message, etc.
`chatThreadId` is the unique ID of the existing chat thread.

```Java
ChatThreadClient chatThreadClient = chatClient.getChatThreadClient(chatThreadId);
```

## Send a message to a chat thread

Use the `sendMessage` method to send a message to the thread you created, identified by chatThreadId.
`sendChatMessageOptions` is used to describe the chat message request.

- Use `content` to provide the chat message content.
- Use `type` to specify the chat message content type, `TEXT` or `HTML`.
- Use `senderDisplayName` to specify the display name of the sender.
- Use `metadata` optionally to include any other data you want to send along with the message. This field provides a mechanism for developers to extend chat message functionality and add custom information for your use case. For example, when sharing a file link in the message, you might want to add `hasAttachment:true` in metadata so that recipient's application can parse that and display accordingly.

The response `sendChatMessageResult` contains an `id`, which is the unique ID of the message.

```Java
Map<String, String> metadata = new HashMap<String, String>();
metadata.put("hasAttachment", "true");
metadata.put("attachmentUrl", "https://contoso.com/files/attachment.docx");

SendChatMessageOptions sendChatMessageOptions = new SendChatMessageOptions()
    .setContent("Please take a look at the attachment")
    .setType(ChatMessageType.TEXT)
    .setSenderDisplayName("Sender Display Name")
    .setMetadata(metadata);

SendChatMessageResult sendChatMessageResult = chatThreadClient.sendMessage(sendChatMessageOptions);
String chatMessageId = sendChatMessageResult.getId();
```

## Receive chat messages from a chat thread

You can retrieve chat messages by polling the `listMessages` method on the chat thread client at specified intervals.

```Java
chatThreadClient.listMessages().forEach(message -> {
    System.out.printf("Message id is %s.\n", message.getId());
});
```

`listMessages` returns the latest version of the message, including any edits or deletes that happened to the message using `.editMessage()` and `.deleteMessage()`. For deleted messages, `chatMessage.getDeletedOn()` returns a datetime value indicating when that message was deleted. For edited messages, `chatMessage.getEditedOn()` returns a datetime indicating when the message was edited. The original time of message creation can be accessed using `chatMessage.getCreatedOn()`, and it can be used for ordering the messages.

Read more about message types here: [Message Types](../../../concepts/chat/concepts.md#message-types).

## Send read receipt

Use the `sendReadReceipt` method to post a read receipt event to a chat thread, on behalf of a user.
`chatMessageId` is the unique ID of the chat message that was read.

```Java
String chatMessageId = message.getId();
chatThreadClient.sendReadReceipt(chatMessageId);
```

## List chat participants

Use `listParticipants` to retrieve a paged collection containing the participants of the chat thread identified by chatThreadId.

```Java
PagedIterable<ChatParticipant> chatParticipantsResponse = chatThreadClient.listParticipants();
chatParticipantsResponse.forEach(chatParticipant -> {
    System.out.printf("Participant id is %s.\n", ((CommunicationUserIdentifier) chatParticipant.getCommunicationIdentifier()).getId());
});
```

## Add a user as participant to the chat thread

Once a chat thread is created, you can then add and remove users from it. By adding users, you give them access to send messages to the chat thread, and add/remove other participants. You need to start by getting a new access token and identity for that user. Before calling `addParticipants` method, ensure that you acquired a new access token and identity for that user. The user needs that access token to initialize their chat client.

Use the `addParticipants` method to add participants to the thread.

- `communicationIdentifier`, required, is the CommunicationIdentifier you created by the CommunicationIdentityClient in [User Access Token](../../identity/access-tokens.md).
- `displayName`, optional, is the display name for the thread participant.
- `shareHistoryTime`, optional, is the time from which the chat history is shared with the participant. To share history since the inception of the chat thread, set this property to any date equal to, or less than the thread creation time. To share no history previous to when the participant was added, set it to the current date. To share partial history, set it to the required date.

```Java
List<ChatParticipant> participants = new ArrayList<ChatParticipant>();

CommunicationUserIdentifier identity3 = new CommunicationUserIdentifier("<USER_3_ID>");
CommunicationUserIdentifier identity4 = new CommunicationUserIdentifier("<USER_4_ID>");

ChatParticipant thirdThreadParticipant = new ChatParticipant()
    .setCommunicationIdentifier(identity3)
    .setDisplayName("Display Name 3");

ChatParticipant fourthThreadParticipant = new ChatParticipant()
    .setCommunicationIdentifier(identity4)
    .setDisplayName("Display Name 4");

participants.add(thirdThreadParticipant);
participants.add(fourthThreadParticipant);

chatThreadClient.addParticipants(participants);
```
