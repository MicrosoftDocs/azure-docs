## Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure to:

- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. For details, see [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) Active LTS and Maintenance LTS versions.
- Create an Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Create an Azure Communication Services resource](../../create-communication-resource.md). You'll need to **record your resource endpoint and connection string** for this quickstart.
- Create *three* Azure Communication Services Users and issue them a [User Access Token](../../identity/access-tokens.md). Be sure to set the scope to **chat**, and **note the token string as well as the user_id string**. The full demo creates a thread with two initial participants and then adds a third participant to the thread. You can also use the Azure CLI and run the command below with your connection string to create a user and an access token.

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az communication identity token issue --scope chat --connection-string "yourConnectionString"
  ```

  For details, see [Use Azure CLI to Create and Manage Access Tokens](../../identity//access-tokens.md?pivots=platform-azcli).

## Setting up

### Create a new web application

First, open your terminal or command window create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it.

```console
mkdir chat-quickstart && cd chat-quickstart
```

Run `npm init -y` to create a **package.json** file with default settings.

```console
npm init -y
```

### Install the packages

Use the `npm install` command to install the below Communication Services SDKs for JavaScript.

```console
npm install @azure/communication-common --save

npm install @azure/communication-identity --save

npm install @azure/communication-signaling --save

npm install @azure/communication-chat --save

```

The `--save` option lists the library as a dependency in your **package.json** file.

### Set up the app framework

This quickstart uses parcel to bundle the application assets. Run the following command to install it and list it as a development dependency in your **package.json**:

```console
npm install parcel --save-dev
```
Create an **index.html** file in the root directory of your project. We'll use this file as a template to add chat capability using the Azure Communication Chat SDK for JavaScript.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Communication Client - Chat Sample</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h4>Azure Communication Services</h4>
    <h1>Chat Quickstart</h1>
    <script src="./client.js" type="module"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Create a file in the root directory of your project called **client.js** to contain the application logic for this quickstart.

### Create a chat client

To create a chat client in your web app, you'll use the Communications Service **endpoint** and the **access token** that was generated as part of prerequisite steps.

User access tokens enable you to build client applications that directly authenticate to Azure Communication Services. This quickstart doesn't cover creating a service tier to manage tokens for your chat application. See [chat concepts](../../../concepts/chat/concepts.md) for more information about chat architecture, and [user access tokens](../../identity/access-tokens.md) for more information about access tokens.

Inside **client.js** use the endpoint and access token in the code below to add chat capability using the Azure Communication Chat SDK for JavaScript.

```JavaScript

import { ChatClient } from '@azure/communication-chat';
import { AzureCommunicationTokenCredential } from '@azure/communication-common';

// Your unique Azure Communication service endpoint
let endpointUrl = '<replace with your resource endpoint>';
// The user access token generated as part of the pre-requisites
let userAccessToken = '<USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>';

let chatClient = new ChatClient(endpointUrl, new AzureCommunicationTokenCredential(userAccessToken));
console.log('Azure Communication Chat client created!');
```
- Replace **endpointUrl** with the Communication Services resource endpoint, see [Create an Azure Communication Services resource](../../create-communication-resource.md) if you haven't already done so.
- Replace **userAccessToken** with the token that you issued.


### Run the code

Run the following command to run your application:
```console
npx parcel index.html
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:1234/. In the developer tools console within your browser you should see following:

```console
Azure Communication Chat client created!
```


## Object model
The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the Azure Communication Services Chat SDK for JavaScript.

| Name                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ChatClient | This class is needed for the Chat functionality. You instantiate it with your subscription information, and use it to create, get, delete threads, and subscribe to chat events. |
| ChatThreadClient | This class is needed for the Chat Thread functionality. You obtain an instance via the ChatClient, and use it to send/receive/update/delete messages, add/remove/get users, send typing notifications and read receipts. |


## Start a chat thread

Use the `createThread` method to create a chat thread.

`createThreadRequest` is used to describe the thread request:

- Use `topic` to give a topic to this chat. Topics can be updated after the chat thread is created using the `UpdateThread` function.
- Use `participants` to list the participants to be added to the chat thread.

When resolved, `createChatThread` method returns a `CreateChatThreadResult`. This model contains a `chatThread` property where you can access the `id` of the newly created thread. You can then use the `id` to get an instance of a `ChatThreadClient`. The `ChatThreadClient` can then be used to perform operation within the thread such as sending messages or listing participants.

```JavaScript
async function createChatThread() {
  const createChatThreadRequest = {
    topic: "Hello, World!"
  };
  const createChatThreadOptions = {
    participants: [
      {
        id: { communicationUserId: '<USER_ID>' },
        displayName: '<USER_DISPLAY_NAME>'
      }
    ]
  };
  const createChatThreadResult = await chatClient.createChatThread(
    createChatThreadRequest,
    createChatThreadOptions
  );
  const threadId = createChatThreadResult.chatThread.id;
  return threadId;
}

createChatThread().then(async threadId => {
  console.log(`Thread created:${threadId}`);
  // PLACEHOLDERS
  // <CREATE CHAT THREAD CLIENT>
  // <RECEIVE A CHAT MESSAGE FROM A CHAT THREAD>
  // <SEND MESSAGE TO A CHAT THREAD>
  // <LIST MESSAGES IN A CHAT THREAD>
  // <ADD NEW PARTICIPANT TO THREAD>
  // <LIST PARTICIPANTS IN A THREAD>
  // <REMOVE PARTICIPANT FROM THREAD>
  });
```

When you refresh your browser tab, you should see the following in the console:
```console
Thread created: <thread_id>
```

## Get a chat thread client

The `getChatThreadClient` method returns a `chatThreadClient` for a thread that already exists. It can be used for performing operations on the created thread: add participants, send message, etc. threadId is the unique ID of the existing chat thread.

```JavaScript
let chatThreadClient = chatClient.getChatThreadClient(threadId);
console.log(`Chat Thread client for threadId:${threadId}`);

```
Add this code in place of the `<CREATE CHAT THREAD CLIENT>` comment in **client.js**, refresh your browser tab and check the console, you should see:
```console
Chat Thread client for threadId: <threadId>
```

## List all chat threads

The `listChatThreads` method returns a `PagedAsyncIterableIterator` of type `ChatThreadItem`. It can be used for listing all chat threads.
An iterator of `[ChatThreadItem]` is the response returned from listing threads

```JavaScript
const threads = chatClient.listChatThreads();
for await (const thread of threads) {
   // your code here
}
```

## Send a message to a chat thread

Use `sendMessage` method to send a message to a thread identified by threadId.

`sendMessageRequest` is used to describe the message request:

- Use `content` to provide the chat message content;

`sendMessageOptions` is used to describe the operation optional params:

- Use `senderDisplayName` to specify the display name of the sender;
- Use `type` to specify the message type, such as 'text' or 'html';
- Use `metadata` optionally to include any other data you want to send along with the message. This field provides a mechanism for developers to extend chat message functionality and add custom information for your use case. For example, when sharing a file link in the message, you might want to add 'hasAttachment: true' in metadata so that recipient's application can parse that and display accordingly.

`SendChatMessageResult` is the response returned from sending a message, it contains an ID, which is the unique ID of the message.

```JavaScript
const sendMessageRequest =
{
  content: 'Please take a look at the attachment'
};
let sendMessageOptions =
{
  senderDisplayName : 'Jack',
  type: 'text',
  metadata: {
    'hasAttachment': 'true',
    'attachmentUrl': 'https://contoso.com/files/attachment.docx'
  }
};
const sendChatMessageResult = await chatThreadClient.sendMessage(sendMessageRequest, sendMessageOptions);
const messageId = sendChatMessageResult.id;
console.log(`Message sent!, message id:${messageId}`);
```

Add this code in place of the `<SEND MESSAGE TO A CHAT THREAD>` comment in **client.js**, refresh your browser tab and check the console.
```console
Message sent!, message id:<number>
```

## Receive chat messages from a chat thread

With real-time signaling, you can subscribe to listen for new incoming messages and update the current messages in memory accordingly. Azure Communication Services supports a [list of events that you can subscribe to](../../../concepts/chat/concepts.md#real-time-notifications).

```JavaScript
// open notifications channel
await chatClient.startRealtimeNotifications();
// subscribe to new notification
chatClient.on("chatMessageReceived", (e) => {
  console.log("Notification chatMessageReceived!");
  // your code here
});

```
Add this code in place of `<RECEIVE A CHAT MESSAGE FROM A CHAT THREAD>` comment in **client.js**.
Refresh your browser tab, you should see in the console a message `Notification chatMessageReceived`;

Alternatively you can retrieve chat messages by polling the `listMessages` method at specified intervals.

```JavaScript

const messages = chatThreadClient.listMessages();
for await (const message of messages) {
   // your code here
}

```
Add this code in place of the `<LIST MESSAGES IN A CHAT THREAD>` comment in **client.js**.
Refresh your tab, in the console you should find the list of messages sent in this chat thread.

`listMessages` returns different types of messages that can be identified by `chatMessage.type`. 

For more details, see [Message Types](../../../concepts/chat/concepts.md#message-types).

## Add a user as a participant to the chat thread

Once a chat thread is created, you can then add and remove users from it. By adding users, you give them access to send messages to the chat thread, and add/remove other participants.

Before calling the `addParticipants` method, ensure that you've acquired a new access token and identity for that user. The user will need that access token in order to initialize their chat client.

`addParticipantsRequest` describes the request object wherein `participants` lists the participants to be added to the chat thread;
- `id`, required, is the communication identifier to be added to the chat thread.
- `displayName`, optional, is the display name for the thread participant.
- `shareHistoryTime`, optional, is the time from which the chat history is shared with the participant. To share history since the inception of the chat thread, set this property to any date equal to, or less than the thread creation time. To share no history previous to when the participant was added, set it to the current date. To share partial history, set it to the date of your choice.

```JavaScript

const addParticipantsRequest =
{
  participants: [
    {
      id: { communicationUserId: '<NEW_PARTICIPANT_USER_ID>' },
      displayName: 'Jane'
    }
  ]
};

await chatThreadClient.addParticipants(addParticipantsRequest);

```
Replace **NEW_PARTICIPANT_USER_ID** with a [new user ID](../../identity/access-tokens.md)
Add this code in place of the `<ADD NEW PARTICIPANT TO THREAD>` comment in **client.js**

## List users in a chat thread
```JavaScript
const participants = chatThreadClient.listParticipants();
for await (const participant of participants) {
   // your code here
}
```
Add this code in place of the `<LIST PARTICIPANTS IN A THREAD>` comment in **client.js**, refresh your browser tab and check the console, you should see information about users in a thread.

## Remove user from a chat thread

Similar to adding a participant, you can remove participants from a chat thread. In order to remove, you'll need to track the IDs of the participants you've added.

Use `removeParticipant` method where `participant` is the communication user to be removed from the thread.

```JavaScript

await chatThreadClient.removeParticipant({ communicationUserId: <PARTICIPANT_ID> });
await listParticipants();
```
Replace **PARTICIPANT_ID** with a User ID used in the previous step (<NEW_PARTICIPANT_USER_ID>).
Add this code in place of the `<REMOVE PARTICIPANT FROM THREAD>` comment in **client.js**.

### Subscribe to connection status of real time notifications
Subscription to events `realTimeNotificationConnected` and `realTimeNotificationDisconnected` allows you to know when the connection to the call server is active.

```JavaScript
// subscribe to realTimeNotificationConnected event
chatClient.on('realTimeNotificationConnected', () => {
  console.log("Real time notification is now connected!");
  // your code here
});
// subscribe to realTimeNotificationDisconnected event
chatClient.on('realTimeNotificationDisconnected', () => {
  console.log("Real time notification is now disconnected!");
  // your code here
});
```
