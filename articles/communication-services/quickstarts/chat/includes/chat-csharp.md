## Prerequisites

- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. For details, see [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- Create an Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Create an Azure Communication Services resource](../../create-communication-resource.md). You need to record your resource **endpoint and connection string** for this article.
- A [User Access Token](../../identity/access-tokens.md). Be sure to set the scope to **chat**, and **note the token string as well as the user_id string**. You can also use the Azure CLI and run the following command with your connection string to create a user and an access token.

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az communication identity token issue --scope chat --connection-string "yourConnectionString"
  ```

  For details, see [Use Azure CLI to Create and Manage Access Tokens](../../identity/access-tokens.md?pivots=platform-azcli).

## Set up

### Create a new C# application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app with the name `ChatQuickstart`. This command creates a simple "Hello World" C# project with a single source file: **Program.cs**.

```console
dotnet new console -o ChatQuickstart
```

Change your directory to the newly created app folder and use the `dotnet build` command to compile your application.

```console
cd ChatQuickstart
dotnet build
```

### Install the package

Install the Azure Communication Chat SDK for .NET

```PowerShell
dotnet add package Azure.Communication.Chat
```

## Object model

The following classes handle some of the major features of the Azure Communication Services Chat SDK for C#.

| Name                                  | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ChatClient | This class is needed for the Chat functionality. You instantiate it with your subscription information, and use it to create, get, and delete threads. |
| ChatThreadClient | This class is needed for the Chat Thread functionality. You obtain an instance via the ChatClient, and use it to send/receive/update/delete messages, add/remove/get participants, send typing notifications and read receipts. |

## Create a chat client

To create a chat client, use your Communication Services endpoint and the access token that was generated as part of the prerequisite steps. You need to use the `CommunicationIdentityClient` class from the Identity SDK to create a user and issue a token to pass to your chat client.

Learn more about [User Access Tokens](../../identity/access-tokens.md).

This article doesn't cover creating a service tier to manage tokens for your chat application, although we recommend it. For more information, see [Chat Architecture](../../../concepts/chat/concepts.md).

Copy the following code snippets and paste into the `Program.cs` source file.

```csharp
using Azure;
using Azure.Communication;
using Azure.Communication.Chat;
using System;

namespace ChatQuickstart
{
    class Program
    {
        static async System.Threading.Tasks.Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Your unique Azure Communication service endpoint
            Uri endpoint = new Uri("<replace with your resource endpoint>");

            CommunicationTokenCredential communicationTokenCredential = new CommunicationTokenCredential(<Access_Token>);
            ChatClient chatClient = new ChatClient(endpoint, communicationTokenCredential);
        }
    }
}
```

## Start a chat thread

Use the `createChatThread` method on the chatClient to create a chat thread
- Use `topic` to give a topic to this chat. You can update the topic after creating the chat thread using the `UpdateTopic` function.
- Use `participants` property to pass a  list of `ChatParticipant` objects to be added to the chat thread. The `ChatParticipant` object is initialized with a `CommunicationIdentifier` object. `CommunicationIdentifier` could be of type `CommunicationUserIdentifier`, `MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier`, or `PhoneNumberIdentifier`. For example, to get a `CommunicationIdentifier` object, you need to pass an Access ID which you created by following instruction to [Create a user](../../identity/access-tokens.md#create-an-identity)

The response object from the `createChatThread` method contains the `chatThread` details. To interact with the chat thread operations such as adding participants, sending a message, deleting a message, and so on, a `chatThreadClient` client instance needs to instantiated using the `GetChatThreadClient` method on the `ChatClient` client.

```csharp
var chatParticipant = new ChatParticipant(identifier: new CommunicationUserIdentifier(id: "<Access_ID>"))
{
    DisplayName = "UserDisplayName"
};
CreateChatThreadResult createChatThreadResult = await chatClient.CreateChatThreadAsync(topic: "Hello world!", participants: new[] { chatParticipant });
ChatThreadClient chatThreadClient = chatClient.GetChatThreadClient(threadId: createChatThreadResult.ChatThread.Id);
string threadId = chatThreadClient.Id;
```

## Get a chat thread client
The `GetChatThreadClient` method returns a thread client for a thread that already exists. You can use it to perform operations on the created thread: add members, send message, and so on. `threadId` is the unique ID of the existing chat thread.

```csharp
string threadId = "<THREAD_ID>";
ChatThreadClient chatThreadClient = chatClient.GetChatThreadClient(threadId: threadId);
```

## List all chat threads
Use `GetChatThreads` to retrieve all the chat threads that the user is part of.

```csharp
AsyncPageable<ChatThreadItem> chatThreadItems = chatClient.GetChatThreadsAsync();
await foreach (ChatThreadItem chatThreadItem in chatThreadItems)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{ chatThreadItem.Id}");
}
```

## Send a message to a chat thread

Use `SendMessage` to send a message to a thread.

- Use `content` to provide the content for the message. Required.
- Use `type` for the content type of the message such as 'Text' or 'Html'. If not specified, 'Text' is set.
- Use `senderDisplayName` to specify the display name of the sender. If not specified, empty string is set.
- Optional: Use `metadata` to include other data you want to send along with the message. This field provides a mechanism for developers to extend chat message functionality and add custom information for your use case. For example, when sharing a file link in the message, you might want to add 'hasAttachment:true' in metadata so that recipient's application can parse that and display accordingly.

```csharp
SendChatMessageOptions sendChatMessageOptions = new SendChatMessageOptions()
{
    Content = "Please take a look at the attachment",
    MessageType = ChatMessageType.Text
};
sendChatMessageOptions.Metadata["hasAttachment"] = "true";
sendChatMessageOptions.Metadata["attachmentUrl"] = "https://contoso.com/files/attachment.docx";

SendChatMessageResult sendChatMessageResult = await chatThreadClient.SendMessageAsync(sendChatMessageOptions);

string messageId = sendChatMessageResult.Id;
```

## Receive chat messages from a chat thread

You can retrieve chat messages by polling the `GetMessages` method on the chat thread client at specified intervals.

```csharp
AsyncPageable<ChatMessage> allMessages = chatThreadClient.GetMessagesAsync();
await foreach (ChatMessage message in allMessages)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{message.Id}:{message.Content.Message}");
}
```

`GetMessages` takes an optional `DateTimeOffset` parameter. If that offset is specified, you receive messages that were received, updated, or deleted after it. Messages received before the offset time but edited or removed afterward are also returned.

`GetMessages` returns the latest version of the message, including any edits or deletes that happened to the message using `UpdateMessage` and `DeleteMessage`. For deleted messages, `chatMessage.DeletedOn` returns a datetime value indicating when that message was deleted. For edited messages, `chatMessage.EditedOn` returns a datetime indicating when the message was edited. The original time of message creation can be accessed using `chatMessage.CreatedOn`, and it can be used for ordering the messages.

`GetMessages` returns different types of messages. You can identify the type from the `chatMessage.Type`. The types are:

- `Text`: Regular chat message sent by a thread member.

- `Html`: A formatted text message. Communication Services users currently can't send RichText messages. This message type is supported for messages sent from Teams users to Communication Services users in Teams Interop scenarios.

- `TopicUpdated`: System message that indicates the topic is updated. (readonly)

- `ParticipantAdded`: System message that indicates one or more participants are added to the chat thread (readonly).

- `ParticipantRemoved`: System message that indicates a participant is removed from the chat thread.

For more information, see [Message Types](../../../concepts/chat/concepts.md#message-types).

## Add a user as a participant to the chat thread

Once a thread is created, you can then add and remove users from it. By adding users, you give them access to be able to send messages to the thread, and add/remove other participant. Before calling `AddParticipants`, ensure that you acquire a new access token and identity for that user. The user needs that access token in order to initialize their chat client.

Use `AddParticipants` to add one or more participants to the chat thread. The following are the supported attributes for each thread participant:
- `communicationUser`, required, is the identity of the thread participant.
- `displayName`, optional, is the display name for the thread participant.
- `shareHistoryTime`, optional, time from which the chat history is shared with the participant.

```csharp
var josh = new CommunicationUserIdentifier(id: "<Access_ID_For_Josh>");
var gloria = new CommunicationUserIdentifier(id: "<Access_ID_For_Gloria>");
var amy = new CommunicationUserIdentifier(id: "<Access_ID_For_Amy>");

var participants = new[]
{
    new ChatParticipant(josh) { DisplayName = "Josh" },
    new ChatParticipant(gloria) { DisplayName = "Gloria" },
    new ChatParticipant(amy) { DisplayName = "Amy" }
};

await chatThreadClient.AddParticipantsAsync(participants: participants);
```

## Get thread participants

Use `GetParticipants` to retrieve the participants of the chat thread.

```csharp
AsyncPageable<ChatParticipant> allParticipants = chatThreadClient.GetParticipantsAsync();
await foreach (ChatParticipant participant in allParticipants)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{((CommunicationUserIdentifier)participant.User).Id}:{participant.DisplayName}:{participant.ShareHistoryTime}");
}
```

## Send read receipt

Use `SendReadReceipt` to notify other participants that the user read the message.

```csharp
await chatThreadClient.SendReadReceiptAsync(messageId: messageId);
```

## Run the code

Run the application from your application directory with the `dotnet run` command.

```console
dotnet run
```
