## Prerequisites

- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. For details, see [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.7+.
- Create an Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Quickstart: Create and manage Communication Services resources](../../create-communication-resource.md). You need to **record your resource endpoint and connection string** for this article.
- A [User Access Token](../../identity/access-tokens.md). Be sure to set the scope to **chat**, and **note the token string as well as the user_id string**. You can also use the Azure CLI and run the following command with your connection string to create a user and an access token.

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az communication identity token issue --scope chat --connection-string "yourConnectionString"
  ```

  For details, see [Use Azure CLI to Create and Manage Access Tokens](../../identity/access-tokens.md?pivots=platform-azcli).

## Setting up

### Create a new Python application

Open your terminal or command window, create a new directory for your app, and go to it.

```console
mkdir chat-quickstart && cd chat-quickstart
```

Use a text editor to create a file called *start-chat.py* in the project root directory. Add the structure for the program, including basic exception handling. In the following sections, add all the source code for this article to this file.

```python
import os
# Add required SDK components from quickstart here

try:
    print('Azure Communication Services - Chat Quickstart')
    # Quickstart code goes here
except Exception as ex:
    print('Exception:')
    print(ex)
```

### Install SDK

Use the following command to install the SDK:

```console

pip install azure-communication-chat

```

## Object model

The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the Azure Communication Services Chat SDK for Python.

| Name                                  | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ChatClient` | This class is needed for the chat functionality. You instantiate it with your subscription information, and use it to create, get, and delete threads. |
| `ChatThreadClient` | This class is needed for the chat thread functionality. You obtain an instance via `ChatClient`, and use it to send, receive, update, and delete messages. You can also use it to add, remove, and get users, and send typing notifications and read receipts. |

## Create a chat client

To create a chat client, use the Communication Services endpoint and the access token you generated as part of prerequisite steps.

```console
pip install azure-communication-identity
```

```python
from azure.communication.chat import ChatClient, CommunicationTokenCredential

endpoint = "<replace with your resource endpoint>"
chat_client = ChatClient(endpoint, CommunicationTokenCredential("<Access Token>"))
```
This article doesn't cover creating a service tier to manage tokens for your chat application, but it's recommended. For more information, see the "Chat architecture" section of [Chat concepts > Chat architecture](../../../concepts/chat/concepts.md#chat-architecture).

## Start a chat thread

Use the `create_chat_thread` method to create a chat thread.

- Use `topic` to give the thread a topic. You can update the topic after the chat thread is created by using the `update_thread` function.
- Use `thread_participants` to list the `ChatParticipant` to be added to the chat thread. The `ChatParticipant` takes the `CommunicationUserIdentifier` type as `user`.

`CreateChatThreadResult` is the result returned from creating a thread. You can use it to fetch the `id` of the chat thread that got created. This `id` can then be used to fetch a `ChatThreadClient` object by using the `get_chat_thread_client` method. You can use `ChatThreadClient` to perform other chat operations to this chat thread.

```python
topic="test topic"

create_chat_thread_result = chat_client.create_chat_thread(topic)
chat_thread_client = chat_client.get_chat_thread_client(create_chat_thread_result.chat_thread.id)
```

## Get a chat thread client

The `get_chat_thread_client` method returns a thread client for a thread that already exists. You can use it to perform operations on the created thread. For example, you can add participants and send messages. `thread_id` is the unique ID of the existing chat thread.

You can use `ChatThreadClient` to perform other chat operations to this chat thread.

```python
thread_id = create_chat_thread_result.chat_thread.id
chat_thread_client = chat_client.get_chat_thread_client(thread_id)
```

## List all chat threads

The `list_chat_threads` method returns an iterator of type `ChatThreadItem`.

- Use `start_time` to specify the earliest point in time to get chat threads.
- Use `results_per_page` to specify the maximum number of chat threads returned per page.

An iterator of `[ChatThreadItem]` is the response returned from listing threads.

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

start_time = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=2)

chat_threads = chat_client.list_chat_threads(results_per_page=5, start_time=start_time)
for chat_thread_item_page in chat_threads.by_page():
    for chat_thread_item in chat_thread_item_page:
        print(chat_thread_item)
        print('Chat Thread Id: ', chat_thread_item.id)
```


## Send a message to a chat thread

Use the `send_message` method to send a message to a chat thread you created, identified by `thread_id`.

- Use `content` to provide the chat message content.
- Use `chat_message_type` to specify the message content type. Possible values are `text` and `html`. If you don't specify a value, the default is `text`.
- Use `sender_display_name` to specify the display name of the sender.
- Use `metadata` optionally to include any other data you want to send along with the message. This field provides a mechanism for developers to extend chat message functionality and add custom information for your use case. For example, when sharing a file link in the message, you might want to add 'hasAttachment:true' in metadata so that recipient's application can parse that and display accordingly.

`SendChatMessageResult` is the response returned from sending a message. It contains an ID, which is the unique ID of the message.

```python
from azure.communication.chat import ChatMessageType

topic = "test topic"
create_chat_thread_result = chat_client.create_chat_thread(topic)
thread_id = create_chat_thread_result.chat_thread.id
chat_thread_client = chat_client.get_chat_thread_client(create_chat_thread_result.chat_thread.id)


content='Please take a look at the attachment'
sender_display_name='sender name'
metadata={
    'hasAttachment': 'true',
    'attachmentUrl': 'https://contoso.com/files/attachment.docx'
}

# specify chat message type with pre-built enumerations
send_message_result_w_enum = chat_thread_client.send_message(content=content, sender_display_name=sender_display_name, chat_message_type=ChatMessageType.TEXT, metadata=metadata)
print("Message sent: id: ", send_message_result_w_enum.id)
```


## Receive chat messages from a chat thread

You can retrieve chat messages by polling the `list_messages` method at specified intervals.

- Use `results_per_page` to specify the maximum number of messages to be returned per page.
- Use `start_time` to specify the earliest point in time to get messages.

An iterator of `[ChatMessage]` is the response returned from listing messages.

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

start_time = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=1)

chat_messages = chat_thread_client.list_messages(results_per_page=1, start_time=start_time)
for chat_message_page in chat_messages.by_page():
    for chat_message in chat_message_page:
        print("ChatMessage: Id=", chat_message.id, "; Content=", chat_message.content.message)
```

`list_messages` returns the latest version of the message, including any edits or deletes that happened to the message by using `update_message` and `delete_message`. For deleted messages, `ChatMessage.deleted_on` returns a `datetime` value indicating when that message was deleted. For edited messages, `ChatMessage.edited_on` returns a `datetime` value indicating when the message was edited. You can access the original time of message creation by using `ChatMessage.created_on`, which can be used for ordering the messages.

`list_messages` returns different types of messages, which you identify from the `ChatMessage.type`. 

For more information, see [Message types](../../../concepts/chat/concepts.md#message-types).

## Send read receipt

You use the `send_read_receipt` method to post a read receipt event to a thread, on behalf of a user.

- Use `message_id` to specify the ID of the latest message read by current user.

```python
content='hello world'

send_message_result = chat_thread_client.send_message(content)
chat_thread_client.send_read_receipt(message_id=send_message_result.id)
```

## Add a user as a participant to the chat thread

When you create a chat thread, you can then add and remove users from it. By adding users, you give them access to be able to send messages to the chat thread, and add or remove other participants. Before calling the `add_participants` method, ensure that you acquired a new access token and identity for that user. The user needs that access token to initialize the chat client.

You can add one or more users to the chat thread by using the `add_participants` method, if a new access token and identity is available for all users.

A `list(tuple(ChatParticipant, CommunicationError))` is returned. When the participant is successfully added, an empty list is expected. If you encounter an error while adding a participant, the list is populated with the failed participants and the error that was encountered.

```python
from azure.communication.identity import CommunicationIdentityClient
from azure.communication.chat import ChatParticipant
from datetime import datetime

# create 2 users
identity_client = CommunicationIdentityClient.from_connection_string('<connection_string>')
new_users = [identity_client.create_user() for i in range(2)]

# # conversely, you can also add an existing user to a chat thread; provided the user_id is known
# from azure.communication.identity import CommunicationUserIdentifier
#
# user_id = 'some user id'
# user_display_name = "Wilma Flinstone"
# new_user = CommunicationUserIdentifier(user_id)
# participant = ChatParticipant(
#     identifier=new_user,
#     display_name=user_display_name,
#     share_history_time=datetime.utcnow())

participants = []
for _user in new_users:
  chat_thread_participant = ChatParticipant(
    identifier=_user,
    display_name='Fred Flinstone',
    share_history_time=datetime.utcnow()
  ) 
  participants.append(chat_thread_participant) 

response = chat_thread_client.add_participants(participants)

def decide_to_retry(error, **kwargs):
    """
    Insert some custom logic to decide if retry is applicable based on error
    """
    return True

# verify if all users has been successfully added or not
# in case of partial failures, you can retry to add all the failed participants 
retry = [p for p, e in response if decide_to_retry(e)]
if retry:
    chat_thread_client.add_participants(retry)
```


## List thread participants in a chat thread

Similar to adding a participant, you can also list participants from a thread.

Use `list_participants` to retrieve the participants of the thread. Both of the following commands are optional:

- Use `results_per_page` to specify the maximum number of participants to be returned per page.
- Use `skip` to skip participants up to a specified position in the response.

An iterator of `[ChatParticipant]` is the response returned from listing participants.

```python
chat_thread_participants = chat_thread_client.list_participants()
for chat_thread_participant_page in chat_thread_participants.by_page():
    for chat_thread_participant in chat_thread_participant_page:
        print("ChatParticipant: ", chat_thread_participant)
```

## Run the code

Run the application from your application directory with the `python` command.

```console
python start-chat.py
```
