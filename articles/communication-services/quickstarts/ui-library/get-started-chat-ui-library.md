# Quickstart: Add chat with UI Library

Get started with Azure Communication Services UI Library to quickly integrate communication experiences into your applications. In this quickstart, learn how to integrate UI Library chat composites into an application and set up the experience for your app users.

Azure Communication Services UI Library renders a full chat experience right in your application. It takes care of connecting to Azure Communication Services chat services and updates a participant's presence automatically. As a developer, you need to decide about where in your app's user experience you want the chat experience to start and create only the Azure Communication Services resources as required.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group.

Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
