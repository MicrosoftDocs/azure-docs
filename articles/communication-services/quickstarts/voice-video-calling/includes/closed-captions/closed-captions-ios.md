## Prerequisites
- Azure account with an active subscription, for details see [Create an account for free.](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Azure Communication Services resource. See [Create an Azure Communication Services resource](../../../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp). Save the connection string for this resource. 
- An app with voice and video calling, refer to our [Voice](../../../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/getting-started-with-calling.md) and [Video](../../../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-with-video-calling.md) calling quickstarts.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to have a voice calling app using Azure Communication Services calling SDKs to access the closed captions feature that is described in this guide.

## Models

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CaptionsCallFeature | API for captions call feature |
| CommunicationCaptions | API for communication captions |
| StartCaptionOptions | Closed caption options like spoken language |
| CommunicationCaptionsDelegate | Delegate for communication captions |
| CommunicationCaptionsReceivedEventArgs | Data object received for each communication captions received event |

## Get closed captions feature 

You need to get and cast the captions object to use captions specific features.

``` swift
if let call = self.call {
 @State var captionsCallFeature = call.feature(Features.captions)
 captionsCallFeature.getCaptions{(value, error) in
 if let error = error {
 // failed to get captions
 } else {
 if (value?.type == CaptionsType.communicationCaptions) {
 // communication captions
 @State var communicationCaptions = value as? CommunicationCaptions
 }
 }
 }
}
```

## Subscribe to listeners

### Add a listener to receive captions enabled/disabled, type, spoken language, caption language status changed, and data received

The event `didChangeActiveCaptionsType` triggers when the caption type changes from `CommunicationCaptions` to `TeamsCaptions` upon inviting Microsoft 365 users to ACS-only calls.

```swift
extension CallObserver: CommunicationCaptionsDelegate {
 // listener for receive captions enabled/disabled status
 public func communicationCaptions(_ communicationCaptions: CommunicationCaptions, didChangeCaptionsEnabledState args: PropertyChangedEventArgs) {
 // communicationCaptions.isEnabled
 }
 
 // listener for active spoken language state change
 public func communicationCaptions(_ communicationCaptions: CommunicationCaptions, didChangeActiveSpokenLanguageState args: PropertyChangedEventArgs) {
 // communicationCaptions.activeSpokenLanguage
 }
 
 // listener for captions data received
 public func communicationCaptions(_ communicationCaptions: CommunicationCaptions, didReceiveCaptions:CommunicationCaptionsReceivedEventArgs) {
 // Information about the speaker.
 // didReceiveCaptions.speaker
 // The original text with no transcribed.
 // didReceiveCaptions.spokenText
 // language identifier for the speaker.
 // didReceiveCaptions.spokenLanguage
 // Timestamp denoting the time when the corresponding speech was made.
 // didReceiveCaptions.timestamp
 // CaptionsResultType is Partial if text contains partially spoken sentence.
 // It is set to Final once the sentence has been completely transcribed.
 // didReceiveCaptions.resultType
 }
}

communicationCaptions.delegate = self.callObserver

extension CallObserver: CaptionsCallFeatureDelegate {
 // captions type changed
 public func captionsCallFeature(_ captionsCallFeature: CaptionsCallFeature, didChangeActiveCaptionsType args: PropertyChangedEventArgs) {
 // captionsCallFeature.getCaptions to get captions
 }
}

captionsCallFeature.delegate = self.callObserver
```

## Start captions

Once you set up all your listeners, you can start adding captions.

``` swift
func startCaptions() {
 guard let communicationCaptions = communicationCaptions else {
 return
 }
 let startCaptionsOptions = StartCaptionsOptions()
 startCaptionsOptions.spokenLanguage = "en-us"
 communicationCaptions.startCaptions(startCaptionsOptions: startCaptionsOptions, completionHandler: { (error) in
 if error != nil {
 
 }
 })
}
```

## Stop captions

``` swift
func stopCaptions() {
 communicationCaptions.stopCaptions(completionHandler: { (error) in
 if error != nil {
 
 }
 })
}
```

## Remove caption received listener

``` swift
communicationCaptions?.delegate = nil
```

## Spoken language support 

### Get list of supported spoken languages

Get a list of supported spoken languages that your users can select from when enabling closed captions. 

``` swift
// bcp 47 formatted language code
let spokenLanguage : String = "en-us"
for language in communicationCaptions?.supportedSpokenLanguages ?? [] {
 // choose required language
 spokenLanguage = language
}
```

### Set spoken language

When the user selects the spoken language, your app can set the spoken language that it expects captions to be generated from. 

``` swift 
func setSpokenLanguage() {
 guard let communicationCaptions = self.communicationCaptions else {
 return
 }

 communicationCaptions.set(spokenLanguage: spokenLanguage, completionHandler: { (error) in
 if let error = error {
 }
 })
}
```
