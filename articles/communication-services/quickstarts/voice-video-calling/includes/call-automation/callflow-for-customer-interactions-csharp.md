## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
- Azure Communication Services resource. See [Create an Azure Communication Services resource](../../../create-communication-resource.md?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp). Note the resource connection string for this quickstart by navigating to your resource selecting 'Keys' from the left side menu.
- [Acquire a phone number for your Communication Service resource](../../../telephony/get-phone-number.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp). Note the phone number you acquired for use in this quickstart. 
- The latest [.NET library](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) for your operating system. .NET 6.0 or higher is recommended as this quickstart uses the minimal API feature. 
- An audio file for the message you want to play in the call. This audio should be accessible via a url. 

## Create a new C# application

In the console window of your operating system, use the `dotnet` command to create a new web application.
```console
    dotnet new web -n MyApplication
```

## Install required packages

1. Configure NuGet Package Manager to use dev feed: During the preview phase, the CallAutomation package is published to the dev feed. Configure your package manager to use the Azure SDK Dev Feed from [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#nuget-package-dev-feed).

2. Install the NuGet packages: [Azure.Communication.CallAutomation](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_artifacts/feed/azure-sdk-for-net/NuGet/Azure.Communication.CallAutomation/versions/) and [Azure.Messaging.EventGrid](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_artifacts/feed/azure-sdk-for-net/NuGet/Azure.Messaging.EventGrid/versions/) to your project. 
```console 
dotnet add <path-to-project> package Azure.Communication.CallAutomation --prerelease
dotnet add <path-to-project> package Azure.Messaging.EventGrid --prerelease
```
## Set up a public URI for the local application 

In this quick-start, you'll use [Ngrok tool](https://ngrok.com/) to project a public URI to the local port so that your local application can be visited by the internet. The public URI is needed to receive the Event Grid `IncomingCall` event and Call Automation events using webhooks.

First, determine the port of the .NET application. Minimal API dynamically allocates a port for the project at the time of creation. Find out the http port in <PROJECT_ROOT>\Properties\launchSettings.json.
:::image type="content" source="./../../media/call-automation/dotnet-application-port.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of demo application's launchsetting.json file":::

Then, [install Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) and run Ngrok with the following command: `ngrok http <port>`. This command will create a public URI like `https://ff2f-75-155-253-232.ngrok.io/`, and it is your Ngrok Fully Qualified Domain Name(Ngrok_FQDN). Keep Ngrok running while following the rest of this quick-start.

## Update Program.cs

Using the minimal API feature in .NET 6, we can easily add an HTTP POST map and answer the call. A callback URI is required so the service knows how to contact your application for subsequent calls state events such as `CallConnected` and `PlayCompleted`.  

In this code snippet, /api/incomingCall is the default route that will be used to listen for and answer incoming calls. At a later step, you'll register this url with Event Grid. Since Event Grid requires you to prove ownership of your Webhook endpoint before it starts delivering events to that endpoint, the code sample also handles this one time validation by processing SubscriptionValidationEvent. This requirement prevents a malicious user from flooding your endpoint with events. For more information, see this [guide](../../../../../event-grid/webhook-event-delivery.md).  

The code sample also illustrates how you can control the callback URI by setting your own context/ID when you answer the call. All events generated by the call will be sent to the specific route you provide when answering an inbound call and the same applies to when you place an outbound call.

        {
            // Handle the subscription validation event.
            if (eventData is SubscriptionValidationEventData subscriptionValidationEventData)
            {
                var responseData = new SubscriptionValidationResponse
                {
                    ValidationResponse = subscriptionValidationEventData.ValidationCode
                };
                return Results.Ok(responseData);
            }
        }
        var jsonObject = JsonNode.Parse(eventGridEvent.Data).AsObject();
        var callerId = (string)(jsonObject["from"]["rawId"]);
        var incomingCallContext = (string)jsonObject["incomingCallContext"];
        var callbackUri = new Uri(callbackUriBase + $"/api/calls/{Guid.NewGuid()}?callerId={callerId}");

        AnswerCallResult answerCallResult = await client.AnswerCallAsync(incomingCallContext, callbackUri);
    }
    return Results.Ok();

    {
        CallAutomationEventBase @event = CallAutomationEventParser.Parse(cloudEvent);
        if (@event is CallConnected)
        {
            // play audio then recognize 3-digit DTMF input with pound (#) stop tone
            var recognizeOptions =
                new CallMediaRecognizeDtmfOptions(CommunicationIdentifier.FromRawId(callerId), 3)
                {

                    OperationContext = "MainMenu"
                };
            await client.GetCallConnection(@event.CallConnectionId)
                .GetCallMedia()
                .StartRecognizingAsync(recognizeOptions);
        }
        if (@event is RecognizeCompleted { OperationContext: "MainMenu" })
        {
            // this RecognizeCompleted correlates to the previous action as per the OperationContext value
            var addThisPerson = new PhoneNumberIdentifier(phoneNumberToAddToCall); 
            var listOfPersonToBeAdded = new List<CommunicationIdentifier>(); 
            listOfPersonToBeAdded.Add(addThisPerson); 
            var addParticipantsOption = new AddParticipantsOptions(listOfPersonToBeAdded);

        }
    }
    return Results.Ok();
