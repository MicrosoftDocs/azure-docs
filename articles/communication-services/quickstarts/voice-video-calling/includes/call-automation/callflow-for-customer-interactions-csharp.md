## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
- A Communication Service resource.
- [Acquire a phone number for your Communication Service resource](../../../telephony/get-phone-number.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp). This can be done under the Phone Numbers blade of your resource on azure portal. 
- The latest [.NET library](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) for your operating system. .NET 6.0 or higher is recommended as this quickstart uses the minimal API feature. 

## Create a new C# application

In the console window of your operating system, use the `dotnet` command to create a new web application.

```console
    dotnet new web -n MyApplication
```

## Configure NuGet package manager

During the preview phase, the `Azure.Communication.CallAutomation` NuGet package can be obtained by configuring your package manager to use the Azure SDK Dev Feed from [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#nuget-package-dev-feed)

## Install required Nuget packages

Install the following Nuget packages to your project using the `dotnot add <package>` command. 

*Azure.Communication.CallAutomation* - [Package details](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_artifacts/feed/azure-sdk-for-net/NuGet/Azure.Communication.CallAutomation/versions/)

*Azure.Messaging.EventGrid* - [Package details](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_artifacts/feed/azure-sdk-for-net/NuGet/Azure.Messaging.EventGrid/versions/)

## Obtain your connection string and phone number

From the Azure portal, locate your Communication Service resource.

1. Select on the Keys section to obtain your connection string.

2. Then select on the Phone numbers section to obtain your ACS phone number.

## Update Program.cs

Using the minimal API feature in .NET 6, we can easily add an HTTP POST map and answer the call. A callback URI is required so the service knows how to contact your web server for subsequent calls state events such as `CallConnected` and `PlayCompleted`.  

In this code snippet, /api/incomingCall is the default route which will be used to listen for and answer incoming calls. At a later step, we will register this url with EventGrid. Since Event Grid requires you to prove ownership of your Webhook endpoint before it starts delivering events to that endpoint, the code sample also handles this one time validation by processing SubscriptionValidationEvent. This requirement prevents a malicious user from flooding your endpoint with events. For more details, see this [guide](../../../event-grid/webhook-event-delivery.md).  

The code sample also illustrates how you can control the callback URI by setting your own context/ID when you answer the call. All events generated by the call will be sent to the specific route you provide when answering an inbound call and the same applies to when you place an outbound call.  

``` csharp
using Azure.Communication;
using Azure.Communication.CallAutomation;
using Azure.Messaging;
using Azure.Messaging.EventGrid;
using Azure.Messaging.EventGrid.SystemEvents;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
using System.Text.Json.Nodes;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var client = new CallAutomationClient(builder.Configuration["ConnectionString"]);
var callbackUriBase = builder.Configuration["callbackUriBase"]; // i.e. https://someguid.ngrok.io

var app = builder.Build();
app.MapPost("/api/incomingCall", async (
    [FromBody] EventGridEvent[] eventGridEvents) =>
{
    foreach (var eventGridEvent in eventGridEvents)
    {
        // Handle system events
        if (eventGridEvent.TryGetSystemEventData(out object eventData))
        {
            // Handle the subscription validation event.
            if (eventData is SubscriptionValidationEventData subscriptionValidationEventData)
            {
                var responseData = new SubscriptionValidationResponse
                {
                    ValidationResponse = subscriptionValidationEventData.ValidationCode
                };
                return Results.Ok(responseData);
            }
        }
        var jsonObject = JsonNode.Parse(eventGridEvent.Data).AsObject();
        var callerId = (string)(jsonObject["to"]["rawId"]);
        var incomingCallContext = (string)jsonObject["incomingCallContext"];
        var callbackUri = new Uri(callbackUriBase + $"/api/calls/{Guid.NewGuid()}?callerId={callerId}");

        AnswerCallResult answerCallResult = await client.AnswerCallAsync(incomingCallContext, callbackUri);
    }
    return Results.Ok();
});

app.MapPost("/api/calls/{contextId}", async (
    [FromBody] CloudEvent[] cloudEvents,
    [FromRoute] string contextId,
    [Required] string callerId) =>
{
    foreach (var cloudEvent in cloudEvents)
    {
        CallAutomationEventBase @event = CallAutomationEventParser.Parse(cloudEvent);
        if (@event is CallConnected)
        {
            // play audio then recognize 3-digit DTMF input with pound (#) stop tone
            var recognizeOptions =
                new CallMediaRecognizeDtmfOptions(CommunicationIdentifier.FromRawId(callerId), 3)
                {
                    InterruptPrompt = true,
                    InterToneTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10),
                    InitialSilenceTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5),
                    Prompt = new FileSource(new Uri(builder.Configuration["MediaSource"])),
                    StopTones = new[] { DtmfTone.Pound },
                    OperationContext = "MainMenu"
                };
            await client.GetCallConnection(@event.CallConnectionId)
                .GetCallMedia()
                .StartRecognizingAsync(recognizeOptions);
        }
        if (@event is RecognizeCompleted { OperationContext: "MainMenu" })
        {
            // this RecognizeCompleted correlates to the previous action as per the OperationContext value
            await client.GetCallConnection(@event.CallConnectionId)
                .AddParticipantsAsync(new AddParticipantsOptions(
                    new List<CommunicationIdentifier>()
                    {
                        new CommunicationUserIdentifier(builder.Configuration["ParticipantToAdd"])
                    })
                );
        }
    }
    return Results.Ok();
}).Produces(StatusCodes.Status200OK);

app.Run();
```

## Setup a public URI for the local application 

In this quick-start, we use [Ngrok tool](https://ngrok.com/) to project a public URI to your local port so that your local application can be visited by the Internet. This tool will be needed for the quick-start application to receive the Event Grid `IncomingCall` event and Call Automation events using webhooks.

First, determine the port of the .NET application. Minimal API dynamically allocates a port for the project at the time of creation. Find out the http port in <PROJECT_ROOT>\Properties\launchSettings.json.
:::image type="content" source="./../../media/call-automation/dotNetApplicationPort.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of demo application's launchsetting.json file":::

Then, [install Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) and run Ngrok with the following command: `ngrok http <port>`. This command will create a public URI like `https://ff2f-75-155-253-232.ngrok.io/`, and it is your Ngrok Fully Qualified Domain Name(Ngrok_FQDN). Keep Ngrok running while following the rest of this quick-start.

## Set up environment variables

In Visual Studio, right click at your project and then select "Manage User Secrets" to configure confidential environment variables.

Reading more about Secret Manager at [Safe storage of app secrets in development in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets)

``` json
{
  ...
    "ConnectionString": "Your_ACS_resource_connection_string",
    "CallbackUriBase": "Your_Ngrok_FQDN",
    "MediaSource": "Link_to_media_file_for_play_prompt",
    "ParticipantToAdd": "The_participant_to_be_added_after_recognizing_tones"
  ...
}
```

ParticipantToAdd used in the code snippet is assumed to be an ACS User MRI.

## Run the app

Open Your_Project_Name.csproj file in your project with Visual Studio, and then select Run button or press F5 on your keyboard.

## Set up IncomingCall event

IncomingCall is an Azure Event Grid event for notifying incoming calls to your Communication Services resource, like the phone number purchased in pre-requisites. Follow [this guide](../../../../how-tos/call-automation-sdk/subscribe-to-incoming-call.md) to set up your IncomingCall event.
