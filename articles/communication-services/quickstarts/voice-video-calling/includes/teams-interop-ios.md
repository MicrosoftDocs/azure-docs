In this quickstart, you'll learn how to join a Teams meeting using the Azure Communication Services Calling SDK for iOS.

## Prerequisites

- A working [Communication Services calling iOS app](../getting-started-with-calling.md).
- A [Teams deployment](/deployoffice/teams-install).


## Add the Teams UI controls and Enable the Teams UI controls

Replace code in ContentView.swift with following snippet. The text box will be used to enter the Teams meeting context and the button will be used to join the specified meeting:

```swift

import SwiftUI
import AzureCommunicationCalling
import AVFoundation

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var meetingLink: String = ""
    @State var callStatus: String = ""
    @State var message: String = ""
    @State var recordingStatus: String = ""
    @State var callClient: CallClient?
    @State var callAgent: CallAgent?
    @State var call: Call?
    @State var callObserver: CallObserver?

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Form {
                Section {
                    TextField("Teams meeting link", text: $meetingLink)
                    Button(action: joinTeamsMeeting) {
                        Text("Join Teams Meeting")
                    }.disabled(callAgent == nil)
                    Button(action: leaveMeeting) {
                        Text("Leave Meeting")
                    }.disabled(call == nil)
                    Text(callStatus)
                    Text(message)
                    Text(recordingStatus)
                }
            }
            .navigationBarTitle("Calling Quickstart")
        }.onAppear {
            // Initialize call agent
            var userCredential: CommunicationTokenCredential?
            do {
                userCredential = try CommunicationTokenCredential(token: "<USER ACCESS TOKEN>")
            } catch {
                print("ERROR: It was not possible to create user credential.")
                self.message = "Please enter your token in source code"
                return
            }

            self.callClient = CallClient()

            // Creates the call agent
            self.callClient?.createCallAgent(userCredential: userCredential) { (agent, error) in
                if error == nil {
                    guard let agent = agent else {
                        self.message = "Failed to create CallAgent"
                        return
                    }

                    self.callAgent = agent
                    self.message = "Call agent successfully created."
                } else {
                    self.message = "Failed to create CallAgent with error"
                }
            }
        }
    }

    func joinTeamsMeeting() {
        // Ask permissions
        AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().requestRecordPermission { (granted) in
            if granted {
                let joinCallOptions = JoinCallOptions()
                let teamsMeetingLinkLocator = TeamsMeetingLinkLocator(meetingLink: self.meetingLink);
                guard let call = self.callAgent?.join(with: teamsMeetingLinkLocator, joinCallOptions: joinCallOptions) else {
                    self.message = "Failed to join Teams meeting"
                    return
                }

                self.call = call
                self.callObserver = CallObserver(self)
                self.call!.delegate = self.callObserver
                self.message = "Teams meeting joined successfully"
            }
        }
    }

    func leaveMeeting() {
        if let call = call {
            call.hangup(options: nil, completionHandler: { (error) in
                if error == nil {
                    self.message = "Leaving Teams meeting was successful"
                } else {
                    self.message = "Leaving Teams meeting failed"
                }
            })
        } else {
            self.message = "No active call to hanup"
        }
    }
}

class CallObserver : NSObject, CallDelegate {
    private var owner:ContentView
    init(_ view:ContentView) {
        owner = view
    }

    public func onCallStateChanged(_ call: Call!,
                                   args: PropertyChangedEventArgs!) {
        owner.callStatus = CallObserver.callStateToString(state: call.state)
        if call.state == .disconnected {
            owner.call = nil
            owner.message = "Left Meeting"
        } else if call.state == .inLobby {
            owner.message = "Waiting in lobby !!"
        } else if call.state == .connected {
            owner.message = "Joined Meeting !!"
        }
    }
    
    public func onIsRecordingActiveChanged(_ call: Call!, args: PropertyChangedEventArgs!) {
        if (call.isRecordingActive == true) {
            owner.recordingStatus = "This call is being recorded"
        }
        else {
            owner.recordingStatus = ""
        }
    }

    private static func callStateToString(state: CallState) -> String {
        switch state {

        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}

```

## Get the Teams meeting link

The Teams meeting link can be retrieved using Graph APIs. This is detailed in [Graph documentation](/graph/api/onlinemeeting-createorget?tabs=http&view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
The Communication Services Calling SDK accepts a full Teams meeting link. This link is returned as part of the `onlineMeeting` resource, accessible under the [`joinWebUrl` property](/graph/api/resources/onlinemeeting?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). You can also get the required meeting information from the **Join Meeting** URL in the Teams meeting invite itself.

## Launch the app and join Teams meeting

You can build and run your app on iOS simulator by selecting **Product** > **Run** or by using the (&#8984;-R) keyboard shortcut.
