>[!IMPORTANT]
> Please be aware that the current Data Channel feature API doesn't support direct messaging between a web browser and a native app in a peer-to-peer call scenario.

## Overview
The Data Channel feature API enables real-time data messaging during audio and video calls. In this quickstart guide, we illustrate how to integrate Data Channel feature to your call and use the Data Channel APIs to send and receive data messages through a data channel.
### Prerequisites
Refer to the [Voice Calling Quickstart](../../getting-started-with-calling.md?pivots=platform-android) to set up a sample app with voice calling.
### Classes
| Name | Description |
| - | - | 
| DataChannelCallFeature | Used to start and manage data channel feature. | 
| DataChannelSender | Used to manage a data channel as a sender and send data. | 
| DataChannelReceiver | Used to manage a data channel as a receiver and receive data. |
| DataChannelSenderOptions | Used for representing options to create a data channel sender. |
### Enums
| Name | Description |  
| - | - | 
| DataChannelPriority | Describes the priority options of data channel. Values: { `NORMAL`, `HIGH` }. | 
| DataChannelReliability | Describes the reliability options of data channel. Values: { `LOSSY`, `DURABLE` }. |
### Error Code
| Name | Description |  
| - | - | 
| _DATA_CHANNEL_FAILED_TO_START_ | `getDataChannelSender()` can fail with this error code, indicating underlying Data Channel is not ready to be used. | 
| _DATA_CHANNEL_RANDOM_ID_NOT_AVAILABLE_ | `getDataChannelSender()` can fail with this error code, indicating all available random channel IDs have already been used. | 
| _DATA_CHANNEL_SENDER_CLOSED_ | `sendMessage()` can fail with this error code, indicating the sender has already been closed previously. |
| _DATA_CHANNEL_MESSAGE_SIZE_OVER_LIMIT_ | `sendMessage()` can fail with this error code, indicating the message data size exceeds the limit. You can get the message size limit using `getMaxMessageSizeInBytes()` in `DataChannelSender`. |
| _DATA_CHANNEL_MESSAGE_FAILURE_FOR_BANDWIDTH_ | `sendMessage()` can fail with this error code, indicating a failure in sending the message due to not enough bandwidth. | 
| _DATA_CHANNEL_MESSAGE_FAILURE_FOR_TRAFFIC_LIMIT_ | `sendMessage()` can fail with this error code, indicating a failure in sending the message due to the overall usage of Data Channel not in compliance with the traffic limit rules. Refer to [Data Channel Concept Document](../../../../concepts/voice-video-calling/data-channel.md) for details of the traffic limit. |
### Methods
#### Enable Data Channel feature

1. Get the ongoing call object established during the prerequisite steps.
2. Get the Data Channel Feature object.
```java
DataChannelCallFeature dataChannelCallFeature = call.feature(Features.DATA_CHANNEL);
```
#### Receiving data message
1. Define the DataChannelReceiverCreatedListener.
```java
DataChannelReceiverCreatedListener receiverCreatedListener = new DataChannelReceiverCreatedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onReceiverCreated(DataChannelReceiverCreatedEvent e) {
        DataChannelReceiver receiver = e.getReceiver(); // get the new data channel receiver
        int channelId = receiver.getChannelId(); // get the channel id
        CommunicationIdentifier senderId = receiver.getSenderIdentifier(); // get the message sender id
        // listen to the message received event and closed event from this receiver
        // receiver.addOnMessageReceivedListener(messageReceivedlistener);
        // receiver.addOnClosedListener(receiverClosedListener);
    }
};
```
2. Register the `receiverCreatedListener`.
```java
dataChannelCallFeature.addOnReceiverCreatedListener(receiverCreatedListener);
 ```
3. Define the MessageReceivedListener.
```java
MessageReceivedListener messageReceivedListener = new MessageReceivedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onMessageReceived(PropertyChangedEvent e) {
        DataChannelMessage message = e.getReceiver().receiveMessage(); // read the data message from the receiver
        int sequence = message.getSequenceNumber(); // get the message sequence number
        byte[] data = message.getData(); // get the data content
    }
};
```
4. Define the ReceiverClosedListener.
```java
ReceiverClosedListener receiverClosedListener = new ReceiverClosedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onReceiverClosed(PropertyChangedEvent e) {
        DataChannelReceiver receiver = e.getReceiver(); // get the data channel receiver to be closed
    }
};
```
5. Register the `messageReceivedListener` and `receiverClosedListener`.
```java
receiver.addOnMessageReceivedListener(messageReceivedlistener);
receiver.addOnClosedListener(receiverClosedListener);
```
#### Sending data message
1. Configure the DataChannelSenderOptions.
```java
DataChannelSenderOptions options = new DataChannelSenderOptions();
options.setChannelId(1000);
options.setBitrateInKbps(32);
options.setPriority(DataChannelPriority.NORMAL);
options.setReliability(DataChannelReliability.LOSSY);

List<CommunicationIdentifier> participants = Arrays.asList( /* identifier1, identifier2, ... */ );
options.setParticipants(participants);
```
2. Get the DataChannelSender and send data message
```java
DataChannelSender dataChannelSender = dataChannelCallFeature.getDataChannelSender(options);

// msgData contains the byte[] data to be sent
dataChannelSender.sendMessage(msgData);

// change participants in the channel if needed
dataChannelSender.setParticipants(new ArrayList<CommunicationIdentifier>()); 
```
