## Implement pre-call diagnostics with iOS

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Disclaimer](../../../../includes/public-preview-include.md)]

The pre-call API feature allows developers to programmatically validate a clientâ€™s readiness to join an Azure Communication Services call. You can only access pre-call features using the Calling SDK. The pre-call diagnostic feature provides multiple diagnostics including device, connection, and call quality. Provide us with [feedback](../../../../support.md) about which platforms you want to see pre-call diagnostics enabled.

### Pre-call diagnostics access

To access pre-call diagnostics, you need to initialize a `CallClient`, and provision an Azure Communication Services access token. Then you can access the `PreCallDiagnostics` feature and the `startTest` method.

```swift
let acsToken: String;
do
{
    let options = CommunicationTokenRefreshOptions(initialToken: acsToken,
                                                    refreshProactively: true,
                                                    tokenRefresher: tokenRefresher)
    credentials = try CommunicationTokenCredential(withOptions: options)
}
catch
{
    return nil
}

let options = CallClientOptions()
callClient = CallClient(options: options)

preCallDiagnosticsFeature = callClient.feature(Features.preCallDiagnostics)

preCallDiagnosticsCallClientFeatureObserver = PreCallDiagnosticsCallClientFeatureObserver(view: self)
preCallDiagnosticsFeature.delegate = preCallDiagnosticsCallClientFeatureObserver
preCallDiagnosticsFeature.startTest(credentials, withCompletionHandler: { error in

})

class PreCallDiagnosticsCallClientFeatureObserver: NSObject, PreCallDiagnosticsCallClientFeatureDelegate
{
    private var view: HomeView

    init(view: HomeView)
    {
        self.view = view
    }
    
    func diagnosticsCallClientFeature(_ preCallDiagnosticsCallClientFeature: PreCallDiagnosticsCallClientFeature, 
                                      didDiagnosticsReady args: PreCallDiagnosticsReadyEventArgs)
    {
        view.onPreCallDiagnosticsReady(args: args)
    }
}
```

Once it finishes running, developers can access the result object.

### Diagnostic results

Pre-call diagnostics returns a full diagnostic of the device including details like availability and compatibility, call quality statistics, and in-call diagnostics. The results are returned as a `PreCallDiagnosticsReadyEvent` object.

```swift
func onPreCallDiagnosticsReady(args: PreCallDiagnosticsReadyEventArgs) -> Void
{
    let diagnostics = args.diagnostics
    let mediaStatsReport = diagnostics.mediaStatisticsReport;

    if let outgoingStatsList = mediaStatsReport.outgoingStatistics
    {
        let videoStatsList = outgoingStatsList.videoStatistics;
        let screenShareStatsList = outgoingStatsList.screenShareStatistics;
        let audioStatsList = outgoingStatsList.audioStatistics;
    }

    if let incomingStatsList = mediaStatsReport.incomingStatistics
    {
        let videoStatsList = incomingStatsList.videoStatistics;
        let screenShareStatsList = incomingStatsList.screenShareStatistics;
        let audioStatsList = incomingStatsList.audioStatistics;
    }
}
```

You can access individual result objects using the `PreCallDiagnosticsReadyEvent` type. Results for individual tests are returned as they're completed with many of the test results being available immediately. The results might take up to 1 minute as the test validates the quality of the video and audio.

#### Device permissions

The permission check determines whether video and audio devices are available from a permissions perspective. Provides `boolean` value for `audio` and `video` devices. 

```swift
let permissionList = preCallDiagnosticsFeature?.devicePermissions()
```
