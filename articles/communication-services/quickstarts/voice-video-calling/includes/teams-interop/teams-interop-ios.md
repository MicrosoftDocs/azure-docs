In this quickstart, you'll learn how to join a Teams meeting using the Azure Communication Services Calling SDK for iOS.

## Prerequisites

- A working [Communication Services calling iOS app](../../getting-started-with-calling.md).
- A [Teams deployment](/deployoffice/teams-install).

We will use beta.12 of AzureCommunicationCalling SDK for this quickstart so we need to update the podfile and install the Pods again. 

Replace your podfile with the following code to the Podfile and save (make sure that "target" matches the name of your project):

   ```
   platform :ios, '13.0'
   use_frameworks!

   target 'AzureCommunicationCallingSample' do
     pod 'AzureCommunicationCalling', '1.0.0-beta.12'
   end
   ```
Delete your Pods folder, Podfile.lock and the `.xcworkspace.` file.

Run `pod install` and open the `.xcworkspace` with Xcode.

## Add the Teams UI controls and Enable the Teams UI controls

Replace code in ContentView.swift with following snippet. The text box will be used to enter the Teams meeting context and the button will be used to join the specified meeting:

```swift

import SwiftUI
import AzureCommunicationCalling
import AVFoundation

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var meetingLink: String = ""
    @State var callStatus: String = ""
    @State var message: String = ""
    @State var recordingStatus: String = ""
    @State var callClient: CallClient?
    @State var callAgent: CallAgent?
    @State var call: Call?
    @State var callObserver: CallObserver?

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Form {
                Section {
                    TextField("Teams meeting link", text: $meetingLink)
                    Button(action: joinTeamsMeeting) {
                        Text("Join Teams Meeting")
                    }.disabled(callAgent == nil)
                    Button(action: leaveMeeting) {
                        Text("Leave Meeting")
                    }.disabled(call == nil)
                    Text(callStatus)
                    Text(message)
                    Text(recordingStatus)
                }
            }
            .navigationBarTitle("Calling Quickstart")
        }.onAppear {
            // Initialize call agent
            var userCredential: CommunicationTokenCredential?
            do {
                userCredential = try CommunicationTokenCredential(token: "<USER ACCESS TOKEN>")
            } catch {
                print("ERROR: It was not possible to create user credential.")
                self.message = "Please enter your token in source code"
                return
            }

            self.callClient = CallClient()

            // Creates the call agent
            self.callClient?.createCallAgent(userCredential: userCredential!) { (agent, error) in
                if error != nil {
                    self.message = "Failed to create CallAgent."
                    return
                } else {
                    self.callAgent = agent
                    self.message = "Call agent successfully created."
                }
            }
        }
    }

    func joinTeamsMeeting() {
        // Ask permissions
        AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().requestRecordPermission { (granted) in
            if granted {
                let joinCallOptions = JoinCallOptions()
                let teamsMeetingLinkLocator = TeamsMeetingLinkLocator(meetingLink: self.meetingLink)
                self.callAgent?.join(with: teamsMeetingLinkLocator, joinCallOptions: joinCallOptions) {(call, error) in
                    if (error == nil) {
                        self.call = call
                        self.callObserver = CallObserver(self)
                        self.call!.delegate = self.callObserver
                        self.message = "Teams meeting joined successfully"
                    } else {

## Get the Teams meeting link

The Teams meeting link can be retrieved using Graph APIs. This is detailed in [Graph documentation](/graph/api/onlinemeeting-createorget?tabs=http&view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
The Communication Services Calling SDK accepts a full Teams meeting link. This link is returned as part of the `onlineMeeting` resource, accessible under the [`joinWebUrl` property](/graph/api/resources/onlinemeeting?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). You can also get the required meeting information from the **Join Meeting** URL in the Teams meeting invite itself.

## Launch the app and join Teams meeting

You can build and run your app on iOS simulator by selecting **Product** > **Run** or by using the (&#8984;-R) keyboard shortcut.

Insert the Teams context into the text box and press *Join Teams Meeting* to join the Teams meeting from within your Communication Services application.
