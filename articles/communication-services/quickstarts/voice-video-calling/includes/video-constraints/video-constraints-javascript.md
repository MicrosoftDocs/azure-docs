You can set video constraints in your calls to control the video quality based on resolution or frameRate or bitrate in your video calls. In this quickstart guide, we illustrate how to set video constraints at the start of a call and how to use our `setConstraints` method on the call object to set video constraints dynamically during the call.

## Send video constraints
Azure Communication Services Web Calling SDK supports setting the maximum video resolution, framerate, or bitrate that a client sends. The sender video constraints are supported on Desktop browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) and when using iOS Safari mobile browser or Android Chrome mobile browser.



| Supported Constraints | 
| ----------- |
| **Incoming video**: resolution<br />**Outgoing video**: resolution, framerate, bitrate |

### Setting video constraints at the start of a call - outgoing (send) video
The video constraints setting is implemented on the `Call` interface. To use the Video Constraints, you can specify the constraints from within `CallOptions` when you make a call, accept a call, or join a call. You must specify `localVideoStreams` in `videoOptions`. <br/>
Do note that constraints don't work if you join a call with audio only option and turn on the camera later. In this case, you can set video constraints dynamically using the `setConstraints` method on the `Call` interface.

```javascript
const callOptions = {
    videoOptions: {
        localVideoStreams: [...],
        constraints: {
            send: {
                bitrate: {
                    max: 575000
                },
                frameHeight: {
                    max: 240
                },
                frameRate: {
                    max: 20
                }
            }
        }
    },
    audioOptions: {
        muted: false
    }
};
// make a call
this.callAgent.startCall(identitiesToCall, callOptions);
// join a group call
this.callAgent.join({ groupId }, callOptions);
// accept an incoming call
this.incomingCall.accept(callOptions)
```

Video constraints types are described as follows:
```javascript
export declare interface VideoOptions {
    localVideoStreams?: LocalVideoStream[];
    //video constraint when call starts
    constraints?: VideoConstraints;
};

export declare type VideoConstraints = {
    send?: VideoSendConstraints;
};

export type VideoSendConstraints = {
    /**
     * Resolution constraint
     */
    frameHeight?: MediaConstraintRange;

    /**
     * FrameRate constraint
     */
    frameRate?: MediaConstraintRange;

    /**
     * Bitrate constraint
     */
    bitrate?: MediaConstraintRange;
};

export declare type MediaConstraintRange = {
    max?: number;
};
```

When setting video constraints, the SDK chooses the nearest value that falls within the constraint set to prevent the values for resolution, frameRate, and bitrate to not exceed the maximum constraint values set. Also, when the resolution constraint value is too small, the SDK chooses the smallest available resolution. In this case, the height of chosen resolution can be larger than the constraint value.

> [!NOTE]
> For all `bitrate`, `frameHeight` and `frameRate`, the constraint value is a `max` constraint, which means the actual value in the call can be the specified value or smaller.
> There's no guarantee that the sent video resolution remains at the specified resolution.

The `frameHeight` in `VideoSendConstraints` has a different meaning when a mobile device is in portrait mode. In portrait mode, this value indicates the shorter side of the device. For example, specifying `frameHeight.max` value with 240 on a 1080(W) x 1920(H) device in portrait mode, the constraint height is on the 1080(W) side. When the same device is in landscape mode (1920(W) x 1080(H)), the constraint is on the 1080(H) side.

If you use MediaStats API to track the sent video resolution, you may find out that the sent resolution can change during the call. It can go up and down, but should be equal or smaller than the constraint value you provide. This resolution change is an expected behavior. The browser also has some degradation rule to adjust sent resolution based on cpu or network conditions.

### Setting video constraints during the call - outgoing (send) video
You can set video constraints during the call by using the `setConstraints` method on the `Call` object.
```javascript
// For eg, when you've started a call,
const currentCall = this.callAgent.startCall(identitiesToCall, callOptions);

// To set constraints during the call,
await currentCall.setConstraints({
    video: {
        send: {
            frameHeight: {
                max: 360
            },
            frameRate: {
                max: 15
            }
        }
    }
});

// To set only a particular constraint (the others will stay as what they were set before, if they were set)
await currentCall.setConstraints({
    video: {
        send: {
            bitrate: {
                max: 400000
            }
        }
    }
});

// To unset any constraint,
await currentCall.setConstraints({
    video: {
        send: {
            frameHeight: {
                max: 0
            }
        }
    }
});
```
> [!NOTE]
> Setting constraint value as `0` unsets any previously set constraints. You can use this way to reset or remove constraints.

## Receive video constraints
Managing video quality for incoming streams involves understanding the Azure Communication Services resolution ladder, which is a predefined list of video resolutions with estimated upper and lower bitrate boundaries. When a client requests a specific resolution, the WebJS and backend server consults the resolution ladder to allocate the appropriate video bitrate, considering both network conditions and device capabilities.

Defining the video render size is a crucial step for developers aiming to control the bitrate and frame rate of an incoming video stream. The initial quality and resolution of a video stream are determined by the size of the renderer created and placed on a web page. For instance, if the renderer is small, the WebJS SDK requests a smaller resolution. Conversely, if the renderer is large, the ACS SDK aims for the best possible resolution from the server. This process ensures that the video quality is optimized based on the client's requirements and capabilities. When a client requests a specific resolution, the server consults the resolution ladder to allocate the appropriate video bitrate, considering both network conditions and device capabilities.

The resolution ladder table provides what the WebJS calling SDK resolution ladder consists of with the estimated incoming video bitrates for various resolutions. These details help developers understand the relationship between resolution, bit rate, and frame rate and the approximate amount of bandwidth a specific incoming video stream uses. For example, a resolution of 1280x720 streams at 30 FPS with the client using an approximate minimum bitrate of 1 MBPS and an approximate maximum bitrate of 2.5 MBPS.

The Azure Communication Services WebJS Calling SDK adjusts video size based on available bandwidth to ensure a consistent communication experience. WebJS Calling SDK adjusts the video size based on algorithms that monitor network conditions. When network bandwidth is sufficient, the SDK increases video resolution to its maximum level based on the render size defined on the web page. Conversely, when bandwidth is limited, it reduces video resolution to prevent buffering and maintain a stable connection. 

The following table provides the resolution ladder and estimated bitrates for each resolution and associated FPS that will be delivered at that resolution.

| Height | Width | FPS | Min Bitrate (MBps) | Max Bitrate (MBps) |
|--------|-------|-----|------------------|------------------|
| 1080  | 1920  | 30  | 1.75  |  10  |
| 720  | 1280  | 30  | 1 |  2.5  |
| 540  | 960   | 30  | 0.5  | 1.125 |
| 360  | 640   | 30  | 0.4  | 0.57 |
| 240  | 426   | 15  | 0.125  | 0.5 |
| 240  | 320   | 15  | 0.2  | 0.175 |


## Using Media statics to understand video constraints impact
To evaluate and compare the video quality after applying the video constraints, you can access [MediaStats API](../../../../concepts/voice-video-calling/media-quality-sdk.md) to get video resolution and bitrate information of the sending stream. The media stats also include other granular stats related to the streams, such as jitter, packet loss, round trip time, etc.

```javascript
const mediaStatsFeature = call.feature(Features.MediaStats);
const mediaStatsCollector = mediaStatsFeature.createCollector();

mediaStatsCollector.on('sampleReported', (sample: SDK.MediaStatsReportSample) => {
    // process the stats for the call.
    console.log(sample);
});
```
