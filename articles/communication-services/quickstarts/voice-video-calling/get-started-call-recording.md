# Call recording quickstart

This article describes call recording for voice and video calls. To start using the Call Recording APIs, you must have a call in place. To build the end-user calling experience, make sure you're familiar with [Calling client SDK](get-started-with-video-calling.md) and [Call Automation](../call-automation/callflows-for-customer-interactions.md#build-a-customer-interaction-workflow-using-call-automation).

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](../create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).
