# Local preview mirroring

Meeting participants can now choose to stop mirroring their video preview—the small window showing how they appear during meetings.

This ability is especially useful for situations like:
<br/>✅ Virtual backgrounds with text – ensuring words appear correctly in your preview.
<br/>✅ Teaching and presenting – making it easier to align your view with what participants see, reducing distractions when writing on a whiteboard or sharing content.
 
## Frequently asked questions

### What is the default setting?

By default, your video is mirrored to you. This mirroring matches the familiar experience of front-facing smartphone cameras. However, you can easily toggle mirroring off when joining a meeting.

### Does lack of mirroring affect my outgoing video?

No, this setting only changes your personal view. Others always see your video as intended, regardless of whether mirroring is on or off.

### When it most useful to turn off mirroring?

This feature is helpful in:
- Gallery & Large Gallery views
- Preview videos
- PowerPoint content sharing & PowerPoint Live <br/>
  \* These views mirror your self-view, but others still see your actual video.
