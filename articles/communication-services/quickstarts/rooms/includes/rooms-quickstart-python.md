## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An active Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../../create-communication-resource.md).
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.7+ for your operating system.

## Sample code

Review and download the sample code for from GitHub at [Rooms Quickstart - Python](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-python-quickstarts/tree/main/rooms-quickstart).

## Set up

### Create a new Python application

In a terminal or console window, create a new folder for your application and navigate to it.

```console
mkdir acs-rooms-quickstart
cd acs-rooms-quickstart
```

### Install the package

You need to use the Azure Communication Rooms client library for Python [version 1.1.0](https://pypi.org/project/azure-communication-rooms/) or above.

From a console prompt, navigate to the directory containing the rooms.py file, then execute the following command:

```console
pip install azure-communication-rooms
```

### Set up the app framework

Create a new file called `rooms-quickstart.py` and add the basic program structure.

```python
import os
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from azure.core.exceptions import HttpResponseError
from azure.communication.rooms import (
    RoomsClient,
    RoomParticipant,
    ParticipantRole
)

class RoomsQuickstart(object):
    print("Azure Communication Services - Rooms Quickstart")
    #room method implementations goes here

if __name__ == '__main__':
    rooms = RoomsQuickstart()
```

## Initialize a room client

Create a new `RoomsClient` object that you need to create new rooms and manage their properties and lifecycle. Use the connection string of your Communications Service to authenticate the request. For more information on connection strings, see [Create communications resource](../../create-communication-resource.md#access-your-connection-strings-and-service-endpoints).

```python
#Find your Communication Services resource in the Azure portal
connection_string = '<connection_string>'
rooms_client = RoomsClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)
```

## Create a room

### Set up room participants

To set up who can join a room, you need a list of the identities of those users. Follow the instructions at [Access tokens](../../identity/access-tokens.md?pivots=programming-language-python) to create users and issue access tokens. Alternatively, to create the users on demand, you can create them using the `CommunicationIdentityClient`. Azure Communication Services rooms currently only support a room participant of type `CommunicationUserIdentifier`. Using other types of `CommunicationIdentity` causes a runtime error.

To use the `CommunicationIdentityClient`, install the following package:

```console
pip install azure-communication-identity
```

Also, import the namespace of the package at the top of your `rooms-quickstart.py` file:

```python
from azure.communication.identity import (
    CommunicationIdentityClient
)
```

Now, initialize the `CommunicationIdentityClient` and use it to create users:

```python
# Create identities for users who will join the room
identity_client = CommunicationIdentityClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)
user1 = identity_client.create_user()
user2 = identity_client.create_user()
user3 = identity_client.create_user()
```

Then, create the list of room participants by referencing those users:

```python
participant_1 = RoomParticipant(communication_identifier=user1, role=ParticipantRole.PRESENTER)
participant_2 = RoomParticipant(communication_identifier=user2, role=ParticipantRole.CONSUMER)
participants = [participant_1, participant_2]
```

### Initialize the room

Create a new room using the `participants` defined in the preceding code snippet:

```python
# Create a room
valid_from = datetime.now()
valid_until = valid_from + timedelta(weeks=4)
pstn_dial_out_enabled = False

try:
    create_room = rooms_client.create_room(
        valid_from=valid_from,
        valid_until=valid_until,
        pstn_dial_out_enabled=pstn_dial_out_enabled,
        participants=participants
    )
    print("\nCreated a room with id: " + create_room.id)
except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print(ex)
```

Since rooms are server-side entities, you should keep track of and persist the `room.id` in the storage medium of choice. You can reference the `id` to view or update the properties of a room object.

### Enable PSTN dial out capability for a room

Each room has PSTN dial out disabled by default. You can enable the PSTN dial out for a room at creation, by defining the `pstn_dial_out_enabled` parameter as true. You can change this capability for a room by issuing an update request for the `pstn_dial_out_enabled` parameter.

```python
# Create a room with PSTN dial out capability
pstn_dial_out_enabled = True
create_room = rooms_client.create_room(pstn_dial_out_enabled=pstn_dial_out_enabled)
print("\nCreated room with pstn_dial_out_enabled: " + updated_room.pstn_dial_out_enabled)

# Update a room to enable or disable PSTN dial out capability
pstn_dial_out_enabled= False
updated_room = rooms_client.update_room(room_id=room_id, pstn_dial_out_enabled=pstn_dial_out_enabled)
print("\nUpdated room with pstn_dial_out_enabled: " + updated_room.pstn_dial_out_enabled)

```

## Get properties of an existing room

Retrieve the details of an existing `room` by referencing the `id`:

```python
# Retrieves the room with corresponding ID
room_id = create_room.id
try:
    get_room = rooms_client.get_room(room_id=room_id)
    print("\nRetrieved room with id: ", get_room.id)
except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print(ex)
```

## Update the lifetime of a room

You can change the lifetime of a room by issuing an update request for the `valid_from` and `valid_until` parameters. A room can be valid for a maximum of six months.

```python
# Update the lifetime of a room
valid_from =  datetime.now()
valid_until = valid_from + timedelta(weeks=7)
pstn_dial_out_enabled=True

try:
    updated_room = rooms_client.update_room(room_id=room_id, valid_from=valid_from, valid_until=valid_until, pstn_dial_out_enabled=pstn_dial_out_enabled)
     print("\nUpdated room with validFrom: " + updated_room.valid_from + ", validUntil: " + updated_room.valid_until + " and pstn_dial_out_enabled: " + updated_room.pstn_dial_out_enabled)
except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print(ex)
```

## List all active rooms

To retrieve all active rooms created under your resource, use the `list_rooms` method exposed on the client.

```python
# List all active rooms
try:
    rooms = rooms_client.list_rooms()
    count = 0
    for room in rooms:
        if count == 1:
            break
        print("\nPrinting the first room in list"
            "\nRoom Id: " + room.id +
            "\nCreated date time: " + str(room.created_at) +
            "\nValid From: " + str(room.valid_from) + 
            "\nValid Until: " + str(room.valid_until) +
            "\nPSTN Dial-Out Enabled: " + str(room.pstn_dial_out_enabled))
        count += 1
except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print(ex)
```

## Add or update participants

To add new participants or update existing participants in a room, use the `add_or_update_participants` method exposed on the client.

```python
# Add or update participants in a room
try:
    # Update existing user2 from consumer to attendee
    participants = []
    participants.append(RoomParticipant(communication_identifier=user2, role=ParticipantRole.ATTENDEE))

    # Add new participant user3
    participants.append(RoomParticipant(communication_identifier=user3, role=ParticipantRole.COLLABORATOR))
    rooms_client.add_or_update_participants(room_id=room_id, participants=participants)
    print("\nAdd or update participants in room")

except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print('Error in adding or updating participants to room.', ex)
```

When you add participants to a room, they become eligible to join calls.

## List participants in a room

Retrieve the list of participants for an existing room by referencing the `room_id`:

```python
# Get list of participants in room
try:
    participants = rooms_client.list_participants(room_id)
    print('\nParticipants in Room Id :', room_id)
    for p in participants:
        print(p.communication_identifier.properties['id'], p.role)
except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print(ex)

```

## Remove participants

To remove a participant from a room and revoke their access, use the `remove_participants` method.

```python
# Remove Participants
try:
    participants = [user2]
    rooms_client.remove_participants(room_id=room_id, participants=participants)
    print("\nRemoved participants from room")

except HttpResponseError as ex:
    print(ex)

```

## Delete room

To disband an existing room, issue an explicit delete request. All rooms and associated resources are automatically deleted at the end of their validity plus a grace period.

```python
# Delete Room

rooms_client.delete_room(room_id=room_id)
print("\nDeleted room with id: " + room_id)

```

## Run the code

To run the code, make sure you are in the same directory as your `rooms-quickstart.py` file.

```console
python rooms-quickstart.py
```

The expected output describes each completed action:

```console
