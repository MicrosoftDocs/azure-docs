# Join a room call

This article describes how to join a room call using web or native mobile calling SDKs.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An active Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../create-communication-resource.md).
- Two or more Communication User Identities. [Create and manage access tokens](../identity/access-tokens.md) or [Quick-create identities for testing](../identity/quick-create-identity.md).
- A created room and participant added to it. [Create and manage rooms](get-started-rooms.md)

## Obtain user access token

If you have already created users and have added them as participants in the room following the "Set up room participants" section in [this page](./get-started-rooms.md), then you can directly use those users to join the room.

Otherwise, you'll need to create a User Access Token for each call participant. [Learn how to create and manage user access tokens](../identity/access-tokens.md). You can also use the Azure CLI and run the command below with your connection string to create a user and an access token. After the users have been created, you'll need to add them to the room as participants before they can join the room.

```azurecli-interactive
az communication identity token issue --scope voip --connection-string "yourConnectionString"
```

For details, see [Use Azure CLI to Create and Manage Access Tokens](../identity/access-tokens.md?pivots=platform-azcli).
