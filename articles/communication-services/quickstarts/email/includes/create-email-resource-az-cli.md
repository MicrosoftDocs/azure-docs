## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/).
- Install [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli).

## Create Email Communication Services resource

To create an Email Communication Services resource, [sign in to Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli). You can sign in running the ```az login``` command from the terminal and providing your credentials. To create the resource, run the following command: 

```azurepowershell-interactive
az communication email create --name "<EmailServiceName>" --location "Global" --data-location "United States" --resource-group "<resourceGroup>"
```

If you want to select a specific subscription, you can also specify the ```--subscription``` flag and provide the subscription ID.

```azurepowershell-interactive
az communication email create --name "<EmailServiceName>" --location "Global" --data-location "United States" --resource-group "<resourceGroup>" --subscription "<subscriptionId>"
```

You can configure your Email Communication Services resource with the following options:

* The [resource group](../../../../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-cli.md).
* The name of the Email Communication Services resource.
* The geography to associate with the resource.

In the next step, you can assign tags to the resource. Then you can use tags to organize your Azure Email resources. For more information about tags, see the [resource tagging documentation](../../../../azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources.md).

## Manage your Email Communication Services resource

To add tags to your Email Communication Services resource, run the following commands. You can also target a specific subscription.

```azurepowershell-interactive
az communication email update --name "<EmailServiceName>" --tags newTag="newVal1" --resource-group "<resourceGroup>"

az communication email update --name "<EmailServiceName>" --tags newTag="newVal2" --resource-group "<resourceGroup>" --subscription "<subscriptionId>"
```

To list all of your Email Communication Service Resources in a given Resource group, use the following command:

```azurepowershell-interactive
az communication email list --resource-group "<resourceGroup>"
```

To show all the information on a given Email Communication Service resource use the following command. You can also target a specific subscription.

```azurepowershell-interactive
az communication email show --name "<EmailServiceName>" --resource-group "<resourceGroup>"

az communication email show --name "<EmailServiceName>" --resource-group "<resourceGroup>" --subscription "<subscriptionId>"
```

## Clean up resource

If you want to clean up and remove an Email Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. You can delete your email communication resource by running the following command.

```azurecli-interactive
az communication email delete --name "<EmailServiceName>" --resource-group "<resourceGroup>"
```

[Deleting the resource group](../../../../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal.md#delete-resource-groups) also deletes any other resources associated with it.

> [!NOTE]
> Resource deletion is **permanent** and no data, including Event Grid filters, phone numbers, or other data tied to your resource, can be recovered if you delete the resource.

For information on other commands, see [Email Communication CLI](/cli/azure/communication/email).
