## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/).
- An Azure Email Communication Services Resource ready to provision domains. [Get started creating an Email Communication Resource](../create-email-communication-resource.md).
- An [Azure Managed Domain](../add-azure-managed-domains.md) or [Custom Domain](../add-custom-verified-domains.md) provisioned and ready to send emails.
- We're using a [service principal for authentication](/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal). Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the Microsoft Entra ID application as the following environment variables: `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

## Install the required packages

```console
pip install azure-mgmt-communication
pip install azure-identity
```

## Initialize the management client

Replace the field in the sample code with the subscription ID of the subscription your Domain and Email resources are in. Run the code sample to initialize the management client.

```python
from azure.mgmt.communication import CommunicationServiceManagementClient
from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
subscription_id = "<your-subscription-id>"

mgmt_client = CommunicationServiceManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

## Add sender usernames

When you provision an Azure Managed Domain resource, the MailFrom address defaults to `donotreply@xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.azurecomm.net`. If you configured a custom domain such as `notification.azurecommtest.net` the MailFrom address defaults to `donotreply@notification.azurecommtest.net`. 

The username is the user alias that is used in the MailFrom address. For example, the username in the MailFrom address `contosoNewsAlerts@notification.azurecommtest.net` would be `contosoNewsAlerts`. You can add extra sender usernames, which can also be configured with a more user friendly display name. In our example, the display name is `Contoso News Alerts`.

Update the code sample with the resource group name, the email service name, and the domain name that you would like to add this username to. You can find this information in the portal by navigating to the domains resource you created when setting up the prerequisites. The title of the resource is `<your-email-service-name>/<your-domain-name>`. You can find the resource group name in the **Essentials** sections in the domain resource overview.

To add multiple sender usernames, you need to repeat this code sample multiple times.

```python
resource_group_name = "<your-resource-group-name>"
email_service_name = "<your-email-service-name>"
domain_name = "<your-domain-name>"

parameters = {
    "username": "contosoNewsAlerts",
    "displayName": "Contoso News Alerts",
}

mgmt_client.sender_usernames.create_or_update(
    resource_group_name,
    email_service_name,
    domain_name,
    "contosoNewsAlerts",
    parameters
)
```

## Remove sender usernames

To delete the sender username, call the delete function on the client.

```python
mgmt_client.sender_usernames.delete(
    resource_group_name,
    email_service_name,
    domain_name,
    "contosoNewsAlerts"
)
```
