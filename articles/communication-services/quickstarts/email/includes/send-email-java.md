Get started with Azure Communication Services by using the Communication Services Java Email SDK to send Email messages.

> [!TIP]
> Jump-start your email sending experience with Azure Communication Services by skipping straight to the [Basic Email Sending](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-java-quickstarts/tree/main/send-email) and [Advanced Email Sending](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-java-quickstarts/tree/main/send-email-advanced) sample code on GitHub.

## Understanding the email object model

The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the Azure Communication Services Email SDK for Python.

| Name | Description |
| ---- |-------------|
| EmailAddress | This class contains an email address and an option for a display name. |
| EmailAttachment | This interface creates an email attachment by accepting a unique ID, email attachment [MIME type](../../../concepts/email/email-attachment-allowed-mime-types.md) string, a string of content bytes, and an optional content ID to define it as an inline attachment. |
| EmailClient | This class is needed for all email functionality. You instantiate it with your connection string and use it to send email messages. |
| EmailMessage | This class combines the sender, content, and recipients. Custom headers, attachments, and reply-to email addresses can optionally be added, as well. |
| EmailSendResult | This class holds the results of the email send operation. It has an operation ID, operation status and error object (when applicable). |
| EmailSendStatus | This class represents the set of statuses of an email send operation. |

EmailSendResult returns the following status on the email operation performed.

| Status Name | Description |
| ----------- | ------------|
| NOT_STARTED | We're not sending this status from our service at this time. |
| IN_PROGRESS | The email send operation is currently in progress and being processed. |
| SUCCESSFULLY_COMPLETED | The email send operation has completed without error and the email is out for delivery. Any detailed status about the email delivery beyond this stage can be obtained either through Azure Monitor or through Azure Event Grid. [Learn how to subscribe to email events](../handle-email-events.md) |
| FAILED | The email send operation wasn't successful and encountered an error. The email wasn't sent. The result contains an error object with more details on the reason for failure. |

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk) version 8 or above.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- A deployed Communication Services resource and connection string. For details, see [Create a Communication Services resource](../../create-communication-resource.md).
- Create an [Azure Email Communication Services resource](../create-email-communication-resource.md) to start sending emails.
- A setup managed identity for a development environment, [see Authorize access with managed identity](../../identity/service-principal.md?pivot="programming-language-java").

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

> [!NOTE]
> We can also send an email from our own verified domain [Add custom verified domains to Email Communication Service](../add-custom-verified-domains.md).

### Prerequisite check
- In a terminal or command window, run `mvn -v` to check that Maven is installed.
- To view the domains verified with your Email Communication Services resource, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Locate your Email Communication Services resource and open the **Provision domains** tab from the left navigation pane.

## Set up the application environment

To set up an environment for sending emails, take the steps in the following sections.

### Create a new Java application
Open your terminal or command window and navigate to the directory where you would like to create your Java application. Run the following command to generate the Java project from the maven-archetype-quickstart template.

```console
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId="maven-archetype-quickstart" -DarchetypeGroupId="org.apache.maven.archetypes" -DarchetypeVersion="1.4" -DgroupId="com.communication.quickstart" -DartifactId="communication-quickstart"
```

The `generate` goal creates a directory with the same name as the `artifactId` value. Under this directory, the **src/main/java** directory contains the project source code, the **src/test/java directory** contains the test source, and the **pom.xml** file is the project's Project Object Model (POM).

### Install the package

Open the **pom.xml** file in your text editor. Add the following dependency element to the group of dependencies.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-communication-email</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-beta.2</version>
</dependency>
```

### Set up the app framework

Open **/src/main/java/com/communication/quickstart/App.java** in a text editor, add import directives, and remove the `System.out.println("Hello world!");` statement:

```java
package com.communication.quickstart;

import com.azure.communication.email.models.*;
import com.azure.communication.email.*;
import com.azure.core.util.polling.*;

public class App
{
    public static void main( String[] args )
    {
        // Quickstart code goes here.
    }
}
```

## Creating the email client with authentication

There are a few different options available for authenticating an email client.

#### [Connection String](#tab/connection-string)

To authenticate a client, you instantiate an `EmailClient` with your connection string. Learn how to [manage your resource's connection string](../../create-communication-resource.md#store-your-connection-string). You can also initialize the client with any custom HTTP client that implements the `com.azure.core.http.HttpClient` interface.

To instantiate a synchronous client, add the following code to the `main` method:

```java
// You can get your connection string from your resource in the Azure portal.
String connectionString = "endpoint=https://<resource-name>.communication.azure.com/;accesskey=<access-key>";

EmailClient emailClient = new EmailClientBuilder()
    .connectionString(connectionString)
    .buildClient();
```

To instantiate an asynchronous client, add the following code to the `main` method:

```java
// You can get your connection string from your resource in the Azure portal.
String connectionString = "endpoint=https://<resource-name>.communication.azure.com/;accesskey=<access-key>";

EmailAsyncClient emailClient = new EmailClientBuilder()
    .connectionString(connectionString)
    .buildAsyncClient();
```

<a name='azure-active-directory'></a>

#### [Microsoft Entra ID](#tab/aad)

A [DefaultAzureCredential](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity#defaultazurecredential) object must be passed to the `EmailClientBuilder` via the `credential()` method. An endpoint must also be set via the `endpoint()` method.

The `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, and `AZURE_TENANT_ID` environment variables are needed to create a `DefaultAzureCredential` object.

To instantiate a synchronous client, add the following code to the `main` method:

```java
// You can find your endpoint and access key from your resource in the Azure portal
String endpoint = "https://<resource-name>.communication.azure.com/";
EmailClient emailClient = new EmailClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
    .buildClient();
```

To instantiate an asynchronous client, add the following code to the `main` method:

```java
// You can find your endpoint and access key from your resource in the Azure portal
String endpoint = "https://<resource-name>.communication.azure.com/";
EmailAsyncClient emailClient = new EmailClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
    .buildAsyncClient();
```

#### [AzureKeyCredential](#tab/azurekeycredential)

Email clients can also be created and authenticated using the endpoint and Azure Key Credential acquired from an Azure Communication Resource in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

To instantiate a synchronous client, add the following code to the `main` method:

```java
String endpoint = "https://<resource-name>.communication.azure.com";
AzureKeyCredential azureKeyCredential = new AzureKeyCredential("<access-key>");
EmailClient emailClient = new EmailClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(azureKeyCredential)
    .buildClient();
```

To instantiate an asynchronous client, add the following code to the `main` method:

```java
String endpoint = "https://<resource-name>.communication.azure.com";
AzureKeyCredential azureKeyCredential = new AzureKeyCredential("<access-key>");
EmailClient emailClient = new EmailClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(azureKeyCredential)
    .buildClient();
```

For simplicity, this quickstart uses connection strings, but in production environments, we recommend using [service principals](../../../quickstarts/identity/service-principal.md).



## Basic email sending

An email message can be crafted using the `EmailMessage` object in the SDK.

```java
EmailMessage message = new EmailMessage()
    .setSenderAddress("<donotreply@xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.azurecomm.net>")
    .setToRecipients("<emailalias@emaildomain.com>")
    .setSubject("Welcome to Azure Communication Services Email")
    .setBodyPlainText("This email message is sent from Azure Communication Services Email using the Java SDK.");
```

Make these replacements in the code:
- Replace `<emailalias@emaildomain.com>` with the email address you would like to send a message to.
- Replace `<donotreply@xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.azurecomm.net>` with the MailFrom address of your verified domain.

To send the email message, call the `beginSend` function from the `EmailClient`.

## [Sync Client](#tab/sync-client)

Calling `beginSend` on the sync client returns a `SyncPoller` object, which can be used to check on the status of the operation and retrieve the result once it's finished. Note that the initial request to send an email will be sent as soon as the `beginSend` method is called. **Sending an email is a long running operation. Its important to note that the `getFinalResult()` method on the poller is a blocking operation until a terminal state (`SUCCESSFULLY_COMPLETED` or `FAILED`) is reached.** The recommended method is to do manual polling at an interval that's appropriate for your application needs as demonstrated in the sample below.

```java
try
{
    SyncPoller<EmailSendResult, EmailSendResult> poller = emailClient.beginSend(message, null); // This will send out the initial request to send an email

    PollResponse<EmailSendResult> pollResponse = null;

    Duration timeElapsed = Duration.ofSeconds(0);
    Duration POLLER_WAIT_TIME = Duration.ofSeconds(10);

    // Polling is done manually to avoid blocking the application in case of an error
    while (pollResponse == null
            || pollResponse.getStatus() == LongRunningOperationStatus.NOT_STARTED
            || pollResponse.getStatus() == LongRunningOperationStatus.IN_PROGRESS)
    {
        pollResponse = poller.poll();
        // The operation ID can be retrieved as soon as .poll() is called on the poller
        System.out.println("Email send poller status: " + pollResponse.getStatus() + ", operation id: " + pollResponse.getValue().getId());

        Thread.sleep(POLLER_WAIT_TIME.toMillis());
        timeElapsed = timeElapsed.plus(POLLER_WAIT_TIME);

        if (timeElapsed.compareTo(POLLER_WAIT_TIME.multipliedBy(18)) >= 0)
        {
            throw new RuntimeException("Polling timed out.");
        }
    }

    if (poller.getFinalResult().getStatus() == EmailSendStatus.SUCCEEDED)
    {
        System.out.printf("Successfully sent the email (operation id: %s)", poller.getFinalResult().getId());
    }
    else
    {
        throw new RuntimeException(poller.getFinalResult().getError().getMessage());
    }
}
catch (Exception exception)
{
    System.out.println(exception.getMessage());
}
```

## [Async Client](#tab/async-client)

Calling `beginSend` on the async client returns a `PollerFlux` object to which you can subscribe. The callbacks defined in the subscribe method will be triggered once the email sending operation is complete. **Note that the initial request to send an email will not be sent until a subscriber is set up.**

```java
Duration MAIN_THREAD_WAIT_TIME = Duration.ofSeconds(30);

// ExecutorService to run the polling in a separate thread
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

PollerFlux<EmailSendResult, EmailSendResult> poller = emailAsyncClient.beginSend(emailMessage);

executorService.submit(() -> {
    // The initial request is sent out as soon as we subscribe the to PollerFlux object
    poller.subscribe(
        response -> {
            if (response.getStatus() == LongRunningOperationStatus.SUCCESSFULLY_COMPLETED) {
                System.out.printf("Successfully sent the email (operation id: %s)\n", response.getValue().getId());
            }
            else {
                // The operation ID can be retrieved as soon as the first response is received from the PollerFlux.
                System.out.println("Email send status: " + response.getStatus() + ", operation id: " + response.getValue().getId());
            }
        },
        error -> {
            System.out.println("Error occurred while sending email: " + error.getMessage());
        }
    );
});

// In a real application, you might have a mechanism to keep the main thread alive.
// For this sample we will keep the main thread alive for 30 seconds to make sure the child thread has time to receive the SUCCESSFULLY_COMPLETED status.
try {
    Thread.sleep(MAIN_THREAD_WAIT_TIME.toMillis());
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

executorService.shutdown();
System.out.println("Main thread ends.");
```
