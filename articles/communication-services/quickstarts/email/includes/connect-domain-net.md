## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/).
- An Azure Email Communication Services Resource ready to provision domains. [Get started creating an Email Communication Resource](../create-email-communication-resource.md).
- An [Azure Managed Domain](../add-azure-managed-domains.md) or [Custom Domain](../add-custom-verified-domains.md) provisioned and ready to send emails. This domain must be fully verified before attempting to link it to the Communication Service resource.
- An Azure Communication Services Resource. [Create a Communication Services Resources](../../create-communication-resource.md).
- We're using a [service principal for authentication](/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal). Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the Microsoft Entra application as the following environment variables: `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

## Install the required packages

```console
dotnet add package Azure.ResourceManager.Communication
```

## Initialize the management client

Set the environment variable `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` with the subscription ID of the subscription your Domain and Email resources are in. Run the code sample to initialize the management client.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Azure.Core;
using Azure.Identity;
using Azure.ResourceManager;
using Azure.ResourceManager.Compute;
using Azure.ResourceManager.Resources;

ArmClient client = new ArmClient(new DefaultAzureCredential());
```

## Connect an email domain to a Communication Service Resource

Replace the `<subscription-id>`, `<resource-group-name>`, `<azure-communication-services-resource-name>`, and `<linked-domain-resource-id>` in the sample code.

Format the linked domain resource ID as follows: 

```
/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Communication/emailServices/<email-service-name>/domains/<domain-name>
```

If you're using an Azure Managed Domain, the `domain-name` is "AzureManagedDomain." The `email-service-name` should be the same email service that you used to provision the domain.

Once these values are populated, run the sample code.

```csharp
ResourceIdentifier communicationServiceResourceId = CommunicationServiceResource.CreateResourceIdentifier("<subscription-id>", "<resource-group-name>", "<azure-communication-services-resource-name>");
CommunicationServiceResource communicationServiceResource = client.GetCommunicationServiceResource(communicationServiceResourceId);

CommunicationServiceResourcePatch patch = new CommunicationServiceResourcePatch()
{
    LinkedDomains =
    {
        "<linked-domain-resource-id>",
    },
};
CommunicationServiceResource result = await communicationServiceResource.UpdateAsync(patch);
```

## Disconnect an email domain from the Communication Service Resource

Replace the `<subscription-id>`, `<resource-group-name>`, and `<azure-communication-services-resource-name>` in the sample code. 

Once these values are populated, run the sample code.

```csharp
ResourceIdentifier communicationServiceResourceId = CommunicationServiceResource.CreateResourceIdentifier("<subscription-id>", "<resource-group-name>", "<azure-communication-services-resource-name>");
CommunicationServiceResource communicationServiceResource = client.GetCommunicationServiceResource(communicationServiceResourceId);

CommunicationServiceResourcePatch patch = new CommunicationServiceResourcePatch();
patch.LinkedDomains.Clear();
CommunicationServiceResource result = await communicationServiceResource.UpdateAsync(patch);
```
