# Quickstart: How to add custom verified email domains

In this quick start, you learn how to provision a custom verified email domain in Azure Communication Services.

## Azure Managed Domains compared to Custom Domains

Before provisioning a custom email domain, review the following table to decide which domain type best meets your needs.

| | [Azure Managed Domains](./add-azure-managed-domains.md) | [Custom Domains](./add-custom-verified-domains.md) | 
|---|---|---|
|**Pros:** | - Setup is quick & easy<br/>- No domain verification required<br /> | - Emails are sent from your own domain |
|**Cons:** | - Sender domain isn't personalized and can't be changed<br/>- Sender usernames can't be personalized<br/>- Limited sending volume<br />- User Engagement Tracking can't be enabled<br /> | - Requires verification of domain records<br /> - Longer setup for verification |

### Service limits

Both Azure managed domains and Custom domains are subject to service limits. Service limits include failure, rate, and size limits. For more information, see [Service limits for Azure Communication Services > Email](../../concepts/service-limits.md#email).

## Change MailFrom and FROM display names for custom domains

You can optionally configure your `MailFrom` address to be something other than the default `DoNotReply` and add more than one sender username to your domain. For more information about how to configure your sender address, see [Quickstart: How to add multiple sender addresses](add-multiple-senders.md).

**Your email domain is now ready to send emails.**
