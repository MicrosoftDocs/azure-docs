## Basic email sending 

### Construct your email message

To send an email message, you need to:
- Define the email subject and body.
- Define your Sender Address. Construct your email message with your Sender information you get your MailFrom address from your verified domain. 
- Define the Recipient Address.
- Call the SendAsync method. Add this code to the end of `Main` method in **Program.cs**:

Replace with your domain details and modify the content, recipient details as required
```csharp

//Replace with your domain and modify the content, recipient details as required

var subject = "Welcome to Azure Communication Service Email APIs.";
var htmlContent = "<html><body><h1>Quick send email test</h1><br/><h4>This email message is sent from Azure Communication Service Email.</h4><p>This mail was sent using .NET SDK!!</p></body></html>";
var sender = "donotreply@xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.azurecomm.net";
var recipient = "emailalias@contoso.com";

```
### Send and get the email send status

When you call SendAsync with Azure.WaitUntil.Started, your method returns back after starting the operation. The method returns EmailSendOperation object. You can call UpdateStatusAsync method to refresh the email operation status. 

The returned EmailSendOperation object contains an EmailSendStatus object that contains: 
- Current status of the Email Send operation.
- An error object with failure details if the current status is in a failed state.

```csharp

/// Send the email message with WaitUntil.Started
EmailSendOperation emailSendOperation = await emailClient.SendAsync(
    Azure.WaitUntil.Started,
    sender,
    recipient,
    subject,
    htmlContent);

/// Call UpdateStatus on the email send operation to poll for the status
/// manually.
try
{
    while (true)
    {
        await emailSendOperation.UpdateStatusAsync();
        if (emailSendOperation.HasCompleted)
        {
            break;
        }
        await Task.Delay(100);
    }

    if (emailSendOperation.HasValue)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Email queued for delivery. Status = {emailSendOperation.Value.Status}");
    }
}
catch (RequestFailedException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Email send failed with Code = {ex.ErrorCode} and Message = {ex.Message}");
}

/// Get the OperationId so that it can be used for tracking the message for troubleshooting
string operationId = emailSendOperation.Id;
Console.WriteLine($"Email operation id = {operationId}");
```

Run the application from your application directory with the `dotnet run` command.

```console
dotnet run
```
