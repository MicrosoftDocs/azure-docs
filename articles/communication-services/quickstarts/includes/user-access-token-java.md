## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](/java/azure/jdk/) version 8 or above.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- A deployed Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../create-communication-resource.md).

## Setting Up

### Create a new Java application

Open your terminal or command window. Navigate to the directory where you'd like to create your Java application. Run the command below to generate the Java project from the maven-archetype-quickstart template.

```console
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.communication.quickstart -DartifactId=communication-quickstart -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false
```

You'll notice that the 'generate' task created a directory with the same name as the `artifactId`. Under this directory, the src/main/java directory contains the project source code, the `src/test/java directory` contains the test source, and the `pom.xml` file is the project's Project Object Model, or POM.

### Install the package

Open the **pom.xml** file in your text editor. Add the following dependency element to the group of dependencies.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-communication-identity</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-beta.6</version>
</dependency>
```

### Set up the app framework

From the project directory:

1. Navigate to the */src/main/java/com/communication/quickstart* directory
1. Open the *App.java* file in your editor
1. Replace the `System.out.println("Hello world!");` statement
1. Add `import` directives

Use the following code to begin:

```java
package com.communication.quickstart;

import com.azure.communication.common.*;
import com.azure.communication.identity.*;
import com.azure.communication.identity.models.*;
import com.azure.core.credential.*;
import com.azure.core.http.*;
import com.azure.core.http.netty.*;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.time.*;
import java.util.*;

public class App
{
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws IOException
    {
        System.out.println("Azure Communication Services - Access Tokens Quickstart");
        // Quickstart code goes here
    }
}
```

## Authenticate the client

Instantiate a `CommunicationIdentityClient` with your resource's access key and endpoint. Learn how to [manage you resource's connection string](../create-communication-resource.md#store-your-connection-string).

Add the following code to the `main` method:

```java
// Your can find your endpoint and access key from your resource in the Azure portal
String endpoint = "https://<RESOURCE_NAME>.communication.azure.com";
String accessKey = "SECRET";

// Create an HttpClient builder of your choice and customize it
// Use com.azure.core.http.netty.NettyAsyncHttpClientBuilder if that suits your needs
// -> Add "import com.azure.core.http.netty.*;"
// -> Add azure-core-http-netty dependency to file pom.xml

HttpClient httpClient = new NettyAsyncHttpClientBuilder().build();

CommunicationIdentityClient communicationIdentityClient = new CommunicationIdentityClientBuilder()
        .endpoint(endpoint)
        .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(accessKey))
        .httpClient(httpClient)
        .buildClient();
```

You can initialize the client with any custom HTTP client the implements the `com.azure.core.http.HttpClient` interface. The above code demonstrates use of the [Azure Core Netty HTTP client](/java/api/overview/azure/core-http-netty-readme) that is provided by `azure-core`.

You can also provide the entire connection string using the `connectionString()` function instead of providing the endpoint and access key.
```java
// Your can find your connection string from your resource in the Azure portal
String connectionString = "<connection_string>";
HttpClient httpClient = new NettyAsyncHttpClientBuilder().build();

CommunicationIdentityClient communicationIdentityClient = new CommunicationIdentityClientBuilder()
    .connectionString(connectionString)
    .httpClient(httpClient)
    .buildClient();
```

## Create an identity

Azure Communication Services maintains a lightweight identity directory. Use the `createUser` method to create a new entry in the directory with a unique `Id`. Store received identity with mapping to your application's users. For example, by storing them in your application server's database. The identity is required later to issue access tokens.

```java
CommunicationUserIdentifier user = communicationIdentityClient.createUser();
System.out.println("\nCreated an identity with ID: " + user.getId());
```

## Issue access tokens

Use the `getToken` method to issue an access token for already existing Communication Services identity. Parameter `scopes` defines set of primitives, that will authorize this access token. See the [list of supported actions](../../concepts/authentication.md). New instance of parameter `user` can be constructed based on string representation of Azure Communication Service identity.

```java
// Issue an access token with the "voip" scope for a user identity
List<CommunicationTokenScope> scopes = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(CommunicationTokenScope.VOIP));
AccessToken accessToken = communicationIdentityClient.getToken(user, scopes);
OffsetDateTime expiresAt = accessToken.getExpiresAt();
String token = accessToken.getToken();
System.out.println("\nIssued an access token with 'voip' scope that expires at: " + expiresAt + ": " + token);
```

## Create an identity and issue token in one call

Alternatively, use the 'createUserAndToken' method to to create a new entry in the directory with a unique `Id` and
issue an access token.

```java
List<CommunicationTokenScope> scopes = Arrays.asList(CommunicationTokenScope.CHAT);
CommunicationUserIdentifierAndToken result = communicationIdentityClient.createUserAndToken(scopes);
CommunicationUserIdentifier user = result.getUser();
System.out.println("\nCreated a user identity with ID: " + user.getId());
AccessToken accessToken = result.getUserToken();
OffsetDateTime expiresAt = accessToken.getExpiresAt();
String token = accessToken.getToken();
System.out.println("\nIssued an access token with 'chat' scope that expires at: " + expiresAt + ": " + token);
```

Access tokens are short-lived credentials that need to be reissued. Not doing so might cause disruption of your application's users experience. The `expiresAt` property indicates the lifetime of the access token.

## Refresh access tokens

To refresh an access token, use the `CommunicationUserIdentifier` object to reissue:

```java
// Value existingIdentity represents identity of Azure Communication Services stored during identity creation
CommunicationUserIdentifier identity = new CommunicationUserIdentifier(existingIdentity);
AccessToken response = communicationIdentityClient.getToken(identity, scopes);
```

## Revoke access tokens

In some cases, you may explicitly revoke access tokens. For example, when an application's user changes the password they use to authenticate to your service. Method `revokeTokens` invalidates all active access tokens, that were issued to the identity.

```java
communicationIdentityClient.revokeTokens(user);
System.out.println("\nSuccessfully revoked all access tokens for user identity with ID: " + user.getId());
```

## Delete an identity

Deleting an identity revokes all active access tokens and prevents you from issuing access tokens for the identity. It also removes all the persisted content associated with the identity.

```java
communicationIdentityClient.deleteUser(user);
System.out.println("\nDeleted the user identity with ID: " + user.getId());
```

## Run the code

Navigate to the directory containing the *pom.xml* file and compile the project by using the following `mvn` command.

```console
mvn compile
```

Then, build the package.

```console
mvn package
```

Run the following `mvn` command to execute the app.

```console
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.communication.quickstart.App" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false
```
