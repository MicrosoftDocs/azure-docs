# Quickstart: Download WhatsApp message media

Azure Communication Services enables you to send and receive WhatsApp messages. This article describes how to download the media payload received in a WhatsApp message. 

**Use case:** A business receives a WhatsApp message from their customer that contains an image. The business needs to download the image from WhatsApp in order to view the image.

Incoming messages to the business are published as [Microsoft.Communication.AdvancedMessageReceived](/azure/event-grid/communication-services-advanced-messaging-events#microsoftcommunicationadvancedmessagereceived-event) Event Grid events. This example uses the media ID and media MIME type in the `AdvancedMessageReceived` event to download the media payload.

An example of an `AdvancedMessageReceived` event with media content:

```json
[{
  "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "topic": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resourcegroup-name}/providers/microsoft.communication/communicationservices/{communication-services-resource-name}",
  "subject": "advancedMessage/sender/{sender@id}/recipient/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
  "data": {
    "channelType": "whatsapp",
    "media": {
      "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
      "id": "22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222"
    },
    "from": "{sender@id}",
    "to": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
    "receivedTimestamp": "2023-07-06T18:30:19+00:00"
  },
  "eventType": "Microsoft.Communication.AdvancedMessageReceived",
  "dataVersion": "1.0",
  "metadataVersion": "1",
  "eventTime": "2023-07-06T18:30:22.1921716Z"
}]
```
