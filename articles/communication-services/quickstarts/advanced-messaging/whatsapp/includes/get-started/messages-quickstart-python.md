## Prerequisites

- [WhatsApp Business Account registered with your Azure Communication Services resource](../../connect-whatsapp-business-account.md).

- Active WhatsApp phone number to receive messages.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.7+ for your operating system.

## Setting up

### Create a new Python application

In a terminal or console window, create a new folder for your application and navigate to it.

```console
mkdir messages-quickstart && cd messages-quickstart
```

### Install the package

You need to use the Azure Communication Messages client library for Python [version 1.0.0](https://pypi.org/project/azure-communication-messages) or above.

From a console prompt, execute the following command:

```console
pip install azure-communication-messages
```

### Set up the app framework

Create a new file called `messages-quickstart.py` and add the basic program structure.

```console
type nul > messages-quickstart.py   
```
#### Basic program structure
```python
import os

class MessagesQuickstart(object):
    print("Azure Communication Services - Advanced Messages SDK Quickstart")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    messages = MessagesQuickstart()
```

## Object model
The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the Azure Communication Services Messages SDK for Python.

| Name                        | Description                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NotificationMessagesClient  | This class connects to your Azure Communication Services resource. It sends the messages.              |
| MessageTemplate             | This class defines which template you use and the content of the template properties for your message. |
| TemplateNotificationContent | This class defines the "who" and the "what" of the template message you intend to send.                |
| TextNotificationContent     | This class defines the "who" and the "what" of the text message you intend to send.                    |
| ImageNotificationContent    | This class defines the "who" and the "what" of the image media message you intend to send.             |

## Code examples

Follow these steps to add the necessary code snippets to the messages-quickstart.py python program.

- [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
- [Set channel registration ID](#set-channel-registration-id)
- [Set recipient list](#set-recipient-list)
- [Start sending messages between a business and a WhatsApp user](#start-sending-messages-between-a-business-and-a-whatsapp-user)
  - [Send a template message to a WhatsApp User](#option-1-initiate-conversation-from-business---send-a-template-message)
  - [Initiate conversation from user](#option-2-initiate-conversation-from-user)
- [Send a text message to a WhatsApp user](#send-a-text-message-to-a-whatsapp-user)
- [Send a media message to a WhatsApp user](#send-a-media-message-to-a-whatsapp-user)

### Authenticate the client 

Messages sending is done using NotificationMessagesClient. NotificationMessagesClient is authenticated using your connection string acquired from Azure Communication Services resource in the Azure portal. For more information on connection strings, see [access-your-connection-strings-and-service-endpoints](../../../../create-communication-resource.md#access-your-connection-strings-and-service-endpoints).

#### [Connection String](#tab/connection-string)

Get Azure Communication Resource connection string from Azure portal as given in screenshot.On the left, navigate to the `Keys` tab. Copy the `Connection string` field for the primary key. The connection string is in the format `endpoint=https://{your Azure Communication Services resource name}.communication.azure.com/;accesskey={secret key}`.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/get-started/get-communication-resource-connection-string.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an Azure Communication Services resource in the Azure portal, viewing the 'Primary Key' field in the 'Keys' section.":::

Set the environment variable `COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_CONNECTION_STRING` to the value of your connection string.   
Open a console window and enter the following command:
```console
setx COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_CONNECTION_STRING "<your connection string>"
```
After you add the environment variable, you might need to restart any running programs that will need to read the environment variable, including the console window. For example, if you're using Visual Studio as your editor, restart Visual Studio before running the example.

For more information on how to set an environment variable for your system, follow the steps at [Store your connection string in an environment variable](../../../../create-communication-resource.md#store-your-connection-string-in-an-environment-variable).

```python
    # Get a connection string to our Azure Communication Services resource.
    connection_string = os.getenv("COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_CONNECTION_STRING")
    
    def send_template_message(self):
        from azure.communication.messages import NotificationMessagesClient

        # Create NotificationMessagesClient Client
        messaging_client = NotificationMessagesClient.from_connection_string(self.connection_string)
```

#### [Microsoft Entra ID](#tab/aad)

NotificationMessagesClient is also authenticated using Microsoft Entra ID/TokenCredentials. For more information see [access-Azure-Communication-Resources-using-TokenCredentials](/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-python&preserve-view=true#environment-variables).

The [`azure.identity`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/azure-identity_1.15.0/sdk/identity/azure-identity) package provides various credential types that your application can use to authenticate. You can choose from the various options to authenticate the identity client detailed at [Azure Identity - Credential providers](/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-python#credential-classes) and [Azure Identity - Authenticate the client](/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-python#authenticate-with-defaultazurecredential). This option walks through one way of using the [`DefaultAzureCredential`](/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-python#defaultazurecredential).
 
The `DefaultAzureCredential` attempts to authenticate via [`several mechanisms`](/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-python#defaultazurecredential) and it might be able to find its authentication credentials if you're signed into Visual Studio or Azure CLI. However, this option walks you through setting up with environment variables.   

To create a `DefaultAzureCredential` object:
1. To set up your service principle app, follow the instructions at [Creating a Microsoft Entra registered Application](../../../../identity/service-principal.md?pivots=platform-azcli#creating-a-microsoft-entra-registered-application).

1. Set the environment variables `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AZURE_TENANT_ID` using the output of your app's creation.    
    Open a console window and enter the following commands:
    ```console
    setx COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_ENDPOINT_STRING "<https://<resource name>.communication.azure.com>"
    setx AZURE_CLIENT_ID "<your app's appId>"
    setx AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET "<your app's password>"
    setx AZURE_TENANT_ID "<your app's tenant>"
    ```
    After you add the environment variables, you might need to restart any running programs that will need to read the environment variables, including the console window. For example, if you're using Visual Studio as your editor, restart Visual Studio before running the example.

1. To use the [`DefaultAzureCredential`](/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-python#defaultazurecredential) provider, or other credential providers provided with the Azure SDK, install the `azure.identity` python package and then instantiate client.
    
```python
    # Get a connection string to our Azure Communication Services resource.
    endpoint_string = os.getenv("COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_ENDPOINT_STRING")
    
    def send_template_message(self):
        from azure.communication.messages import NotificationMessagesClient
        from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

        # Create NotificationMessagesClient Client
        messaging_client = NotificationMessagesClient(endpoint=self.endpoint_string,
                                                    credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
```

#### [AzureKeyCredential](#tab/azurekeycredential)

You can also authenticate with an AzureKeyCredential.

Get the endpoint and key from your Azure Communication Services resource in the Azure portal. On the left, navigate to the `Keys` tab. Copy the `Endpoint` and the `Key` field for the primary key.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/get-started/get-communication-resource-endpoint-and-key.png" lightbox="../../media/get-started/get-communication-resource-endpoint-and-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an Azure Communication Services resource in the Azure portal, viewing the 'Connection string' field in the 'Primary key' section.":::

Set the environment variable `COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_KEY` to the value of your connection string.   
Open a console window and enter the following command:
```console
setx COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_ENDPOINT_STRING "<https://<resource name>.communication.azure.com>"
setx COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_KEY "<your key>"
```
After you add the environment variable, you might need to restart any running programs that will need to read the environment variable, including the console window. For example, if you're using Visual Studio as your editor, restart Visual Studio before running the example.

For more information on how to set an environment variable for your system, follow the steps at [Store your connection string in an environment variable](../../../../create-communication-resource.md#store-your-connection-string-in-an-environment-variable).

To instantiate a `NotificationMessagesClient`, add the following code:

```python
    # Get a connection string to our Azure Communication Services resource.
    endpoint_string = os.getenv("COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_ENDPOINT_STRING")
    key = os.getenv("COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_KEY")

    def send_template_message(self):
        from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
        from azure.communication.messages import NotificationMessagesClient

        # Create NotificationMessagesClient Client
        messaging_client = NotificationMessagesClient(endpoint=self.endpoint_string,
                                                    credential=AzureKeyCredential(self.key))
```

### Set channel registration ID   

The Channel Registration ID GUID was created during [channel registration](../../connect-whatsapp-business-account.md). You can look it up in the portal on the Channels tab of your Azure Communication Services resource.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/get-started/get-messages-channel-id.png" lightbox="../../media/get-started/get-messages-channel-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an Azure Communication Services resource in the Azure portal, viewing the 'Channels' tab. Attention is placed on the copy action of the 'Channel ID' field.":::

Assign it to a variable called channelRegistrationId.
```python
    channelRegistrationId = os.getenv("WHATSAPP_CHANNEL_ID_GUID")
```

### Set recipient list

You need to supply a real phone number that has a WhatsApp account associated with it. This WhatsApp account receives the template, text, and media messages sent in this quickstart.
For this quickstart, this phone number may be your personal phone number.   

The recipient phone number can't be the business phone number (Sender ID) associated with the WhatsApp channel registration. The Sender ID appears as the sender of the text and media messages sent to the recipient.

The phone number should include the country code. For more information on phone number formatting, see WhatsApp documentation for [Phone Number Formats](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/phone-numbers#phone-number-formats).

> [!NOTE]
> Only one phone number is currently supported in the recipient list.

Set the recipient list like this:
```python
    phone_number = os.getenv("RECIPIENT_WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER")
```

Usage Example:
```python
    # Example only
    to=[self.phone_number],
```

### Start sending messages between a business and a WhatsApp user

Conversations between a WhatsApp Business Account and a WhatsApp user can be initiated in one of two ways:
- The business sends a template message to the WhatsApp user.
- The WhatsApp user sends any message to the business number.

Regardless of how the conversation was started, **a business can only send template messages until the user sends a message to the business.** Only after the user sends a message to the business, the business is allowed to send text or media messages to the user during the active conversation. Once the 24 hour conversation window expires, the conversation must be reinitiated. To learn more about conversations, see the definition at [WhatsApp Business Platform](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing#conversations).

#### (Option 1) Initiate conversation from business - Send a template message
Initiate a conversation by sending a template message.

First, create a MessageTemplate using the values for a template. 
> [!NOTE]
> To check which templates you have available, see the instructions at [List templates](../../../../../concepts/advanced-messaging/whatsapp/template-messages.md#list-templates).
> If you don't have a template to use, proceed to [Option 2](#option-2-initiate-conversation-from-user).

Here's MessageTemplate creation using a default template, `sample_template`.   
If `sample_template` isn't available to you, skip to [Option 2](#option-2-initiate-conversation-from-user). For advanced users, see the page [Templates](../../../../../concepts/advanced-messaging/whatsapp/template-messages.md) to understand how to send a different template with Option 1.

Messages SDK allows Contoso to send templated WhatsApp messages to WhatsApp users. To send template messages below details are required:
- [WhatsApp Channel ID](#set-channel-registration-id)
- [Recipient Phone Number in E16 format](#set-recipient-list)
- Template details
    - Name like 'sample_template'
    - Language like 'en_us'
    - Parameters if any

For more examples of how to assemble your MessageTemplate and how to create your own template, refer to the following resource:
- [Send WhatsApp Template Messages](../../../../../concepts/advanced-messaging/whatsapp/template-messages.md) 
   
For further WhatsApp requirements on templates, refer to the WhatsApp Business Platform API references:
- [Create and Manage Templates](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/message-templates/)
- [Template Components](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/message-templates/components)
- [Sending Template Messages](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-message-templates)

To send WhatsApp template message add below code in the send_template_message(self) function.
```python
        input_template: MessageTemplate = MessageTemplate(
            name="<<template_name>>",
            language="<<template_language>>")
        template_options = TemplateNotificationContent(
            channel_registration_id=self.channelRegistrationId,
            to=[self.phone_number],
            template=input_template
        )

        # calling send() with whatsapp template details
        message_responses = messaging_client.send(template_options)
        response = message_responses.receipts[0]
        
        if (response is not None):
            print("WhatsApp Templated Message with message id {} was successfully sent to {}."
            .format(response.message_id, response.to))
        else:
            print("Message failed to send")
```

Add send_template_message() call to the [main method](#basic-program-structure).
```python
    # Calling send_template_message()
    messages.send_template_message()
```

Now, the user needs to respond to the template message. From the WhatsApp user account, reply to the template message received from the WhatsApp Business Account. The content of the message is irrelevant for this scenario.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The recipient must respond to the template message to initiate the conversation before text or media message can be delivered to the recipient.

#### (Option 2) Initiate conversation from user

The other option to initiate a conversation between a WhatsApp Business Account and a WhatsApp user is to have the user initiate the conversation.
To do so, from your personal WhatsApp account, send a message to your business number (Sender ID).

:::image type="content" source="../../media/get-started/user-initiated-conversation.png" lightbox="../../media/get-started/user-initiated-conversation.png" alt-text="A WhatsApp conversation viewed on the web showing a user message sent to the WhatsApp Business Account number.":::

### Send a text message to a WhatsApp user

Messages SDK allows Contoso to send text WhatsApp messages, which initiated WhatsApp users initiated. To send text messages below details are required:
- [WhatsApp Channel ID](#set-channel-registration-id)
- [Recipient Phone Number in E16 format](#set-recipient-list)
- Message body/text to be sent

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To send a text message to a WhatsApp user, the WhatsApp user must first send a message to the WhatsApp Business Account. For more information, see [Start sending messages between business and WhatsApp user](#start-sending-messages-between-a-business-and-a-whatsapp-user).

In this example, we reply to the WhatsApp user with the text "Thanks for your feedback.\n From Notification Messaging SDK".
```python
    def send_text_message(self):
        from azure.communication.messages import NotificationMessagesClient
        from azure.communication.messages.models import ( TextNotificationContent)

        # Create NotificationMessagesClient Client
        messaging_client = NotificationMessagesClient.from_connection_string(self.connection_string)
        text_options = TextNotificationContent (
            channel_registration_id=self.channelRegistrationId,
            to= [self.phone_number],
            content="Thanks for your feedback.\n From Notification Messaging SDK",
        )
        
        # calling send() with whatsapp message details
        message_responses = messaging_client.send(text_options)
        response = message_responses.receipts[0]
        
        if (response is not None):
            print("WhatsApp Text Message with message id {} was successfully sent to {}."
            .format(response.message_id, response.to))
        else:
            print("Message failed to send")
```

Update the [main method](#basic-program-structure) to run send_text_message()
```python
    #Calling send_text_message()
    messages.send_text_message()
```

### Send a media message to a WhatsApp user

Messages SDK allows Contoso to send Image WhatsApp messages to WhatsApp users. To send Image embedded messages below details are required:
- [WhatsApp Channel ID](#set-channel-registration-id)
- [Recipient Phone Number in E16 format](#set-recipient-list)
- MediaUri of the Image

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To send a text message to a WhatsApp user, the WhatsApp user must first send a message to the WhatsApp Business Account. For more information, see [Start sending messages between business and WhatsApp user](#start-sending-messages-between-a-business-and-a-whatsapp-user).

An example of media_uri used in sending media WhatsApp message.

input_media_uri: str = "https://aka.ms/acsicon1"

```python
    def send_image_message(self):
        from azure.communication.messages import NotificationMessagesClient
        from azure.communication.messages.models import ( ImageNotificationContent)

        # Create NotificationMessagesClient Client
        messaging_client = NotificationMessagesClient.from_connection_string(self.connection_string)
        input_media_uri: str = "https://aka.ms/acsicon1"
        image_message_options = ImageNotificationContent(
            channel_registration_id=self.channelRegistrationId,
            to=[self.phone_number],
            media_uri=input_media_uri
        )

        # calling send() with whatsapp image message
        message_responses = messaging_client.send(image_message_options)
        response = message_responses.receipts[0]
        
        if (response is not None):
            print("WhatsApp Image containing Message with message id {} was successfully sent to {}"
            .format(response.message_id, response.to))
        else:
            print("Message failed to send")
```

Update the [main method](#basic-program-structure) to run send_image_message()
```python
    # Calling send_image_message()
    messages.send_image_message()
```


## Run the code

To run the code, make sure you are on the directory where your `messages-quickstart.py` file is.

```console
python messages-quickstart.py
```

```output
Azure Communication Services - Advanced Messages Quickstart
