- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

## Set up environment

To set up an environment for sending messages, complete the steps in the following sections.

[!INCLUDE [Setting up for Java Application](../java-application-setup.md)]

## Object model

The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the Azure Communication Services Messages SDK for Java.

| `NotificationMessagesClient`  | Connects to your Azure Communication Services resource. It sends the messages.              |
| `StickerNotificationContent` |  Defines sticker content of the messages. |

> [!NOTE]
> For more information, see the Azure SDK for Java reference at [com.azure.communication.messages Package](/java/api/com.azure.communication.messages).

## Common configuration

### Send a sticker messages to a WhatsApp user

The Messages SDK enables Contoso to send reaction WhatsApp messages, when initiated by WhatsApp users. To send text messages:
- [WhatsApp Channel ID](#set-channel-registration-id).
- [Recipient Phone Number in E16 format](#set-recipient-list).
- URL of a sticker.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To send a sticker message to user, the WhatsApp user must first send a message to the WhatsApp Business Account. For more information, see [Start sending messages between business and WhatsApp user](#start-sending-messages-between-a-business-and-a-whatsapp-user).

Assemble and send the sticker message:

```java
// Assemble sticker message
String stickerUrl = "https://www.gstatic.com/webp/gallery/1.sm.webp";
StickerNotificationContent sticker = new StickerNotificationContent("<CHANNEL_ID>", recipients, stickerUrl);

// Send sticker message
SendMessageResult textMessageResult = notificationClient.send(sticker);

// Process result
for (MessageReceipt messageReceipt : textMessageResult.getReceipts()) {
    System.out.println("Message sent to:" + messageReceipt.getTo() + " and message id:" + messageReceipt.getMessageId());
}
```

### Run the code

1. Open to the directory that contains the `pom.xml` file and compile the project using the `mvn` command.

   ```console
   mvn compile
   ```

1. Run the app by executing the following `mvn` command.

   ```console
   mvn exec:java -D"exec.mainClass"="com.communication.quickstart.App" -D"exec.cleanupDaemonThreads"="false"
   ```
