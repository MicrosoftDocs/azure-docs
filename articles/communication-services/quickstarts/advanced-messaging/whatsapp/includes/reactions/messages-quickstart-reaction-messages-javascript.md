### Send a Reaction messages to a WhatsApp user message

The Messages SDK enables Contoso to send reaction WhatsApp messages, when initiated by WhatsApp users. To send text messages:
- [WhatsApp Channel ID](#set-channel-registration-id).
- [Recipient Phone Number in E16 format](#set-recipient-list).
- Emoji.
- Message Id of message you want to apply the emoji to.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To send a reaction to user message, the WhatsApp user must first send a message to the WhatsApp Business Account. For more information, see [Start sending messages between business and WhatsApp user](#start-sending-messages-between-a-business-and-a-whatsapp-user).

In this example, the business sends a reaction to the user message:

```javascript
/**
 * @summary Send a reaction message
 */

const { AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/core-auth");
const NotificationClient = require("@azure-rest/communication-messages").default,
  { isUnexpected } = require("@azure-rest/communication-messages");
// Load the .env file if it exists
require("dotenv").config();

async function main() {
  const credential = new AzureKeyCredential(process.env.ACS_ACCESS_KEY || "");
  const endpoint = process.env.ACS_URL || "";
  const client = NotificationClient(endpoint, credential);
  console.log("Sending message...");
  const result = await client.path("/messages/notifications:send").post({
    contentType: "application/json",
    body: {
      channelRegistrationId: process.env.CHANNEL_ID || "",
      to: [process.env.RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER || ""],
      kind: "reaction",
      emoji: "üòç",
      messageId: "<incoming_message_id>",
    },
  });

  console.log("Response: " + JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));

  if (isUnexpected(result)) {
    throw new Error("Failed to send message");
  }

  const response = result;
  response.body.receipts.forEach((receipt) => {
    console.log("Message sent to:" + receipt.to + " with message id:" + receipt.messageId);
  });
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error("Encountered an error while sending message: ", error);
  throw error;
});
```

## Run the code
Use the node command to run the code you added to the send-messages.js file.
