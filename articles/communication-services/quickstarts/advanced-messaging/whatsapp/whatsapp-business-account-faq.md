# WhatsApp business account FAQ

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Disclaimer](../../../includes/public-preview-include-document.md)]

There are some common issues you may see with the WhatsApp Business Account that you have connected to your Azure Communication Services resource. Your WhatsApp Business Account is managed from the WhatsApp business portal. This article provides links to the WhatsApp documentation to learn more and troubleshoot these issues.

## What is a display name and how is it verified?

The WhatsApp Business display name is your business name that customers see on your WhatsApp Business profile. When you add a new phone number to your WhatsApp Business Account in the Meta Business Manager, you need to assign a display name to it.

WhatsApp reviews your display name and check your account. The review and account checks aren't required to get started with the platform. You can immediately start sending messages to customers. You can learn more about the WhatsApp Business display name review here: [Business Accounts - WhatsApp Business Platform (facebook.com)](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/business-accounts/)


If your display name is rejected, review the [Display Name Guidelines \| Meta Business Help Center (facebook.com)](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/757569725593362)

You can change your display name following these instructions: [How to change your WhatsApp Business display name \| Meta Business Help Center (facebook.com)](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/378834799515077)


## What is WhatsApp business verification and why would I need it?
WhatsApp offers many options to verify and promote your business. You can learn about the types of WhatsApp Business accounts here: [Verify Your Business \| Meta Business Help Center (facebook.com)](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2058515294227817?id=180505742745347)

By default, any account using the WhatsApp Business Platform or WhatsApp Business App is a business account. Business verification isn't required to send messages to your customers.

When you’re ready to scale marketing, utility, and authentication conversations, you can complete business verification. Once the account has completed Business Verification, the name of the business is visible even if the user hasn't added the business to their address book.
