# Register WhatsApp business account

The Advanced Communication Messages SDK extends your communications to interact with the large global WhatsApp community for common scenarios:

- Receive inquiries from your customers for product feedback or support, price quotes, and reschedule appointments.
- Send your customer's notifications like appointment reminders, product discounts, transaction receipts, and one-time passcodes.
