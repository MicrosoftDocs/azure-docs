# Send an SMS message

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SMS capabilities depend on the phone number you use and the country/region that you're operating within as determined by your Azure billing address. For more information, see [Subscription eligibility](../../concepts/numbers/sub-eligibility-number-capability.md).

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues related to SMS delivery, you can [enable delivery reporting with Event Grid](./handle-sms-events.md) to capture delivery details.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](../create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).

## Toll-free verification

To use a new toll-free number for sending SMS messages, you must complete a toll-free verification process. For guidance on how to complete the verification of your toll-free number, see the [Quickstart for submitting a toll-free verification](./apply-for-toll-free-verification.md). Only fully verified toll-free numbers are authorized to send out SMS traffic. Any SMS traffic from unverified toll-free numbers directed to US and CA phone numbers are blocked.
