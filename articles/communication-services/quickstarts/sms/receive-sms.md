# Quickstart: Receive and Reply to SMS

Azure Communication Services SMS capabilities provide developers options to consume SMS received events. The events are posted to Azure Event Grid which provides out of the box integrations to process those using webhooks, Azure Functions, Power Automate / Logic App connectors, and more.

Once received, SMS messages can be processed to respond to them or to simply log them to a database for future access.

In this QuickStart, we will focus on showcasing the processing of SMS received events through Azure Functions using Event Grid triggers and no-code connectors for Power Automate / Logic Apps.

The `SMSReceived` event generated when an SMS is sent to an Azure Communication Services phone number is formatted in the following way:

```json
[{
  "id": "Incoming_20200918002745d29ebbea-3341-4466-9690-0a03af35228e",
  "topic": "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourcegroups/acse2e/providers/microsoft.communication/communicationservices/{communication-services-resource-name}",
  "subject": "/phonenumber/15555555555",
  "data": {
    "MessageId": "Incoming_20200918002745d29ebbea-3341-4466-9690-0a03af35228e",
    "From": "15555555555",
    "To": "15555555555",
    "Message": "Great to connect with Azure Communication Services events",
    "ReceivedTimestamp": "2020-09-18T00:27:45.32Z"
  },
  "eventType": "Microsoft.Communication.SMSReceived",
  "dataVersion": "1.0",
  "metadataVersion": "1",
  "eventTime": "2020-09-18T00:27:47Z"
}]
```

To start generating the events, we must configure Azure Event Grid for our Azure Communication Services resource.

> [!NOTE] 
> Using Azure Event Grid incurs additional costs. For more information, see [Azure Event Grid pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/event-grid/).

## Pre-requisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An active Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../create-communication-resource.md).
- An SMS-enabled telephone number. [Get a phone number](../telephony/get-phone-number.md).
- Enable Event Grid resource provide on your subscription. See [instructions](../sms/handle-sms-events.md#register-an-event-grid-resource-provider).

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](../create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).

## Toll-free verification

If you have a new toll-free number and want to send [high volume of SMS messages](../../concepts/sms/sms-faq.md#what-happens-if-i-dont-verify-my-toll-free-numbers) or send SMS messages to Canadian phone numbers, please visit [here](../../concepts/sms/sms-faq.md#how-do-i-submit-a-toll-free-verification) to learn how to verify your toll-free number.
