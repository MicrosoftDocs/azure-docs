By using the [Azure Communication Services SMS](../../../overview.md) connector and [Azure Logic Apps](../../../../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md), you can create automated workflows that can send SMS messages. This quickstart shows how to automatically send text messages in response to a trigger event, which is the first step in a logic app workflow. A trigger event can be an incoming email message, a recurrence schedule, an [Azure Event Grid](../../../../event-grid/overview.md) resource event, or any other [trigger that's supported by Azure Logic Apps](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-logicapps-connectors).

Although this quickstart focuses on using the connector to respond to a trigger, you can also use the connector to respond to other actions, which are the steps that follow the trigger in a workflow. If you're new to Logic Apps, review [What is Azure Logic Apps](../../../../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md) before you get started.

> [!NOTE]
> Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription, or [create an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- An active Azure Communication Services resource, or [create a Communication Services resource](../../create-communication-resource.md).

- An active Logic Apps resource (logic app), or [create a blank logic app but with the trigger that you want to use](../../../../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md). Currently, the Azure Communication Services SMS connector provides only actions, so your logic app requires a trigger, at minimum.

  This quickstart uses the **When a new email arrives** trigger, which is available with the [Office 365 Outlook connector](/connectors/office365/).

- An SMS-enabled telephone number, short code, or alphanumeric sender ID. [Get a phone number](./../../telephony/get-phone-number.md).

## Add an SMS action

To add the **Send SMS** action as a new step in your workflow by using the Azure Communication Services SMS connector, follow these steps in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your logic app workflow open in the Logic App Designer:

1. On the designer, under the step where you want to add the new action, select **New step**. Alternatively, to add the new action between steps, move your pointer over the arrow between those steps, select the plus sign (**+**), and select **Add an action**.

1. In the **Choose an operation** search box, enter `Azure Communication Services`. From the actions list, select **Send SMS**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/logic-app/select-send-sms-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Logic App Designer and the Azure Communication Services connector with the Send SMS action selected.":::

1. Now create a connection to your Communication Services resource.
    1. Within the same subscription:

       1. Provide a name for the connection.

       1. Select your Azure Communication Services resource.

       1. Select **Create**.

       :::image type="content" source="../media/logic-app/send-sms-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Send SMS action configuration with sample information.":::

    1. Using the connection string from your Communication Services resource:
        
        1. Provide a name for the connection.
        
        1. Select ConnectionString Authentication from the dropdown options.
        
        1. Enter the connection string of your Communication Services resource.
        
        1. Select **Create**.
        
        :::image type="content" source="../media/logic-app/connection-string-auth.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Connection String Authentication configuration.":::
        
    1. Using Service Principal ([Refer Services Principal Creation](../../identity/service-principal-from-cli.md)):
        1. Provide a name for the connection.
        
        1. Select Service principal (Microsoft Entra application) Authentication from the dropdown options.
        
        1. Enter the Tenant ID, Client ID & Client Secret of your Service Principal.
        
        1. Enter the Communication Services Endpoint URL value of your Communication Services resource.
        
        1. Select **Create**.
        
        :::image type="content" source="../media/logic-app/service-principal-auth.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Service Principal Authentication configuration.":::     

1. In the **Send SMS** action, provide the following information: 

   * The source and destination phone numbers. For testing purposes, you can use your own phone number as the destination phone number.

   * The message content that you want to send, for example, "Hello from Logic Apps!".

   Here's a **Send SMS** action with example information:

   :::image type="content" source="../media/logic-app/send-sms-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Send SMS action with sample information.":::

1. When you're done, on the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

Next, run your workflow for testing.

## Test your workflow

To manually start your workflow, on the designer toolbar, select **Run**. Or, you can wait for the trigger to fire. In both cases, the workflow should send an SMS message to your specified destination phone number. For more information, review [how to run your workflow](../../../../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md#run-workflow).

## Clean up workflow resources

To clean up your logic app workflow and related resources, review [how to clean up Logic Apps resources](../../../../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md#clean-up-resources).
