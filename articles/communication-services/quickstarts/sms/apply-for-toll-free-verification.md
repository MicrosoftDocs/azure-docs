This program brief is automatically sent to the toll-free messaging aggregator for review. The toll-free aggregator then reviews the details of the toll-free verification application, a process that can typically take between five to six weeks. Once they approve the application, you receive notification via application status change in the Azure portal. You can now start sending and receiving messages with low filtering on this toll-free number for your messaging programs.
