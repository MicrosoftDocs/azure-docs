## Verified Phone Numbers

### Why do I need to verify the recipient phone number for a trial phone number?
Verifying the recipient phone number is a security measure that ensures the trial phone number can only make calls to the verified number. This helps protect against misuse and unauthorized usage of trial phone numbers.

### How is the recipient phone number verified?
The verification process involves sending a one-time passcode via SMS to the recipient phone number. The recipient needs to enter this code in the Azure portal to complete the verification. 

### From where can I verify phone numbers?
Currently, only phone numbers that originate from the United States (i.e., have a +1 prefix) can be verified for use with trial phone numbers. 

### Can I verify multiple recipient phone numbers for the same trial phone number?
Currently the trial phone number can be verified for up to three recipient phone numbers. If you need to make calls to more numbers, then you'll need to [purchase a phone number](../../quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number.md)

### What happens if I enter the verification code incorrectly?
If the verification code is entered incorrectly, the verification process fails. You can request a new verification code and try again.

### Does the recipient phone number need to be in a specific format for verification?
Yes, the recipient phone number should be entered in the correct international format, including the country code. Ensure that the phone number is accurate and free of any typos or formatting errors.

### How long does the verification process take?
The verification code is typically sent within a few seconds after initiating the verification process. The overall process should be completed quickly, depending on the recipient's ability to receive the SMS and enter the code in the Azure portal.
