# Troubleshoot Azure Communication Services PSTN call failures

When you're troubleshooting Azure Communication Services PSTN call failures, we recommend that you [enable logging](../analytics/enable-logging.md). Then you can use `ResultCategories`, `ParticipantEndReason`, and `ParticipantEndSubCode` values to determine why an individual call ended and whether the system detected any failures.

## Use ResultCategories to troubleshoot failures

The `ResultCategories` array is a property of the [Call Summary Log Schema](../analytics/logs/call-summary-log-schema.md). It contains a list of general reasons that describe how the call ended:

- `Success`
- `Failure`
- `UnexpectedClientError`
- `UnexpectedServerError`

This information can help you determine why a call ended without generating a detailed error log.

## Use ParticipantEndReason and ParticipantEndSubCode to troubleshoot failures

If the level of detail in `ResultCategories` isn't sufficient when you're troubleshooting PSTN calls, you can use `ParticipantEndReason` and `ParticipantEndSubCode` to understand the reasons why a call ended in greater detail. `ParticipantEndReason` and `ParticipantEndSubCode` are also properties of the [Call Summary Log Schema](../analytics/logs/call-summary-log-schema.md).

### ParticipantEndReason

`ParticipantEndReason` is a three-digit code that shows the general call status. This code explains why the call ended and groups failures by category. For example, `ParticipantEndReason 404` means that caller or callee wasn't found. `ParticipantEndReason 500` means that a service error occurred.

This code is based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) response codes. For more information, see Wikipedia's [list of SIP response codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SIP_response_codes).

### ParticipantEndSubCode

`ParticipantEndSubCode` is a more specific response code that's usually six digits long. It explains in greater detail why there was a problem with the call.
  
A key factor in troubleshooting Azure Communication Services PSTN calls is determining whether the final SIP response code for the call came from a Microsoft process or the user's/operator's session border controller (SBC). An easy way to determine where the code originated is to look at the `ParticipantEndSubCode` response.

If the `ParticipantEndSubCode` value starts with `560`, it indicates that the user's/operator's SBC generated the response code. In that case, you should check the SBC configuration.

For example, if the `ParticipantEndSubCode` value is `560403`, it means that the SBC generated the final response code, and the code is `403`. In that case, you should start troubleshooting the calls by using the SBC logs.

For `ParticipantEndSubCode` responses that don't start with `560`, the Microsoft service generated the final response code.
