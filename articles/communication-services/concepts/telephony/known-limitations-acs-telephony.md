# Known limitations in Azure telephony

This article provides information about limitations and known issues related to telephony in Azure Communication Services.

## Azure Communication Services direct routing known limitations

- Maximum number of configured Session Border Controllers (SBC) is 250 per communication resource.
- When you change direct routing configuration (add SBC, change Voice Route, etc.), wait approximately five minutes for changes to take effect.
- If you move SBC FQDN to another Communication resource, wait approximately an hour, or restart SBC to force configuration change. 
- Azure Communication Services SBC Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) must be different from Teams Direct Routing SBC FQDN.
- One SBC FQDN can be connected to a single resource only. Unique SBC FQDNs are required for pairing to different resources.
- Media bypass/optimization isn't supported.
- Azure Communication Services direct routing isn't available in Government Clouds.
- Multitenant trunks aren't supported.
- Location-based routing isn't supported.
- No quality dashboard is available for customers.
- Enhanced 911 isn't supported.
- In-band Dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) isn't supported. Use RFC 2833 DTMF instead.
- Multiple IP addresses mapped with the same FQDN on the SBC side aren't supported.
- Maximum call duration is 30 hours.
- Early media isn't supported for group calls.
