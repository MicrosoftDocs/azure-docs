# Teams controls
In this article, you learn what tools Microsoft 365 provides to control the user experience in Microsoft Teams meetings. You know what those tools are, how they interact, which roles and licenses you need, and many more.
Let's start with a high-level decision tree diagram describing whether a specific feature is allowed for a meeting participant. A subset of the controls might control individual features. Let's take an example of call recording in the Teams meeting. Microsoft 365 administrators can't control this feature with tenant configuration but can control it via 
-	Policy assigned to the users, 
-	A sensibility label selected for the meeting, 
-	Meeting template selected for the meeting
-	Meeting options defined by the meeting organizer 
-	Role of the user in the meeting.

## Tenant configurations
Tenant configurations are organization-wide settings that impact everyone in the tenant. There's only one configuration, and the administrator can't create a new configuration. Just modify the existing one. Microsoft Teams provides, for example, configuration for [federation with Azure Communication Services](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsacsfederationconfiguration), [federation with Skype for Business](/powershell/module/skype/set-cstenantfederationconfiguration), or [configuration to control Teams meetings](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingconfiguration) (this configuration is being deprecated). Teams administrators can use these configurations as safeguards to disable capabilities for everyone in the tenant easily.
- Required role: Teams or global administrator
- Licensing: standard licensing
- Tools: Teams Admin Center or PowerShell

|Setting name | 	Description|	Tenant configuration	|Property	|
|--|--|--|--|
|[Anonymous users can join a meeting](/microsoftteams/meeting-settings-in-teams#allow-anonymous-users-to-join-meetings) | If disabled, Teams external users can't join Teams meetings. |	[CsTeamsMeetingConfiguration](/PowerShell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingconfiguration) |	DisableAnonymousJoin |

Your custom application should consider user authentication and other security measures to protect Teams meetings. Be mindful of the security implications of enabling anonymous users to join meetings. Use the [Teams security guide](/microsoftteams/teams-security-guide#addressing-threats-to-teams-meetings) to configure capabilities available to anonymous users.

## Tenant policies
Tenant policies are configurations that can be assigned to specific users or groups of users. A policy consists of properties with one of the following scopes: per-organizer, per-user, or both. Scope controls which policy is considered when evaluating the feature's availability, the organizers, participants, or both. 
Popular tenant policies are meeting, calling, messaging, or external access policies. A tenant has, by default, a Global policy assigned to everyone in the tenant. However, an administrator can create a new policy of a specific type, define a custom configuration, and assign it to users or groups of users. The following priority takes place when selecting which policy applies to the user:
1.	Directly assigned policy: The policy is assigned directly to the user.
2.	Group-assigned policy: The policy is assigned to a group the user is part of.
3.	Organization-wide policy: The Global policy applies.

![Decision tree for selection of policy for evaluation](../virtual-visits/media/decision-tree-policy-selection.svg)

An organizer-assigned policy can disable the feature in all meetings this user organizes. Disabled capability by policy can't be enabled with other tools. For example, administrators can use a global meeting policy to allow recording for everyone. Then create a new meeting policy called "external customers", which would disable recording. Admin then assigns the new policy to a group of users that conduct calls with external customers.
- Required role: Teams or global administrator
- Licensing: standard licensing
- Tools: Teams Admin Center or PowerShell

|Setting name |	Policy scope|Description	|Tenant policy|	property	|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|[Let anonymous people join a meeting](/microsoftteams/meeting-settings-in-teams#allow-anonymous-users-to-join-meetings) | per-organizer | If disabled, Teams external users can't join Teams meetings.	| [CsExternalAccessPolicy](/PowerShell/module/skype/set-csexternalaccesspolicy)|	EnableAcsFederationAccess	|
|Blocked anonymous join client types | per-organizer	|  If the property "BlockedAnonymousJoinClientTypes" is set to "ACS", the Teams external users via Azure Communication Services can't join Teams meeting.	| [CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy) |	BlockedAnonymousJoinClientTypes	|
|[Anonymous users can join a meeting](/microsoftteams/meeting-settings-in-teams#allow-anonymous-users-to-join-meetings) | per-organizer |  If disabled, Teams external users can't join Teams meetings.	|[CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy)|	AllowAnonymousUsersToJoinMeeting|
|[Let anonymous people start a meeting](/microsoftteams/meeting-settings-in-teams#allow-anonymous-users-to-join-meetings)| per-organizer |  Teams external users can start a Teams meeting without Teams user if enabled. |	[CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy)	|AllowAnonymousUsersToStartMeeting|
|Anonymous users can dial out to phone users | per-organizer |  If enabled, Teams external users can add phone participants to the meeting.|	[CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy)	|AllowAnonymousUsersToDialOut|
|[Automatically admit people](/microsoftteams/meeting-policies-participants-and-guests#automatically-admit-people)| per-organizer|  If set to "Everyone", Teams external users can bypass the lobby. Otherwise, Teams external users must wait in the lobby until an organizer, coorganizer, or presenter admits them.|	[CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy)	|AutoAdmittedUsers|

## Sensitivity label
[Sensitivity labels allow Teams admins](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-meetings) to protect and regulate access to sensitive organizational content during Microsoft Teams meetings. Compliance administrators can create sensitivity labels in [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](/microsoft-365/compliance/go-to-the-securitycompliance-center) and assign them with policy to users or groups of users. These labels can then be assigned to Teams meeting via meeting templates or meeting options.
The sensitivity labels control subset of meeting options, adds new controls such as prevention of copy & paste in the chat, and might require justification for a change of the sensitivity label of the meeting. 
- Required role: Compliance or global administrator to manage sensitivity labels and policy. Teams or global administrators to manage meeting templates. Meeting organizer to manage meeting options.
- Licensing: Microsoft Purview
- Tools: Microsoft Purview compliance portal

Meeting options that can be controlled via sensitivity label:
-	Who can bypass the lobby
-	Who can present
-	Who can record
-	Encryption for meeting video and audio
-	Automatically record
-	Video watermark for screen sharing and camera streams
-	Prevent copying of meeting chat
-	Prevent or allow copying of chat contents to the clipboard

## Meeting templates
Teams administrators can use meeting templates to control meeting settings that the meeting organizer usually controls. With templates, Teams administrators can create consistent meeting experiences in your organization and help enforce compliance requirements and business rules. Meeting templates can be used to enforce settings or to set default values. The administrator can lock the individual template option so the meeting organizer can't change it, or it can be left unlocked for the meeting organizer to change it if needed.
- Required role: Teams or global administrator to manage meeting templates. Meeting organizer to select meeting template for the meeting.
- Licensing: Microsoft Premium
- Tools: Teams Admin Center

## Meeting roles
[Teams meeting roles](https://support.microsoft.com/office/roles-in-a-teams-meeting-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019) define permissions that Teams meeting participants have. Microsoft Teams provides roles: organizer, coorganizer, presenter, and attendee. The meeting organizer can assign default roles to the participants. Coorganizers and presenters share most organizer permissions, while attendees are more controlled. There can be only one meeting organizer.
- Required role: Organizer, coorganizer, and presenter can change the roles of individual participants. Each user knows their role.
- Licensing: standard licensing
- Tools: Microsoft Teams and Graph API (only default roles)

List of permissions per role can be found [here](https://support.microsoft.com/office/roles-in-a-teams-meeting-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019) and more details about [coorganizer](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-co-organizers-to-a-meeting-in-teams-0de2c31c-8207-47ff-ae2a-fc1792d466e2).

## Meeting options
[Meeting options](https://support.microsoft.com/office/participant-settings-for-a-teams-meeting-53261366-dbd5-45f9-aae9-a70e6354f88e) allow meeting organizer and coorganizers to customize the meeting experience before and during the meeting. Default values, editability, and visibility of individual features depend on the tenant configuration, policies, sensitivity label, and meeting template.
- Required role: Organizer or coorganizer can change available meeting options. 
- Licensing: standard licensing
- Tools: Microsoft Teams and Graph API (only before the meeting starts)
