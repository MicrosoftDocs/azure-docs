> [!NOTE]
> When Teams external users leave the meeting, or the meeting ends, they can no longer exchange new chat messages. They also can't access messages sent and received during the meeting.

1. Communication Services users can join a channel Teams meeting with audio and video, but they won't be able to send or receive any chat messages.
1. Communication Services provides developer tools to integrate Teams DLP compatible with Teams. For more information, see [Implement data loss prevention](../../../how-tos/chat-sdk/data-loss-prevention.md).
1. This feature isn't available in mobile browsers.
1. The Communication Services Calling SDK doesn't receive a signal that a user is admitted and waiting for the meeting to start. The UI library doesn't support chat while waiting for the meeting to start.
1. The Communication Services Chat SDK shows the real identity of attendees.
1. Functionality isn't available for users who aren't part of the organization.
1. If you're using Microsoft 365 work and school accounts, then use Teams for Work. If you schedule a meeting with this identity, the meeting's URL ends with `teams.microsoft.com`. If you're using personal account, then use Teams for Home. If you schedule a meeting with this identity, the meeting's URL ends with `teams.live.com`. Learn more about those accounts in our [documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/what-s-the-difference-between-a-microsoft-account-and-a-work-or-school-account-72f10e1e-cab8-4950-a8da-7c45339575b0).
