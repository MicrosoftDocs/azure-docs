# Microsoft Teams shared line appearance

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Notice](../../../includes/public-preview-include.md)]
Microsoft Teams shared line appearance lets a user choose a delegate to answer or handle calls on their behalf. This feature is helpful if a user has an administrative assistant who regularly handles the user's calls. In the context of Teams shared line appearance, a manager is someone who authorizes a delegate to make or receive calls on their behalf. A delegate can make or receive calls on behalf of the delegator.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. See [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). 
- A deployed Communication Services resource. See [Create a Communication Services resource](../../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md).
- A user access token to enable the calling client. For more information, see [Create and manage access tokens](../../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md).
- Licensing requirements for delegator and delegates. See [Teams Phone license](/microsoftteams/shared-line-appearance#license-required).
- Enable delegation and shared line appearance. See [Enable delegation](/microsoftteams/shared-line-appearance#enable-delegation-and-shared-line-appearance)
- Assign delegates using [Microsoft Teams Client](https://support.microsoft.com/office/share-a-phone-line-with-a-delegate-in-microsoft-teams-16307929-a51f-43fc-8323-3b1bf115e5a8) or [Teams PowerShell](/microsoftteams/shared-line-appearance#use-powershell).
- Optional: Complete the quickstart to add voice calling to Microsoft Teams user. See [Quickstart: Add voice calling to Microsoft Teams user](../../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-call-to-teams-user.md).

## Use Cases

**Business Enterprises**: Team leads can delegate their call responsibilities during meetings or vacations to their assistants or colleagues, ensuring uninterrupted communication with stakeholders.

**Contact Centers:** Supervisors can allocate their call flows to other available agents during breaks, making certain that no client query goes unanswered.

**Healthcare:** Doctors or nurses can delegate their call flows to peers or assistants during surgeries or when attending critical cases, ensuring patient queries are addressed promptly.

## Platform capabilities
The following Azure Communication Services and Graph platforms currently support shared line appearance:
