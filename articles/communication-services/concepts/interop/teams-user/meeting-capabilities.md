1. The Share Screen capability can be achieved using Raw Media, if you want to learn, **how  to add Raw Media**, visit [the quickstart guide](../../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-raw-media-access.md).
2. The Calling SDK doesn't have an explicit API, you need to use the OS (android & iOS) API to achieve it.
