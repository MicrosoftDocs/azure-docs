# Single-tenant and multitenant authentication for Microsoft 365 users

 This article gives you insight into the authentication process for single-tenant and multitenant, *Microsoft Entra ID* (Microsoft Entra ID) applications. You can use authentication when you build calling experiences for Microsoft 365 users with the *Calling software development kit* (SDK) that *Azure Communication Services* makes available. Use cases in this article also break down individual authentication artifacts.

## Case 1: Example of a single-tenant application
The Fabrikam company has built an application for internal use. All users of the application have Microsoft Entra ID. Access to Azure Communication Services is controlled by *Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)*.

The following sequence diagram details single-tenant authentication.

The client application gets an Azure Communication Services access token for a single tenant Microsoft Entra application." lightbox="./media/custom-teams-endpoint/authentication-case-single-tenant-azure-rbac.svg":::

Before we begin:
- Alice or her Microsoft Entra administrator needs to give the custom Teams application consent, prior to the first attempt to sign in. Learn more about [consent](../../../active-directory/develop/consent-framework.md).
- The Azure Communication Services resource admin needs to grant Alice permission to perform her role. Learn more about [Azure RBAC role assignment](../../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.yml).

Steps:
1. Authenticate Alice using Microsoft Entra ID: Alice is authenticated using a standard OAuth flow with *Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)*. If authentication is successful, the client application receives a Microsoft Entra access token, with a value of `A1` and an Object ID of a Microsoft Entra user with a value of `A2`. Tokens are outlined later in this article. Authentication from the developer perspective is explored in this [quickstart](../../quickstarts/manage-teams-identity.md).
1. Get an access token for Alice: The Fabrikam application by using a custom authentication artifact with value `B` performs authorization logic to decide whether Alice has permission to exchange the Microsoft Entra access token for an Azure Communication Services access token. After successful authorization, the Fabrikam application performs control plane logic, using artifacts `A1`, `A2`, and `A3`. Azure Communication Services access token `D` is generated for Alice within the Fabrikam application. This access token can be used for data plane actions in Azure Communication Services, like Calling. The `A2` and `A3` artifacts are passed along with the artifact `A1` for validation. The validation assures that the Microsoft Entra Token was issued to the expected user. The application prevents attackers from using the Microsoft Entra access tokens issued to other applications or other users. For more information on how to get `A` artifacts, see [Receive the Microsoft Entra user token and object ID via the MSAL library](../../quickstarts/manage-teams-identity.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp#step-1-receive-the-azure-ad-user-token-and-object-id-via-the-msal-library) and [Get an Application ID](../troubleshooting-info.md#get-an-application-id).
1. Call Bob: Alice makes a call to Microsoft 365 user Bob, with Fabrikam's app. The call takes place via the Calling SDK with an Azure Communication Services access token. Learn more about [developing application for Microsoft 365 users](../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-with-voice-video-calling-custom-teams-client.md).

  - Type: Microsoft Entra access token
  - Audience: _`Azure Communication Services`_, control plane
  - Source: Fabrikam's Microsoft Entra tenant
  - Permissions: _`https://auth.msft.communication.azure.com/Teams.ManageCalls`_, _`https://auth.msft.communication.azure.com/Teams.ManageChats`_

  - Type: Custom Fabrikam authorization artifact (issued either by Microsoft Entra ID or a different authorization service)
- Artifact `C`
  - Type: Azure Communication Services resource authorization artifact. 
  - Source: "Authorization" HTTP header with either a bearer token for [Microsoft Entra authentication](../authentication.md#azure-ad-authentication) or a Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) payload and a signature for [access key-based authentication](../authentication.md#access-key).

  - Type: Azure Communication Services access token
  - Audience: _`Azure Communication Services`_, data plane
  - Azure Communication Services Resource ID: Fabrikam's _`Azure Communication Services Resource ID`_
  
## Case 2: Example of a multitenant application
The Contoso company has built an application for external customers. This application uses custom authentication within Contoso's own infrastructure. Contoso uses a connection string to retrieve tokens from Fabrikam's application.

![A sequence diagram that demonstrates how the Contoso application authenticates Fabrikam users with Contoso's own Azure Communication Services resource.](./media/custom-teams-endpoint/authentication-case-multiple-tenants-hmac-overview.svg)

The following sequence diagram details multitenant authentication.

Before we begin:
- Alice or her Microsoft Entra administrator needs to give Contoso's Microsoft Entra application consent before the first attempt to sign in. Learn more about [consent](/entra/identity-platform/application-consent-experience).

Steps:
1. Authenticate Alice using the Fabrikam application: Alice is authenticated through Fabrikam's application. A standard OAuth flow with Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) is used. Make sure you configure MSAL with a correct [authority](/entra/identity-platform/msal-client-application-configuration#authority). If authentication is successful, the Contoso client application receives a Microsoft Entra access token with a value of `A1` and an Object ID of a Microsoft Entra user with a value of `A2`. Token details are outlined below. Authentication from the developer perspective is explored in this [quickstart](../../quickstarts/manage-teams-identity.md). 
1. Get an access token for Alice: The Contoso application by using a custom authentication artifact with value `B` performs authorization logic to decide whether Alice has permission to exchange the Microsoft Entra access token for an Azure Communication Services access token. After successful authorization, the Contoso application performs control plane logic, using artifacts `A1`, `A2`, and `A3`. An Azure Communication Services access token `D` is generated for Alice within the Contoso application. This access token can be used for data plane actions in Azure Communication Services, like Calling. The `A2` and `A3` artifacts are passed along with the artifact `A1`. The validation assures that the Microsoft Entra Token was issued to the expected user. The application prevents attackers from using the Microsoft Entra access tokens issued to other applications or other users. For more information on how to get `A` artifacts, see [Receive the Microsoft Entra user token and object ID via the MSAL library](../../quickstarts/manage-teams-identity.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp#step-1-receive-the-azure-ad-user-token-and-object-id-via-the-msal-library) and [Get an Application ID](../troubleshooting-info.md#get-an-application-id).
1. Call Bob: Alice makes a call to Microsoft 365 user Bob, with Fabrikam's application. The call takes place via the Calling SDK with an Azure Communication Services access token.
