# Microsoft Teams Phone capabilities in Calling and Call Automation SDKs
    
This article describes which Microsoft Teams Phone capabilities Azure Communication Services Calling and Call Automation SDKs support for Teams Phone extensibility.

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-notice.md](../../../includes/public-preview-include-document.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Teams users must have a Teams Phone license.
- Teams users must be Enterprise Voice enabled.
- Agents in Azure Communication Services applications support the capabilities in the following table. Teams users aren't supported.

## Teams Phone capabilities

The following list of capabilities is supported for scenarios where at least one phone number participates in 1:1 or group calls:
