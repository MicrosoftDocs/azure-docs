# Calling capabilities supported for Teams users in Calling SDK

The Azure Communication Services Calling SDK enables Teams user devices to drive voice and video communication experiences. This page provides detailed descriptions of Calling features, including platform and browser support information. To get started right away with JavaScript, check out [Calling quickstarts](../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-with-voice-video-calling-custom-teams-client.md). 

Key features of the Calling SDK:

- **Addressing** - Azure Communication Services is using [Microsoft Entra user identifier](/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.users/get-mguser) to address communication endpoints. Clients use Microsoft Entra identities to authenticate to the service and communicate with each other. These identities are used in Calling APIs that provide clients visibility into who is connected to a call (the roster). And are also used in [Microsoft Graph API](/graph/api/user-get).
- **Encryption** - The Calling SDK encrypts traffic and prevents tampering on the wire. 
- **Device Management and Media** - The Calling SDK provides facilities for binding to audio and video devices, encodes content for efficient transmission over the communications data plane, and renders content to output devices and views that you specify. APIs are also provided for screen and application sharing.
- **Notifications** - The Calling SDK provides APIs that allow clients to be notified of an incoming call. In situations where your app is not running in the foreground, patterns are available to [fire pop-up notifications](../notifications.md) ("toasts") to inform users of an incoming call. 

## Calling capabilities 

The following list presents the set of features that are currently available in the Azure Communication Services Calling SDK when participating in 1:1 voice-over-IP (VoIP) or group VoIP calls.

1. The Share Screen capability can be achieved using Raw Media, if you want to learn, **how  to add Raw Media**, visit [the quickstart guide](../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-raw-media-access.md).
2. The Calling SDK doesn't have an explicit API, you need to use the OS (android & iOS) API to achieve it.

Support for streaming, timeouts, platforms, and browsers is shared with [Communication Services calling SDK overview](../voice-video-calling/calling-sdk-features.md).
