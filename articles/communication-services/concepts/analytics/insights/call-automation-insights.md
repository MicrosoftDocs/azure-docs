# Call Automation Insights

In this document, we outline the available insights dashboard to monitor Call Automation logs and metrics.

## Overview
Within your Communications Resource, we've provided an **Insights Preview** feature that displays many  data visualizations conveying insights from the Azure Monitor logs and metrics monitored for your Communications Services. The visualizations within Insights are made possible via [Azure Monitor Workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview). In order to take advantage of Workbooks, follow the instructions outlined in [Enable Azure Monitor in Diagnostic Settings](../enable-logging.md). To enable Workbooks, you need to send your logs to a [Log Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview) destination.

## Call Automation Insights

The **Call Automation** tab displays data about calls placed or answered using Call Automation SDK, like active call count, operations executed and errors encountered by your resource over time. You can also examine a particular call by looking at the sequence of operations taken on that call using the SDK:

Editing these dashboards doesn't modify the **Insights** tab, but rather creates a separate workbook that can be accessed on your resourceâ€™s Workbooks tab:
