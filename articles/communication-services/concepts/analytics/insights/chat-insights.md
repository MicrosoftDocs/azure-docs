# Chat insights

This article describes the insights dashboard you can view to monitor Chat logs and metrics.

Within your Communications Resource, we provide an **Insights Preview** feature that displays many data visualizations conveying insights from the Azure Monitor logs and metrics monitored for your Communications Services.

The visualizations within Insights are made possible via [Azure Monitor Workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview). In order to take advantage of Workbooks, follow the instructions outlined in [Enable Azure Monitor in Diagnostic Settings](../enable-logging.md). To enable Workbooks, you need to send your logs to a [Log Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview) destination.
