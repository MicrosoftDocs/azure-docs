# Chat Insights

In this document, we outline the available insights dashboard to monitor Chat logs and metrics.

## Overview
Within your Communications Resource, we've provided an **Insights Preview** feature that displays many  data visualizations conveying insights from the Azure Monitor logs and metrics monitored for your Communications Services. The visualizations within Insights are made possible via [Azure Monitor Workbooks](../../../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md). In order to take advantage of Workbooks, follow the instructions outlined in [Enable Azure Monitor in Diagnostic Settings](../enable-logging.md). To enable Workbooks, you need to send your logs to a [Log Analytics workspace](../../../../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview.md) destination.

Editing these dashboards doesn't modify the **Insights** tab, but rather creates a separate workbook that can be accessed on your resource’s Workbooks tab:
