# Azure Communication Services Closed Captions logs

Azure Communication Services offers logging capabilities that you can use to monitor and debug your Communication Services solution. You configure these capabilities through the Azure portal.

The content in this article refers to logs enabled through [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview) (see also [FAQ](/azure/azure-monitor/overview#frequently-asked-questions)). To enable these logs for Communication Services, see [Enable logging in diagnostic settings](../enable-logging.md).
