# Azure Communication Services Rooms Logs

Azure Communication Services offers logging capabilities that you can use to monitor and debug your Communication Services solution. These capabilities can be configured through the Azure portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following refers to logs enabled through [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview) (see also [FAQ](/azure/azure-monitor/overview#frequently-asked-questions)). To enable these logs for your Communications Services, see: [Enable logging in Diagnostic Settings](../enable-logging.md)

## Pre-requisites

Azure Communications Services provides monitoring and analytics features via [Azure Monitor Logs overview](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-platform-logs) and [Azure Monitor Metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics). Each Azure resource requires its own diagnostic setting, which defines the following criteria:
  * Categories of logs and metric data sent to the destinations defined in the setting. The available categories will vary for different resource types.
  * One or more destinations to send the logs. Current destinations include Log Analytics workspace, Event Hubs, and Azure Storage.
  * A single diagnostic setting can define no more than one of each of the destinations. If you want to send data to more than one of a particular destination type (for example, two different Log Analytics workspaces), then create multiple settings. Each resource can have up to five diagnostic settings.

The following are instructions for configuring your Azure Monitor resource to start creating logs and metrics for your Communications Services. For detailed documentation about using Diagnostic Settings across all Azure resources, see: [Enable logging in Diagnostic Settings](../enable-logging.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Under diagnostic setting name please select "Operational Rooms Logs" to enable the logs for Rooms.
