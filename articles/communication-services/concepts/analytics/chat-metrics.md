# Chat metrics overview

Azure Communication Services currently provides metrics for all Communication Services primitives. You can use [Azure Metrics Explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started) to:

- Plot your own charts.
- Investigate abnormalities in your metric values.
- Understand your API traffic by using the metrics data that Chat requests emit.

## Where to find metrics

Primitives in Communication Services emit metrics for API requests. To find these metrics, see the **Metrics** tab under your Communication Services resource. You can also create permanent dashboards by using the workbooks tab under your Communication Services resource.

## Metric definitions

All API request metrics contain three dimensions that you can use to filter your metrics data. These dimensions can be aggregated together by using the `Count` aggregation type. They support all standard Azure Aggregation time series, including `Sum`, `Average`, `Min`, and `Max`.

For more information on supported aggregation types and time series aggregations, see [Advanced features of Azure Metrics Explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-charts#aggregation).

- **Operation**: All operations or routes that can be called on the Communication Services Chat gateway.
- **Status Code**: The status code response sent after the request.
- **StatusSubClass**: The status code series sent after the response.

### Chat API request metric operations

The following operations are available on Chat API request metrics.

| Operation/Route    | Description                                                                                    |

| GetChatMessage       | Gets a message by message ID. |
| ListChatMessages     | Gets a list of chat messages from a thread. |
| SendChatMessage      | Sends a chat message to a thread. |
| UpdateChatMessage    | Updates a chat message. |
| DeleteChatMessage    | Deletes a chat message. |
| GetChatThread        | Gets a chat thread. |
| ListChatThreads      | Gets the list of chat threads of a user. |

| GetReadReceipts      | Gets read receipts for a thread. |
| SendReadReceipt      | Sends a read receipt event to a thread for a user. |
| SendTypingIndicator           | Posts a typing event to a thread for a user. |

If a request is made to an operation that isn't recognized, you receive a "Bad Route" value response.
