# Understand identifiers

Communication Services SDKs and REST APIs use the *identifier* type to identify who is communicating with whom. For example, identifiers specify who to call, or who sent a chat message.

Depending on context, identifiers get wrapped with extra properties, like inside the `ChatParticipant` in the Chat SDK or inside the `RemoteParticipant` in the Calling SDK.

This article describes different types of identifiers and how they look across programming languages. You also get tips on how to use them.


## The `CommunicationIdentifier` type

There are user identities that you create yourself and there are external identities. Microsoft Teams users and phone numbers are external identities that come to play in interop scenarios. Each of these different identity types has a corresponding identifier that represents it. An identifier is a structured type that offers type-safety and works well with your editor's code completion.
