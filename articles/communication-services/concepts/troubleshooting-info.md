# Troubleshooting in Azure Communication Services
<a name="calling-sdk-error-codes"></a>

This article helps you troubleshoot issues that you might experience within your Azure Communication Services solution. If you're troubleshooting SMS, you can [enable delivery reporting with Azure Event Grid](../quickstarts/sms/handle-sms-events.md) to capture SMS delivery details.

## Check Azure Communication Services health status

You can view the health of your Azure Communication Services solution on the [Azure Service Health portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Health/AzureHealthBrowseBlade/%7E/serviceIssues). If you experience problems with your Azure Communication Services solution, check the Service Health portal first. Then you can determine whether there's a known issue with a resolution in progress before calling support or spending time troubleshooting.

[Azure Service Health portal](/azure/service-health/service-health-overview) provides a personalized view of the health of the Azure services and regions you're using. The Service Health portal is the best place to look for outages, planned maintenance activities, and other health advisories. Once you sign in, the authenticated Service Health experience knows which services and resources you currently use.

The best way to use Service Health is to set up [Service Health alerts](/azure/service-health/service-health-overview#configure-service-health-alerts) to notify you via your preferred communication channel. You receive notices for service issues, planned maintenance, or other changes that affect your Azure services and regions.

If you're unable to sign in to your Service Health Portal, you can use the public facing **[Azure Status page](https://azure.status.microsoft)** to check for known issues. [Azure status overview](/azure/service-health/azure-status-overview) provides a global view of Azure services and regions from **[Azure status](https://azure.status.microsoft)**.

The status page is a good reference for widespread incidents. We recommend that current Azure users view the authenticated Azure Service Health portal to stay informed about Azure incidents and maintenance. The authenticated Azure Service Health experience knows which services and resources you currently use.

When Azure Communication Services has an outage that impacts metrics used in the service level agreement (SLA), the service generates a notification in your Azure Service Health portal and the Azure Status. For more information on the Azure Communication Services SLA, see [Service Level Agreements](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/). 

Typically, an outage occurs when any Azure Communication Services API returns non-retriable errors for more than 3% of received API calls for a sustained period of time.

We recommend learning how to implement a disaster recovery plan and high availability strategy. For more information, see [Disaster recovery and high availability for Azure applications](/azure/well-architected/reliability/disaster-recovery).

## Get help

We encourage developers to submit questions, suggest features, and report problems as issues. For more information, see the [dedicated support and help options page](../support.md).

To help you troubleshoot certain issues, you might need one or more of the following pieces of information:

* **MS-CV ID**: Troubleshoot calls and messages.
* **Call ID**: Identify Azure Communication Services calls.
* **SMS message ID**: Identify SMS messages.
* **Short code program brief ID**: Identify a short code program brief application.
* **Toll-free verification campaign brief ID**: Identify a toll-free verification campaign brief application.
* **Email message ID**: Identify **Send Email** requests.
* **Correlation ID**: Identify correlated requests made by using Call Automation.
* **Call logs**: Use the detailed information to troubleshoot calling and network issues.

For more information about throttling and limitations, see [Service limits](service-limits.md).

## Access your MS-CV ID

You can access the MS-CV ID by configuring diagnostics in the `clientOptions` object instance when you initialize your SDKs. You can configure diagnostics for any Azure SDK, including Chat, Identity, and VoIP calling.

### Client options example

The following code snippets demonstrate diagnostics configuration. When you enable diagnostics for SDKs, diagnostics details are emitted to the configured event listener.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)
```
// 1. Import Azure.Core.Diagnostics
using Azure.Core.Diagnostics;

// 2. Initialize an event source listener instance
using var listener = AzureEventSourceListener.CreateConsoleLogger();
Uri endpoint = new Uri("https://<RESOURCE-NAME>.communication.azure.net");
var (token, communicationUser) = await GetCommunicationUserAndToken();
CommunicationUserCredential communicationUserCredential = new CommunicationUserCredential(token);

// 3. Setup diagnostic settings
var clientOptions = new ChatClientOptions()
{
    Diagnostics =
    {
        LoggedHeaderNames = { "*" },
        LoggedQueryParameters = { "*" },
        IsLoggingContentEnabled = true,
    }
};

// 4. Initialize the ChatClient instance with the clientOptions
ChatClient chatClient = new ChatClient(endpoint, communicationUserCredential, clientOptions);
ChatThreadClient chatThreadClient = await chatClient.CreateChatThreadAsync("Thread Topic", new[] { new ChatThreadMember(communicationUser) });
```

# [Python](#tab/python)
```
from azure.communication.chat import ChatClient, CommunicationUserCredential
endpoint = "https://communication-services-sdk-live-tests-for-python.communication.azure.com"
chat_client = ChatClient(
    endpoint,
    CommunicationUserCredential(token),
    http_logging_policy=your_logging_policy)
```

## Use access IDs for Call Automation

When you troubleshoot issues with the Call Automation SDK, such as call management or recording problems, you need to collect the IDs that help identify the failing call or operation. You can provide either of the following two IDs:

- From the header of the API response. Locate the field `X-Ms-Skype-Chain-Id`.
 
    ![Screenshot that shows the response header with the X-Ms-Skype-Chain-Id.](media/troubleshooting/response-header.png)

- From the callback events that your application receives after running an action. For example, use `CallConnected` or `PlayFailed` to locate the correlation ID.

    ![Screenshot that shows a call disconnected event with the correlation ID](media/troubleshooting/correlation-id-in-callback-event.png).

In addition to one of these IDs, you need to provide details about the failing use case and the time stamp when the failure occurred.

## Access your client call ID

When you troubleshoot voice or video calls, you might need to provide a `call ID`. Access this value via the `id` property of the `call` object. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A `call ID` is unique and identifies a specific call, the `call ID` is the same for all the participants of that call. The `call ID` initial value is set by the local client and later it may change after the local client connects to a call that is already ongoing. If the local client was first to initiate the call then the `call ID` it created will become the `call ID` that the server and other call participants will use going forward in the call. 

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)
```javascript
// `call` is an instance of a call created by `callAgent.startCall` or `callAgent.join` methods
console.log(call.id)
```

# [iOS](#tab/ios)
```objc
// The `call id` property can be retrieved by calling the `call.getCallId()` method on a call object after a call ends
// todo: the code snippet suggests it's a property while the comment suggests it's a method call
print(call.callId)
```

# [Android](#tab/android)
```java
// The `call id` property can be retrieved by calling the `call.getCallId()` method on a call object after a call ends
// `call` is an instance of a call created by `callAgent.startCall(‚Ä¶)` or `callAgent.join(‚Ä¶)` methods
Log.d(call.getCallId())
```

## Access your SMS message ID

For SMS issues, you can collect the message ID from the response object.

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)
```
// Instantiate the SMS client
const smsClient = new SmsClient(connectionString);
async function main() {
  const result = await smsClient.send({
    from: "+18445792722",
    to: ["+1972xxxxxxx"],
    message: "Hello World üëãüèª via Sms"
  }, {
    enableDeliveryReport: true // Optional parameter
  });
console.log(result); // your message ID is in the result
}
```

## Access your short code program brief ID

Find the program brief ID in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) in the **Short Codes** section.

## Access your toll-free verification campaign brief ID

Find the program brief ID in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) in the **Regulatory Documents** section.

:::image type="content" source="./media/toll-free-troubleshooting.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a toll-free verification campaign brief ID.":::

## Access your email operation ID

When you troubleshoot email send status or email message status requests, you might need to provide an operation ID. You can access this value in the response.

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)
```csharp
var emailSendOperation = await emailClient.SendAsync(
    wait: WaitUntil.Completed,
    senderAddress: sender,
    recipientAddress: recipient,
    subject: subject,
    htmlContent: htmlContent);

/// Get the OperationId so that it can be used for tracking the message for troubleshooting
Console.WriteLine($"Email operation id = {emailSendOperation.Id}");
```

## Access support files in the Calling SDK

The Calling SDK provides convenient methods to access the log files. These files can help Microsoft support specialists and engineers. We recommend that you collect these logs when you detect an issue.

## Enable and access call logs

Learn how to enable and access call logs.

### JavaScript

To control logging, the Calling SDK relies internally on the [@azure/logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/logger) library.

To configure the log output level, use the `setLogLevel` method from the `@azure/logger` package. Create a logger and pass it into the `CallClient` constructor.

```javascript
import { setLogLevel, createClientLogger, AzureLogger } from '@azure/logger';
setLogLevel('verbose');
let logger = createClientLogger('ACS');
const callClient = new CallClient({ logger });
```

You can use `AzureLogger` to redirect the logging output from Azure SDKs by overriding the `AzureLogger.log` method.

You can log to the browser console, a file, or a buffer. You can also send to your own service. If you're going to send logs over the network to your own service, don't send a request per log line because this method adversely affects browser performance. Instead, accumulate logs lines and send them in batches.

```javascript
// Redirect log output
AzureLogger.log = (...args) => {
    // To console, file, buffer, REST API, etc...
    console.log(...args); 
};
```

### Native SDK (Android/iOS)

For Android, iOS, and Windows, the Azure Communication Services Calling SDK offers access to log files.

For Calling Native SDKs, see the [Log file access tutorial](../tutorials/log-file-retrieval-tutorial.md).

### UI Libraries (Android, iOS)

If you use the Azure Communication Services UI Libraries for Android or iOS, you can solicit user feedback through the built-in support form.

For more information about the support functions of the Calling UI support form, see the [Support form integration tutorial](../tutorials/collecting-user-feedback/collecting-user-feedback.md). This article shows you how to add the necessary event handler and create a basic client/server implementation for centralized storage of support information. This article describes the path for integrating with the support services that your organization uses.

## Build end-to-end support flows in your ACS integrations

Whether you use the Calling SDK or the Calling UI SDK, providing support to your customers is a key component of any robust integration.

The article [Providing user support](../concepts/voice-video-calling/retrieve-support-files.md) highlights the key considerations at each point of the support feedback loop and provides jumping-off points to learn more.

## Verify Teams license eligibility to use Azure Communication Services support for Teams users

There are two ways to verify your Teams license eligibility to use Azure Communication Services support for Teams users.

#### Verify via Teams web client

To verify your Teams license eligibility via Teams web client, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser and go to [Teams web client](https://teams.microsoft.com/).
1. Sign in with credentials that have a valid Teams license.
1. If the authentication is successful and you remain in the `https://teams.microsoft.com/` domain, your Teams license is eligible. If authentication fails or you're redirected to the `https://teams.live.com/v2/` domain, your Teams license isn't eligible to use Azure Communication Services support for Teams users.

#### Check your current Teams license via the Microsoft Graph API

You can find your current Teams license by using [licenseDetails](/graph/api/resources/licensedetails). The Microsoft Graph API returns the licenses assigned to a user. Follow these steps to use the Graph Explorer tool to view licenses assigned to a user.

1. Open your browser and go to [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer).
1. Sign in to Graph Explorer by using credentials.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/troubleshooting/graph-explorer-sign-in.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to sign in to Graph Explorer.":::
1. In the query box, enter the following API and select **Run Query**.

    <!-- { "blockType": "request" } -->
    ```http
    https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/licenseDetails
    ```

    :::image type="content" source="./media/troubleshooting/graph-explorer-query-box.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to enter an API in Graph Explorer.":::

    Or you can query for a particular user by providing the user ID by using the following API:

    <!-- { "blockType": "request" } -->
    ```http
    https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{id}/licenseDetails
    ```

1. The **Response preview** pane shows output.

    The response object shown here might be shortened for readability.
    <!-- {
    "blockType": "response",
    "truncated": true,
    "isCollection": true
    } -->
    ```http
    {
        "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users('071cc716-8147-4397-a5ba-b2105951cc0b')/assignedLicenses",
        "value": [
            {
                "skuId": "b05e124f-c7cc-45a0-a6aa-8cf78c946968",
                "servicePlans":[

                        "servicePlanId":"57ff2da0-773e-42df-b2af-ffb7a2317929",
                        "servicePlanName":"TEAMS1",
                        "provisioningStatus":"Success",
                        "appliesTo":"User"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

1. Find license details where the `servicePlanName` property has one of the values in the [Eligible Teams Licenses table](../quickstarts/eligible-teams-licenses.md).
