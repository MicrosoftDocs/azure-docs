# Job classification

When you submit a job to Job Router, you can either specify the queue, priority, and worker selectors manually or you can specify a classification policy to drive these values.

If you choose to use a classification policy, you receive a [JobClassified Event][job_classified_event] or a [JobClassificationFailed Event][job_classify_failed_event] with the result.  Once the job has been successfully classified, it's automatically queued.  If the classification process fails, you need to intervene to fix it.

The process of classifying a Job involves optionally setting the following properties:

- Priority
- Worker Selectors
- Queue ID

## Fallback queue

The fallback queue is used when queue selectors, resulting from queue selector attachments, are unable to select a queue _and_ the job does not have a `queueId`. In this case, if the fallback queue is defined, the job is assigned to it.

## Prioritization rule

The priority of a Job can be resolved during classification using one of many rule engines.

For more information, see the [Rule concepts](router-rule-concepts.md) page.

## Worker selectors

Each job carries a collection of worker selectors that's evaluated against the worker labels. These conditions need to be true of a worker to be a match.
You can use the classification policy to attach these conditions to a job; you can do it by specifying one or more selector attachments.

For more information, see, the section: [using label selector attachments](#using-label-selector-attachments).

## Queue selectors

You can also specify a collection of label selector attachments to select the Queue based on its labels.

For more information, see, the section: [using label selector attachments](#using-label-selector-attachments).

## Using label selector attachments

The following label selector attachments are available:

**Static label selector -** Always attaches the given `LabelSelector` to the Job.

**Conditional label selector -** Evaluates a condition defined by a [rule](router-rule-concepts.md).  If it resolves to `true`, then the specified collection of selectors are attached to the Job.

**Passthrough label selector -** Attaches a selector to the Job with the specified key and operator but gets the value from the Job label of the same key.

**Rule label selector -** Sources a collection of selectors from one of many rule engines. Read the [RouterRule concepts](router-rule-concepts.md) page, for more information.

**Weighted allocation label selector -** Enables you to specify a percentage-based weighting and a collection of selectors to attach based on the weighting allocation. For example, you may want 30% of the Jobs to go to "Vendor 1" and 70% of Jobs to go to "Vendor 2".

## Reclassifying a job

Once a Job has been classified, it can be reclassified in the following ways:

1. You can update the Job labels, which cause the Job Router to evaluate the new labels with the previous Classification Policy.
2. You can update the Classification Policy ID of a Job, which causes Job Router to process the existing Job against the new policy.
3. An Exception Policy **trigger** can take the **action** of requesting a Job be reclassified.
4. You can Reclassify the job, which causes the Job Router to re-evaluate the current labels and Classification Policy.
