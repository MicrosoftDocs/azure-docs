# Job Router metrics overview

## Where to find metrics

Primitives in Azure Communication Services emit metrics for API requests. These metrics can be found in the Metrics tab under your Azure Communication Services resource. You can also create permanent dashboards using the workbooks tab under your Azure Communication Services resource.

## Metric definitions

All API request metrics contain four dimensions that you can use to filter your metrics data. These dimensions can be aggregated together using the `Count` aggregation.

More information on supported aggregation types and time series aggregations can be found [Advanced features of Azure Metrics Explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-charts#aggregation).

- **Operation** - All operations or routes that can be called on the Azure Communication Services gateway.

- **API Version** â€“ The version of the API used in the API request.

- **Status Code** - The status code response sent after the request.

- **StatusSubClass** - The status code series sent after the response.
