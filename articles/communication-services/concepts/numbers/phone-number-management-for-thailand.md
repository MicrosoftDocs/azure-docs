## Subscription eligibility

To acquire a phone number, you need to be on a paid Azure subscription. Phone numbers can't be acquired by Azure free credits. Also, due to regulatory reasons phone number availability is dependent on your Azure subscription billing location.

More details on eligible subscription types are as follows:

| Number Type                      | Eligible Azure Agreement Type                                                                             |
| :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Toll-Free and Local (Geographic/National) | Modern Customer Agreement (Field and Customer Led), Modern Partner Agreement (CSP), Enterprise Agreement, Pay-As-You-Go |

\** Applications from all other subscription types are reviewed and approved on a case-by-case basis. Reach out to acstns@microsoft.com for assistance with your application.
