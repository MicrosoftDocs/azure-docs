# Generating real-time transcripts
[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Disclaimer](../../includes/public-preview-include-document.md)]

Real-time transcriptions are a crucial component in any major business for driving improved customer service experience. Powered by Azure Communication Services and Azure AI Services integration, developers can now use real-time transcriptions through Call Automation SDKs. 

Using the Azure Communication Services real-time transcription, you can easily integrate your Azure AI Services resource with Azure Communication Services to generate transcripts directly during the call. This eliminates the need for developers to extract audio content and deal with the overhead of converting audio into text on your side. You can store the contents of this transcript to use later on for creating a history of the call, summarizing the call to save an agent's time, and even feeding it into your training/learning modules to help improve your contact center agents' customer interactions.

Out of the box Microsoft utilizes a Universal Language Model as a base model that is trained with Microsoft-owned data and reflects commonly used spoken language. This model is pretrained with dialects and phonetics representing various common domains. For more information about supported languages, see [Languages and voice support for the Speech service](/azure/ai-services/speech-service/language-support).

## Common use cases

### Improved customer experience
Assist agents better understand customer needs and respond more quickly and accurately, leading to a better overall customer experience.

### Increased efficiency 
Help agents focus on the conversation rather than note-taking, allowing them to handle more calls and improve productivity

### Context for agents
Provide context to an agent before the agent picks up the call, this way the agent knows the information that the caller has provided avoiding any need for the caller to repeat their issue.

### Derive insights
Using the transcript generated throughout the call, you can leverage other AI tools to gain live, real-time insights that will help agents and supervisors improve their interactions with customers.
