# Advanced Messaging metrics overview

Azure Communication Services currently provides metrics for all Communication Services primitives. You can use [Azure Monitor metrics explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics) to:

- Plot your own charts.
- Investigate abnormalities in your metric values.
- Understand your API traffic by using the metrics data that Advanced Messaging requests emit.

## Where to find metrics

Primitives in Communication Services emit metrics for API requests. To find these metrics, see the **Metrics** tab under your Communication Services resource. You can also create permanent dashboards by using the workbooks tab under your Communication Services resource.

## Metric definitions

All API request metrics contain three dimensions that you can use to filter your metrics data. These dimensions can be aggregated together by using the `Count` aggregation type. They support all standard Azure Aggregation time series, including `Sum`, `Average`, `Min`, and `Max`.

For more information on supported aggregation types and time series aggregations, see [Azure Monitor Metrics aggregation and display explained](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-aggregation-explained).

- **Operation**: All operations or routes that can be called on the Azure Communication Services Advanced Messaging gateway.
- **Status Code**: The status code response sent after the request.
- **StatusSubClass**: The status code series sent after the response.

For the complete list of all metrics emitted by Azure Communication Services, see [Metrics overview](./../metrics.md) or the reference documentation [Supported metrics for Microsoft.Communication/CommunicationServices](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-communication-communicationservices-metrics).
