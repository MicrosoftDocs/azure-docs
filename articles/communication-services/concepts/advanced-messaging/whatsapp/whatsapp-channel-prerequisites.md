> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=0a095ceb-4138-4a56-930c-444f7984e676]

## Prerequisites

- [Facebook account](https://www.facebook.com/)
- [Active Meta Business account](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-business-suite)
- An Azure account with an active subscription where you have the role of an owner. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/).

## Create an Azure Communication Services resource in Azure portal

Follow the instructions in [Create an Azure Communication Services resource using Azure portal](../../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md) section.

When following those instructions, here are helpful tips:

- Use the following image as an example of how you can fill in your project details and instance details to create your resource.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/create-acs-resource.png" lightbox="./media/create-acs-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows populated fields to create an Azure Communication Services Resource in the Azure portal.":::

- Assigning tags to your resource is optional.
- Once your resource is deployed, continue with the below instructions.

## Get a phone number

You can [provision a SMS enabled phone number from Azure Communication Services](../../../quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number.md)
or bring your own phone number.

Make sure the phone number has the following capabilities:
- Able to receive SMS so your phone number can be verified by Meta
- Phone number isn't already associated with a WhatsApp Business Account

If you're using an Azure Communication Services phone number, continue to follow the [subsequential steps](#setup-and-deploy-event-grid-viewer). 

If you're bringing your own phone number, jump to next [section](#connect-whatsapp-business-account-as-a-channel-in-azure-communication-services-resource). 

### Setup and Deploy Event Grid Viewer

The following steps are only needed if you chose to use an Azure Communication Services phone number with SMS enabled. The Event Grid Viewer displays notification information for events it's subscribed to.

1. Click on the following button to launch a custom template for the Azure portal instance that you're logged into to set up the Event Grid Viewer.

    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure-Samples%2Fazure-event-grid-viewer%2Fmain%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazure.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Button to deploy Event Grid Viewer"/></a>
    
2. Fill in the required fields. Because the site name creates a DNS entry, it needs to be globally unique. We recommend that you include your alias in the name for this step. Here are suggestions for filling out the deployment details:
    - `Subscription` - Select the subscription that contains your Azure Communication Services resource.
    - `Resource Group` - Select the resource group that contains your Azure Communication Services resource.
    - `Region` - Select the resource group that contains your Azure Communication Services resource.
    - `Site Name` - Create a name that is globally unique. This site name is used to create a domain to connect to your Event Grid Viewer.
    - `Hosting Plan Name` - Create any name to identify your hosting plan.
    - `Sku` - Use the SKU F1 for development and testing purposes. If you encounter validation errors creating your Event Grid Viewer that say there's no more capacity for the F1 plan, try selecting a different region. For more information about SKUs, see [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/windows/).

3. Then select **Review + Create**.
4. After the deployment completes, select **Go to resource group**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/event-grid-viewer-deployment.png" lightbox="./media/event-grid-viewer-deployment.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows deployment complete of the Event Grid Viewer web app.":::

    :::image type="content" source="./media/event-grid-viewer-web-app.png" lightbox="./media/event-grid-viewer-web-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows URL of Event Grid Viewer web app.":::

7. Launch that site in your browser and keep it running so you can receive the verification code when you're [connecting your WhatsApp business account to Azure Communication Services resource](#connect-whatsapp-business-account-as-a-channel-in-azure-communication-services-resource). The Event Grid Viewer should look like this.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/event-grid-viewer-site.png" lightbox="./media/event-grid-viewer-site.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Event Grid Viewer web app.":::


### Subscribe to SMS received event

Getting the verification code is required to link your WhatsApp business account to Azure Communication Services resource. Follow these instructions to have the [Azure Event Grid subscribe to the SMS Received event](/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/sms/handle-sms-events#subscribe-to-sms-events-by-using-web-hooks).

When following those instructions, here are helpful tips:

- When filling in the details for the new event subscription.
    - `Name`: Enter a descriptive name for the event subscription. 
    - `System Topic Name`: Enter a unique name, unless this name is already prefilled with a topic from your subscription.
    - `Filter to Event Types`: Select **SMS Received**. No need to select SMS Delivery Report Received
    - `Endpoint Type`: Select **Web Hook**
    - `Endpoint`: Append `/api/updates` to the URL of the Event Grid Viewer (step 6 of [Set up and Deploy Event Grid Viewer](#setup-and-deploy-event-grid-viewer)). It should be something like `https://{{site-name}}.azurewebsites.net/api/updates`

    Use the Azure Communication Services phone number you provisioned previously or bring your own phone number.

    If the phone number you're bringing is:
    - Under a solution provider other than Azure Communication Services, follow these instructions to [migrate your phone number to Azure Communication Services](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/solution-providers/support/migrating-phone-numbers-among-solution-partners-via-embedded-signup/). Create a [support ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) if help is needed.
    - An existing WhatsApp number and want to migrate it to a WhatsApp business account, follow these [instructions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started/migrate-existing-whatsapp-number-to-a-business-account/). Create a [support ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) if help is needed.

19. Select **Finish**.

    The status of your WhatsApp Business account is displayed in the Azure portal. Once approved, you will see an **Active** status.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/active-display-name.png" lightbox="./media/active-display-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an Active status WhatsApp Business account in the Azure portal.":::

    Only when you see that status can you use the WhatsApp Business account to send and receive messages without limitations of number of messages and recipients per day. It also unlocks the ability to link WhatsApp Business account as a channel in Microsoft Copilot Studio.

    Meta reviews your business's display name. You can learn more about this review process and how to update your business account's display name in the article [About WhatsApp Business display name](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/338047025165344).

    When you no longer want to use the WhatsApp Business account with Azure Communication Services, you can select the account and select the **Disconnect** button. This option disconnects the account from Azure Communication Services but doesn't delete the account and the account can be reconnected later.
