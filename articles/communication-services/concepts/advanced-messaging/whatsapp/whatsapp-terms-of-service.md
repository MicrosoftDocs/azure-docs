# Advanced Messaging for WhatsApp data transfer and independent terms of service

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Disclaimer](../../../includes/public-preview-include-document.md)]

To enable the WhatsApp feature in Azure Communication Services, you need to create or connect a WhatsApp Business Account and agree to the Meta Cloud API and WhatsApp Terms of Service ("Meta Terms"). When you use the WhatsApp feature in Azure Communication Services, your data is transferred from one service to the other, and the respective terms govern the handling of that data. [Microsoft Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms) governs the Azure Communication Services. [Meta Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/Meta-Hosting-Terms-Cloud-API)  governs the WhatsApp Service. You should be aware of differences between the Meta Terms and Microsoft Terms in subject matters, including but not limited to privacy, compliance and data handling.

## EU data boundary

WhatsApp data follows the data handling policy defined in the Meta Terms, which may not include the EU Data Boundary commitments.

## Support data transfer

Some support cases may require you to authorize the transfer of your data to Meta. Any data that Microsoft collects will be handled in accordance with the Microsoft Product Terms. The Meta software and any data that you provide to Meta or authorize Microsoft to provide Meta will be covered by the Meta Terms.

## Service level agreement

Azure Communication Services provides an SLA for its customers as outlined in the Azure Terms. Once data is transferred to WhatsApp, it follows the service levels detailed in the Meta Terms.

## HIPAA

The WhatsApp Service may not be HIPAA compliant. It may not have the proper safeguards in place to protect health information.
