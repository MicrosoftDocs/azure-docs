To use the Alphanumeric sender ID service, you need to enable alphanumeric sender ID through the Azure portal. Once the alphanumeric sender ID service is enabled, pay-as-you-go pricing applies to the usage fee. Azure Communication Services determines the usage fee by the destination of the message.
