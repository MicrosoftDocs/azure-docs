The following sections provide information about known issues associated with the Azure Communication Services Calling Native and Native UI SDKs.

## Android API emulators

When utilizing Android API emulators on Android 5.0 (API level 21) and Android 5.1 (API level 22), some crashes are expected.  

## Android Trouter module conflict

When the Android Chat and Calling SDK are together in the same application, Chat SDK's real-time notifications feature doesn't work. You might get a dependency resolving issue.

While we're working on a solution, you can turn off real-time notifications feature by adding the following dependency information in app's build.gradle file and instead poll the GetMessages API to display incoming messages to users.

**Java**
```java
 implementation ("com.azure.android:azure-communication-chat:1.0.0") {
     exclude group: 'com.microsoft', module: 'trouter-client-android'
 }
 implementation 'com.azure.android:azure-communication-calling:1.0.0'
 ```
 
Note: if the application tries to touch any of the notification APIs like `chatAsyncClient.startRealtimeNotifications()` or `chatAsyncClient.addEventHandler()`, results in a runtime error.

## Android Page Size
[16-KB page size](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/08/adding-16-kb-page-size-to-android.html) feature, available since Android 15, is currently not supported.

## iOS answering incoming call via CallKit

Outgoing audio settings wouldn't apply when CallKit is enabled and users answer the incoming calls through CallKit directly. 

## UI Library

You can follow the known issues wiki page in the GitHub repositories.
