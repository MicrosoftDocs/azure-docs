## 10 Digit Long Code (10DLC) Pricing

This page provides an overview of the pricing for 10DLC (10-Digit Long Code) SMS services available through Azure Communication Services (ACS). 10DLC is primarily supported in the United States. Availability depends on the subscription billing location and eligibility. Check the [ACS eligibility documentation](../../concepts/numbers/phone-number-management-for-united-states.md) for more details on supported countries. The 10DLC SMS service requires registering a brand, registering a campaign, and provisioning a 10DLC number through the Azure portal. Pay-as-you-go pricing applies to these different services: brand registration, campaign registration, phone number leasing, and message usage. 

### **Registration Fees**
Registration fees are required for brands and campaigns to comply with U.S. 10DLC regulations. 

- **Brand**: A brand represents your business or organization. It's a unique identity used to register campaigns with mobile carriers.
- **Campaign**: A campaign is a use case associated with a brand, such as promotional messages, customer notifications, or emergency alerts. Campaign registration ensures compliance with messaging regulations and helps carriers distinguish legitimate traffic from spam.

>[!Note]
> Trust scores and vetting requirements are determined by TCR and participating carriers. Brand vetting is **required as per The Campaign Registry (TCR)** in the following cases:  
> To achieve higher trust scores for better message throughput and delivery rates.    
> Brand vetting for 10DLC (10-Digit Long Code) messaging is typically required for companies outside the Russell 3000 list.
