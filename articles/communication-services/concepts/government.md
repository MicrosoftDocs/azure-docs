# Azure Communication Services for US Government

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Notice](../includes/public-preview-include.md)]

You can use Azure Communication Services within [Azure Government](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/government/) to provide compliance with US government requirements for cloud services. In addition to enjoying the features and capabilities of Messaging, Voice and Video calling, developers benefit from the following features that are unique to Azure Government:
- Your personal data is logically segregated from customer content in the commercial Azure cloud.
- Your resourceâ€™s customer content is stored within the United States.
- Access to your organization's customer content is restricted to screened Microsoft personnel. 

Azure Communication Services in Azure Government is currently In Process for the FedRAMP High accreditation as part of the [Microsoft 365 Government Community Cloud (GCC) - High service offering](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/FR1824057433). Once the FedRAMP High certification process is completed and the authorization is granted, Azure Communication Services in the Azure Government cloud moves to GA. Then the government services officially meet the requirements of FedRAMP. Government customers can then use the service that is secure and compliant with federal standards.

## General availability and feature releases

Azure Communication Services for US Government is scheduled for General Availability (GA) in 2025. The initial release focuses on delivering core capabilities, including basic video calling and messaging, to provide government customers with a secure and compliant communication solution.

Following GA, we expect to release advanced features such as:
- Call Logs
- Call Records
- Transcriptions
- Live Captions
- Email Integration

Azure Communication Services is committed to releasing these features as part of its roadmap. Regular releases ensure feature parity with Azure Communication Services Commercial within six months of each feature becoming available in the commercial cloud.
