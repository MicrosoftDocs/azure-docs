To see a list of supported updates for real-time notifications, see [Chat concepts](concepts.md#real-time-notifications)                                     | ❌   | ✔️   | ❌    | ❌  | ❌  | ✔️  | ✔️  |	
|Mobile push notifications with Notification Hub | The Chat SDK provides APIs enabling clients to be notified for incoming messages and other operations occurring in a chat thread. The Chat SDK accomplishes this by connecting an Azure Notification Hub to your Communication Services resource. In situations where your mobile app isn't running in the foreground, patterns are available to [fire pop-up notifications](../notifications.md) ("toasts") to inform end-users, see [Chat concepts](concepts.md#push-notifications).                                     | ❌   | ❌   | ❌    | ❌  | ❌  | ✔️  | ✔️  |
