# Email metrics overview

Azure Communication Services currently provides metrics for all Azure communication services' primitives. [Azure Metrics Explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started) can be used to plot your own charts, investigate abnormalities in your metric values, and understand your API traffic by using the metrics data that email requests emit.

## Where to find metrics

Primitives in Azure Communication Services emit metrics for API requests. These metrics can be found in the Metrics tab under your Communication Services resource. You can also create permanent dashboards using the workbooks tab under your Communication Services resource.

## Metric definitions

All API request metrics contain three dimensions that you can use to filter your metrics data. These dimensions can be aggregated together using the `Count` aggregation type and support all standard Azure Aggregation time series including `Sum`, `Average`, `Min`, and `Max`.

More information about supported aggregation types and time series aggregations, see  [Advanced features of Azure Metrics Explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-charts#aggregation).

- **Operation** - All operations or routes that can be called on the Azure Communication Services Chat gateway.
- **Status Code** - The status code response sent after the request.
- **StatusSubClass** - The status code series sent after the response. 

### Email Service Delivery Status Updates
The `Email Service Delivery Status Updates` metric lets the email sender track SMTP and Enhanced SMTP status codes and get an idea of how many hard bounces they're encountering.

The following dimensions are available on the `Email Service Delivery Status Updates` metric:

| Dimension    | Description                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Result       | High level status of the message delivery: Success, Failure. |
| MessageStatus       | Terminal state of the Delivered, Failed, Suppressed. Emails are suppressed when a user sends an email to an email address that is known not to exist. Sending emails to addresses that don't exist trigger a hard bounce. |
| IsHardBounce       | True when a message delivery failed due to a hard bounce or if an item was suppressed due to a previous hard bounce. |
| SenderDomain       | The domain portion of the senders email address. |
| SmtpStatusCode       | Smtp error code from for failed deliveries. |
| EnhancedSmtpStatusCode       | The EnhancedSmtpStatusCode status code will be emitted if it's available. This status code provides other details not available with the SmtpStatusCode. |

The following operations are available for the `Email Service API Requests` metric. These standard dimensions are supported: StatusCode, StatusCodeClass, StatusCodeReason, and Operation.

| Operation    | Description                                                                                    |
