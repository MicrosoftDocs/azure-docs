# SMS overview

[!INCLUDE [Regional Availability Notice](../../includes/regional-availability-include.md)]

Azure Communication Services enables you to send and receive short message service (SMS) text messages using the Communication Services SMS SDKs. You can use these SDKs to support customer service scenarios, appointment reminders, two-factor authentication, and other real-time communication needs. Azure Communication Services SMS enables you to reliably send messages while exposing deliverability and response metrics.

<!-- [!INCLUDE [Survey Request](../includes/survey-request.md)] -->

## SMS features

Key features of Azure Communication Services SMS SDKs include:

-  **Simple** setup experience for adding SMS capability to your applications.
- **High Velocity** message support over toll free numbers and short codes for A2P (Application to Person) use cases in the United States.
- **Bulk Messaging** supported to enable sending messages to multiple recipients at a time.
- **Two-way** conversations to support scenarios like customer support, alerts, and appointment reminders.
- **Reliable Delivery** with real-time delivery reports for messages sent from your application.
- **Analytics** to track your SMS usage patterns. See [SMS insights](../../concepts/analytics/insights/sms-insights.md) for details.
- **Opt-Out** handling support to automatically detect and respect opt-outs for toll-free numbers and short codes. US carriers mandate and enforce opt-outs for US toll-free numbers. See [opt-out handling FAQ](./sms-faq.md#opt-out-handling) for details.

## Sender types supported

You need a phone number to send SMS to any recipient. Choosing the right number type is critical to the success of your messaging campaign. When choosing a number type, consider the message destination, the throughput needed for your campaign, and when you want to start sending messages. Azure Communication Services enables you to send SMS using various sender types: toll-free number (1-8XX), short codes (12345), 10 digit long codes (1-234-123-1234), and alphanumeric sender ID (CONTOSO). The following table walks you through the features of each number type:
