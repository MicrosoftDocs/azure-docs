# Understand sender reputation in Azure Communication Services email

This article describes best practices for email delivery in business-to-consumer (B2C) communication and how to use Azure Communication Services email logs to help with your email reputation. This comprehensive guide offers insights into optimizing email complaint management, fostering healthier email practices, and maximizing the success of your email delivery.

## Managing sender reputation and email complaints to enhance email delivery

Azure Communication Services offers email capabilities that can enrich your customer communications. However, there's no guarantee that the emails you send through the platform land in the customer's inbox. To proactively identify and avoid delivery problems, you should perform reputation checks such as:

* Ensuring a consistent and healthy percentage of successfully delivered emails over time.
* Analyzing specific details on email delivery failures and bounces.
* Monitoring spam and abuse reports.
* Maintaining a healthy contact list.
* Understanding user engagement and inbox placements.
* Understanding customer complaints and providing an easy process for opting out or unsubscribing.

To enable email logs and monitor your email delivery, follow the steps in [Azure Communication Services email logs](../../concepts/analytics/logs/email-logs.md).

## Email bounces: Delivery statuses and types

Email bounces indicate problems with the successful delivery of an email. During the email delivery process, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) responses provide the following outcomes:

* **Success (2xx)**: The email service provider accepted the email. However, this outcome doesn't guarantee that the email lands in the customer's inbox. A status of **Delivered** indicates delivery of the email.

* **Temporary failure (4xx)**: The email service provider can't accept the email at the moment. But the recipient's address is still valid, enabling future delivery attempts. This outcome is often called a *soft bounce*. The cause can be various factors such as rate limiting or infrastructure problems.

* **Permanent failure (5xx)**: The email service provider rejected the email. This outcome is commonly called a *hard bounce*. This type of bounce occurs when the email address doesn't exist. An email delivery status of **Bounced** indicates this outcome.

According to the RFC definitions:

* A hard bounce (permanent failure) specifically refers to cases where the email address is nonexistent.
* A soft bounce encompasses various types of failures.
* A spam bounce typically occurs because of specific policy decisions.

These practices aren't always uniform and standardized across email service providers.

### Hard bounces

The following SMTP codes can describe hard bounces:

| Error code | Description | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 521 | Server Doesn't Accept Mail | The SMTP server encountered problem that prevents it from accepting the incoming mail. |
| 525 | User Account Disabled | The user's email account was disabled and can't receive emails. |
| 550 | Mailbox Unavailable | The recipient's mailbox is unavailable to receive emails. The mailbox might be full or might have a temporary problem. |
| 553 | Mailbox Name Not Allowed | The recipient's email address or mailbox name isn't valid, or the email system's policies don't support it. |
| 5.1.1 | Bad Destination Mailbox Address | The destination mailbox address is invalid or doesn't exist. Check the address for typos or formatting errors. |
| 5.1.2 | Bad Destination System Address | The destination system address is invalid or doesn't exist. Check the recipient's email domain or system for typos or errors. Ensure that the domain or system is correctly configured. |
| 5.1.3 | Bad Destination Mailbox Address Syntax | The syntax of the destination mailbox address is incorrect. Check the recipient's email address for formatting errors or invalid characters. Verify that the address follows the correct syntax. |
| 5.1.4 | Ambiguous Destination Mailbox Address | The recipient's email address isn't unique and matches multiple recipients. Check the email address for accuracy and provide a unique address. |
| 5.1.6 | Destination Mailbox Moved | The recipient's mailbox was moved to a different location or server. Check the recipient's new mailbox address for message delivery. |
| 5.1.9 | Non-Compliant Destination System | The recipient's email system isn't configured according to standard protocols. Contact the system administrator to resolve the problem. |
| 5.1.10 | Destination Address Null MX | The recipient's email domain doesn't have a valid Mail Exchange (MX) record. Contact the domain administrator to fix the Domain Name System (DNS) configuration. |
| 5.2.1 | Destination Mailbox Disabled | The recipient's mailbox is disabled, which is preventing message delivery. Contact the recipient to enable the mailbox. |
| 5.2.1 | Mailing List Expansion Problem | The destination mailbox is a mailing list, and expansion failed. Contact the mailing list administrator to resolve the problem. |
| 5.3.2 | Destination System Not Accepting Messages | The recipient's email server isn't currently accepting messages. Try resending the email at a later time. |
| 5.4.1 | Recipient Address Rejected | The recipient's email server rejected the message. Check the recipient's email address for accuracy and proper formatting. |
| 5.4.4 | Unable to Route | The message can't be routed to the recipient's server. Verify the recipient's email domain and server settings. |
| 5.4.6 | Routing Loop Detected | The email server encountered a routing loop while attempting to deliver the message. Contact the system administrator to resolve the loop. |
| 5.7.13 | User Account Disabled | The recipient's email account was disabled, and the email server isn't accepting messages for that account. The mail service provider deactivated or suspended the recipient's email address, rendering the address inaccessible for receiving emails. Or, the user or the organization chose to disable the email account. |
| 5.4.310 | DNS Domain Doesn't Exist | The recipient's email domain doesn't exist or has an incorrect DNS configuration. Verify the domain's DNS settings. |

Sending emails repeatedly to addresses that don't exist can significantly affect your sender reputation. It's crucial to take action by promptly removing those addresses from your contact list and diligently managing a healthy contact list.

### Error codes for soft bounces

Closely monitor soft bounces (temporary failures) when you send email. A high volume of soft bounces can indicate a potential reputation issue. Email service providers might be slowing down your mail delivery.

The following SMTP codes can describe soft bounces:

## Managed suppression list

Azure Communication Services offers a feature called a *managed suppression list*, which can play a vital role in protecting and preserving your sender reputation.

The suppression list cache keeps track of email addresses that experienced a hard bounce for all emails sent through Azure Communication Services. Whenever an email delivery fails with one of the specified error codes, the email address is added to the internally managed suppression list, which spans the Azure platform and is maintained globally.

Here's the lifecycle of email addresses that are suppressed:

1. **Initial suppression**: When Azure Communication Services encounters a hard bounce with an email address for the first time, it adds the address to the managed suppression list for 24 hours.

1. **Progressive suppression**: If the same invalid recipient email address reappears in any subsequent emails sent to the platform within the initial 24-hour period, it's automatically suppressed from delivery. The caching time is extended to 48 hours. For subsequent occurrences, the cache time progressively increases to 96 hours, then 7 days, and ultimately reaches a maximum duration of 14 days.

1. **Automatic removal process**: Email addresses are automatically removed from the managed suppression list when no email send requests are made to the same recipient within the designated lease time frame. After the lease period expires, the email address is removed from the list. If any new emails are sent to the same invalid recipient, Azure Communication Services starts a new cycle by making another delivery attempt.

1. **Drop in delivery**: If an email address is under a lease time, any further mails sent to that recipient address are dropped until the address lease either expires or is removed from the managed suppression list. The delivery status for this email request is **Suppressed** in the email logs.

Email addresses can remain on the managed suppression list for a maximum of 14 days. This proactive measure helps protect your sender reputation and shields you from the adverse effects of repeatedly sending emails to invalid addresses. Nevertheless, you should take action on bounced statuses and regularly clean your contact list to maintain optimal email delivery performance.

## Reputation-related and asynchronous email delivery failures

Some email service providers generate email bounces from reputation issues. These bounces are often classified as spam and abuse related, because of specific reputation or content issues. The bounce messages might include URLs to webpages that provide further explanations for the bounces, to help you understand the reason for the delivery failure and enable appropriate action.

In addition to the SMTP-level bounces, bounces might occur after the receiving server accepts a message. Initially, the response from the email service provider might suggest successful email delivery. But later, the provider sends a bounce response.

These asynchronous bounces are typically directed to the return path address mentioned in the email payload. Be aware of these asynchronous bounces and handle them accordingly to maintain optimal email delivery performance.

## Opt out or unsubscribe management

Understanding your customers' interest in your email communication and monitoring opt-out or unsubscribe requests are crucial aspects of maintaining a positive sender reputation. Whether you have a manual or automated process in place for handling unsubscribe requests, it's important to provide an **Unsubscribe** link in the email payload that you send. When recipients decide not to receive further emails, they can select the **Unsubscribe** link and remove their email address from your mailing list.

The functionality of the links and instructions in the email is vital. They must be working correctly and promptly notify the application mailing list to remove the contact from the appropriate list.

An unsubscribe mechanism must be explicit and transparent from the subscriber's perspective. It must ensure that users know precisely which messages they're unsubscribing from.

When users are subscribed to multiple lists in your organization, it's ideal to offer users a preferences center that gives them the option to unsubscribe from more than one list. This process prevents accidental unsubscribes and enables users to manage their opt-in and opt-out preferences effectively through the unsubscribe management process.
