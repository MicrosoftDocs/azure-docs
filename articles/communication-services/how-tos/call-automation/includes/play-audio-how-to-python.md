## Prerequisites

- Azure account with an active subscription, for details see [Create an account for free.](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Azure Communication Services resource. See [Create an Azure Communication Services resource](../../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp). Save the connection string for this resource. 
- Create a new web service application using the [Call Automation SDK](../../../quickstarts/call-automation/callflows-for-customer-interactions.md).
- Have Python installed, you can install from the [official site](https://www.python.org/).

### For AI features 
- Create and connect [Azure AI services to your Azure Communication Services resource](../../../concepts/call-automation/azure-communication-services-azure-cognitive-services-integration.md).
- Create a [custom subdomain](/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains) for your Azure AI services resource. 

## Create a new Python application

### Set up a Python virtual environment for your project
``` console
python -m venv play-audio-app
```

### Activate your virtual environment
On windows, use the following command:
``` console
.\ play-audio-quickstart \Scripts\activate
```
On Unix, use the following command:
``` console
source play-audio-quickstart /bin/activate
```

### Install the Azure Communication Services Call Automation package 

``` console
pip install azure-communication-callautomation
```
Create your application file in your project directory, for example, name it app.py. You write your Python code in this file.  

Run your application using Python with the following command to execute code. 

``` console
python app.py
```

## (Optional) Prepare your audio file if you wish to use audio files for playing prompts

Create an audio file, if you don't already have one, to use for playing prompts and messages to participants. The audio file must be hosted in a location that is accessible to Azure Communication Services with support for authentication. Keep a copy of the URL available for you to use when requesting to play the audio file. Azure Communication Services supports both file types of **MP3** and **WAV files, mono 16-bit PCM at 16 KHz sample rate**. . 

You can test creating your own audio file using our [Speech synthesis with Audio Content Creation tool](/azure/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-audio-content-creation).

## (Optional) Connect your Azure Cognitive Service to your Azure Communication Service

If you would like to use Text-To-Speech capabilities, then it's required for you to connect your [Azure Cognitive Service to your Azure Communication Service](../../../concepts/call-automation/azure-communication-services-azure-cognitive-services-integration.md).

## Establish a call

By this point you should be familiar with starting calls, if you need to learn more about making a call, follow our [quickstart](../../../quickstarts/call-automation/quickstart-make-an-outbound-call.md). You can also use the code snippet provided here to understand how to answer a call.

```python
call_automation_client.answer_call(
    incoming_call_context="<Incoming call context>",
    callback_url="<https://sample-callback-uri>",
    cognitive_services_endpoint=COGNITIVE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT,
)
```

## Play audio

Once the call has been established, there are multiple options for how you may wish to play the audio. You can play audio to the participant that has joined the call or play audio to all the participants in the call.

### Play source - Audio file

To play audio to participants using audio files, you need to make sure the audio file is a WAV file, mono and 16 KHz. To play audio files, you need to make sure you provide Azure Communication Services with a uri to a file you host in a location where Azure Communication Services can access it. The FileSource type in our SDK can be used to specify audio files for the play action.

``` python
play_source = FileSource(url=audioUri)

#Play multiple audio files
#file_source1 = FileSource(MAIN_MENU_PROMPT_URI) 
#file_source2 = FileSource(MAIN_MENU_PROMPT_URI) 
#
# play_sources = [file_source1, file_source2]
# 
# call_connection_client.play_media_to_all(
#     play_source=play_sources,
#     interrupt_call_media_operation=False,
#     operation_context="multiplePlayContext",
#     operation_callback_url=CALLBACK_EVENTS_URI,
#     loop=False
# )
```

### Play source - Text-To-Speech 

To play audio using Text-To-Speech through Azure AI services, you need to provide the text you wish to play, as well either the SourceLocale, and VoiceKind or the VoiceName you wish to use. We support all voice names supported by Azure AI services, full list [here](/azure/ai-services/speech-service/language-support?tabs=tts).

``` python
text_to_play = "Welcome to Contoso"

# Provide SourceLocale and VoiceKind to select an appropriate voice. 
play_source = TextSource(
    text=text_to_play, source_locale="en-US", voice_kind=VoiceKind.FEMALE
)
play_to = [target_participant]
call_automation_client.get_call_connection(call_connection_id).play_media(
    play_source=play_source, play_to=play_to
)

#Multiple text prompts
#play_source1 = TextSource(text="Hi, This is multiple play source one call media test.", source_locale="en-US", voice_kind=VoiceKind.FEMALE) 
#play_source2 = TextSource(text="Hi, This is multiple play source two call media test.", source_locale="en-US", voice_kind=VoiceKind.FEMALE)
#
#play_sources = [play_source1, play_source2]
#
#call_connection_client.play_media_to_all(
#    play_source=play_sources,
#    interrupt_call_media_operation=False,
#    operation_context="multiplePlayContext",
#    operation_callback_url=CALLBACK_EVENTS_URI,
#    loop=False
#)
```

``` python
text_to_play = "Welcome to Contoso"

# Provide VoiceName to select a specific voice. 
play_source = TextSource(text=text_to_play, voice_name="en-US-ElizabethNeural")
play_to = [target_participant]
call_automation_client.get_call_connection(call_connection_id).play_media(
    play_source=play_source, play_to=play_to
)

#Play multiple text prompts
#play_source1 = TextSource(text="Hi, This is multiple play source one call media test.", voice_name=SPEECH_TO_TEXT_VOICE) 
#play_source2 = TextSource(text="Hi, This is multiple play source two call media test.", voice_name=SPEECH_TO_TEXT_VOICE)
#
#play_sources = [play_source1, play_source2]
#
#call_connection_client.play_media_to_all(
#    play_source=play_sources,
#    interrupt_call_media_operation=False,
#    operation_context="multiplePlayContext",
#    operation_callback_url=CALLBACK_EVENTS_URI,
#    loop=False
#)
```

### Play source - Text-To-Speech with SSML 

If you want to customize your Text-To-Speech output even more with Azure AI services you can use [Speech Synthesis Markup Language SSML](/azure/ai-services/speech-service/speech-synthesis-markup) when invoking your play action through Call Automation. With SSML you can fine-tune the pitch, pause, improve pronunciation, change speaking rate, adjust volume and attribute multiple voices.

``` python
ssmlToPlay = '<speak version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang="en-US"><voice name="en-US-JennyNeural">Hello World!</voice></speak>'

play_source = SsmlSource(ssml_text=ssmlToPlay)

play_to = [target_participant]

call_automation_client.get_call_connection(call_connection_id).play_media(
    play_source=play_source, play_to=play_to
)
```

### Custom voice models
If you wish to enhance your prompts more and include custom voice models, the play action Text-To-Speech now supports these custom voices. These are a great option if you are trying to give customers a more local, personalized experience or have situations where the default models may not cover the words and accents you're trying to pronounce. To learn more about creating and deploying custom models you can read this [guide](/azure/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-custom-voice).

**Custom voice names regular text example**
``` python
text_to_play = "Welcome to Contoso"

# Provide VoiceName to select a specific voice. 
play_source = TextSource(text=text_to_play, voice_name="YourCustomVoiceName", custom_voice_endpoint_id = "YourCustomEndpointId")
play_to = [target_participant]
call_automation_client.get_call_connection(call_connection_id).play_media(
    play_source=play_source, play_to=play_to
)
```
**Custom voice names SSML example**
``` python
ssmlToPlay = '<speak version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang="en-US"><voice name="YourCustomVoiceName">Hello World!</voice></speak>'

play_source = SsmlSource(ssml_text=ssmlToPlay, custom_voice_endpoint_id="YourCustomEndpointId")

play_to = [target_participant]

call_automation_client.get_call_connection(call_connection_id).play_media(
    play_source=play_source, play_to=play_to
)
```

Once you've decided on which playSource you wish to use for playing audio, you can then choose whether you want to play it to a specific participant or to all participants.

## Play audio - All participants

Play a prerecorded audio file to all participants in the call.

``` python 
text_to_play = "Welcome to Contoso"

play_source = TextSource(text=text_to_play, voice_name="en-US-ElizabethNeural")

call_automation_client.get_call_connection(call_connection_id).play_media(
    play_source=play_source
)
```

### Support for barge-in
During scenarios where you're playing audio on loop to all participants e.g. waiting lobby you maybe playing audio to the participants in the lobby and keep them updated on their number in the queue. When you use the barge-in support, this will cancel the on-going audio and play your new message. Then if you wanted to continue playing your original audio you would make another play request.

```python
# Interrupt media with text source
# Option 1
play_source = TextSource(text="This is interrupt call media test.", voice_name=SPEECH_TO_TEXT_VOICE)
call_connection_client.play_media_to_all(
    play_source, 
    interrupt_call_media_operation=True, 
    operation_context="interruptContext", 
    operation_callback_url=CALLBACK_EVENTS_URI, 
    loop=False
)

# Interrupt media with file source
# Option 2
#play_source = FileSource(MAIN_MENU_PROMPT_URI)
#call_connection_client.play_media_to_all(
#    play_source, 
#    interrupt_call_media_operation=True, 
#    operation_context="interruptContext", 
#    operation_callback_url=CALLBACK_EVENTS_URI, 
#    loop=False
#)
```

## Play audio - Specific participant

Play a prerecorded audio file to a specific participant in the call.

``` python 
play_to = [target_participant]

call_automation_client.get_call_connection(call_connection_id).play_media(
    play_source=play_source, play_to=play_to
)
```

## Play audio on loop

You can use the loop option to play hold music that loops until your application is ready to accept the caller. Or progress the caller to the next logical step based on your applications business logic.

``` python
text_to_play = "Welcome to Contoso"

play_source = TextSource(text=text_to_play, voice_name="en-US-ElizabethNeural")

call_automation_client.get_call_connection(call_connection_id).play_media(
    play_source=play_source, loop=True
)
```

## Enhance play with audio file caching

If you're playing the same audio file multiple times, your application can provide Azure Communication Services with the sourceID for the audio file. Azure Communication Services caches this audio file for 1 hour. 
> [!Note]
> Caching audio files isn't suitable for dynamic prompts. If you change the URL provided to Azure Communication Services, it does not update the cached URL straight away. The update will occur after the existing cache expires.

``` python
play_source = FileSource(url=audioUri, play_source_cache_id="<playSourceId>")

play_to = [target_participant]

call_automation_client.get_call_connection(call_connection_id).play_media(
    play_source=play_source, play_to=play_to
)
```

## Handle play action event updates 

Your application receives action lifecycle event updates on the callback URL that was provided to Call Automation service at the time of answering the call. 

### Example of how you can deserialize the *PlayCompleted* event:

```python 
if event.type == "Microsoft.Communication.PlayCompleted":

    app.logger.info("Play completed, context=%s", event.data.get("operationContext"))
```

### Example of how you can deserialize the *PlayStarted* event:

```python 
if event.type == "Microsoft.Communication.PlayStarted":

    app.logger.info("Play started, context=%s", event.data.get("operationContext"))
```

### Example of how you can deserialize the *PlayFailed* event:

```python
if event.type == "Microsoft.Communication.PlayFailed":

    app.logger.info("Play failed: data=%s", event.data)
```

To learn more about other supported events, visit the [Call Automation overview document](../../../concepts/call-automation/call-automation.md#call-automation-webhook-events).

## Cancel play action

Cancel all media operations, all pending media operations are canceled. This action also cancels other queued play actions.

```python
call_automation_client.get_call_connection(
    call_connection_id
).cancel_all_media_operations()
```

### Example of how you can deserialize the *PlayCanceled* event:

```python
if event.type == "Microsoft.Communication.PlayCanceled":

    app.logger.info("Play canceled, context=%s", event.data.get("operationContext"))
```
