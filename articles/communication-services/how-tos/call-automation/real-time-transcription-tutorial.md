# Add real-time transcription into your application

[!INCLUDE [Public Preview Disclaimer](../../includes/public-preview-include-document.md)]

This guide helps you better understand the different ways you can use Azure Communication Services offering of real-time transcription through Call Automation SDKs.

### Prerequisites
- Azure account with an active subscription, for details see [Create an account for free.](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Azure Communication Services resource, see [Create an Azure Communication Services resource](../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp)
- Create and connect [Azure AI services to your Azure Communication Services resource](../../concepts/call-automation/azure-communication-services-azure-cognitive-services-integration.md).
- Create a [custom subdomain](/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains) for your Azure AI services resource.
- Create a new web service application using the [Call Automation SDK](../../quickstarts/call-automation/quickstart-make-an-outbound-call.md).

## Setup a WebSocket Server 
Azure Communication Services requires your server application to set up a WebSocket server to stream transcription in real-time. WebSocket is a standardized protocol that provides a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection. You can optionally use Azure services Azure WebApps that allows you to create an application to receive transcripts over a websocket connection. Follow this [quickstart](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/introduction-to-websockets-on-windows-azure-web-sites/).

## Establish a call 
In this quickstart, we assume that you're already familiar with starting calls. If you need to learn more about starting and establishing calls, you can follow our [quickstart](../../quickstarts/call-automation/quickstart-make-an-outbound-call.md). For the purposes of this quickstart, we're going through the process of starting transcription for both incoming calls and outbound calls. 

When working with real-time transcription, you have a few of options on when and how to start transcription:

**Option 1 -** Starting at time of answering or creating a call

**Option 2 -** Starting transcription during an ongoing call 

**Option 3 -** Starting transcription when connecting to an Azure Communication Services Rooms call

In this tutorial, we're demonstrating option 2 and 3, starting transcription during an ongoing call or when connecting to a Rooms call. By default the 'startTranscription' is set to false at time of answering or creating a call.
