# Customize voice prompts to users with Play action

This guide will help you get started with playing audio files to participants by using the play action provided through Azure Communication Services Call Automation SDK.

## Known limitations
- Text-to-Speech text prompts support a maximum of 400 characters, if your prompt is longer than this we suggest using SSML for Text-to-Speech based play actions.
- For scenarios where you exceed your Speech service quota limit, you can request to increase this limit by following the steps outlined [here](/azure/ai-services/speech-service/speech-services-quotas-and-limits).

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).
