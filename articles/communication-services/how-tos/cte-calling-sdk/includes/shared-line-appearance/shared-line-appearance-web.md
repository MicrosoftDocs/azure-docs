## Place a call on behalf of a Microsoft Teams user

Before placing a call behalf of a delegator, make sure delegate placing the call has `make calls` permission through [delegator call settings in Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/share-a-phone-line-with-a-delegate-in-microsoft-teams-16307929-a51f-43fc-8323-3b1bf115e5a8)

To place a call on behalf of a Microsoft Teams user, specify `OnBehalfOfOptions` during start call. Replace `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` with the userId of the delegator and `yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy` with the userId of the callee.

```js
const onBehalfOfOptions = { userId: { microsoftTeamsUserId: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" } }
const teamsCallOptions = { onBehalfOfOptions: onBehalfOfOptions };
const call = teamsCallAgent.startCall([{ microsoftTeamsUserId: "yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy" }], teamsCallOptions);
```

To place a call to a PSTN user on behalf of a Microsoft Teams user, use `PhoneNumberIdentifier` for call participant.

```
