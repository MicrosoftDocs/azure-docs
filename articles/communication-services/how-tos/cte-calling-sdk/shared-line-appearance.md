# Teams Shared Line Appearance

This article describes how to implement Microsoft Teams Shared Line Appearance with Azure Communication Services. Shared line appearance lets a user choose a delegate to make or handle calls on their behalf. This feature is helpful if a user has an administrative assistant who regularly handles the user's calls. In the context of shared line appearance, a manager is a Teams user who authorizes a delegate to make or receive calls on their behalf. A delegate is a Microsoft 365 user who can make or receive calls on behalf of the delegator. You can find additional information about shared line appearance in [Teams documentation](/microsoftteams/shared-line-appearance).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. See [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). 
- A deployed Communication Services resource. See [Create a Communication Services resource](../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md).
- A user access token to enable the calling client. For more information, see [Create and manage access tokens](../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md).
- Licensing requirements for delegator and delegates. See [Teams Phone license](/microsoftteams/shared-line-appearance#license-required).
- Enable delegation and shared line appearance. See [Enable delegation](/microsoftteams/shared-line-appearance#enable-delegation-and-shared-line-appearance)
