#Customer intent: As a developer, I want to create a scheduled job

# Scheduling a job

In the context of a call center, customers may want to receive a scheduled callback at a later time. As such, you need to create a scheduled job in Job Router.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- A deployed Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md).
- A Job Router queue with queueId `Callback` has been [created](manage-queue.md).
- A Job Router worker with channel capacity on the `Voice` channel has been [created](../../concepts/router/matching-concepts.md).
- Subscribe to the [JobWaitingForActivation event](subscribe-events.md#microsoftcommunicationrouterjobwaitingforactivation).
- Optional: Complete the quickstart to [get started with Job Router](../../quickstarts/router/get-started-router.md).

## Create a job using the ScheduleAndSuspendMode

In the following example, a job is created that is scheduled 3 minutes from now by setting the `MatchingMode` to `ScheduleAndSuspendMode` with a `scheduleAt` parameter. This example assumes that you [created a queue](manage-queue.md) with the queueId `Callback` and that there's an active [worker registered](../../concepts/router/matching-concepts.md) to the queue with available capacity on the `Voice` channel.

```csharp
await client.CreateJobAsync(new CreateJobOptions(jobId: "job1", channelId: "Voice", queueId: "Callback")
{
    MatchingMode = new ScheduleAndSuspendMode(scheduleAt: DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.Add(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(3)))
});
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript"

```typescript
await client.path("/routing/jobs/{jobId}", "job1").patch({
    body: {
        channelId: "Voice",
        queueId: "Callback",
        matchingMode: {
            kind: "scheduleAndSuspend",
            scheduleAt: new Date(Date.now() + 3 * 60000)
        }
    },
    contentType: "application/merge-patch+json"
});
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"

```python
client.upsert_job(
    job_id = "job1",
    channel_id = "Voice",
    queue_id = "Callback",
    matching_mode = ScheduleAndSuspendMode(schedule_at = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes = 3)))
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"

```java
client.createJob(new CreateJobOptions("job1", "Voice", "Callback")
    .setMatchingMode(new ScheduleAndSuspendMode(OffsetDateTime.now().plusMinutes(3))));
```

::: zone-end

> [!NOTE]
> The job's status after being scheduled is initially `PendingSchedule`, and once Job Router successfully schedules the job, the status is updated to `Scheduled`.

## Wait for the scheduled time to be reached, then queue the job

When the scheduled time is reached, the job's status is updated to `WaitingForActivation` and Job Router emits a [RouterJobWaitingForActivation event](subscribe-events.md#microsoftcommunicationrouterjobwaitingforactivation) to Event Grid. If this event is subscribed, some required actions may be performed, before enabling the job to be matched to a worker. For example, in the context of the contact center, such an action could be making an outbound call and waiting for the customer to accept the callback. Once the required actions are complete, the job can be queued by calling the `UpdateJobAsync` method with the `MatchingMode` set to `QueueAndMatchMode` and priority set to `100` to quickly find an eligible worker, which updates the job's status to `queued`.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

```csharp
// Event Grid Event Handler code omitted
if (eventGridEvent.EventType == "Microsoft.Communication.RouterJobWaitingForActivation")
{
    // Perform required actions here

    await client.UpdateJobAsync(new RouterJob(jobId: eventGridEvent.Data.JobId)
    {
        MatchingMode = new QueueAndMatchMode(),
        Priority = 100
    });
}
```

    await client.path("/routing/jobs/{jobId}", eventGridEvent.data.jobId).patch({
      body: {
          matchingMode: { kind: "queueAndMatch" },
          priority: 100
      },
      contentType: "application/merge-patch+json"
    });
}
```

{
    # Perform required actions here

    client.upsert_job(
        job_id = eventGridEvent.data.job_id,
        matching_mode = queue_and_match_mode = {},
        priority = 100)
}
```

    job = client.updateJob(eventGridEvent.getData().toObject(new TypeReference<Map<String, Object>>() {
}).get("JobId").toString(), BinaryData.fromObject(new RouterJob()
        .setMatchingMode(new QueueAndMatchMode())
        .setPriority(100)), null).toObject(RouterJob.class);
}
```
