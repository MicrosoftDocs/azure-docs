# Enable Closed captions for Teams interoperability

Learn how to allow your users to enable closed captions during a Teams interoperability scenario where your users might be in a meeting between an Azure Communication Services user and a Teams client user, or where your users are using Azure Communication Services calling SDK with their Microsoft 365 identity.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources here](../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).
