During an active call, we recommend sending and receiving states from other participants. Let's learn how. 

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). 
- A deployed Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md).
- A user access token to enable the calling client. For more information, see [Create and manage access tokens](../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md).
- Optional: Complete the quickstart to [add voice calling to your application](../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/getting-started-with-calling.md)
