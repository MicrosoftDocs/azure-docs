# Microsoft Teams Meeting Audio Conferencing 

This article describes how to use Azure Communication Services Calling SDK to retrieve Microsoft Teams Meeting Audio Conferencing details. This function enables users who are already connected to a Microsoft Teams Meeting to be able to get the conference ID and dial-in phone number associated with the meeting. The Teams Meeting Audio Conferencing feature returns a collection of all toll and toll-free numbers. The collection includes concomitant country/region names and city names, giving users control of which Teams meeting dial-in details to use.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). 
- A deployed Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md).
- A user access token to enable the calling client. For more information. [Create and manage access tokens](../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md).
- Optional: Complete the quickstart to [add voice calling to your application](../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/getting-started-with-calling.md).
