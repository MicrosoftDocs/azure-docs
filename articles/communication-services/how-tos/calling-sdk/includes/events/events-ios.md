[!INCLUDE [Install SDK](../install-sdk/install-sdk-ios.md)]

Now that you installed the iOS SDK, you can subscribe to most of the properties and collections to be notified when values change.

## Properties

To subscribe to `property changed` events, use the following code.

```swift
call.delegate = self
// Get the property of the call state by getting on the call's state member
public func call(_ call: Call, didChangeState args: PropertyChangedEventArgs) {
{
    print("Callback from SDK when the call state changes, current state: " + call.state.rawValue)
}

// to unsubscribe
self.call.delegate = nil
```

## Collections

To subscribe to `collection updated` events, use the following code.

```swift
call.delegate = self
// Collection contains the streams that were added or removed only
public func call(_ call: Call, didUpdateLocalVideoStreams args: LocalVideoStreamsUpdatedEventArgs) {
{
    print(args.addedStreams.count)
    print(args.removedStreams.count)
}
// to unsubscribe
self.call.delegate = nil
```
