## Events on the Azure Communication Calling SDK

This guide describes the various events or properties changes your app can subscribe to. Subscribing to those events allows your app to be informed about state change in the calling SDK and react accordingly.

Tracking events is crucial because it enables your application's state to stay synchronized with the ACSCalling framework's state, all without requiring you to implement a pull mechanism on the SDK objects.

This guide assumes you went through the QuickStart or that you implemented an application that is able to make and receive calls. If you didn't complete the getting starting guide, refer to our [Quickstart](../../../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/getting-started-with-calling.md).

Each object in the JavaScript calling SDK has `properties` and `collections`. Their values change throughout the lifetime of the object.
Use the `on()` method to subscribe to objects' events, and use the `off()` method to unsubscribe from objects' events.

### Properties
You can subscribe to the `'<property>Changed'` event to listen to value changes on the property.

### Example of subscription on a property
In this example, we subscribe to changes in the value of the `isLocalVideoStarted` property.

```javascript
call.on('isLocalVideoStartedChanged', () => {
    // At that point the value call.isLocalVideoStarted is updated
    console.log(`isLocalVideoStarted changed: ${call.isLocalVideoStarted}`);
});
```

## Collections
You can subscribe to the '\<collection>Updated' event to receive notifications about changes in an object collection. The '\<collection>Updated' event is triggered whenever elements are added to or removed from the collection you're monitoring.

- The `'<collection>Updated'` event's payload, has an `added` array that contains values that were added to the collection.
- The `'<collection>Updated'` event's payload also has a `removed` array that contains values that were removed from the collection.

### Example subscription on a collection

In this example, we subscribe to changes in values of the Call object `LocalVideoStream`.

```javascript
call.on('localVideoStreamsUpdated', updateEvent => {
    updateEvent.added.forEach(async (localVideoStream) => {
        // Contains an array of LocalVideoStream that were added to the call
        // Add a preview and start any processing if needed
        handleAddedLocalVideoStream(localVideoStream )
    });
    updateEvent.removed.forEach(localVideoStream => {
        // Contains an array of LocalVideoStream that were removed from the call
        // Remove the preview and stop any processing if needed
        handleRemovedLocalVideoStream(localVideoStream ) 
    });
});
```

<!---------- CallAgent  object ---------->
## Events on the `CallAgent` object

### Event Name: `incomingCall`

The `incomingCall` event fires when the client is receiving an incoming call.

**How should your application react to the event?**

Your application should notify the user of the incoming call. The notification prompt should propose the user to accept or refuse the call.

**Code sample:**
```javascript
callClient.on('incomingCall', (async (incomimgCallEvent) => {
    try {
        // Store a reference to the call object
        incomingCall = incomimgCallEvent.incomingCall; 
        // Update your UI to allow
        acceptCallButton.disabled = false; 
        callButton.disabled = true;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
});
```

### Event Name: `callsUpdated`

The `callsUpdated` updated event is fired when a call is removed or added to the call agent. This event happens when the user makes, receives, or terminates a call.

**How should your application react to the event?**
Your application should update its UI based on the number of active calls for the CallAgent instance.

### Event Name: `connectionStateChanged`

The `connectionStateChanged` event fired when the signaling state of the `CallAgent` is updated.

**How should your application react to the event?**

Your application should update its UI based on the new state. The possible connection state values are `Connected` and `Disconnected`

**Code sample:**
```javascript
callClient.on('connectionStateChanged', (async (connectionStateChangedEvent) => {
    if (connectionStateChangedEvent.newState === "Connected") {
        enableCallControls() // Enable all UI element that allow user to make a call
    }

    if (connectionStateChangedEvent.newState === 'Disconnected') {
        if (typeof connectionStateChangedEvent.reason !== 'undefined') {
            alert(`Disconnected reason: ${connectionStateChangedEvent.reason}`)
        } 
        disableCallControls() // Disable all the UI element that allows the user to make a call
    }
});
```

<!---------- Call object ---------->
## Events on the `Call` object

### Event Name: `stateChanged`

The `stateChanged`  event is fired when the call state changes. For example, when a call goes from `connected` to `disconnected`.

**How should your application react to the event?**

Your application should update its UI accordingly. Disabling or enabling appropriate buttons and other UI elements based on the new call state.

**Code Sample:**

```javascript
call.on('stateChanged', (async (connectionStateChangedEvent) => {
  if(call.state === 'Connected') {
      connectedLabel.hidden = false;
      acceptCallButton.disabled = true;
      startCallButton.disabled = true;
      startVideoButton.disabled = false;
      stopVideoButton.disabled = false
  } else if (call.state === 'Disconnected') {
      connectedLabel.hidden = true;
      startCallButton.disabled = false;
      console.log(`Call ended, call end reason={code=${call.callEndReason.code}, subCode=${call.callEndReason.subCode}}`);
  }
});
```

### Event: `idChanged`

The `idChanged`  event is fired when the ID of a call changes. The ID of a call changes when the call moves from `connecting` state to `connected`. Once the call is connected, the ID of the call remains identical.

**How might your application react to the event?**

Your application should save the new call ID but it can also be retrieved from the call object later when needed.

**Code Sample:**

```javascript
let callId = "";
call.on('idChanged', (async (callIdChangedEvent) => {
  callId = call.id; // You can log it as the call ID is useful for debugging call issues
});
```

### Event: `isMutedChanged`

The `isMutedChanged` event is fired when the local audio is muted or unmuted.

**How might your application react to the event?**

Your application should update the mute / unmute button to the proper state.

**Code Sample:**

```javascript
call.on('isMutedChanged', (async (isMutedChangedEvent) => {
    microphoneButton.disabled = call.isMuted;       
});
```

### Event: `isScreenSharingOnChanged`

The `isScreenSharingOnChanged` event is fired when screen sharing for the local user is enabled or disabled.

**How might your application react to the event?**

Your application should show a preview and/or a warning to the user if the screen sharing became on.
If the screen sharing went off, then the application should remove the preview and warning.

**Code Sample:**

```javascript
call.on('isScreenSharingOnChanged', () => {
  if (!this.call.isScreenSharing) {
      displayStartScreenSharingButton();
      hideScreenSharingWarning()
      removeScreenSharingPreview();    
  } else {
      displayScreenSharingWarning()
      displayStopScreenSharingButton();
      renderScreenSharingPreview(); 
  }
});
```

```javascript
call.on('isLocalVideoStartedChanged', () => {
    showdDisableCameraButton(call.isLocalVideoStarted);
});
```

### Event: `remoteParticipantsUpdated`

        // handleParticipant should
        //   - subscribe to the remote participants events 
        //   - update the UI 
        handleParticipant(participant);
    });
    
    remoteParticipantsUpdatedEvent.removed.forEach(participant => {
        // removeParticipant should
        //   - unsubcribe from the remote participants events 
        //   - update the UI  
        removeParticipant(participant);
    });
});
```

### Event: `localVideoStreamsUpdated`

The `localVideoStreamsUpdated` event is fired when the list of local video stream changes. These changes happen when the user starts or remove a video stream.

**How might your application react to the event?**

Your application should show previews for each of `LocalVideoStream` added. Your application should remove the preview and stop the processing for each `LocalVideoStream` removed.

**Code Sample:**

```javascript
call.on('localVideoStreamsUpdated', (localVideoStreamUpdatedEvent) => {
    localVideoStreamUpdatedEvent.added.forEach(addedLocalVideoStream => { 
        // Add a preview and start any processing if needed
        handleAddedLocalVideoStream(addedLocalVideoStream) 
    });

    localVideoStreamUpdatedEvent.removed.forEach(removedLocalVideoStream => {
