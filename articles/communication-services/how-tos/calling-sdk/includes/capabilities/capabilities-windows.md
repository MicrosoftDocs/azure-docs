Capabilities feature is an extended feature of the core `Call` API and allows you to obtain the capabilities of the local participant in the current call.

The feature allows you to register for an event listener, to listen to capability changes.

In order to use the Capabilities call feature for Windows, the first step is to obtain the Capabilities feature API object:

## Obtaining capabilities feature
```C#
private CapabilitiesCallFeature capabilitiesCallFeature;
capabilitiesCallFeature = call.Features.Capabilities;
```

## Get the capabilities of the local participant
Capabilities object has the capabilities of the local participants and is of type `ParticipantCapability`. Properties of Capabilities include:

- *isAllowed* indicates if a capability can be used.
- *reason* indicates capability resolution reason.

```C#
var capabilities = capabilitiesCallFeature.Capabilities;
```

## Subscribe to `capabilitiesChanged` event
```C#
capabilitiesCallFeature.CapabilitiesChanged += Call__OnCapabilitiesChangedAsync;

private async void Call__OnCapabilitiesChangedAsync(object sender, CapabilitiesChangedEventArgs args)
{
    Trace.WriteLine(args.Reason.ToString());
    foreach (var capability in args.ChangedCapabilities)
    {
        //Prints out capability kind and resolution reason in console
        Trace.WriteLine(capability.Kind.ToString() + " is " + capability.Reason.ToString());
    }
}
```
