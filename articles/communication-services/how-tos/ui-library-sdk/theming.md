# Theme the UI Library in an application

:::image type="content" source="./media/custom-colors.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the experience using custom colors in the UI Library.":::

The Azure Communication Services UI Library is a set of components, icons, and composites that make it easier for you to build high-quality user interfaces for your projects. The UI Library uses components and icons from [Fluent UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui), the cross-platform design system that Microsoft uses. As a result, the components are built with usability, accessibility, and localization in mind.

In this article, you learn how to change the theme for UI Library components as you configure an application.

The UI Library is fully documented for developers on a separate site. The documentation is interactive and helps you understand how the APIs work by giving you the ability to try them directly from a webpage. For more information, see the [UI Library documentation](../../concepts/ui-library/ui-library-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
