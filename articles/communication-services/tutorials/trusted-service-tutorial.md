## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. You can find out more about [cleaning up Azure Communication Service resources](../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources) and [cleaning Azure Function Resources](../../azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-csharp.md#clean-up-resources).
