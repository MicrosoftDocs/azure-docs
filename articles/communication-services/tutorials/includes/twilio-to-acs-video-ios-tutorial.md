## Prerequisites

1. **Azure Account:** Make sure that your Azure account is active. New users can create a free account at [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
2. **Communication Services Resource:** Set up a [Communication Services Resource](../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) via your Azure portal and note your connection string.
3. **Azure CLI:** Follow the instructions to [Install Azure CLI on Windows](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli).
4. **User Access Token:** Generate a user access token to instantiate the call client. You can create one using the Azure CLI as follows:

```console
az communication identity token issue --scope voip --connection-string "yourConnectionString"
```

For more information, see [Use Azure CLI to Create and Manage Access Tokens](../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md?pivots=platform-azcli).

For Video Calling as a Teams user:

- You can also use Teams identity. To generate an access token for a Teams User, see [Manage teams identity](../../quickstarts/manage-teams-identity.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript).
- Obtain the Teams thread ID for call operations using the [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer). For information about creating a thread ID, see [Create chat - Microsoft Graph v1.0 > Example2: Create a group chat](/graph/api/chat-post?preserve-view=true&tabs=javascript&view=graph-rest-1.0#example-2-create-a-group-chat).

## UI Library

The Azure Communication Services UI library, simplifies the process of creating modern communication user interfaces using Azure Communication Services Calling. It offers a collection of ready-to-use UI components that you can easily integrate into your application.

This open source prebuilt set of controls enables you to create aesthetically pleasing designs using Fluent UI SDK components and develop high quality audio/video communication experiences. For more information, check out the Azure Communications Services [UI Library overview](../../concepts/ui-library/ui-library-overview.md?pivots=platform-mobile). The overview includes comprehensive information about both web and mobile platforms.

## Installation

To start the migration from Twilio Video, the first step is to install the Azure Communication Services Calling SDK for iOS to your project. You can configure these parameters using`CocoaPods`.

1. To create a Podfile for your application, open the terminal and navigate to the project folder and run:

 `pod init`

2. Add the following code to the Podfile and save (make sure that "target" matches the name of your project):

```
platform :ios, '13.0' 
use_frameworks! 
  
target 'AzureCommunicationCallingSample' do 
  pod 'AzureCommunicationCalling', '~> 2.6.0' 
end 
```

3. Set up the `.xcworkspace` project

```shell
pod install
```

4. Open the `.xcworkspace` that was created by the pod install with Xcode.

## Authenticating to the SDK

To be able to use the Azure Communication Services Calling SDK, you need to authenticate using an access token.

### Twilio

The following code snippets presume the availability of a valid access token for Twilio Services.

From within the Twilio Video, the access token is used to connect to a room. By passing the token to `ConnectOptions`, you can create the option to create or connect a room.

```swift
let connectOptions = ConnectOptions(token: accessToken) { 
 // Twilio Connect options goes here 
} 
 
let room =   TwilioVideoSDK.connect(
    options: connectOptions, 
    delegate: // The Room Delegate
)
```

### Azure Communication Services

The following code snippets require a valid access token to initiate a `CallClient`.

You need a valid token. For more information, see [Create and Manage Access Tokens](../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md).

```swift
// Create an instance of CallClient 
let callClient = CallClient() 
 
// A reference to the call agent, it will be initialized later 
var callAgent: CallAgent? 
 
// Embed the token in a CommunicationTokenCredential object 
let userCredential = try? CommunicationTokenCredential(token: "<USER_TOKEN>") 
 
// Create a CallAgent that will be used later to initiate or receive calls 
callClient.createCallAgent(userCredential: userCredential) { callAgent, error in 
 if error != nil { 
        // Raise the error to the user and return 
 } 
 self.callAgent = callAgent         
} 
```
### Class reference

| Class Name | Description          |
|-----------|----------------------|
|[CallClient](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acscallclient) | The main class representing the entry point for the Calling SDK.|
|[CommunicationTokenCredential](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-ios/AzureCommunicationCommon/Classes/CommunicationTokenCredential.html)| The Azure Communication Services User token credential|
|[CallAgent](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acscallagent)|The class responsible of managing calls on behalf of the authenticated user |

## Initiating an outgoing call

### Twilio

Twilio Video has a concept of `Room`, where if user Bob wants to have a call with client Alice, Bob can create a room and Alice has to connect to it by implementing a feature like push notification.

#### Connect to a room

When user Bob or user Alice wants to create or connect to a room, and they have a valid access token. They can pass the room name they want to create or connect to as a parameter of `ConnectOptions`.

```swift
let connectOptions = ConnectOptions(token: accessToken) { builder in 
 builder.roomName = "the-room"  
} 
 
room = TwilioVideoSDK.connect(options: connectOptions, delegate: self)
```

### Azure Communication Services

#### Connect to a call

The `CommunicationUserIdentifier` represents a user identity that was created using the [Identity SDK or REST API](../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md). It's the only identifier used if your application doesn't use Microsoft Teams interoperability or Telephony features.

Initiating a call with the Azure Communication Service Calling SDK consists of the following steps:

1. Creating a `StartCallOptions` object
2. Creating an Array of `CommunicationUserIdentifier`
3. Calling `startCall` method on the previously created `CallAgent`

```swift
let startCallOptions = StartCallOptions() // 1 
let callees = [CommunicationUserIdentifier(“<USER_ID>”)] // 2 
 
callAgent?.startCall(participants: callees, options: startCallOptions) { call, error in 
    // Check for error if no Error and the call object isn't nil then the call is being established       
}

```

#### Connect to a Team's call

##### With External Identity

Connecting to a team call is almost the same as connecting to a call. Instead of using `StartCallOptions`, the client application needs to use `JoinCallOptions` together with a `TeamsMeeting locator`.

The Teams meeting link can be retrieved using Graph APIs. You can read more about Graph APIs in the  [Graph documentation](/graph/api/onlinemeeting-createorget?tabs=http&view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

```swift
let joinCallOptions = JoinCallOptions()
let teamsMeetingLinkLocator = TeamsMeetingLinkLocator(meetingLink: meetingLink)
    callAgent?.join(with: teamsMeetingLinkLocator, joinCallOptions: joinCallOptions) { call, error in
    // Handle error or set a CallDelegate delegate on the call if no error
}

```

## Accepting and joining a call

### Twilio

Twilio Video uses the concept of a `Room`. Different clients can establish communication by joining the same room. So accept and join a call is not straight alternative.

### Azure Communication Services

#### Receiving incoming call

To accept calls, the application must first be configured to receive incoming calls.

#### Register for push notifications and handling incoming push notification

A calling client can select to receive push notifications to receive incoming calls. This [guide](/azure/communication-services/how-tos/calling-sdk/push-notifications?pivots=platform-ios#set-up-push-notifications) describes how to set up APNS for the Azure Communication Services Calling.

#### Setting up the `CallAgentDelegate`

The Azure Communication Services Calling SDK has a `CallAgentDelegate` that has a method that is called during an incoming call.

```swift
class ApplicationCallAgentDelegate: NSObject, CallAgentDelegate { 
 
    func callAgent(_ callAgent: CallAgent, didUpdateCalls args: CallsUpdatedEventArgs) {} 
 
    func callAgent(_ callAgent: CallAgent, didReceiveIncomingCall incomingCall: IncomingCall) { 
        // This is called when the application receives an incoming call 
        // An application could use this callback to  display an incoming call banner 
        // or report an incoming call to CallKit 
    } 
} 

```

In order to receive incoming calls, the application needs to add a `CallAgentDelegate` to its `CallAgent`.

```swift
let callAgentDelegate = ApplicationCallAgentDelegate() 
callClient.createCallAgent(userCredential: userCredential) { callAgent, error in 
    if error != nil { 
        // Raise the error to the user and return 
    } 
    self.callAgent = callAgent 
    self.callAgent?.delegate = callAgentDelegate 
} 
```

With the `CallAgentDelegate` in place, and associated with a `CallAgent` instance, the application should be able to receive incoming calls.

#### Accept an incoming call

```swift
func acceptCall(incomingCall: IncomingCall) { 
    let options = AcceptCallOptions() 
    incomingCall.accept(options: options) {(call, error) in 
        if error != nil { 
            // Raise the error to the user and return 
        } 
      // The call is established clients can speak/view each other 
    }
} 
```

|[IncomingCall](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acsincomingcall)| Describes an incoming call |

## Video Stream

### Starting and stopping video

#### Twilio

##### Accessing the camera

With Twilio Video, adding video to a call consists of two steps:

1. Accessing the camera
2. Adding the video track to the list of `LocalVideoTrack`

```swift
let options = CameraSourceOptions { (builder) in
    // Set the CameraSource options here
}
camera = CameraSource(options: options, delegate: aCameraDelegate)
```

##### Creating the LocalVideoTrack

Once the CameraSource is created, it can be associated to a `LocalVideoTrack`.

```swift
localVideoTrack = LocalVideoTrack(source: camera!, enabled: true, name: "Camera")
```

##### Adding the LocalVideoTrack to the call

**At connect time** . When a call connects, you can add the local video track to the call can be achieved by passing the local video track to the `localVideo` track list that can be set with ConnectOptions``.

```swift
let connectOptions = ConnectOptions(token: accessToken) { builder in
     builder.videoTracks =  [localVideoTrack!]
}
```

**In an existing room**. The local participant can publish a local video track via the `publishVideoTrack(_ : LocalVideoTrack)` method.

```swift
room.localParticipant.publishVideoTrack(localVideoTrack)
```

#### Azure Communication Services

##### Accessing the camera

Accessing the camera is done through the `DeviceManager`. Grabbing an instance of the `DeviceManager` can be done with the following code.

```swift
self.callClient.getDeviceManager { (deviceManager, error) in
    if (error != nil) {
       // Display an error message to the user and exit the closure 
       return
    }
    self.deviceManager = deviceManager                 
}
```

##### Creating the `LocalVideoStream`

The `deviceManager` provides access to cameras that can be used to create a `LocalVideoStream` instance.

```swift
LocalVideoStream(camera: deviceManager.cameras.first!)
```

##### Adding the `LocalVideoStream`

**At connect time**

The `localVideoStream` can be added to the streams via the `OutgoingVideoOptions` of the `StartCallOptions`.

```swift
var callOptions = StartCallOptions()
let outgoingVideoOptions = OutgoingVideoOptions()
outgoingVideoOptions.streams = [localVideoStream]
```

**In a call**

A video stream can be started by calling the startVideo method that takes a LocalVideoStream as a parameter.

```swift
call.startVideo(stream: localVideoStream) { error in
    if error != ni {
     // Report the error to the user and return 
    }
}
```

#### Class reference

|Class Name | Description          |
|-----------|----------------------|
|[DeviceManager](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acsdevicemanager#declaration) | Facilitates the interaction with the device |
|[LocalVideoStream](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acslocalvideostream) | Local video stream information |
|[VideoDeviceInfo](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acsvideodeviceinfo) | Information about a video device |
|[Call](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acscall)|Describes a call|

## Rendering video

### Twilio

To render video using Twilio Video, an object conforming to the `VideoRenderer` protocol can be added to `VideoTrack`. The SDK provides a ready to use `VideoRenderer` called `VideoView`, which is a subclass of `UIView`.

```swift
let videoView = VideoView(frame: CGRect.zero, delegate: nil)
```

Once an instance of `VideoView` is created, a `VideoTrack` (local or remote) has a method `addVideoRenderer` that can be used to add the `videoView` created as a renderer.

```swift
localVideoTrack = LocalVideoTrack(source: camera, enabled: true, name: "Camera")
// Add renderer to video track for local preview
localVideoTrack!.addRenderer(videoView)
```

### Azure Communication Services

To render video with Azure Communication Services Calling, create a `VideoStreamRenderer` and pass a `LocalVideoStream` or a `RemoteVideoStream` as parameter.

```swift
 let previewRenderer = try VideoStreamRenderer(localVideoStream: localVideoStream)
```

`VideoStreamRenderer` created can be used to create a `VideoStreamRendererView`, which renders the video stream passed to the `VideoStreamRenderer`.

```swift
let scalingMode = ScalingMode.fit
let options = CreateViewOptions(scalingMode:scalingMode)
let previewView = try previewRenderer.createView(withOptions:options)
```

#### Class reference

|Class Name | Description          |
|-----------|----------------------|
|[ScalingMode](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acsscalingmode) | Enum for local and remote video scaling mode|
|[CreateViewOptions](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acscreateviewoptions) | Options to be passed when rendering a Video |
|[VideoStreamRenderer](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acsvideostreamrenderer) | Renderer for video rendering |
|OutgoingVideoOptions | Documentation isn't available yet |
|[VideoStreamRendererView](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acsvideostreamrendererview)|View used to render video|

## Audio Stream

### Toggling the microphone

#### Twilio

Muting and unmuting of the microphone is done through the `LocalAudioTrack` associated with the microphone.

Muting the microphone

```swift
self.localAudioTrack.isEnabled =  false
```

Unmuting the microphone

```swift
self.localAudioTrack.isEnabled =  true
```

#### Azure Communication Services

Muting and unmuting can be done by calling the `muteOutgoingAudio` and `unmuteoutgoingAudio` on the `Call` object.

Muting the microphone

```swift
'call': call.muteOutgoingAudio() { error in
    if error == nil {
        isMuted = true
    } else {
       // Display an error to the user
    }
}
```

Unmuting the microphone

```swift
callBase.unmuteOutgoingAudio() { error in
    if error == nil {
        isMuted = true
    } else {
       // Display an error to the user
    }
}
```

## Event Listeners

Twilio Video and Azure Communication Services Calling SDKs propose various delegates to listen to call events.

### Room / Call Events

#### Twilio

The `RoomDelegate` allows clients to listen to events related to the room. It has methods that can be called for the following events:

- The client has connected or fails to connect to a room
- The client is reconnecting to the room or has reconnected
- A remote participant as connected, disconnected, reconnected to the room
- The room recording has started or stopped
- The dominant speaker changes

#### Azure Communication Services

The Azure Communication Services Calling SDK enable the `Call` object to incorporate various event listeners, notifying them when a call property changes. Each event type should be subscribed to individually. To learn more about event handling, see the [events tutorial.](../../how-tos/calling-sdk/events.md)

- The call state changed. This is where the connection event is reported
- The list of remote participants has been updated
- The local video stream has been updated
- The mute state changed

### Local Participant Events

#### Twilio

Twilio has a `LocalParticpant` delegate that allows client to receive updates about the following events:

- The local participant has published or failed to be published a media track (audio, video, data)
- The network quality level for the local participant changed

### Azure Communication Services

Azure Communication Services Calling SDK has a `CallAgent` delegate that allows clients to listen to the call agent related event. It's notified when:

- When calls are updated or created, if there's an incoming call or when an existing call is disconnected
- When an incoming call is received

### Remote Participant Events

Both SDKs, propose a remote participant delegate that allows clients to be notified about what is happening with each remote participant.

#### Twilio

The `RemoteParticipantDelegate` handles the following events.

- The remote participant has published or unpublished a media track (video, audio, data)
- The local participant has subscribed, failed to subscribe or unsubscribed to a remote media track (video, audio, data)
- The remote participant network quality changed
- The remote participant changed the priority of a track publication
- The remote participant has switch on/off its video track

#### Azure Communication Services

The `RemoteParticipantDelegate` handles the following events.

- The remote participant state changed
- The remote participant is muted or not muted
- The remote participant is speaking
- The remote participant display name changed
- The remote participant added or removed a video stream

### Camera Events

#### Twilio

Twilio proposes a `CameraSourceDelegate` to notify client about the following events related to the camera:

- The camera source has been interrupted or has been resumed (when you put the app in background for example)
- The camera source failed
- The camera source is reporting system pressure

### Azure Communication Services

Azure Communication Services Calling proposes a `DeviceManagerDelegate`. It consists of a single method that will notify clients when video devices are added or removed on the current `DeviceManager`.

### Class reference

| Class Name | Description          |
|-----------|----------------------|
|[CallDelegate](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acscalldelegate) | A set of methods that are called by calling SDK in response to important events.|
|[CallAgentDelegate](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acscallagentdelegate) | A set of methods that are called by `ACSCallAgent` in response to important events. |
|[RemoteParticipantDelegate](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acsremoteparticipantdelegate) | A set of methods that are called by `ACSRemoteParticipant` in response to important events. |
|[DeviceManagerDelegate](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acsdevicemanagerdelegate)|A set of methods that are called by `ACSDeviceManager` in response to important events.|

## Ending a Call

### Twilio

Ending a call (disconnecting from a room)  is done via the `room.disconnect()` method.

### Azure Communication Services

Hanging up a call is done through the `hangUp` method of the `Call` object.

```swift
call.hangUp(options: HangUpOptions()) { error in
            if error != nil {
                print("ERROR: It was not possible to hang up the call.")
            }
            self.call = nil
 }

```

### Class reference

| Class Name | Description          |
|-----------|----------------------|
|[Call](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acscall) | A set of methods that are called by `ACSCall` in response to important events.|
|[HangUp Options](/objectivec/communication-services/calling/acscallagentdelegate) | A Property bag class for hanging up a call |

## More features from the Azure Communication Services Calling

### Dominant speaker

The first step to register for dominant speaker update is to grab an instance of the dominant speaker feature from the `Call` object.  Learn more about the dominant speaker configuration in [the tutorial.](../../how-tos/calling-sdk/dominant-speaker.md)

```swift
let dominantSpeakersFeature = call.feature(Features.dominantSpeakers)
```

Once an instance of the dominant speakers feature is obtained, a `DominantSpeakersCallFeatureDelegate` can be attached to it.

```swift
dominantSpeakersFeature.delegate = DominantSpeakersDelegate()
public class DominantSpeakersDelegate : DominantSpeakersCallFeatureDelegate {
    public func dominantSpeakersCallFeature(_ dominantSpeakersCallFeature: DominantSpeakersCallFeature, didChangeDominantSpeakers args: PropertyChangedEventArgs) {
        // When the list changes, get the timestamp of the last change and the current list of Dominant Speakers
        let dominantSpeakersInfo = dominantSpeakersCallFeature.dominantSpeakersInfo
        let timestamp = dominantSpeakersInfo.lastUpdatedAt
        let dominantSpeakersList = dominantSpeakersInfo.speakers
    }
}
```

### Media Quality Statistics

To help you understand media quality during the call, Azure Communication Services SDK provides media quality statistics. Use it to examine the low-level audio, video, and screen-sharing quality metrics for incoming and outgoing call metrics.For more information, see the [Media quality statistics](../../concepts/voice-video-calling/media-quality-sdk.md) guide.

### User Facing Diagnostics

Azure Communication Services Calling SDK offers a feature known as **User Facing Diagnostics (UFD)**, allowing clients to scrutinize diverse properties of a call to identify potential issues. To learn more about User Facing Diagnostics, see the [User Facing Diagnostics.](../../concepts/voice-video-calling/user-facing-diagnostics.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some features of the Azure Communication Services Calling SDK described in the list don’t have an equivalent in the Twilio Video SDK.

### Raise Hand

[Raise Hand](../../how-tos/calling-sdk/raise-hand.md?pivots=platform-ios) feature allows participants of a call  raise or lower hands.

### Video Background

Adding [Video Background](../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-video-effects.md?pivots=platform-ios) Allow users blur the background in the video stream.

### Video spotlights

[Spotlights](../../how-tos/calling-sdk/spotlight.md?pivots=platform-ios) Allow users pin and unpin videos.
