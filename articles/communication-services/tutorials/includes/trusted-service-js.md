## Download code

Find the finalized code for this quickstart on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-javascript-quickstarts/tree/main/trusted-authentication-service).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on one of the [supported platforms](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements#_platforms).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), Active LTS and Maintenance LTS versions (10.14.1 recommended). Use the `node --version` command to check your version.
- The [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) for Visual Studio Code.
- An active Communication Services resource and connection string. For more information, see [Quickstart: Create and manage Communication Services resources](../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md).

## Overview

:::image type="content" source="../media/trusted-service-architecture.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows trusted service architecture.":::

For this tutorial, you create a function app that serves as a trusted token provisioning service. You can use this tutorial to bootstrap your own token provisioning service.

This service is responsible for authenticating users to Communication Services. Users of your Communication Services applications require an access token to participate in chat threads and VoIP calls. The function works as a trusted middleman between the user and Communication Services. You can provision access tokens without exposing your resource connection string to your users.

For more information, see the [client-server architecture](../../concepts/identity-model.md#client-server-architecture) and [authentication and authorization](../../concepts/authentication.md) conceptual documentation.

## Set up a function

This section describes the procedures to set up a function.

### Azure Functions setup

Let's first set up the basic structure for the function. For step-by-step instructions for setup, see [Quickstart: Create a C# function in Azure by using Visual Studio Code](../../../azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-csharp.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript).

The function requires the following configuration:

- **Language**: JavaScript
- **Template**: HTTP Trigger
- **Authorization Level**: Anonymous (if you prefer a different authorization model, you can switch it later)
- **Function Name**: User defined

After you follow the instructions in [Quickstart: Create a C# function in Azure by using Visual Studio Code](../../../azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-csharp.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript) with the preceding configuration, you should have a project in Visual Studio Code for the function with an `index.js` file that contains the function itself. The following code inside of the file should be:

```javascript

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');

    const name = (req.query.name || (req.body && req.body.name));
    const responseMessage = name
        ? "Hello, " + name + ". This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."
        : "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.";

    context.res = {
        // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
        body: responseMessage
    };
}

```

The next step is to install Communication Services libraries.

### Install Communication Services libraries

You use the `Identity` library to generate user access tokens.

Use the `npm install` command to install the Communication Services Identity SDK for JavaScript.

```console

npm install @azure/communication-identity --save

```

The `--save` option lists the library as a dependency in your *package.json* file.

At the top of the `index.js` file, import the interface for the `CommunicationIdentityClient` parameter.

```javascript
const { CommunicationIdentityClient } = require('@azure/communication-identity');
```

## Generate access tokens

To allow your function to generate user access tokens, you first need to use the connection string for your Communication Services resource.

For more information on how to retrieve your connection string, see [Quickstart: Create and manage Communication Services resources](../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md).

``` javascript
const connectionString = 'INSERT YOUR RESOURCE CONNECTION STRING'
```

Next, you modify your original function to generate user access tokens.

To generate user access tokens, use the `createUser` method to create a user. After the user is created, use the `getToken` method to generate a token for that user, which the function returns.

For this example, you configure the token scope to `voip`. Other scopes might be necessary for your application. To learn more about scopes, see [Create and manage access tokens](../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md).

```javascript
module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    let tokenClient = new CommunicationIdentityClient(connectionString);

    const user = await tokenClient.createUser();

    const userToken = await tokenClient.getToken(user, ["voip"]);

    context.res = {
        body: userToken
    };
}
```

For the existing Communication Services `CommunicationUser` parameter, you can skip the creation step and generate an access token. For more information, see [Create and manage access tokens](../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md).

## Test the function

Run the function locally by using `F5`. This action initializes the function locally and makes it accessible through `http://localhost:7071/api/FUNCTION_NAME`. For more information on running locally, see [Quickstart: Create a C# function in Azure by using Visual Studio Code](../../../azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-csharp.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript#run-the-function-locally).

Open the URL on your browser and you see a response body with the Communication User ID, the token, and the expiration for the token.

## Deploy the function to Azure

To deploy your function, follow the step-by-step instructions in [Quickstart: Create a C# function in Azure by using Visual Studio Code](../../../azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-csharp.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript#sign-in-to-azure).

In summary, you need to:

1. Sign in to Azure from Visual Studio.
1. Publish your project to your Azure account. Here you need to choose an existing subscription.
1. Create a new function resource by using the Visual Studio wizard or an existing resource. For a new resource, you need to configure it to your desired region, runtime, and unique identifier.
1. Wait for deployment to finalize.
1. Run the function.

## Run the function

Run the function by using the URL `http://<function-appn-ame>.azurewebsites.net/api/<function-name>`.

To find the URL, right-click the function in Visual Studio Code and copy the function URL.

For more information on how to run your function, see [Quickstart: Create a C# function in Azure by using Visual Studio Code](../../../azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-csharp.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript#run-the-function-in-azure).
