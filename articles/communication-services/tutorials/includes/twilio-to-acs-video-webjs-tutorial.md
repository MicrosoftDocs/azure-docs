## Prerequisites

1.  **Azure Account:** Make sure that your Azure account is active. New users can create a free account at [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
2.  **Node.js 18:** Ensure Node.js 18 is installed on your system. Download from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
3.  **Communication Services Resource:** Set up a [Communication Services Resource](../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) via your Azure portal and note your connection string.
4.  **Azure CLI:** Follow the instructions to [Install Azure CLI on Windows](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli)..
5.  **User Access Token:** Generate a user access token to instantiate the call client. You can create one using the Azure CLI as follows:
```console
az communication identity token issue --scope voip --connection-string "yourConnectionString"
```

For more information, see [Use Azure CLI to Create and Manage Access Tokens](../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md?pivots=platform-azcli).

For Video Calling as a Teams user:

-   You can also use Teams identity. To generate an access token for a Teams User, see [Manage teams identity](../../quickstarts/manage-teams-identity.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript).
-   Obtain the Teams thread ID for call operations using the [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer). For information about creating a thread ID, see [Create chat - Microsoft Graph v1.0 > Example2: Create a group chat](/graph/api/chat-post?preserve-view=true&tabs=javascript&view=graph-rest-1.0#example-2-create-a-group-chat).

## UI library

The Azure Communication Services UI library simplifies the process of creating modern communication user interfaces using Azure Communication Services. It offers a collection of ready-to-use UI components that you can easily integrate into your application.

This open source prebuilt set of controls enables you to create aesthetically pleasing designs using [Fluent UI SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/) components and develop high quality audio/video communication experiences. For more information, check out the [Azure Communications Services UI Library overview](../../concepts/ui-library/ui-library-overview.md). The overview includes comprehensive information about both web and mobile platforms.

## Object Model

The following classes and interfaces handle some of the main features of the Azure Communication Services Calling SDK:

| **Name**                          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CallClient                        | The main entry point to the Calling SDK.                                                                                                                                               |
| AzureCommunicationTokenCredential | Implements the `CommunicationTokenCredential` interface, which is used to instantiate the CallAgent.                                                                                     |
| CallAgent                         | Start and manage calls.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Device Manager                    | Manage media devices.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Call                              | Represents a Call.                                                                                                                                                          |
| LocalVideoStream                  | Create a local video stream for a camera device on the local system.                                                                                                        |
| RemoteParticipant                 | Represents a remote participant in the Call.                                                                                                                                |
| RemoteVideoStream                 | Represents a remote video stream from a Remote Participant.                                                                                                                 |
| LocalAudioStream                  | Represents a local audio stream for a local microphone device.                                                                                                                          |
| AudioOptions                      | Audio options, provided to a participant when making an outgoing call or joining a group call.                                                                                                  |
| AudioIssue                        | Represents the end of call survey audio issues. Example responses might be `NoLocalAudio` - the other participants were unable to hear me, or `LowVolume` - the call audio volume was too low. |

When using ACS calling in a Teams call, there are a few differences:

-   Instead of `CallAgent` - use `TeamsCallAgent` for starting and managing Teams calls.
-   Instead of `Call` - use `TeamsCall` for representing a Teams Call.

## Initialize the Calling SDK (CallClient/CallAgent)

Using the `CallClient`, initialize a `CallAgent` instance. The `createCallAgent` method uses CommunicationTokenCredential as an argument. It accepts a [user access token](../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md?tabs=windows&pivots=programming-language-javascript).

### Device manager

#### Twilio

Twilio doesn't have a Device Manager analog. Tracks are created using the system’s default device. To customize a device, obtain the desired source track via:
```javascript
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()
```

And pass it to the track creation method.

#### Azure Communication Services
```javascript
const { CallClient } = require('@azure/communication-calling');  
const { AzureCommunicationTokenCredential} = require('@azure/communication-common'); 

const userToken = '<USER_TOKEN>';  
const tokenCredential = new AzureCommunicationTokenCredential(userToken); 

callClient = new CallClient(); 
const callAgent = await callClient.createCallAgent(tokenCredential, {displayName: 'optional user name'});
```

You can use the `getDeviceManager` method on the `CallClient` instance to access `deviceManager`.

const deviceManager = await callClient.getDeviceManager(); 
```javascript
// Get a list of available video devices for use.  
const localCameras = await deviceManager.getCameras(); 

// Get a list of available microphone devices for use.  
const localMicrophones = await deviceManager.getMicrophones();  

// Get a list of available speaker devices for use.  
const localSpeakers = await deviceManager.getSpeakers();
```

### Get device permissions

#### Twilio

Twilio Video asks for device permissions on track creation.

#### Azure Communication Services

Prompt a user to grant camera and/or microphone permissions:
```javascript
const result = await deviceManager.askDevicePermission({audio: true, video: true});
```

The output returns with an object that indicates whether audio and video permissions were granted:
```javascript
console.log(result.audio);  console.log(result.video);
```

## Starting a call

### Twilio

```javascript
import * as TwilioVideo from 'twilio-video';

const twilioVideo = TwilioVideo; 
let twilioRoom; 

twilioRoom = await twilioVideo.connect('token', { name: 'roomName', audio: false, video: false });
```

### Azure Communication Services

To create and start a call, use one of the `callAgent` APIs and provide a user that you created through the Communication Services identity SDK.

Call creation and start are synchronous. The `call` instance enables you to subscribe to call events. Subscribe to the `stateChanged` event for value changes.
```javascript
call.on('stateChanged', async () =\> {  console.log(\`Call state changed: \${call.state}\`) });
```

#### 1:1 Call

To call another Azure Communication Services user, use the `startCall` method on `callAgent` and pass the recipient's `CommunicationUserIdentifier` that you [created with the Communication Services administration library](../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md).
```javascript
const userCallee = { communicationUserId: '\<Azure_Communication_Services_USER_ID\>' };
const oneToOneCall = callAgent.startCall([userCallee]);
```

#### Rooms Call

To join a `Room` call, you can instantiate a context object with the `roomId` property as the room identifier. To join the call, use the `join` method and pass the context instance.
```javascript
const context = { roomId: '\<RoomId\>' };
const call = callAgent.join(context);
```
A **Room** offers application developers better control over who can join a call, when they meet and how they collaborate. To learn more about **Rooms**, see the [Rooms overview](../../concepts/rooms/room-concept.md), or see [Quickstart: Join a room call](../../quickstarts/rooms/join-rooms-call.md).

#### Group Call

To start a new group call or join an ongoing group call, use the `join` method and pass an object with a `groupId` property. The `groupId` value must be a GUID.
```javascript
const context = { groupId: '\<GUID\>'};
const call = callAgent.join(context);
```

#### Teams call

Start a synchronous one-to-one or group call using the `startCall` API on `teamsCallAgent`. You can provide `MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier` or `PhoneNumberIdentifier` as a parameter to define the target of the call. The method returns the `TeamsCall` instance that allows you to subscribe to call events.
```javascript
const userCallee = { microsoftTeamsUserId: '\<MICROSOFT_TEAMS_USER_ID\>' };
const oneToOneCall = teamsCallAgent.startCall(userCallee);
```

## Accepting and joining a call

### Twilio

When using Twilio Video SDK, the Participant is created after joining the room; and it doesn't have any information about other rooms.

### Azure Communication Services

Azure Communication Services has the `CallAgent` instance, which emits an `incomingCall` event when the logged-in identity receives an incoming call.
```javascript
callAgent.on('incomingCall', async (call) =\>{
    // Incoming call
    });
```

The `incomingCall` event includes an `incomingCall` instance that you can accept or reject.

When starting, joining, or accepting a call with *video on*, if the specified video camera device is being used by another process or if the camera is disabled in the system, the call starts with *video off*, and returns a `cameraStartFailed: true` call diagnostic.

```javascript
const incomingCallHandler = async (args: { incomingCall: IncomingCall }) => {  
  const incomingCall = args.incomingCall;  

  // Get incoming call ID  
  var incomingCallId = incomingCall.id  

  // Get information about this Call.  
  var callInfo = incomingCall.info;  

  // Get information about caller  
  var callerInfo = incomingCall.callerInfo  
    
  // Accept the call  
  var call = await incomingCall.accept();  

  // Reject the call  
  incomingCall.reject();  

  // Subscribe to callEnded event and get the call end reason  
  incomingCall.on('callEnded', args =>  
  	{ console.log(args.callEndReason);  
  });  

  // callEndReason is also a property of IncomingCall  
  var callEndReason = incomingCall.callEndReason;  
};  

callAgentInstance.on('incomingCall', incomingCallHandler);

```

After starting a call, joining a call, or accepting a call, you can also use the `callAgent` `callsUpdated` event to be notified of the new `Call` object and start subscribing to it.
```javascript
callAgent.on('callsUpdated', (event) => { 
  event.added.forEach((call) => { 
    // User joined call 
  }); 
  
  event.removed.forEach((call) => { 
    // User left call 
  }); 
});
```

For Azure Communication Services Teams implementation, see how to [Receive a Teams Incoming Call](../../how-tos/cte-calling-sdk/manage-calls.md#receive-a-teams-incoming-call).

## Adding and removing participants to a call

### Twilio

Participants can't be added or removed from Twilio Room, they need to join the Room or disconnect from it themselves.

Local Participant in Twilio Room can be accessed this way:
```javascript
let localParticipant = twilioRoom.localParticipant;
```

Remote Participants in Twilio Room are represented with a map that has unique Participant SID as a key:
```javascript
twilioRoom.participants;
```

### Azure Communication Services

All remote participants are represented by `RemoteParticipant` type and available through `remoteParticipants` collection on a call instance.

The `remoteParticipants` collection returns a list of remote participants in a call:
```javascript
call.remoteParticipants; // [remoteParticipant, remoteParticipant....]
```

**Add participant:**

To add a participant to a call, you can use `addParticipant`. Provide one of the Identifier types. It synchronously returns the `remoteParticipant` instance.

The `remoteParticipantsUpdated` event from Call is raised when a participant is successfully added to the call.
```javascript
const userIdentifier = { communicationUserId: '<Azure_Communication_Services_USER_ID>' }; 
const remoteParticipant = call.addParticipant(userIdentifier);
```

**Remove participant:**

To remove a participant from a call, use `removeParticipant`. You need to pass one of the Identifier types. This method resolves asynchronously after the participant is removed from the call. The participant is also removed from the `remoteParticipants` collection.
```javascript
const userIdentifier = { communicationUserId: '<Azure_Communication_Services_USER_ID>' }; 
await call.removeParticipant(userIdentifier);

```

Subscribe to the call's `remoteParticipantsUpdated` event to be notified when new participants are added to the call or removed from the call.

```javascript
call.on('remoteParticipantsUpdated', e => {
    e.added.forEach(remoteParticipant => {
        // Subscribe to new remote participants that are added to the call
    });
 
    e.removed.forEach(remoteParticipant => {
        // Unsubscribe from participants that are removed from the call
    })

});
```

Subscribe to remote participant's `stateChanged` event for value changes.
```javascript
remoteParticipant.on('stateChanged', () => {
    console.log(`Remote participants state changed: ${remoteParticipant.state}`)
});
```

## Video calling

## Starting and stopping video

### Twilio

```javascript
const videoTrack = await twilioVideo.createLocalVideoTrack({ constraints }); 
const videoTrackPublication = await localParticipant.publishTrack(videoTrack, { options });
```

The camera is enabled by default. It can be disabled and enabled back if necessary:
```javascript
videoTrack.disable();
```
Or:
```javascript
videoTrack.enable();
```

If there's a later created video track, attach it locally:

```javascript
const videoElement = videoTrack.attach();
const localVideoContainer = document.getElementById( localVideoContainerId );
localVideoContainer.appendChild(videoElement);
```

Twilio Tracks rely on default input devices and reflect the changes in defaults. To change an input device, you need to unpublish the previous Video Track:

```javascript
localParticipant.unpublishTrack(videoTrack);
```

Then create a new Video Track with the correct constraints.

### Azure Communication Services
To start a video while on a call, you need to enumerate cameras using the `getCameras` method on the `deviceManager` object. Then create a new instance of `LocalVideoStream` with the desired camera and pass the `LocalVideoStream` object into the `startVideo` method of an existing call object:

```javascript
const deviceManager = await callClient.getDeviceManager();
const cameras = await deviceManager.getCameras();
const camera = cameras[0]
const localVideoStream = new LocalVideoStream(camera);
await call.startVideo(localVideoStream);
```

After you successfully start sending video, a `LocalVideoStream` instance of type Video is added to the `localVideoStreams` collection on a call instance.
```javascript
const localVideoStream = call.localVideoStreams.find( (stream) =\> { return stream.mediaStreamType === 'Video'} );
```

To stop local video while on a call, pass the `localVideoStream` instance that's being used for video:
```javascript
await call.stopVideo(localVideoStream);
```

You can switch to a different camera device while a video is sending by calling `switchSource` on a `localVideoStream` instance:

```javascript
const cameras = await callClient.getDeviceManager().getCameras();
const camera = cameras[1];
localVideoStream.switchSource(camera);
```

If the specified video device is being used by another process, or if it's disabled in the system:

-   While in a call, if your video is off and you start video using `call.startVideo()`, this method returns a `SourceUnavailableError` and `cameraStartFailed` are set to true.
-   A call to the `localVideoStream.switchSource()` method causes `cameraStartFailed` to be set to true. See the [Call Diagnostics guide](../../concepts/voice-video-calling/call-diagnostics.md) for more information about how to diagnose call-related issues.

To verify whether the local video is *on* or *off* you can use the `isLocalVideoStarted` API, which returns true or false:
```javascript
call.isLocalVideoStarted;
```

To listen for changes to the local video, you can subscribe and unsubscribe to the `isLocalVideoStartedChanged` event:

```javascript
// Subscribe to local video event
call.on('isLocalVideoStartedChanged', () => {
    // Callback();
});
// Unsubscribe from local video event
call.off('isLocalVideoStartedChanged', () => {
    // Callback();
});

```

### Rendering a remote user's video

#### Twilio

As soon as a Remote Participant publishes a Video Track, it needs to be attached. The `trackSubscribed` event on Room or Remote Participant enables you to detect when the track can be attached:

```javascript
twilioRoom.on('participantConnected', (participant) => {
 participant.on('trackSubscribed', (track) => {
   const remoteVideoElement = track.attach();
   const remoteVideoContainer = document.getElementById(remoteVideoContainerId + participant.identity);
   remoteVideoContainer.appendChild(remoteVideoElement);
 });
});
```

Or

```javascript
twilioRoom..on('trackSubscribed', (track, publication, participant) => {
   const remoteVideoElement = track.attach();
   const remoteVideoContainer = document.getElementById(remoteVideoContainerId + participant.identity);
   remoteVideoContainer.appendChild(remoteVideoElement);
 });
});
```

#### Azure Communication Services

To list the video streams and screen sharing streams of remote participants, inspect the `videoStreams` collections:
```javascript
const remoteVideoStream: RemoteVideoStream = call.remoteParticipants[0].videoStreams[0];
const streamType: MediaStreamType = remoteVideoStream.mediaStreamType;
```

To render `RemoteVideoStream`, you need to subscribe to its `isAvailableChanged` event. If the `isAvailable` property changes to true, a remote participant is sending a stream. After that happens, create a new instance of `VideoStreamRenderer`, and then create a new `VideoStreamRendererView` instance by using the asynchronous `createView` method. You can then attach `view.target` to any UI element.

Whenever availability of a remote stream changes, you can destroy the whole `VideoStreamRenderer` or a specific `VideoStreamRendererView`. If you do decide to keep them, it displays a blank video frame.

```javascript
// Reference to the html's div where we would display a grid of all remote video streams from all participants.
let remoteVideosGallery = document.getElementById('remoteVideosGallery');

subscribeToRemoteVideoStream = async (remoteVideoStream) => {
   let renderer = new VideoStreamRenderer(remoteVideoStream);
    let view;
    let remoteVideoContainer = document.createElement('div');
    remoteVideoContainer.className = 'remote-video-container';

    let loadingSpinner = document.createElement('div');
    // See the css example below for styling the loading spinner.
    loadingSpinner.className = 'loading-spinner';
    remoteVideoStream.on('isReceivingChanged', () => {
        try {
            if (remoteVideoStream.isAvailable) {
                const isReceiving = remoteVideoStream.isReceiving;
                const isLoadingSpinnerActive = remoteVideoContainer.contains(loadingSpinner);
                if (!isReceiving && !isLoadingSpinnerActive) {
                    remoteVideoContainer.appendChild(loadingSpinner);
                } else if (isReceiving && isLoadingSpinnerActive) {
                    remoteVideoContainer.removeChild(loadingSpinner);
                }
            }
        } catch (e) {
            console.error(e);
        }
    });

    const createView = async () => {
        // Create a renderer view for the remote video stream.
        view = await renderer.createView();
        // Attach the renderer view to the UI.
        remoteVideoContainer.appendChild(view.target);
        remoteVideosGallery.appendChild(remoteVideoContainer);
    }

    // Remote participant has switched video on/off
    remoteVideoStream.on('isAvailableChanged', async () => {
        try {
            if (remoteVideoStream.isAvailable) {
                await createView();
            } else {
                view.dispose();
                remoteVideosGallery.removeChild(remoteVideoContainer);
            }
        } catch (e) {
            console.error(e);
        }
    });

    // Remote participant has video on initially.
    if (remoteVideoStream.isAvailable) {
        try {
            await createView();
        } catch (e) {
            console.error(e);
        }
    }
    
    console.log(`Initial stream size: height: ${remoteVideoStream.size.height}, width: ${remoteVideoStream.size.width}`);
    remoteVideoStream.on('sizeChanged', () => {
        console.log(`Remote video stream size changed: new height: ${remoteVideoStream.size.height}, new width: ${remoteVideoStream.size.width}`);
    });
}
```

Subscribe to the remote participant's `videoStreamsUpdated` event to be notified when the remote participant adds new video streams and removes video streams.

```javascript
remoteParticipant.on('videoStreamsUpdated', e => {
    e.added.forEach(remoteVideoStream => {
        // Subscribe to new remote participant's video streams
    });

    e.removed.forEach(remoteVideoStream => {
        // Unsubscribe from remote participant's video streams
    });
});
```

### Virtual background

#### Twilio

To use Virtual Background, install Twilio helper library:
```console
npm install @twilio/video-processors
```

Create and load a new `Processor` instance:

```javascript
import { GaussianBlurBackgroundProcessor } from '@twilio/video-processors';

const blurProcessor = new GaussianBlurBackgroundProcessor({ assetsPath: virtualBackgroundAssets });

await blurProcessor.loadModel();
```

As soon as the model is loaded, you can add the background to the video track using the `addProcessor` method:
```javascript
videoTrack.addProcessor(processor, {  inputFrameBufferType: 'video',  outputFrameBufferContextType: 'webgl2' });
```

#### Azure Communication Services

Use the npm install command to install the [Azure Communication Services Effects SDK](../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-video-effects.md?pivots=platform-web) for JavaScript.
```console
npm install @azure/communication-calling-effects --save
```

> [!NOTE]
> To use video effects with the Azure Communication Calling SDK, once you've created a LocalVideoStream, you need to get the VideoEffects feature API of the LocalVideoStream to start/stop video effects:

```javascript
import * as AzureCommunicationCallingSDK from '@azure/communication-calling'; 

import { BackgroundBlurEffect, BackgroundReplacementEffect } from '@azure/communication-calling-effects'; 

// Get the video effects feature API on the LocalVideoStream 
// (here, localVideoStream is the LocalVideoStream object you created while setting up video calling)
const videoEffectsFeatureApi = localVideoStream.feature(AzureCommunicationCallingSDK.Features.VideoEffects); 

// Subscribe to useful events 
videoEffectsFeatureApi.on(‘effectsStarted’, () => { 
    // Effects started
});

videoEffectsFeatureApi.on(‘effectsStopped’, () => { 
    // Effects stopped
}); 

videoEffectsFeatureApi.on(‘effectsError’, (error) => { 
    // Effects error
});
```

To blur the background:

```javascript
// Create the effect instance 
const backgroundBlurEffect = new BackgroundBlurEffect(); 

// Recommended: Check support 
const backgroundBlurSupported = await backgroundBlurEffect.isSupported(); 

if (backgroundBlurSupported) { 
    // Use the video effects feature API we created to start effects
    await videoEffectsFeatureApi.startEffects(backgroundBlurEffect); 
}
```

To use a custom background replacement with an image you need to provide the URL of the image you want as the background to this effect. Supported image formats are: PNG, JPG, JPEG, TIFF, and BMP. The supported aspect ratio is 16:9.

```javascript
const backgroundImage = 'https://linkToImageFile'; 

// Create the effect instance 
const backgroundReplacementEffect = new BackgroundReplacementEffect({ 
    backgroundImageUrl: backgroundImage
}); 

// Recommended: Check support
const backgroundReplacementSupported = await backgroundReplacementEffect.isSupported(); 

if (backgroundReplacementSupported) { 
    // Use the video effects feature API as before to start/stop effects 
    await videoEffectsFeatureApi.startEffects(backgroundReplacementEffect); 
}
```

Change the image for this effect by passing it via the configured method:
```javascript
const newBackgroundImage = 'https://linkToNewImageFile'; 

await backgroundReplacementEffect.configure({ 
    backgroundImageUrl: newBackgroundImage
});
```

To switch effects, use the same method on the video effects feature API:

```javascript
// Switch to background blur 
await videoEffectsFeatureApi.startEffects(backgroundBlurEffect); 

// Switch to background replacement 
await videoEffectsFeatureApi.startEffects(backgroundReplacementEffect);
```

At any time, if you want to check which effects are active, use the `activeEffects` property. The `activeEffects` property returns an array with the names of the currently active effects and returns an empty array if there are no effects active.
```javascript
// Using the video effects feature api
const currentActiveEffects = videoEffectsFeatureApi.activeEffects;
```

To stop effects:
```javascript
await videoEffectsFeatureApi.stopEffects();
```


## Audio

### Starting and stopping audio

#### Twilio

```javascript
const audioTrack = await twilioVideo.createLocalAudioTrack({ constraints });
const audioTrackPublication = await localParticipant.publishTrack(audioTrack, { options });
```

The microphone is enabled by default. You can disable and enable it back as needed:
```javascript
audioTrack.disable();
```

Or
```javascript
audioTrack.enable();
```

Any created Audio Track should be attached by Local Participant the same way as Video Track:

```javascript
const audioElement = audioTrack.attach();
const localAudioContainer = document.getElementById(localAudioContainerId);
localAudioContainer.appendChild(audioElement);
```

And by Remote Participant:

```javascript
twilioRoom.on('participantConnected', (participant) => {
 participant.on('trackSubscribed', (track) => {
   const remoteAudioElement = track.attach();
   const remoteAudioContainer = document.getElementById(remoteAudioContainerId + participant.identity);
   remoteAudioContainer.appendChild(remoteAudioElement);
 });
});
```

Or:

```javascript
twilioRoom..on('trackSubscribed', (track, publication, participant) => {
   const remoteAudioElement = track.attach();
   const remoteAudioContainer = document.getElementById(remoteAudioContainerId + participant.identity);
   remoteVideoContainer.appendChild(remoteAudioElement);
 });
});

```

It isn't possible to mute incoming audio in Twilio Video SDK.

#### Azure Communication Services

```javascript
await call.startAudio();
```

To mute or unmute the local endpoint, you can use the mute and unmute asynchronous APIs:

```javascript
//mute local device (microphone / sent audio)
await call.mute();

//unmute local device (microphone / sent audio)
await call.unmute();
```

Mute incoming audio sets the call volume to 0. To mute or unmute the incoming audio, use the `muteIncomingAudio` and `unmuteIncomingAudio` asynchronous APIs:

```javascript
//mute local device (speaker)
await call.muteIncomingAudio();

//unmute local device (speaker)
await call.unmuteIncomingAudio();

```

### Detecting dominant speaker

#### Twilio

To detect the loudest Participant in the Room, use the Dominant Speaker API. You can enable it in the connection options when joining the Group Room with at least 2 participants:
```javascript
twilioRoom = await twilioVideo.connect('token', { 
name: 'roomName', 
audio: false, 
video: false,
dominantSpeaker: true
}); 
```

When the loudest speaker in the Room changes, the `dominantSpeakerChanged` event is emitted:

```javascript
twilioRoom.on('dominantSpeakerChanged', (participant) => {
    // Highlighting the loudest speaker
});
```

#### Azure Communication Services

Dominant speakers for a call are an extended feature of the core Call API. It enables you to obtain a list of the active speakers in the call. The list of dominant speakers is a ranked list, where the first element in the list represents the last active speaker on the call and so on.

In order to obtain the dominant speakers in a call, you first need to obtain the call dominant speakers feature API object:
```javascript
const callDominantSpeakersApi = call.feature(Features.CallDominantSpeakers);
```

Next you can obtain the list of the dominant speakers by calling `dominantSpeakers`. This has a type of `DominantSpeakersInfo`, which has the following members:

-   `speakersList` contains the list of the ranked dominant speakers in the call. These are represented by their participant ID.
-   `timestamp` is the latest update time for the dominant speakers in the call.
```javascript
let dominantSpeakers: DominantSpeakersInfo = callDominantSpeakersApi.dominantSpeakers;
```

You can also subscribe to the `dominantSpeakersChanged` event to know when the dominant speakers list changes.


```javascript
const dominantSpeakersChangedHandler = () => {
    // Get the most up-to-date list of dominant speakers
    let dominantSpeakers = callDominantSpeakersApi.dominantSpeakers;
};
callDominantSpeakersApi.on('dominantSpeakersChanged', dominantSpeakersChangedHandler);

```

## Enabling screen sharing
### Twilio

To share the screen in Twilio Video, obtain the source track via `navigator.mediaDevices`:

Chromium-based browsers:
```javascript
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia({
   audio: false,
   video: true
 });
const track = stream.getTracks()[0];
```

Firefox and Safari:
```javascript
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ mediaSource: 'screen' });
const track = stream.getTracks()[0];
```

Obtain the screen share track, then you can publish and manage it the same way as the casual Video Track (see the “Video” section).

### Azure Communication Services

To start screen sharing while on a call, you can use the asynchronous API `startScreenSharing`:
```javascript
await call.startScreenSharing();
```

After successfully starting to sending screen sharing, a `LocalVideoStream` instance of type `ScreenSharing` is created and added to the `localVideoStreams` collection on the call instance.

```javascript
const localVideoStream = call.localVideoStreams.find( (stream) => { return stream.mediaStreamType === 'ScreenSharing'} );
```

To stop screen sharing while on a call, you can use the asynchronous API `stopScreenSharing`:
```javascript
await call.stopScreenSharing();
```

To verify whether screen sharing is on or off, you can use `isScreenSharingOn` API, which returns true or false:
```javascript
call.isScreenSharingOn;
```

To listen for changes to the screen share, subscribe and unsubscribe to the `isScreenSharingOnChanged` event:

```javascript
// Subscribe to screen share event
call.on('isScreenSharingOnChanged', () => {
    // Callback();
});
// Unsubscribe from screen share event
call.off('isScreenSharingOnChanged', () => {
    // Callback();
});

```

## Media quality statistics

### Twilio

To collect real-time media stats, use the `getStats`` method.
```javascript
const stats = twilioRoom.getStats();
```

### Azure Communication Services

Media quality statistics is an extended feature of the core Call API. You first need to obtain the `mediaStatsFeature` API object:

```javascript
const mediaStatsFeature = call.feature(Features.MediaStats);
```


To receive the media statistics data, you can subscribe `sampleReported` event or `summaryReported` event:

- `sampleReported` event triggers every second. Suitable as a data source for UI display or your own data pipeline.
- `summaryReported` event contains the aggregated values of the data over intervals. Useful when you just need a summary.

If you want control over the interval of the `summaryReported` event, you need to define `mediaStatsCollectorOptions` of type `MediaStatsCollectorOptions`. Otherwise, the SDK uses default values.
```javascript
const mediaStatsCollectorOptions: SDK.MediaStatsCollectorOptions = {
    aggregationInterval: 10,
    dataPointsPerAggregation: 6
};

const mediaStatsCollector = mediaStatsFeature.createCollector(mediaStatsSubscriptionOptions);

mediaStatsCollector.on('sampleReported', (sample) => {
    console.log('media stats sample', sample);
});

mediaStatsCollector.on('summaryReported', (summary) => {
    console.log('media stats summary', summary);
});
```

If you don't need to use the media statistics collector, you can call the dispose method of `mediaStatsCollector`.

```javascript
mediaStatsCollector.dispose();
```


You don't need to call the dispose method of `mediaStatsCollector` every time a call ends. The collectors are reclaimed internally when the call ends.

For more information, see [Media quality statistics](../../concepts/voice-video-calling/media-quality-sdk.md?pivots=platform-web).

## Diagnostics

### Twilio

To test connectivity, Twilio offers Preflight API. This is a test call performed to identify signaling and media connectivity issues.

An access token is required to launch the test:

```javascript
const preflightTest = twilioVideo.runPreflight(token);

// Emits when particular call step completes
preflightTest.on('progress', (progress) => {
  console.log(`Preflight progress: ${progress}`);
});

// Emits if the test has failed and returns error and partial test results
preflightTest.on('failed', (error, report) => {
  console.error(`Preflight error: ${error}`);
  console.log(`Partial preflight test report: ${report}`);
});

// Emits when the test has been completed successfully and returns the report
preflightTest.on('completed', (report) => {
  console.log(`Preflight test report: ${report}`);
});
```

Another way to identify network issues during the call is by using the Network Quality API, which monitors a Participant's network and provides quality metrics. You can enable it in the connection options when a participant joins the Group Room:

```javascript
twilioRoom = await twilioVideo.connect('token', { 
    name: 'roomName', 
    audio: false, 
    video: false,
    networkQuality: {
        local: 3, // Local Participant's Network Quality verbosity
        remote: 1 // Remote Participants' Network Quality verbosity
    }
});
```

When the network quality for Participant changes, it generates a `networkQualityLevelChanged` event:
```javascript
participant.on(networkQualityLevelChanged, (networkQualityLevel, networkQualityStats)  => {
    // Processing Network Quality stats
});
```

### Azure Communication Services
Azure Communication Services provides a feature called `"User Facing Diagnostics" (UFD)` that you can use to examine various properties of a call to identify the issue. User Facing Diagnostics events could be caused by some underlying issue (poor network, the user has their microphone muted) that could cause a user to have a poor call experience.

User-facing diagnostics is an extended feature of the core Call API and enables you to diagnose an active call.
```javascript
const userFacingDiagnostics = call.feature(Features.UserFacingDiagnostics);
```

Subscribe to the `diagnosticChanged`` event to monitor when any user-facing diagnostic changes:
```javascript
/**
 *  Each diagnostic has the following data:
 * - diagnostic is the type of diagnostic, e.g. NetworkSendQuality, DeviceSpeakWhileMuted
 * - value is DiagnosticQuality or DiagnosticFlag:
 *     - DiagnosticQuality = enum { Good = 1, Poor = 2, Bad = 3 }.
 *     - DiagnosticFlag = true | false.
 * - valueType = 'DiagnosticQuality' | 'DiagnosticFlag'
 */
const diagnosticChangedListener = (diagnosticInfo: NetworkDiagnosticChangedEventArgs | MediaDiagnosticChangedEventArgs) => {
    console.log(`Diagnostic changed: ` +
        `Diagnostic: ${diagnosticInfo.diagnostic}` +
        `Value: ${diagnosticInfo.value}` +
        `Value type: ${diagnosticInfo.valueType}`);

    if (diagnosticInfo.valueType === 'DiagnosticQuality') {
        if (diagnosticInfo.value === DiagnosticQuality.Bad) {
            console.error(`${diagnosticInfo.diagnostic} is bad quality`);

        } else if (diagnosticInfo.value === DiagnosticQuality.Poor) {
            console.error(`${diagnosticInfo.diagnostic} is poor quality`);
        }

    } else if (diagnosticInfo.valueType === 'DiagnosticFlag') {
        if (diagnosticInfo.value === true) {
            console.error(`${diagnosticInfo.diagnostic}`);
        }
    }
};

userFacingDiagnostics.network.on('diagnosticChanged', diagnosticChangedListener);
userFacingDiagnostics.media.on('diagnosticChanged', diagnosticChangedListener);
```

To learn more about User Facing Diagnostics and the different diagnostic values available, see [User Facing Diagnostics](../../concepts/voice-video-calling/user-facing-diagnostics.md?pivots=platform-web).

Azure Communication Services also provides a precall diagnostics API. To Access the Pre-Call API, you need to initialize a `callClient`, and provision an Azure Communication Services access token. Then you can access the `PreCallDiagnostics` feature and the `startTest` method.

```javascript
import { CallClient, Features} from "@azure/communication-calling";
import { AzureCommunicationTokenCredential } from '@azure/communication-common';

const callClient = new CallClient(); 
const tokenCredential = new AzureCommunicationTokenCredential("INSERT ACCESS TOKEN");
const preCallDiagnosticsResult = await callClient.feature(Features.PreCallDiagnostics).startTest(tokenCredential);
```

The Pre-Call API returns a full diagnostic of the device including details like device permissions, availability and compatibility, call quality stats and in-call diagnostics. The results are returned as a `PreCallDiagnosticsResult` object.

```javascript
export declare type PreCallDiagnosticsResult  = {
    deviceAccess: Promise<DeviceAccess>;
    deviceEnumeration: Promise<DeviceEnumeration>;
    inCallDiagnostics: Promise<InCallDiagnostics>;
    browserSupport?: Promise<DeviceCompatibility>;
    id: string;
    callMediaStatistics?: Promise<MediaStatsCallFeature>;
};
```

You can learn more about ensuring precall readiness in [Pre-Call diagnostics](../../concepts/voice-video-calling/pre-call-diagnostics.md).

## Event listeners

### Twilio

```javascript
twilioRoom.on('participantConnected', (participant) => { 
// Participant connected 
}); 

twilioRoom.on('participantDisconnected', (participant) => { 
// Participant Disconnected 
});

```

### Azure Communication Services

Each object in the JavaScript Calling SDK has properties and collections. Their values change throughout the lifetime of the object. Use the `on()` method to subscribe to objects' events, and use the `off()` method to unsubscribe from objects' events.

**Properties**

-   You must inspect their initial values, and subscribe to the `'\<property\>Changed'` event for future value updates.

**Collections**

-   You must inspect their initial values, and subscribe to the `'\<collection\>Updated'` event for future value updates.
-   The `'\<collection\>Updated'` event's payload, has an `added` array that contains values that were added to the collection.
-   The `'\<collection\>Updated'` event's payload also has a removed array that contains values that were removed from the collection.

## Leaving and ending sessions

### Twilio
```javascript
twilioVideo.disconnect();
```


### Azure Communication Services
```javascript
call.hangUp();

// Set the 'forEveryone' property to true to end call for all participants
call.hangUp({ forEveryone: true });

```

## Cleaning Up

If you want to [clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription](../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp#clean-up-resources), you can delete the resource or resource group.
