## Sample code

You can find the completed code for this tutorial on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-javascript-quickstarts/tree/main/sms-url-shortener).

## Prerequisites

-	An active Azure subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).
-	An active Azure Communication Services resource. For more information, see [Create an Azure Communication Services resource](../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md).
-	An Azure Communication Services phone number. [Get a phone number](../../quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number.md). You need to [verify your phone number](../../quickstarts/sms/apply-for-toll-free-verification.md) so it can send messages with URLs. 
-	Deployed [AzUrlShortener](https://github.com/microsoft/AzUrlShortener). Click [Deploy to Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/AzUrlShortener/wiki/How-to-deploy-your-AzUrlShortener) button for quick deploy.
    -  [*Optional*] Deploy the [Admin web app](https://github.com/microsoft/AzUrlShortener/blob/main/src/Cloud5mins.ShortenerTools.TinyBlazorAdmin/README.md) to manage and monitor links in UI.
-	For this tutorial, SMS requests are routed to an Azure Function. You could always use an existing service, different framework like express or just run the tutorial as a Node.js console app. To follow this tutorial with an Azure Function, see instructions to set it up: [Azure Function for TypeScript](/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-typescript).

## Architecture overview

In this tutorial, the focus is to set up a middleware that orchestrates requests to send SMS and the shortening of URLs through the Azure URL Shortener service. It interacts with Azure Communication Services to complete the sending of the SMS.

## Set up the Azure Function

To get started, you need to create a new Azure Function. You can create the Azure Function by following the steps in the [Azure Functions documentation](/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-typescript). If you aren't using an Azure Function and instead are using a different framework, skip this step and continue to the next section.

Once the Azure Function is set up, go to the `local.settings.json` file and add three more values that you need to store: the Azure Communication Services connection string, phone number (Ex. +15555555555) and URL Shortener endpoint (Ex. `https://<Azure_Function_URL>/api/UrlCreate`). These variables are all values you generated from the prerequisites at the beginning of the document.

```json

{
    "IsEncrypted": false,
    "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
    "ACS_CONNECTIONSTRING": "<AZURE COMMUNICATION SERVICES CONNECTION STRING>",
    "ACS_PHONE_NUMBER": "<AZURE COMMUNICATION SERVICES PHONE NUMBER>",
    "URL_SHORTENER": "<URL SHORTENER ENDPOINT>" 
    }
}

```

## Configure query parameters

Now that you've created the Azure Function, you need to configure the query parameters needed to trigger it. The function expects a phone number and a URL. The phone number is used as the recipient of the SMS message. The URL is the link that is shortened and sent to the recipient.

```typescript

const httpTrigger: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context, req: HttpRequest): Promise<void> {
    //Parse Query Parameters
    let phoneNumber = req.query.phoneNumber; // get phone number query parameter
    let url =  req.query.url; // get url to shorten query parameter

    context.res = {
      // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
      body: null
    };
};

export default httpTrigger;

```

## Shorten the URL

Now that you have the phone number and URL, you can use the Azure URL Shortener service to shorten the URL. Ensure you have [deployed](https://github.com/microsoft/AzUrlShortener/wiki/How-to-deploy-your-AzUrlShortener) this service already. The service contains several endpoints, but for this tutorial the focus is on the `UrlCreate` endpoint. Use the `fetch` method to place a `POST` request to the Azure URL Shortener service with the URL you want to shorten. The service returns a JSON object with the shortened URL. Store the shortened URL in a variable called `shortUrl`. In the snippet, insert the endpoint of your deployed Azure URL Shortener service. For information on how to get the endpoint, see [Validate the deployment](https://github.com/microsoft/AzUrlShortener/wiki/How-to-deploy-your-AzUrlShortener#validate-the-deployment).

```typescript

const urlShortener = process.env.URL_SHORTENER

const httpTrigger: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context, req: HttpRequest): Promise<void> {
    //Parse Query Parameters    
    let phoneNumberTo = req.query.phoneNumber; // get phone number query parameter
    let urlToShorten =  req.query.url; // get url to shorten query parameter
    
    //Get short URL from Azure URL Shortener
    const body =  JSON.stringify({ "Url": url})
    await fetch(urlShortener, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: body
    })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(async data => {
      const shortUrl = data["ShortUrl"]
      context.log(shortUrl)
      }
    })

    context.res = {
      // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
      body: null
    };
};

export default httpTrigger;

```

## Send SMS

Now that you have the short URL, use Azure Communication Services to send the SMS. Start with the `send` method from the `SmsClient` class from the `@azure/communication-sms` package. 

```bash

npm i @azure/communication-sms --save

```

This method sends the SMS to the phone number provided in the query parameters. The SMS contains the short URL. For more information on how to send SMS, see [Send SMS](../../quickstarts/telephony-sms/send.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript).

```typescript

import { AzureFunction, Context, HttpRequest } from "@azure/functions"
import { SmsClient }  from "@azure/communication-sms"

const httpTrigger: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context, req: HttpRequest): Promise<void> {
    //Parse Query Parameters
    let to = req.query.phoneNumber; // Get phone number to send SMS to
    let urlToShorten =  req.query.url; // Get URL to shorten

    //Get short URL from Azure URL Shortener
    const body =  JSON.stringify({ "Url": urlToShorten})
    const urlShortener = process.env.URL_SHORTENER
    await fetch(urlShortener, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: body
    })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(async data => {
      const url = data["ShortUrl"]
      const connectionString =  process.env.ACS_CONNECTIONSTRING
      const phoneNumberFrom = process.env.ACS_PHONE_NUMBER
      const smsClient = new SmsClient(connectionString);
      // Send the SMS message
      const sendResults = await smsClient.send({
        from: phoneNumberFrom,
        to: [to],
        message: "Join your scheduled appointment here: " + url
      }, {
        enableDeliveryReport: true
      });
      // Use the "successful" property to verify the status.
      for (const sendResult of sendResults) {
        if (sendResult.successful) {
          console.log("Success: ", sendResult);
        } else {
          console.error("Something went wrong when trying to send this message: ", sendResult);
        }
      }
      context.res = {
        // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
        body: url
      };
    })

};

```

## Test locally

>[!NOTE]
> You need to [verify your phone number](../../quickstarts/sms/apply-for-toll-free-verification.md) to send SMS messages with URLs. Once your verification applications is set to pending state (1-2 days), the phone number to be enabled to send URLs. The full verification will take 5-6 weeks. For more information on toll-free number verification, see [Toll Free Verification FAQ](../../concepts/sms/sms-faq.md#toll-free-verification).

You can now run your Azure Function locally by pressing `F5` in Visual Studio Code or by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash

func host start

```

Then using a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), you can test your function by making a `POST` request to the endpoint of your Azure Function. You need to provide the phone number and URL as query parameters. For example, if your Azure Function is running locally, you can make a request to `http://localhost:7071/api/<FUNCTION NAME>?phoneNumber=%2B15555555555&url=https://www.microsoft.com`. You should receive a response with the shortened URL and a status of `Success`.

## Deploy to Azure

To deploy your Azure Function, you can follow [step by step instructions](/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-csharp?pivots=programming-language-javascript#sign-in-to-azure).

Once deployed, you can access the function through a similar method as you did when testing locally. You need to provide the phone number and URL as query parameters. For example, if your Azure Function is deployed to Azure, you can make a request to `https://<YOUR AZURE FUNCTION NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/<FUNCTION NAME>?phoneNumber=%2B15555555555&url=https://www.microsoft.com`. You should receive a response with the shortened URL and a status of `Success`.
