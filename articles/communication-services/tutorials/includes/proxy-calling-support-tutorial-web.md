The proxy feature is general available starting in the public version [1.25.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/communication-calling/v/1.25.1) of Azure Communication Services Calling SDK. Make sure that you use this SDK or a later version of the SDK when you try to use this feature. This tutorial uses a version of the Calling SDK 1.13.0-beta.1 where this feature became first available on public preview.

## Proxy calling media traffic

The following sections describe how to proxy call your media traffic.

### What is a TURN server?

Many times, establishing a network connection between two peers isn't straightforward. A direct connection might not work because of:

- Firewalls with strict rules.
- Peers sitting behind a private network.
- Computers running in a network address translation (NAT) environment.

To solve these network connection issues, you can use a server that uses the Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) protocol for relaying network traffic. Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) and TURN servers are the relay servers.

### Provide your TURN server details to the SDK

To provide the details of your TURN servers, you need to pass details of what TURN server to use as part of `CallClientOptions` while initializing `CallClient`. For more information on how to set up a call, see [Azure Communication Services Web SDK](../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-with-video-calling.md?pivots=platform-web) for the quickstart on how to set up voice and video.

```js
import { CallClient } from '@azure/communication-calling'; 

const myTurn1 = {
    urls: [
        'turn:turn.azure.com:3478?transport=udp',
        'turn:turn1.azure.com:3478?transport=udp',
    ],
    username: 'turnserver1username',
    credential: 'turnserver1credentialorpass'
};

const myTurn2 = {
    urls: [
        'turn:20.202.255.255:3478',
        'turn:20.202.255.255:3478?transport=tcp',
    ],
    username: 'turnserver2username',
    credential: 'turnserver2credentialorpass'
};

// While you are creating an instance of the CallClient (the entry point of the SDK):
const callClient = new CallClient({
    networkConfiguration: {
        turn: {
            iceServers: [
                myTurn1,
                myTurn2
            ]
        }
    }
});




// ...continue normally with your SDK setup and usage.
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you provided your TURN server details while you initialized `CallClient`, all the media traffic *exclusively* flows through these TURN servers. Any other ICE candidates that are normally generated when you create a call won't be considered while trying to establish connectivity between peers. That means only `relay` candidates are considered. To learn more about different types of Ice candidates see [RTCIceCandidate: type property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCIceCandidate/type).

If the `?transport` query parameter isn't present as part of the TURN URL or isn't one of the `udp`, `tcp`, or `tls` values, the default behavior is UDP.

If any of the URLs provided are invalid or don't have one of the `turn:`, `turns:`, or `stun:` schemas, the `CallClient` initialization fails and throws errors accordingly. The error messages that are thrown should help you troubleshoot if you run into issues.

For the API reference for the `CallClientOptions` object, and the `networkConfiguration` property within it, see [CallClientOptions](/javascript/api/azure-communication-services/@azure/communication-calling/callclientoptions?view=azure-communication-services-js&preserve-view=true).

### Set up a TURN server in Azure

You can create a Linux virtual machine in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Quickstart: Create a Linux virtual machine in the Azure portal](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal?tabs=ubuntu). To deploy a TURN server, use [coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn). Coturn is a free and open-source implementation of a TURN and STUN server for VoIP and WebRTC.

After you set up a TURN server, you can test it by using the instructions on the [WebRTC Trickle ICE](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/) webpage.

## Proxy signaling traffic

To provide the URL of a proxy server, you need to pass it in as part of `CallClientOptions` while initializing `CallClient`. For more information on how to set up a call, see [Azure Communication Services Web SDK](../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-with-video-calling.md?pivots=platform-web) for the quickstart on how to set up voice and video.

```js
import { CallClient } from '@azure/communication-calling'; 

// While you are creating an instance of the CallClient (the entry point of the SDK):
const callClient = new CallClient({
    networkConfiguration: {
        proxy: {
            url: 'https://myproxyserver.com'
        }
    }
});

// ...continue normally with your SDK setup and usage.
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the proxy URL provided is an invalid URL, the `CallClient` initialization fails and throws errors accordingly. The error messages that are thrown help you troubleshoot if you run into issues.

For the API reference for the `CallClientOptions` object, and the `networkConfiguration` property within it, see [CallClientOptions](/javascript/api/azure-communication-services/@azure/communication-calling/callclientoptions?view=azure-communication-services-js&preserve-view=true).

### Set up a signaling proxy middleware in Express.js

You can also create a proxy middleware in your Express.js server setup to have all the URLs redirected through it by using the [http-proxy-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy-middleware) npm package. The `createProxyMiddleware` function from that package should cover what you need for a simple redirect proxy setup. Here's an example usage of it with some option settings that the SDK needs so that all of our URLs work as expected:

```js
const proxyRouter = (req) => {
    // Your router function if you don't intend to set up a direct target

    // An example:
    if (!req.originalUrl && !req.url) {
        return '';
    }

    const incomingUrl = req.originalUrl || req.url;
    if (incomingUrl.includes('/proxy')) {
        return 'https://microsoft.com/forwarder/';
    }
    
    return incomingUrl;
}

const myProxyMiddleware = createProxyMiddleware({
    target: 'https://microsoft.com', // This will be ignored if a router function is provided, but createProxyMiddleware still requires this to be passed in (see its official docs on the npm page for the most recent changes)
    router: proxyRouter,
    changeOrigin: true,
    secure: false, // If you have proper SSL setup, set this accordingly
    followRedirects: true,
    ignorePath: true,
    ws: true,
    logLevel: 'debug'
});

// And finally pass in your proxy middleware to your express app depending on your URL/host setup
app.use('/proxy', myProxyMiddleware);
```

> [!Tip]
> If you're having SSL issues, see the [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) package.

### Set up a signaling proxy server on Azure

You can create a Linux virtual machine in the Azure portal and deploy an NGINX server on it. For more information, see [Quickstart: Create a Linux virtual machine in the Azure portal](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal?tabs=ubuntu).

Here's an NGINX configuration that you can use as a sample:

```
events {
    multi_accept       on;
    worker_connections 65535;
}
http {
    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default upgrade;
        '' close;
    }
    map $request_method $access_control_header {
        OPTIONS '*';
    }
    server {
        listen <port_you_want_listen_on> ssl;
        ssl_certificate     <path_to_your_ssl_cert>;
        ssl_certificate_key <path_to_your_ssl_key>;
        location ~* ^/(.*?\.(com|net)(?::[\d]+)?)/(.*)$ {
            if ($request_method = 'OPTIONS') {
                add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin '*' always;
                add_header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials 'true' always;
                add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers '*' always;
                add_header Access-Control-Allow-Methods 'GET, POST, OPTIONS';
                add_header Access-Control-Max-Age 1728000;
                add_header Content-Type 'text/plain';
                add_header Content-Length 0;
                return 204;
            }
            resolver 1.1.1.1;
            set $ups_host $1;
            set $r_uri $3;
            rewrite ^/.*$ /$r_uri break;
            proxy_set_header Host $ups_host;
            proxy_ssl_server_name on;
            proxy_ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;
            proxy_ssl_ciphers DEFAULT;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_pass_header Authorization;
            proxy_pass_request_headers on;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Proxy "";
            proxy_set_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin $access_control_header;
            proxy_pass https://$ups_host;
            proxy_redirect https://$ups_host https://$host/$ups_host;
            proxy_intercept_errors on;
            error_page 301 302 307 = @process_redirect;
            error_page 400 405 = @process_error_response;
        }
        location @process_redirect {
            set $saved_redirect_location '$upstream_http_location';
            resolver 1.1.1.1;
            proxy_pass $saved_redirect_location;
            add_header X-DBUG-MSG "301" always;
        }
        location @process_error_response {
            add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin * always;
        }
    }
}
```
