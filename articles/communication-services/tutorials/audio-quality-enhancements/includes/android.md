[!INCLUDE [Audio filters options](./native-audio-filters.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Install SDK](../../../how-tos/calling-sdk/includes/install-sdk/install-sdk-android.md)]

You can use the audio filter feature to apply different audio preprocessing options to outgoing audio. The two types of audio filters are `OutgoingAudioFilters` and `LiveOutgoingAudioFilters`. Use `OutgoingAudioFilters` to change settings before the call starts. Use `LiveOutgoingAudioFilters` to change settings while a call is in progress.

You first need to import the Calling SDK and the associated classes:

```csharp
import com.azure.android.communication.calling.OutgoingAudioOptions;
import com.azure.android.communication.calling.OutgoingAudioFilters;
import com.azure.android.communication.calling.LiveOutgoingAudioFilters;
```

## Before a call starts

You can apply `OutgoingAudioFilters` when a call starts.

Begin by creating an `OutgoingAudioFilters` property and passing it into `OutgoingAudioOptions`, as shown in the following code:

```java
OutgoingAudioOptions outgoingAudioOptions = new OutgoingAudioOptions();
OutgoingAudioFilters filters = new OutgoingAudioFilters();
filters.setNoiseSuppressionMode(NoiseSuppressionMode.HIGH);
filters.setAnalogAutomaticGainControlEnabled(true);
filters.setDigitalAutomaticGainControlEnabled(true);
filters.setMusicModeEnabled(true);
filters.setAcousticEchoCancellationEnabled(true); 
outgoingAudioOptions.setAudioFilters(filters);
```

## During the call

You can apply `LiveOutgoingAudioFilters` after a call begins. You can retrieve this object from the call object during the call. To change the setting in `LiveOutgoingAudioFilters`, set the members inside the class to a valid value and they're applied.

Only a subset of the filters available from `OutgoingAudioFilters` are available during an active call. They're music mode, echo cancellation, and noise suppression mode.

```java
LiveOutgoingAudioFilters filters = call.getLiveOutgoingAudioFilters();
filters.setMusicModeEnabled(false);
filters.setAcousticEchoCancellationEnabled(false);
filters.setNoiseSuppressionMode(NoiseSuppressionMode.HIGH);
```
