# Tutorial: Sign an HTTP request

In this tutorial, you learn how to sign an HTTP request with a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) signature.

> [!NOTE]
> We strongly encourage you to use [Azure SDKs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk). The approach described here is a fallback option for cases when Azure SDKs can't be used for any reason.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> * Create a content hash.
> * Compute a signature.
> * Create an authorization header string.
> * Add headers.

## Clean up resources

To clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. You can find out more about how to [clean up Azure Communication Services resources](../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources) and [clean up Azure Functions resources](../../azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-csharp.md#clean-up-resources).
