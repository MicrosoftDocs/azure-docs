# Sign an HTTP request using hash-based message authentication code (HMAC)

This article describes how to sign an HTTP request with a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) signature.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend using the [Azure SDKs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk) to sign an HTTP request. The approach described in this article is a fallback option if Azure SDKs can't be used for any reason.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a request message.
> * Create a content hash.
> * Compute a signature.
> * Create an authorization header string.
> * Add headers.

## Clean up resources

To clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. You can find out more about how to [clean up Azure Communication Services resources](../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources) and [clean up Azure Functions resources](../../azure-functions/how-to-create-function-vs-code.md?pivot=programming-language-csharp#clean-up-resources).
