# Get started with the chat hero sample

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [This sample is available **on GitHub**.](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-web-chat-hero)


The Azure Communication Services **Group Chat Hero Sample** demonstrates how the Communication Services Chat Web SDK can be used to build a group chat experience.

In this Sample quickstart, we learn how the sample works before we run the sample on your local machine. We then deploy the sample to Azure using your own Azure Communication Services resources.


## Overview

The sample has both a client-side application and a server-side application. The **client-side application** is a React/Redux web application that uses Microsoft's Fluent UI framework. This application sends requests to a Node.js **server-side application** that helps the client-side application connect to Azure.

Here's what the sample looks like:

When you press **Start a Chat**, the web application fetches a user access token from the server-side application. You then use this token to connect the client app to Azure Communication Services. Once the token is retrieved, the system prompts you to enter your name and choose an emoji to represent you in chat.

:::image type="content" source="./media/chat/pre-chat.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the application's pre-chat screen.":::

Once you configure your display name and emoji, you can join the chat session. Now you see the main chat canvas where the core chat experience lives.

Components of the main chat screen:

- **Main Chat Area**: The core chat experience where users can send and receive messages. To send messages, you can use the input area and press enter (or use the send button). Received chat messages are organized by sender with the correct name and emoji. You see two types of notifications in the chat area: 1) typing notifications when a user is typing and 2) sent and read notifications for messages.
- **Header**: Where the user sees the title of the chat thread and the controls for toggling participant and settings side bars, and a leave button to exit the chat session.
- **Side Bar**: Where participants and setting information display when toggled using the controls in the header. The participants side bar contains a list of participants in the chat and a link to invite participants to the chat session. The settings side bar enables you to configure the chat thread title.

Complete the following prerequisites and steps to set up the sample.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code (Stable Build)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- [Node.js (16.14.2 and above)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. For details, see [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Create an Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Create an Azure Communication Resource](../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md). Record your resource **connection string** for this quickstart.

## Before running the sample for the first time

1. Open an instance of PowerShell, Windows Terminal, Command Prompt, or equivalent and navigate to the directory where you'd like to clone the sample to.
2. Clone the repo using the following CLI string: 

   `git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-web-chat-hero.git`

   Or clone the repo using any method described in [Clone an existing Git repo](/azure/devops/repos/git/clone).

3. Get the `Connection String` and `Endpoint URL` from the Azure portal or by using the Azure CLI. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az communication list-key --name "<acsResourceName>" --resource-group "<resourceGroup>"
    ```

   For more information on connection strings, see [Create an Azure Communication Services resources](../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md)
4. Once you get the `Connection String`, Add the connection string to the **Server/appsettings.json** file found under the Chat folder. Input your connection string in the variable: `ResourceConnectionString`.
5. Once you get the `Endpoint`, add the endpoint string to the **Server/appsetting.json** file. Input your endpoint in the variable: `EndpointUrl`.
6. Get the `identity` from the Azure portal. Select **Identities & User Access Tokens** in the Azure portal. Generate a user with `Chat` scope.
7. Once you get the `identity` string, add the identity string to the **Server/appsetting.json** file. Input your identity string in the variable: `AdminUserId`. This is the server user to add new users to the chat thread.

## Local run

1. Set your connection string in `Server/appsettings.json`
2. Set your endpoint URL string in `Server/appsettings.json`
3. Set your adminUserId string in `Server/appsettings.json`
3. `npm run setup` from the root directory
4. `npm run start` from the root directory

You can test the sample locally by opening multiple browser sessions with the URL of your chat to simulate a multi-user chat.

## Publish the sample to Azure

1. Under the root directory, run these commands:
```
npm run setup
npm run build
npm run package
```
2. Use the Azure extension and deploy the Chat/dist directory to your app service

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).
