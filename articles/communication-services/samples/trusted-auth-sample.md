# Get started with the trusted authentication service hero sample

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This sample is available **on GitHub** for [node.JS](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-authentication-hero-nodejs) and [C#](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-authentication-hero-csharp).

## Overview

Azure Communication Services requires developers to generate user and access token credentials inside of a trusted authentication service. Azure Communication Services is identity-agnostic, to learn more check out our [conceptual documentation](../concepts/identity-model.md).

This repository provides a sample of a server implementation of an authentication service for Azure Communication Services. It uses best practices to build a trusted backend service that issues Azure Communication Services credentials and maps them to Microsoft Entra identities. 

This sample can help you in the following scenarios:
- As a developer, you need to enable an authentication flow to generate Azure Communication Services user identities mapped to a Microsoft Entra identity. Using this identity you then will provision access tokens to be used in calling and chat experiences.
- As a developer, you need to enable an authentication flow for Azure Communication Services support Teams identities, which is done by using an Microsoft 365 Microsoft Entra identity of a Teams' user to fetch an Azure Communication Services token to be able to join Teams calling/chat.

> [!NOTE]
>If you are looking to get started with Azure Communication Services, but are still in learning / prototyping phases, check out our [quickstarts for getting started with Azure communication services users and access tokens](../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp).

Since this sample only focuses on the server APIs, the client application is not part of it. If you want to add the client application to login user using Microsoft Entra ID, then follow the MSAL samples [here](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js).

## Prerequisites

To be able to run this sample, you will need to:

- Register a Client and Server (Web API) applications in Microsoft Entra ID as part of [On Behalf Of workflow](/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow). Follow instructions on [registrations set up guideline](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-authentication-hero-csharp/blob/main/docs/deployment-guides/set-up-app-registrations.md)
- A deployed Azure Communication Services resource. [Create an Azure Communication Services resource](../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md?tabs=linux&pivots=platform-azp). 
- Update the Server (Web API) application with information from the app registrations.
