# Integrate Azure Communication Services with Microsoft Copilot Studio agents

This article provides step-by-step instructions on how to create and integrate a Microsoft Copilot Studio agent with Azure Communication Services. This article shows you how to create voice-enabled agents that your users can call into.

## Download the sample

Find the project for this sample on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-dotnet-quickstarts/tree/main/CallAutomation_MCS_Sample). You can download this code and run it locally to try it for yourself.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. For more information, see [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- An Azure Communication Services resource. For more information, see [Create a new Azure Communication Services resource](../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp). You need to record your resource *connection string* for this sample.
- A new web service application that uses the Call Automation SDK.
- An Azure AI multiservice resource and a custom domain.
- [Azure Communication Services and Azure AI](../concepts/call-automation/azure-communication-services-azure-cognitive-services-integration.md).
- A Copilot Studio User License so that you can create and publish an agent.

## Step 1: Create your agent in Copilot Studio

1. After you sign in to or sign up for Copilot Studio, the home page opens. On the left pane, select **Create**.

1. On the **Create** page, select **New agent**.

   Use chat to describe your agent. Use the provided questions for guidance.

1. After you provide all the requested information, select **Create**.

   ![Screenshot that shows Create.](./media/click-create.png)

For more information on how to create and customize your agent, you can see the [Copilot Studio quickstart](/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-get-started).

## Step 2: Disable authentication

After you create your agent, you need to make some updates so that you can integrate it with Azure Communication Services.

1. Go to the **Settings** tab.

   ![Screenshot that shows the Settings tab.](./media/mcs-settings.png)

1. On the left pane, select **Security**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the Security tab.](./media/security-tab.png)

1. Select **Authentication** > **No Authentication**, and then select **Save**.

## Step 3: Get the Web Channel Security key

Go back to the **Security** section and select **Web Channel Security**. Copy and save the key. You need it when you deploy your application.

## Step 4: Publish the agent

After you update your agent settings and save your agent key, you can publish your agent.

## Step 5: Set up the code

After you create your agent, make sure to download the [sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-dotnet-quickstarts/tree/main/CallAutomation_MCS_Sample). After you download the sample, you need to update some of the properties:

- **Your connection string**: You can get your connection string from your Azure Communication Services resource.
- **Microsoft Copilot Studio Direct Line key**: You saved your Web Channel Security key in step 3.
- **Azure AI services custom endpoint**: You can get this endpoint from your Azure AI services resource.
- **A port to receive event notifications from Azure Communication Services**: You can use tools like [dev tunnels](/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/overview) to help set one up.

## Step 6: Understand the code

You must be familiar with a few basic concepts that the sample uses to build out this workflow.

### Register an incoming call

Register an [incoming call event](../concepts/call-automation/incoming-call-notification.md) so that your application knows when a call is coming in and needs to answer.

### Answer a call with real-time transcription

When you answer the call, you also enable streaming of real-time transcription. The speech-to-text converted content that the caller is saying is streamed in near real time.

``` csharp
app.MapPost("/api/incomingCall", async (
    [FromBody] EventGridEvent[] eventGridEvents,
    ILogger<Program> logger) =>
{
    foreach (var eventGridEvent in eventGridEvents)
    {
        logger.LogInformation($"Incoming Call event received : {JsonConvert.SerializeObject(eventGridEvent)}");
        // Handle system events
        if (eventGridEvent.TryGetSystemEventData(out object eventData))
        {
            // Handle the subscription validation event.
            if (eventData is SubscriptionValidationEventData subscriptionValidationEventData)
            {
                var responseData = new SubscriptionValidationResponse
                {
                    ValidationResponse = subscriptionValidationEventData.ValidationCode
                };
                return Results.Ok(responseData);
            }
        }
        var jsonObject = JsonNode.Parse(eventGridEvent.Data).AsObject();
        var incomingCallContext = (string)jsonObject["incomingCallContext"];
        var callbackUri = new Uri(baseUri + $"/api/calls/{Guid.NewGuid()}");
        
        var answerCallOptions = new AnswerCallOptions(incomingCallContext, callbackUri)
        {
            CallIntelligenceOptions = new CallIntelligenceOptions()
            {
                CognitiveServicesEndpoint = new Uri(cognitiveServicesEndpoint)
            },
            TranscriptionOptions = new TranscriptionOptions(new Uri($"wss://{baseWssUri}/ws"), "en-US", true, TranscriptionTransport.Websocket)
            {
                EnableIntermediateResults = true
            }
        };

        try
        {
            AnswerCallResult answerCallResult = await client.AnswerCallAsync(answerCallOptions);

            var correlationId = answerCallResult?.CallConnectionProperties.CorrelationId;
            logger.LogInformation($"Correlation Id: {correlationId}");

            if (correlationId != null)
            {
                CallStore[correlationId] = new CallContext()
                {
                    CorrelationId = correlationId
                };
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            logger.LogError($"Answer call exception : {ex.StackTrace}");
        }
    }
    return Results.Ok();
});
```

### Establish a Copilot connection

After the call is connected, the application needs to establish a connection to the AI agent that you built by using Direct Line APIs with WebSocket.

### Start a conversation

``` csharp
var response = await httpClient.PostAsync("https://directline.botframework.com/v3/directline/conversations", null);
response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(content);
```

### Listen to the WebSocket connection

```csharp
await webSocket.ConnectAsync(new Uri(streamUrl), cancellationToken);

var buffer = new byte[4096]; // Set the buffer size to 4096 bytes
var messageBuilder = new StringBuilder();

while (webSocket.State == WebSocketState.Open && !cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
{
    messageBuilder.Clear(); // Reset buffer for each new message
    WebSocketReceiveResult result;
    do
    {
        result = await webSocket.ReceiveAsync(new ArraySegment<byte>(buffer), cancellationToken);
        messageBuilder.Append(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(buffer, 0, result.Count));
    }
    while (!result.EndOfMessage); // Continue until we've received the full message
}
```

### Detect the barge-in

The application uses intermediate results that are received from real-time transcription to detect barge-in from the caller and [cancels the play operation](../how-tos/call-automation/play-action.md).

``` csharp
if (data.Contains("Intermediate"))
{
    Console.WriteLine("\nCanceling prompt");
    if (callMedia != null)
    {
        await callMedia.CancelAllMediaOperationsAsync();
    }
}
```

- When the AI agent provides responses, the application uses the [Play API](../how-tos/call-automation/play-action.md) to convert that text to audio for the text-to-speech service.

    ```csharp
    var ssmlPlaySource = new SsmlSource($"{message}");
    
    var playOptions = new PlayToAllOptions(ssmlPlaySource)
    {
        OperationContext = "Testing"
    };
    
    await callConnectionMedia.PlayToAllAsync(playOptions);
    ```

- When the caller asks to speak to a representative, the AI agent escalates the call by transferring it to a human agent.

    ```csharp
    if (botActivity.Type == "handoff")
    {
        var transferOptions = new TransferToParticipantOptions(agentPhoneIdentity)
        {
            SourceCallerIdNumber = acsPhoneIdentity
        };
    
        await Task.Delay(6000);
        await callConnection.TransferCallToParticipantAsync(transferOptions);
    }
    ``` 

## Step 7: Run the agent

Now you can make a call and talk to your agent.

## Tips

### Topics

To optimize for voice, we recommend that you update topics where you're using the `Message` type of text to speech, because it optimizes the agent's responses for speech scenarios.

### System topics

Your agent has system topics built in by default. You can choose to disable these topics. If you want to continue using them, your application should build logic to handle these topics. For example, you need to build agent transfer into your application to escalate the call from this Copilot agent to a human representative.
