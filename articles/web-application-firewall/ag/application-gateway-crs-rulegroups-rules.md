# Web Application Firewall DRS and CRS rule groups and rules

The Azure-managed rule sets in the Application Gateway web application firewall (WAF) actively protect web applications from common vulnerabilities and exploits. These rule sets, managed by Azure, receive updates as necessary to guard against new attack signatures. The default rule set also incorporates the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Collection rules. The Microsoft Intelligence team collaborates in writing these rules, ensuring enhanced coverage, specific vulnerability patches, and improved false positive reduction.

You also have the option of using rules that are defined based on the OWASP core rule sets 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, or 2.2.9. 

You can disable rules individually, or set specific actions for each rule. This article lists the current rules and rule sets available. If a published rule set requires an update, we'll document it here.

> [!NOTE]
> When a ruleset version is changed in a WAF Policy, any existing customizations you made to your ruleset will be reset to the defaults for the new ruleset. See: [Upgrading or changing ruleset version](#upgrading-or-changing-ruleset-version).

## Default rule sets

The Azure-managed Default Rule Set (DRS) includes rules against the following threat categories:

-	Cross-site scripting
-	Java attacks
-	Local file inclusion
-	PHP injection attacks
-	Remote command execution
-	Remote file inclusion
-	Session fixation
-	SQL injection protection
-	Protocol attackers
The version number of the DRS increments when new attack signatures are added to the rule set.

## Microsoft Threat Intelligence Collection rules

The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Collection rules are written in partnership with the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team to provide increased coverage, patches for specific vulnerabilities, and better false positive reduction.

> [!NOTE]
> Please use the following guidance to tune WAF while you get started with 2.1 on Application Gateway WAF. Details of the rules are described next.

## Core rule sets

The Application Gateway WAF comes preconfigured with CRS 3.2 by default, but you can choose to use any other supported CRS version.
 
CRS 3.2 offers a new engine and new rule sets defending against Java injections, an initial set of file upload checks, and fewer false positives compared with earlier versions of CRS. You can also [customize rules to suit your needs](application-gateway-customize-waf-rules-portal.md). Learn more about the new [Azure WAF engine](waf-engine.md).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Manages rules](../media/application-gateway-crs-rulegroups-rules/managed-rules-01.png)

The WAF protects against the following web vulnerabilities:

- SQL-injection attacks
- Cross-site scripting attacks
- Other common attacks, such as command injection, HTTP request smuggling, HTTP response splitting, and remote file inclusion
- HTTP protocol violations
- HTTP protocol anomalies, such as missing host user-agent and accept headers
- Bots, crawlers, and scanners
- Common application misconfigurations (for example, Apache and IIS)

## Tuning of Managed rule sets

Both DRS and CRS are enabled by default in Detection mode in your WAF policies. You can disable or enable individual rules within the Managed Rule Set to meet your application requirements. You can also set specific actions per rule. The DRS/CRS supports block, log and anomaly score actions. The Bot Manager ruleset supports the allow, block and log actions.

Sometimes you might need to omit certain request attributes from a WAF evaluation. A common example is Active Directory-inserted tokens that are used for authentication. You can configure exclusions to apply when specific WAF rules are evaluated, or to apply globally to the evaluation of all WAF rules. Exclusion rules apply to your whole web application. For more information, see [Web Application Firewall (WAF) with Application Gateway exclusion lists](application-gateway-waf-configuration.md).

By default, DRS version 2.1 / CRS version 3.2 and above uses anomaly scoring when a request matches a rule. CRS 3.1 and below blocks matching requests by default. Additionally, custom rules can be configured in the same WAF policy if you want to bypass any of the preconfigured rules in the Core Rule Set.

Custom rules are always applied before rules in the Core Rule Set are evaluated. If a request matches a custom rule, the corresponding rule action is applied. The request is either blocked or passed through to the back-end. No other custom rules or the rules in the Core Rule Set are processed. 

### Anomaly scoring

When you use CRS or DRS 2.1 and later, your WAF is configured to use anomaly scoring by default. Traffic that matches any rule isn't immediately blocked, even when your WAF is in prevention mode. Instead, the OWASP rule sets define a severity for each rule: Critical, Error, Warning, or Notice. The severity affects a numeric value for the request, which is called the anomaly score:

| Rule severity | Value contributed to anomaly score |
|-|-|
| Critical | 5 |
| Error | 4 |
| Warning | 3 |
| Notice | 2 |

If the anomaly score is 5 or greater, and the WAF is in Prevention mode, the request is blocked. If the anomaly score is 5 or greater, and the WAF is in Detection mode, the request is logged but not blocked.

For example, a single *Critical* rule match is enough for the WAF to block a request when in Prevention mode, because the overall anomaly score is 5. However, one *Warning* rule match only increases the anomaly score by 3, which isn't enough by itself to block the traffic. When an anomaly rule is triggered, it shows a "Matched" action in the logs. If the anomaly score is 5 or greater, there is a separate rule triggered with either "Blocked" or "Detected" action depending on whether WAF policy is in Prevention or Detection mode. For more information, please see [Anomaly Scoring mode](ag-overview.md#anomaly-scoring-mode).

### Upgrading or changing ruleset version

If you are upgrading, or assigning a new ruleset version, and would like to preserve existing rule overrides and exclusions, it is recommended to use PowerShell, CLI, REST API, or a templates to make ruleset version changes. A new version of a ruleset can have newer rules, additional rule groups, and may have updates to existing signatures to enforce better security and reduce false positives. It is recommended to validate changes in a test environment, fine tune if necessary, and then deploy in a production environment.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the Azure portal to assign a new managed ruleset to a WAF policy, all the previous customizations from the existing managed ruleset such as rule state, rule actions, and rule level exclusions will be reset to the new managed ruleset's defaults. However, any custom rules, policy settings, and global exclusions will remain unaffected during the new ruleset assignment. You will need to redefine rule overrides and validate changes before deploying in a production environment.

### DRS 2.1 

DRS 2.1 rules offer better protection than earlier versions of the DRS. It includes more rules developed by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team and updates to signatures to reduce false positives. It also supports transformations beyond just URL decoding.

DRS 2.1 includes 17 rule groups, as shown in the following table. Each group contains multiple rules, and you can customize behavior for individual rules, rule groups, or entire rule set. DRS 2.1 is baselined off the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Core Rule Set (CRS) 3.3.2 and includes additional proprietary protections rules developed by Microsoft Threat Intelligence team.
