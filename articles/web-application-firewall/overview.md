# What is Azure Web Application Firewall?

Azure Web Application Firewall provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. Web applications increasingly encounter malicious attacks that exploit commonly known vulnerabilities. SQL injection and cross-site scripting are among the most common attacks.

Preventing such attacks in application code is challenging. It can require rigorous maintenance, patching, and monitoring at multiple layers of the application topology. A centralized web application firewall (WAF) helps make security management simpler. A WAF also gives application administrators better assurance of protection against threats and intrusions.

A WAF solution can react to a security threat faster by centrally patching a known vulnerability, instead of securing each individual web application.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Web Application Firewall is one of the services in the category of network security for Azure. Other services in this category include [Azure DDoS Protection](../ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview.md) and [Azure Firewall](../firewall/overview.md). Each service has its own unique features and use cases. For more information on this service category, see [What is Azure network security?](../networking/security/network-security.md).

## Supported services

Azure Web Application Firewall can be deployed with these Microsoft services:

- Azure Application Gateway
- Azure Application Gateway for Containers
- Azure Front Door
- Azure Content Delivery Network

Azure Web Application Firewall on Azure Content Delivery Network and Azure Web Application Firewall on Application Gateway for Containers are currently in preview. Azure Web Application Firewall has features that are customized for each specific service.
