# Web Application Firewall DRS rule groups and rules

Azure Web Application Firewall on Azure Front Door protects web applications from common vulnerabilities and exploits. Azure-managed rule sets provide an easy way to deploy protection against a common set of security threats. Because Azure manages these rule sets, the rules are updated as needed to protect against new attack signatures.

The Default Rule Set (DRS) also includes the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Collection rules that are written in partnership with the Microsoft Intelligence team to provide increased coverage, patches for specific vulnerabilities, and better false positive reduction.

> [!NOTE]
> When a ruleset version is changed in a WAF Policy, any existing customizations you made to your ruleset will be reset to the defaults for the new ruleset. See: [Upgrading or changing ruleset version](#upgrading-or-changing-ruleset-version).

## Default rule sets

The Azure-managed DRS includes rules against the following threat categories:

- Cross-site scripting
- Java attacks
- Local file inclusion
- PHP injection attacks
- Remote command execution
- Remote file inclusion
- Session fixation
- SQL injection protection
- Protocol attackers

The version number of the DRS increments when new attack signatures are added to the rule set.

DRS is enabled by default in Detection mode in your WAF policies. You can disable or enable individual rules within the DRS to meet your application requirements. You can also set specific actions per rule. The available actions are [Allow, Block, Log, and Redirect](afds-overview.md#waf-actions).

Sometimes you might need to omit certain request attributes from a web application firewall (WAF) evaluation. A common example is Active Directory-inserted tokens that are used for authentication. You might configure an exclusion list for a managed rule, a rule group, or the entire rule set. For more information, see [Azure Web Application Firewall on Azure Front Door exclusion lists](./waf-front-door-exclusion.md).

By default, DRS versions 2.0 and above use anomaly scoring when a request matches a rule. DRS versions earlier than 2.0 block requests that trigger the rules. Also, custom rules can be configured in the same WAF policy if you want to bypass any of the preconfigured rules in the DRS.

Custom rules are always applied before rules in the DRS are evaluated. If a request matches a custom rule, the corresponding rule action is applied. The request is either blocked or passed through to the back end. No other custom rules or the rules in the DRS are processed. You can also remove the DRS from your WAF policies.

### Microsoft Threat Intelligence Collection rules

The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Collection rules are written in partnership with the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team to provide increased coverage, patches for specific vulnerabilities, and better false positive reduction.

By default, the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Collection rules replace some of the built-in DRS rules, causing them to be disabled. For example, rule ID 942440, *SQL Comment Sequence Detected*, has been disabled and replaced by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Collection rule 99031002. The replaced rule reduces the risk of false positive detections from legitimate requests.

### <a name="anomaly-scoring-mode"></a>Anomaly scoring

When you use DRS 2.0 or later, your WAF uses *anomaly scoring*. Traffic that matches any rule isn't immediately blocked, even when your WAF is in prevention mode. Instead, the OWASP rule sets define a severity for each rule: *Critical*, *Error*, *Warning*, or *Notice*. The severity affects a numeric value for the request, which is called the *anomaly score*. If a request accumulates an anomaly score of 5 or greater, the WAF takes action on the request.

| Rule severity | Value contributed to anomaly score |
|-|-|
| Critical | 5 |
| Error | 4 |
| Warning | 3 |
| Notice | 2 |

When you configure your WAF, you can decide how the WAF handles requests that exceed the anomaly score threshold of 5. The three anomaly score action options are Block, Log, or Redirect. The anomaly score action you select at the time of configuration is applied to all requests that exceed the anomaly score threshold.

For example, if the anomaly score is 5 or greater on a request, and the WAF is in Prevention mode with the anomaly score action set to Block, the request is blocked. If the anomaly score is 5 or greater on a request, and the WAF is in Detection mode, the request is logged but not blocked.

A single *Critical* rule match is enough for the WAF to block a request when in Prevention mode with the anomaly score action set to Block because the overall anomaly score is 5. However, one *Warning* rule match only increases the anomaly score by 3, which isn't enough by itself to block the traffic. When an anomaly rule is triggered, it shows a "matched" action in the logs. If the anomaly score is 5 or greater, there a separate rule is triggered with the anomaly score action configured for the rule set. Default anomaly score action is Block, which results in a log entry with the action `blocked`.

When your WAF uses an older version of the Default Rule Set (before DRS 2.0), your WAF runs in the traditional mode. Traffic that matches any rule is considered independently of any other rule matches. In traditional mode, you don't have visibility into the complete set of rules that a specific request matched.

The version of the DRS that you use also determines which content types are supported for request body inspection. For more information, see [What content types does WAF support?](waf-faq.yml#what-content-types-does-waf-support-) in the FAQ.

### Upgrading or changing ruleset version

If you are upgrading, or assigning a new ruleset version, and would like to preserve existing rule overrides and exclusions, it is recommended to use PowerShell, CLI, REST API, or a templates to make ruleset version changes. A new version of a ruleset can have newer rules, additional rule groups, and may have updates to existing signatures to enforce better security and reduce false positives. It is recommended to validate changes in a test environment, fine tune if necessary, and then deploy in a production environment.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the Azure portal to assign a new managed ruleset to a WAF policy, all the previous customizations from the existing managed ruleset such as rule state, rule actions, and rule level exclusions will be reset to the new managed ruleset's defaults. However, any custom rules, or policy settings will remain unaffected during the new ruleset assignment. You will need to redefine rule overrides and validate changes before deploying in a production environment.

### DRS 2.1

DRS 2.1 rules offer better protection than earlier versions of the DRS. It includes other rules developed by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team and updates to signatures to reduce false positives. It also supports transformations beyond just URL decoding.

DRS 2.1 includes 17 rule groups, as shown in the following table. Each group contains multiple rules, and you can customize behavior for individual rules, rule groups, or an entire rule set. DRS 2.1 is baselined off the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Core Rule Set (CRS) 3.3.2 and includes additional proprietary protections rules developed by Microsoft Threat Intelligence team.

> DRS 2.1 is only available on Azure Front Door Premium.
