# Configure an IP restriction rule with a WAF for Azure Front Door

This article shows you how to configure IP restriction rules in a web application firewall (WAF) for Azure Front Door by using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or an Azure Resource Manager template.

An IP addressâ€“based access control rule is a custom WAF rule that lets you control access to your web applications. The rule specifies a list of IP addresses or IP address ranges in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) format.

There are two types of match variables in an IP address match: `RemoteAddr` and `SocketAddr`. The `RemoteAddr` variable is the original client IP that's usually sent via the `X-Forwarded-For` request header. The `SocketAddr` variable is the source IP address the WAF sees. If your user is behind a proxy, `SocketAddr` is often the proxy server address.

By default, your web application is accessible from the internet. If you want to limit access to clients from a list of known IP addresses or IP address ranges, you can create an IP matching rule that contains the list of IP addresses as matching values and sets the operator to `Not` (negate is true) and the action to `Block`. After an IP restriction rule is applied, requests that originate from addresses outside this allowed list receive a 403 Forbidden response.

## Configure a WAF policy

#### [Portal](#tab/browser)

Follow these steps to configure a WAF policy using the Azure portal.

### Prerequisites

Create an Azure Front Door profile by following the instructions described in [Quickstart: Create an Azure Front Door instance for a highly available global web application](../../frontdoor/quickstart-create-front-door.md).

### Create a WAF policy

1. On the Azure portal, select **Create a resource**. Enter **Web application firewall** in the **Search services and marketplace** search box and select Enter. Then select **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**.
1. Select **Create**.
1. On the **Create a WAF policy** page, use the following values to complete the **Basics** tab.

   |Setting  |Value  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Policy for     |Global WAF (Front Door).|
   |Front door tier| Select Premium or Standard to match your Azure Front Door tier.|

   > [!NOTE]
   > A private IP address was intentionally used in the custom rule to guarantee the rule would trigger. In an actual deployment, create *allow* and *deny* rules by using IP addresses for your particular situation.

#### [CLI](#tab/azure-devops-cli)

Follow these steps to configure a WAF policy using the Azure CLI.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin to configure an IP restriction policy, set up your CLI environment and create an Azure Front Door profile.

#### Set up the Azure CLI environment

1. Install the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) or use Azure Cloud Shell. Azure Cloud Shell is a free Bash shell that you can run directly within the Azure portal. It has the Azure CLI preinstalled and configured to use with your account. Select the **Try it** button in the CLI commands that follow. Then sign in to your Azure account in the Cloud Shell session that opens. After the session starts, enter `az extension add --name front-door` to add the Azure Front Door extension.
 1. If you're using the CLI locally in Bash, sign in to Azure by using `az login`.

#### Create an Azure Front Door profile
Create an Azure Front Door profile by following the instructions described in [Quickstart: Create an Azure Front Door instance for a highly available global web application](../../frontdoor/quickstart-create-front-door.md).

### Create a WAF policy

Create a WAF policy by using the [az network front-door waf-policy create](/cli/azure/network/front-door/waf-policy#az-network-front-door-waf-policy-create) command.
In the example that follows, replace the policy name *IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI* with a unique policy name.

```azurecli-interactive
az network front-door waf-policy create \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --subscription <subscription ID> \
  --name IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI
  ```
### Add a custom IP access control rule

Use the [az network front-door waf-policy custom-rule create](/cli/azure/network/front-door/waf-policy/rule#az-network-front-door-waf-policy-rule-create) command to add a custom IP access control rule for the WAF policy you created.

In the following examples:
-  Replace *IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI* with your unique policy created earlier.
-  Replace *ip-address-range-1*, *ip-address-range-2* with your own range.

First, create an IP allow rule for the policy created from the previous step.

> [!NOTE]
> `--defer` is required because a rule must have a match condition to be added in the next step.

```azurecli
az network front-door waf-policy rule create \
  --name IPAllowListRule \
  --priority 1 \
  --rule-type MatchRule \
  --action Block \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --policy-name IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI --defer
```

Next, add a match condition to the rule:

```azurecli
az network front-door waf-policy rule match-condition add \
--match-variable SocketAddr \
--operator IPMatch \
--values "ip-address-range-1" "ip-address-range-2" \
--negate true \
--name IPAllowListRule \
  --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
  --policy-name IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI
  ```

### Find the ID of a WAF policy
Find a WAF policy's ID by using the [az network front-door waf-policy show](/cli/azure/network/front-door/waf-policy#az-network-front-door-waf-policy-show) command. Replace *IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI* in the following example with your unique policy that you created earlier.

   ```azurecli
   az network front-door  waf-policy show \
     --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
     --name IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI
   ```

### Link a WAF policy to an Azure Front Door front-end host

Set the Azure Front Door *WebApplicationFirewallPolicyLink* ID to the policy ID by using the [az network front-door update](/cli/azure/network/front-door#az-network-front-door-update) command. Replace *IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI* with your unique policy that you created earlier.

   ```azurecli
   az network front-door update \
     --set FrontendEndpoints[0].WebApplicationFirewallPolicyLink.id=/subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourcegroups/resource-group-name/providers/Microsoft.Network/frontdoorwebapplicationfirewallpolicies/IPAllowPolicyExampleCLI \
     --name <frontdoor-name> \
     --resource-group <resource-group-name>
   ```

In this example, the WAF policy is applied to `FrontendEndpoints[0]`. You can link the WAF policy to any of your front ends.

> [!Note]
> You need to set the `WebApplicationFirewallPolicyLink` property only once to link a WAF policy to an Azure Front Door front end. Subsequent policy updates are automatically applied to the front end.

#### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/powershell)


Follow these steps to configure a WAF policy using Azure PowerShell.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin to configure an IP restriction policy, set up your PowerShell environment and create an Azure Front Door profile.

#### Set up your PowerShell environment
Azure PowerShell provides a set of cmdlets that use the [Azure Resource Manager](../../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md) model for managing Azure resources.

You can install [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/) on your local machine and use it in any PowerShell session. Follow the instructions on the page to sign in to PowerShell by using your Azure credentials and then install the Az PowerShell module module.

1. Connect to Azure by using the following command and then use an interactive dialog to sign in.
    ```
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```
 1. Before you install an Azure Front Door module, make sure you have the current version of the PowerShellGet module installed. Run the following command and then reopen PowerShell.

    ```
    Install-Module PowerShellGet -Force -AllowClobber
    ```

1. Install the Az.FrontDoor module by using the following command:

    ```
    Install-Module -Name Az.FrontDoor
    ```
### Create an Azure Front Door profile
Create an Azure Front Door profile by following the instructions described in [Quickstart: Create a Front Door for a highly available global web application](../../frontdoor/quickstart-create-front-door.md).

### Define an IP match condition
Use the [New-AzFrontDoorWafMatchConditionObject](/powershell/module/az.frontdoor/new-azfrontdoorwafmatchconditionobject) command to define an IP match condition.
In the following example, replace *ip-address-range-1*, *ip-address-range-2* with your own range.

```powershell
$IPMatchCondition = New-AzFrontDoorWafMatchConditionObject `
-MatchVariable  SocketAddr `
-OperatorProperty IPMatch `
-MatchValue "ip-address-range-1", "ip-address-range-2"
-NegateCondition 1
```

### Create a custom IP allow rule

Use the [New-AzFrontDoorWafCustomRuleObject](/powershell/module/Az.FrontDoor/New-azfrontdoorwafcustomruleobject) command to define an action and set a priority. In the following example, requests not from client IPs that match the list are blocked.

```azurepowershell
$IPAllowRule = New-AzFrontDoorWafCustomRuleObject `
-Name "IPAllowRule" `
-RuleType MatchRule `
-MatchCondition $IPMatchCondition `
-Action Block -Priority 1
```

### Configure a WAF policy
Find the name of the resource group that contains the Azure Front Door profile by using `Get-AzResourceGroup`. Next, configure a WAF policy with the IP rule by using [New-AzFrontDoorWafPolicy](/powershell/module/az.frontdoor/new-azfrontdoorwafpolicy).

```azurepowershell
  $IPAllowPolicyExamplePS = New-AzFrontDoorWafPolicy `
    -Name "IPRestrictionExamplePS" `
    -resourceGroupName <resource-group-name> `
    -Customrule $IPAllowRule`
    -Mode Prevention `
    -EnabledState Enabled
   ```

> [!TIP]
> For an existing WAF policy, you can use [Update-AzFrontDoorWafPolicy](/powershell/module/az.frontdoor/update-azfrontdoorwafpolicy) to update the policy.

### Link a WAF policy to an Azure Front Door front-end host

Link a WAF policy object to an existing front-end host and update Azure Front Door properties. First, retrieve the Azure Front Door object by using [Get-AzFrontDoor](/powershell/module/Az.FrontDoor/Get-AzFrontDoor). Next, set the `WebApplicationFirewallPolicyLink` property to the resource ID of `$IPAllowPolicyExamplePS`, created in the previous step, by using the [Set-AzFrontDoor](/powershell/module/Az.FrontDoor/Set-AzFrontDoor) command.

```azurepowershell
  $FrontDoorObjectExample = Get-AzFrontDoor `
    -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name> `
    -Name $frontDoorName
  $FrontDoorObjectExample[0].FrontendEndpoints[0].WebApplicationFirewallPolicyLink = $IPBlockPolicy.Id
  Set-AzFrontDoor -InputObject $FrontDoorObjectExample[0]
```

> [!NOTE]
> In this example, the WAF policy is applied to `FrontendEndpoints[0]`. You can link a WAF policy to any of your front ends. You need to set the `WebApplicationFirewallPolicyLink` property only once to link a WAF policy to an Azure Front Door front end. Subsequent policy updates are automatically applied to the front end.
