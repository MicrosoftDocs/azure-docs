This tutorial shows you how to create a basic web application firewall (WAF) policy and apply it to a front-end host at Azure Front Door.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a WAF policy.
> * Associate it with a front-end host.
> * Configure WAF rules.

## Prerequisites

Create an Azure [Front Door](../../frontdoor/quickstart-create-front-door.md) instance or an [Azure Front Door Standard or Premium](../../frontdoor/standard-premium/create-front-door-portal.md) profile.

## Create a WAF policy

First, create a basic WAF policy with the managed Default Rule Set (DRS) by using the Azure portal.

1. In the upper-left side of the screen, select **Create a resource**. Search for **WAF**, select **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**, and select **Create**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create a WAF policy** page, enter or select the following information and accept the defaults for the remaining settings.

    | Setting                 | Value                                              |
    | ---                     | ---                                                |
    | Policy for              | Select **Global WAF (Front Door)**. |
    | Front door tier         | Select between **Classic**, **Standard**, and **Premium** tiers. |
    | Subscription            | Select your Azure subscription.|
    | Resource group          | Select your Azure Front Door resource group name.|
    | Policy name             | Enter a unique name for your WAF policy.|
    | Policy state            | Set as **Enabled**. |

1. On the **Association** tab, select **Associate a Front door profile**, enter the following settings, and select **Add**.

    | Setting                 | Value                                              |
    | ---                     | ---                                                |
    | Front door profile              | Select your Azure Front Door profile name. |
    | Domains          | Select the domains you want to associate the WAF policy to and then select **Add**. |

    :::image type="content" source="../media/waf-front-door-create-portal/associate-profile.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Associate a Front door profile page.":::
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If the domain is associated to a WAF policy, it's shown as grayed out. You must first remove the domain from the associated policy and then re-associate the domain to a new WAF policy.

1. Select **Review + create** > **Create**.

## Configure WAF rules (optional)

Follow these steps to configure WAF rules.

### Change mode

When you create a WAF policy, by default, the WAF policy is in **Detection** mode. In **Detection** mode, the WAF doesn't block any requests. Instead, requests matching the WAF rules are logged at WAF logs.
To see the WAF in action, you can change the mode settings from **Detection** to **Prevention**. In **Prevention** mode, requests that match defined rules are blocked and logged at WAF logs.

### Custom rules

To create a custom rule, under the **Custom rules** section, select **Add custom rule** to open the custom rule configuration page.

:::image type="content" source="../media/waf-front-door-create-portal/custom-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Custom rules page.":::

The following example shows how to configure a custom rule to block a request if the query string contains **blockme**.

:::image type="content" source="../media/waf-front-door-create-portal/customquerystring2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the custom rule configuration page showing settings for a rule that checks whether the QueryString variable contains the value blockme.":::

### Default Rule Set

The Azure-managed Default Rule Set is enabled by default for the Premium and Classic tiers of Azure Front Door. The current DRS for the Premium tier of Azure Front Door is Microsoft_DefaultRuleSet_2.1. Microsoft_DefaultRuleSet_1.1 is the current DRS for the Classic tier of Azure Front Door. On the **Managed rules** page, select **Assign** to assign a different DRS.

To disable an individual rule, select the checkbox in front of the rule number and select **Disable** at the top of the page. To change action types for individual rules within the rule set, select the checkbox in front of the rule number and select **Change action** at the top of the page.

> [!NOTE]
