# Open Targets

The Open Targets Platform is a data resource to facilitate the systematic identification and prioritization of potential therapeutic drug targets. This resource integrates publicly available datasets, including those datasets that are generated by the Open Targets consortium, to build and score target-disease associations, aiding in the identification and prioritization of drug targets. Additionally, it incorporates pertinent annotation information about targets, diseases, phenotypes, drugs, and their key relationships.

The Open Targets Genetics highlights variant-centric statistical evidence to allow both prioritization of candidate causal variants at trait-associated loci and identification of potential drug targets. It collects and combines genetic associations gathered from published literature as well as newly derived data from sources like UK Biobank and FinnGen. Additionally, it includes functional genomics information such as chromatin conformation and interactions, along with quantitative trait loci (eQTLs, pQTLs, and sQTLs). Large-scale pipelines apply statistical fine-mapping across thousands of trait-associated loci to resolve association signals and link each variant to its proximal and distal target genes using a 'Locus2Gene' assessment. Integrated cross-trait colocalisation analyses and linking to detailed pharmaceutical compounds extend the capacity of Open Targets Genetics to explore drug repositioning opportunities and shared genetic architecture.
