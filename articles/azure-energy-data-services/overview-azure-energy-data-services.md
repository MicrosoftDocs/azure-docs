## Introduction

Azure Energy Data Services is an enterprise grade, OSDU-ready data platform developed in collaboration with Schlumberger that includes the OSDU Data Foundation on Microsoft Azure. The Azure Energy Data Services platform will be delivered as a first party managed PaaS offering from Microsoft, incorporating significant extra features and capabilities over the OSDU community code. Azure Energy Data Services will be an open platform with the capability to connect to multiple internal and external data sources (in addition to other OSDU-ready third party applications and tools). Azure Energy Data Services will incorporate innovative scalable data ingestion capabilities, unified AI templates, domain services, etc. The platform will be extensible, and its rich tooling can automate the subsurface data pipelines and accelerate delivery of curated datasets. Since the platform is being built using leading cloud capabilities of Microsoft Azure, based on Microsoft’s standards, it will also differentiate itself with following strengths: 
- Seamless upgrades 
- Updates, hotfix and security fixes 
- Manageability and Monitoring 
- SLAs, SLIs, SLOs 
- Security, Data governance and Extensibility 
- Auto scaling 
- Disaster recovery and resiliency 


## Advantages of Azure Energy Data Services

Azure Energy Data Services is a commercial-grade, Microsoft-managed first party PaaS that will provide customers an OSDU solution that is efficient, standardized, easy-to-deploy, scalable environment for data management – ingesting, aggregating, storing, searching, and retrieving data. The platform will provide scale, security, privacy, and compliance that are expected by Enterprise customers. It will provide improved Developer Experiences, like SDK, sample apps, reference architecture and extensive documentation, to enable partners to evaluate and develop their own applications faster and easier. Azure Energy Data Services will provide Petrel compatibility out of the box and allow customers to be able to run their domain workflows with ease, with data contained in Azure Energy Data Services.

Azure Energy Data Services will grow into an ecosystem that will offer Microsoft Azure Marketplace integration with applications developed and offered by third parties. It will also offer extra value-added capabilities and applications, like AI/KM capabilities via APIs and SDK.

Azure Energy Data Services will also support other platforms for the energy vertical including for Carbon (Project Cedar) and for Power and Utilities (Project Pine).

## Tiers

Azure Energy Data Services will have two distinct tiers:

* Foundation Tier
* Enterprise Tier

### Foundation Tier

The Foundation Tier is a Microsoft-branded core data platform offered as a Microsoft-managed first party PaaS that provides

* An enterprise-ready, commercial grade, standards compliant, managed-OSDU offering as a platform service that provides the scale, security, privacy, compliance, and availability for Enterprise Customers and is faster and easier to deploy.
* Microsoft’s and Schlumberger’s joint Support and Monitoring to support Microsoft’s Terms of Use (TOU) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
* DDMS for specific SLB apps to provide out-of-the-box compatibility for ubiquitous domain apps like Petrel
* Out of the box compatibility with Petrel for basic seismic workflows.
* Basic Developer Experiences that include SDK and sample code to help with ease and speed of app development with Azure Energy Data Services.

The Azure Energy Data Services doesn't preclude other ISVs from the ecosystem. Therefore, it includes a developer ecosystem (SDK, Developer Portal, and sample code) for our other ecosystem partners (ISV’s and SIs) to build new apps and port existing apps.
  
### Enterprise Tier

The current product provides the Foundation Tier functionality. The Enterprise Tier is under development.

The Enterprise Tier provides a rich toolkit for managing data across the customer’s organization. Customers can curate data products into the OSDU Data Platform, with full lifecycle data management support including ingestion, QC, data governance and projects. Using commercial applications in the Enterprise Tier allows the customers to get value from their OSDU investments much quicker and at a lower cost than building customized applications from scratch on the Foundation Tier. The Schlumberger apps are based on years of investment in specialist domain data processing tools, and that know-how is delivered into the OSDU data platform to enable greater insight and faster decisions. The solution contains all the components they need to run your data management and data engineering teams. Based on the industry standard data foundation, the enterprise data management solution supports all their content needs from their entire ecosystem of data and application suppliers.
To summarize, the Enterprise Tier is offered as a SaaS environment and includes

* The Foundation Tier
* Extra MSFT integrations (Power Platform, Dynamics, and Office 365)  
* Extra SLB apps and integrations (for loading, migrating, data access, data enrichment and workflow enablement, among others)
