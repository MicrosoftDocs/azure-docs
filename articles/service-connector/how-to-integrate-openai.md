# Connect to Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models using Service Connector

This page provides information about supported authentication methods and clients. It provides sample code you can use to connect compute services to Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models using Service Connector. This page also lists default environment variable names and values obtained when creating service connections.

## Supported compute services

Service Connector can be used to connect the following compute services to Azure OpenAI:

- Azure App Service
- Azure Container Apps
- Azure Functions
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Azure Spring Apps

## Supported authentication types and client types

This table shows which combinations of authentication methods and clients are supported for connecting your compute service to Azure OpenAI using Service Connector. A "Yes" indicates that the combination is supported, while a "No" indicates that it isn't supported.


| Client type | System-assigned managed identity | User-assigned managed identity | Secret/connection string | Service principal |
|-------------|:--------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|:------------------------:|:-----------------:|
| .NET        |                Yes               |               Yes              |            Yes           |        Yes        |
