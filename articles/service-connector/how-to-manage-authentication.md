# Manage authentication within Service Connector

In this guide, learn about the different authentication options available in Service Connector, and how to customize environment variables.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
- An Azure App Service, Azure Container Apps or Azure Spring Apps instance.
- This guide assumes that you already know how the basics of connecting services using Service Connector. To review our quickstarts, go to [App Service](quickstart-portal-app-service-connection.md), [Container Apps](quickstart-portal-container-apps.md) or [Azure Spring Apps](quickstart-portal-spring-cloud-connection.md).

## Start creating a new connection

1. Within your App Service, Container Apps or Azure Spring Apps instance, open Service Connector and fill out the form in the **Basics** tab with the required information about your compute and target services.
2. Select **Next : Authentication**.

## Select an authentication option

Select one of the four different authentication options offered by Service Connector to connect your Azure services together:

- **System assigned managed identity**: provides an automatically managed identity tied to the resource in Microsoft Entra ID
- **User assigned managed identity**: provides an identity that can be used on multiple resources
- **Connection string**: provides one or multiple key-value pairs with secrets or tokens
- **Service principal**: creates a service principal that defines the access policy and permissions for the user/application in the Microsoft Entra tenant

Service Connector offers the following authentication options:

| Target resource                               | System assigned managed identity | User assigned managed identity (Workload identity) | Connection string | Service principal |
