# Connect to an Azure AI multi-service resource with Service Connector

This page provides information on supported authentication methods and clients. It provides sample code you can use to connect compute services to Azure AI multi-service resource using Service Connector. This page also lists default environment variable names and values obtained when creating the service connection. 

## Supported compute services

Service Connector can be used to connect the following compute services to an Azure AI multi-service resource:

- Azure App Service
- Azure Container Apps
- Azure Functions
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Azure Spring Apps

## Supported authentication types and client types

This table indicates the authentication methods and clients supported for connecting your compute service to an Azure AI multi-service resource using Service Connector. A "Yes" indicates that the combination is supported, while a "No" indicates that it isn't supported.


| Client type | System-assigned managed identity | User-assigned managed identity | Secret/connection string | Service principal |
|-------------|:--------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|:------------------------:|:-----------------:|
| .NET        |                Yes               |               Yes              |            Yes           |        Yes        |
