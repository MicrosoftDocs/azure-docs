# Quickstart: Create a service connection in App Service from the Azure portal

Get started with Service Connector by using the Azure portal to create a new service connection in Azure App Service.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
- An application deployed to App Service in a [region supported by Service Connector](./concept-region-support.md). If you don't have one yet, [create and deploy an app to App Service](../app-service/quickstart-dotnetcore.md).

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/) with your Azure account.

## Create a new service connection in App Service

1. To create a new service connection in App Service, select the **Search resources, services and docs (G +/)** search bar at the top of the Azure portal, type ***App Services***, and select **App Services**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/app-service-quickstart/select-app-services.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal, selecting App Services.":::

1. Select the Azure App Services resource you want to connect to a target resource.
1. Select **Service Connector** from the left table of contents. Then select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/app-service-quickstart/select-service-connector.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal, selecting Service Connector and creating new connection.":::

1. Select or enter the following settings.

    | Setting             | Example                                | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
    |---------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Service type**    | Storage -  Blob                        | The target service type. If you don't have a Microsoft Blob Storage, you can [create one](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal.md) or use another service type. |
    | **Connection name** | *my_connection*                        | The connection name that identifies the connection between your App Service and target service. Use the connection name provided by Service Connector or choose your own connection name.                                                                          |
    | **Subscription**    | My subscription                        | The subscription for your target service (the service you want to connect to). The default value is the subscription for this App Service resource.          |
    | **Storage account** | *my_storage_account*                   | The target storage account you want to connect to. Target service instances to choose from vary according to the selected service type.                                 |
    | **Client type**     | The same app stack on this App Service | The default value comes from the App Service runtime stack. Select the app stack that's on this App Service instance.                                                    |

1. Select **Next: Authentication** to choose an authentication method.

    ### [System-assigned managed identity (recommended)](#tab/SMI)

    System-assigned managed identity is the recommended authentication option. Select **System-assigned managed identity** to connect through an identity that's generated in Microsoft Entra ID and tied to the lifecycle of the service instance.

    ### [User-assigned managed identity](#tab/UMI)

    Select **User-assigned managed identity** to authenticate through a standalone identity assigned to one or more instances of an Azure service.

    ### [Service principal](#tab/SP)

    Select **Service principal** to use a service principal that defines the access policy and permissions for the user/application in Microsoft Entra ID.

    ### [Connection string](#tab/CS)
    
    > [!WARNING]
    > Microsoft recommends that you use the most secure authentication flow available. The authentication flow described in this procedure requires a very high degree of trust in the application, and carries risks that are not present in other flows. You should only use this flow when other more secure flows, such as managed identities, aren't viable.
    
    Select **Connection string** to generate or configure one or multiple key-value pairs with pure secrets or tokens.

1. Select **Next: Networking** to configure the network access to your target service and select **Configure firewall rules to enable access to your target service**.

1. Select **Next: Review + Create**  to review the provided information. Then select **Create** to create the service connection. This operation might take a minute to complete.

> [!NOTE]
> You need enough permissions to create a connection successfully, for more details, see [Permission requirements](./concept-permission.md).

## View service connections in App Service

1. Once the connection has successfully been created, the **Service Connector** page displays existing App Service connections.

1. Select the **>** button to expand the list and see the environment variables required by your application code. Select **Hidden value** to view the hidden value.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/app-service-quickstart/show-values.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal, viewing connection details.":::

1. Select **Validate** to check your connection. Select **Learn more** to see the connection validation details in the panel on the right.
