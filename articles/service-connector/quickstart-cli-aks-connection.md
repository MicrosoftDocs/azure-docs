# Quickstart: Create a service connection in AKS cluster with the Azure CLI

This quickstart shows you how to connect Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to other Cloud resources using Azure CLI and Service Connector. Service Connector lets you quickly connect compute services to cloud services, while managing your connection's authentication and networking settings.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

* This quickstart requires version 2.30.0 or higher of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.
* This quickstart assumes that you already have an AKS cluster. If you don't have one yet, [create an AKS cluster](/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli).
* This quickstart assumes that you already have an Azure Storage account. If you don't have one yet, [create an Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md).

## Initial set-up

1. If you're using Service Connector for the first time, start by running the command [az provider register](/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-register) to register the Service Connector and Kubernetes Configuration resource providers.

   ```azurecli
   az provider register -n Microsoft.ServiceLinker
   ```
   ```azurecli
   az provider register -n Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > You can check if these resource providers have already been registered by running the commands `az provider show -n "Microsoft.ServiceLinker" --query registrationState` and `az provider show -n "Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration" --query registrationState`.

1. Optionally, use the Azure CLI command to get a list of supported target services for AKS cluster.

   ```azurecli
   az aks connection list-support-types --output table
   ```

## Create a service connection

### [Using a workload identity](#tab/Using-Managed-Identity)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using Managed Identity requires you have the permission to [Microsoft Entra ID role assignment](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/howto-assign-access-portal.md). If you don't have the permission, your connection creation will fail. You can ask your subscription owner for the permission or use an access key to create the connection.

Use the Azure CLI command to create a service connection to a Blob Storage with a workload identity, providing the following information:

* **Source compute service resource group name:** the resource group name of the AKS cluster.
* **AKS cluster name:** the name of your AKS cluster that connects to the target service.
* **Target service resource group name:** the resource group name of the Blob Storage.
* **Storage account name:** the account name of your Blob Storage.
* **User-assigned identity resource ID:** the resource ID of the user assigned identity that is used to create workload identity

```azurecli
az aks connection create storage-blob \
    --workload-identity <user-identity-resource-id>
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have a Blob Storage, you can run `az aks connection create storage-blob --new --workload-identity <user-identity-resource-id>"` to provision a new one and get connected to your function app straightaway.

### [Using an access key](#tab/Using-access-key)

> [!WARNING]
> Microsoft recommends that you use the most secure authentication flow available. The authentication flow described in this procedure requires a very high degree of trust in the application, and carries risks that are not present in other flows. You should only use this flow when other more secure flows, such as managed identities, aren't viable.

Run the following Azure CLI command to create a service connection to an Azure Blob Storage with an access key, providing the following information.

```azurecli
az aks connection create storage-blob --secret
```

Provide the following information as prompted:

* **Source compute service resource group name:** the resource group name of the AKS cluster.
* **AKS cluster name:** the name of your AKS cluster that connects to the target service.
* **Target service resource group name:** the resource group name of the Blob Storage.
* **Storage account name:** the account name of your Blob Storage.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have a Blob Storage, you can run `az aks connection create storage-blob --new --secret` to provision a new one and connect it to your AKS cluster.

---

## View connections

Use the Azure CLI [az aks connection list](/cli/azure/functionapp/connection#az-functionapp-connection-list) command to list connections to your AKS Cluster, providing the following information:

* **Source compute service resource group name:** the resource group name of the AKS cluster.
* **AKS cluster name:** the name of your AKS cluster that connects to the target service.

```azurecli
az aks connection list \
    -g "<your-aks-cluster-resource-group>" \
    -n "<your-aks-cluster-name>" \
    --output table
```
