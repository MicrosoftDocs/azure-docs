# Service Connector region support

When you connect Cloud services together with Service Connector, the conceptual connection resource is provisioned into the same region as your compute service instance by default. This page shows the region support information.

## Supported regions with regional endpoints

If your compute service instance is located in one of the regions that Service Connector supports below, you can use Service Connector to create and manage service connections.

## Regions not supported

In regions where Service Connector isn't supported, you will still find Service Connector in the Azure portal and the Service Connector commands will appear in the Azure CLI, but you won't be able to create or manage service connections. The product team is working actively to enable more regions.
