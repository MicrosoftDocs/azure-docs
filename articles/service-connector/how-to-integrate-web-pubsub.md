# Integrate Azure Web PubSub with service connector

This page shows supported authentication methods and clients, and shows sample code you can use to connect Azure Web PubSub to other cloud services using Service Connector. You might still be able to connect to App Configuration using other methods. This page also shows default environment variable names and values you get when you create the service connection.

## Supported compute services

Service Connector can be used to connect the following compute services to Azure Web PubSub:

- Azure App Service
- Azure Container Apps
- Azure Functions
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Azure Spring Apps

## Supported authentication types and client types

The table below shows which combinations of authentication methods and clients are supported for connecting your compute service to Azure Web PubSub using Service Connector. A “Yes” indicates that the combination is supported, while a “No” indicates that it is not supported.

| Client type | System-assigned managed identity | User-assigned managed identity | Secret/connection string | Service principal |
|-------------|:--------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|:------------------------:|:-----------------:|
| .NET        |                Yes               |               Yes              |            Yes           |        Yes        |
| Java        |                Yes               |               Yes              |            Yes           |        Yes        |
| Node.js     |                Yes               |               Yes              |            Yes           |        Yes        |
| Python      |                Yes               |               Yes              |            Yes           |        Yes        |

This table indicates that all combinations of client types and authentication methods in the table are supported. Other client types are not supported to connect to Azure Web PubSub using Service Connector. 

## Default environment variable names or application properties and sample code

Use the environment variable names and application properties listed below, according to your connection's authentication type and client type, to connect compute services to Web PubSub using .NET, Java, Node.js, or Python. For each example below, replace the placeholder texts `<name>`, `<client-id>`, `<client-secret`, `<access-key>`, and `<tenant-id>` with your own resource name, client ID, client secret, access-key, and tenant ID. For more information about naming conventions, check the [Service Connector internals](concept-service-connector-internals.md#configuration-naming-convention) article.

### System-assigned managed identity

| Default environment variable name | Description           | Sample value                   |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| AZURE_WEBPUBSUB_HOST              | Azure Web PubSub host | `<name>.webpubsub.azure.com` |

#### Sample code

Refer to the steps and code below to connect to Azure Web PubSub using a system-assigned managed identity.
[!INCLUDE [code for web pubsub](./includes/code-webpubsub-me-id.md)]

### User-assigned managed identity

| Default environment variable name | Description                | Sample value                   |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| AZURE_WEBPUBSUB_HOST              | Azure Web PubSub host      | `<name>.webpubsub.azure.com` |
| AZURE_WEBPUBSUB_CLIENTID          | Azure Web PubSub client ID | `<client-id>`                |

#### Sample code

Refer to the steps and code below to connect to Azure Web PubSub using a user-assigned managed identity.
[!INCLUDE [code for web pubsub](./includes/code-webpubsub-me-id.md)]

### Connection string

> [!WARNING]
> Microsoft recommends that you use the most secure authentication flow available. The authentication flow described in this procedure requires a very high degree of trust in the application, and carries risks that are not present in other flows. You should only use this flow when other more secure flows, such as managed identities, aren't viable.
