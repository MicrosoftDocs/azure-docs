# Quickstart: Create a service connection in App Service with the Azure CLI

This quickstart describes the steps for creating a service connection in Azure App Service with the Azure CLI.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This quickstart requires version 2.30.0 or higher of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.
- This quickstart assumes that you already have at least an App Service running on Azure. If you don't have an App Service, [create one](../app-service/quickstart-dotnetcore.md).

## Initial set-up

1. If you're using Service Connector for the first time, start by running the command [az provider register](/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-register) to register the Service Connector resource provider.

   ```azurecli
   az provider register -n Microsoft.ServiceLinker
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > You can check if the resource provider has already been registered by running the command  `az provider show -n "Microsoft.ServiceLinker" --query registrationState`. If the output is `Registered`, then Service Connector has already been registered.
   >
2. Optionally, use the Azure CLI [az webapp connection list-support-types](/cli/azure/webapp/connection#az-webapp-connection-list-support-types) command to get a list of supported target services for App Service.

   ```azurecli
   az webapp connection list-support-types --output table
   ```

## Create a service connection

#### [Using a managed identity](#tab/Using-Managed-Identity)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using Managed Identity requires you have the permission to [Microsoft Entra role assignment](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/manage-roles-portal). Without this permission, creating a connection will fail. You can ask your subscription owner to grant you this permission or use an access key to create the connection.

Use the Azure CLI [az webapp connection](/cli/azure/webapp/connection) command to create a service connection to a Blob Storage with a system-assigned Managed Identity, providing the following information:

- The name of the resource group that contains the App Service
- The name of the App Service
- The name of the resource group that contains the storage account
- The name of the storage account

```azurecli
az webapp connection create storage-blob
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have a Blob Storage, you can run `az webapp connection create storage-blob --new --system-identity` to provision a new Blob Storage resource and directly connected it to your App Service instance.

#### [Using an access key](#tab/Using-access-key)

> [!WARNING]
> Microsoft recommends that you use the most secure authentication flow available. The authentication flow described in this procedure requires a very high degree of trust in the application, and carries risks that are not present in other flows. You should only use this flow when other more secure flows, such as managed identities, aren't viable.

Use the Azure CLI [az webapp connection create](/cli/azure/webapp/connection/create) command to create a service connection to an Azure Blob Storage with an access key, providing the following information:

- **Source compute service resource group name:** the resource group name of the App Service.
- **App Service name:** the name of your App Service that connects to the target service.
- **Target service resource group name:** the resource group name of the Blob Storage.
- **Storage account name:** the account name of your Blob Storage.

```azurecli
az webapp connection create storage-blob --secret
```

> [!TIP]
> If you don't have a Blob Storage, run `az webapp connection create storage-blob --new --secret` to provision a new one and directly get connected to your App Service resource.

---

## View connections

Run the Azure CLI [az webapp connection](/cli/azure/webapp/connection) command to list connections to your App Service, providing the following information:

- The name of the resource group that contains the App Service
- The name of the App Service

```azurecli
az webapp connection list -g "<your-app-service-resource-group>" -n "<your-app-service-name>" --output table
```
