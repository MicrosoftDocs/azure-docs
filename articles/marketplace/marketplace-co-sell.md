# Co-sell partner engagement

If you're a partner, you can use the Microsoft co-sell program to work directly with Microsoft on joint selling opportunities. The program helps our partners reach a vast community of customers and create new sales opportunities that can help accelerate business growth.

## Partner selling motions

Microsoft offers three partner selling motions:

* *Sell through partner* – You can resell Microsoft technology through your own sellers.
* *Services co-sell* – Sellers and partners collaborate to sell your project or managed services with Microsoft technology embedded.
* *IP co-sell* – Sellers and partners collaborate to sell your repeatable, packaged IP solution.*

\* Some of these IP co-sell solutions might receive additional incentives when they're successfully sold and deployed with Microsoft field sales teams.
