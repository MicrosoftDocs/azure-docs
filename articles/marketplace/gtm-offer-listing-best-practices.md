This section provides best practices and suggestions for publishing engaging marketplace offers. To write and configure your marketing materials log into [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).

| Offer Description | Provide a clear description that describes your offer's value proposition in the first few sentences, keeping in mind that those sentences may be used in search engine results. Core components of your value proposition should include: <br> <br> <ul> <li>Description of the product or solution</li> <li>User persona that benefits from the product or solution</li> <li>Customer need or pain the product or solution addresses</li> </ul> <br> <br> Use industry standard vocabulary or benefit-based wording when possible. Do not rely on features and functionality to sell your product. Instead, focus on the value you deliver. For Consulting Service listings, clearly state the professional service you provide. |

* **src**: Include the source from which the traffic is routed to AppSource (for example, website, LinkedIn, or Facebook).
* **mktcmpid**: Your marketing campaign ID, which can contain up to 16 characters in any combination of letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens (for example, *blogpost_12*).

The following example URL contains both of the preceding query parameters:
`https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.04931187-431c-415d-8777-f7f482ba8095?src=website&mktcmpid=blogpost_12`
