## Link to your offer page from your website

When you link from the AppSource or Azure Marketplace badge on your site to your listing in the marketplace, you can support strong analytics and reporting by including the following query parameters at the end of the URL:
* **src**: Include the source from which the traffic is routed to AppSource (for example, website, LinkedIn, or Facebook).
* **mktcmpid**: Your marketing campaign ID, which can contain up to 16 characters in any combination of letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens (for example, *blogpost_12*).

The following example URL contains both of the preceding query parameters:
`https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.04931187-431c-415d-8777-f7f482ba8095?src=website&mktcmpid=blogpost_12`

By adding the parameters to your AppSource URL, you can review the effectiveness of your campaign in the analytics dashboard in [Cloud Partner portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/#insights).
