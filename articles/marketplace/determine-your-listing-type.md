All virtual machines (VMs) published in the Azure Marketplace are tested for the Azure Certified program.

The certification program provides the following benefits: 
*   Your VM is compatible with the Azure platform and the Marketplace selling model.  
*   Your VM is tested for online image safety compliance, including viruses and malware.  
*   Your VM includes badging at the offer level. Badging as a validated solution enhances promotion for Microsoft enterprise customers.

|:--- |:--- |  
| Service offer characteristics | Your consulting service must meet the following criteria:<ul> <li>Deliver a fixed-scope, fixed-duration, fixed-price (or free) engagement.</li> <li>Be oriented primarily for pre-sales.</li> <li>Be limited to a single customer.</li> <li>Be conducted on-site.</li> </ul> |

#### <a name="requirements-for-list-contact-me"></a>Requirements for List: Contact Me  
Use the Contact Me offer type when using a Trial or Transact publishing option isn't feasible. The benefit of a Contact Me offer type is that you can immediately receive leads with an in-market solution. Your leads should be nurtured into the foundational deals to start your business flywheel. The drawback is that customer engagement is limited compared to other offer types.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer engagement is best with Trial and Transact offer types. The value of the Contact Me publishing option is the lead that you receive. If you choose the Contact Me publishing option, you must verify that your lead destination is configured and that you are ready to maximize your lead.  

### Trial  
Providing a trial experience increases the engagement level provided to your customers. An increased engagement level causes richer exposure to your solution. A Trial offer type enables customers to explore your solution before buying. With the Trial publishing option, you have a higher chance of promotion in your storefront. You should also expect more and richer leads from customer engagements.  

Your app or offer using the Trial publishing option is deployed to your trial environment, Azure subscription, or both. Other publishing options are deployed to the environment or Azure subscription of your customer. Your app or offer must be customer-led, without additional requirements to buy. Your app or offer must have minimal, if any, additional configuration to complete a use case. Your app or offer must include free support at least for the duration of the trial period. For best results, your customers should be nurtured and monitored along a deliberate evaluation path. You are encouraged to use leads provided in the Marketplace and from your own in-app intelligence. Use your leads to monitor and manage your customers.  

The Trial publishing option includes the following Offer types in Marketplace storefronts:  

| Offer type | Storefront | Details |  
|:---        |:---        |:---     |  
| Free/SaaS trial | AppSource | [Requirements for Trial](#requirements-for-trial) | 
| Free/SaaS trial | Azure Marketplace | [Requirements for Trial: Free trial/SaaS trial](#requirements-for-trial-free-saas-trial) |  
| Interactive demo | AppSource | [Requirements for Trial](#requirements-for-trial) |
| Interactive demo | Azure Marketplace | [Requirements for Trial: Interactive demo](#requirements-for-trial-interactive-demo) | 
| Test drive | AppSource | [Requirements for Trial](#requirements-for-trial) |  
| Test drive | Azure Marketplace | [Requirements for Trial: Test drive](#requirements-for-trial-test-drive) |

A test drive provides an evaluation at no additional cost to your customer. Your customer doesn't need to be an existing Azure customer to help generate higher-quality leads for you.  

| Benefit | Requirement |
