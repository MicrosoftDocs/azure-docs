# Manage names in Partner Center

Use the **Manage product names** page to view all the names that you've reserved for your solution, reserve additional names (for other languages or to change the name of your solution), and delete names you don't need. You can find this page in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/office/overview) by expanding the **Product management** section in the left navigation menu for any of your solution.

## Reserve additional names

Reserve multiple names to use for the same solution. This is useful if you're offering your solution in multiple languages and want to use localized display names for the localized listings. You can also reserve a new name to change the name of your solution.

To reserve a new name, find the text box in the **Reserve more names** section of the **Manage product names** page. Enter the name you'd like to reserve, then select **Check availability**. If the name is available, select **Reserve product name**. You can reserve multiple names by repeating these steps.

## Delete names

If you no longer want to use a name you previously reserved, you can release it by deleting it on the **Manage product names** page. Make sure you're certain before you do so, because the name will immediately become available for someone else to reserve and use. You can only delete a name if it isn’t in use in any listing.

To delete one of your reserved names, find the name you no longer want to use and then select **Delete**. In the confirmation dialog box, select **Delete** again to confirm.

Note that your solution must have at least one reserved name.

## Remove a draft solution

To remove a draft solution from Partner Center (and release all the names you've reserved), select **Delete** on the **Product setup** page. Note that if you've already published your solution to Microsoft AppSource, you can't remove it from Partner Center.

## Rename a published solution

If your solution is already in Microsoft AppSource and you want to rename it, you can do so by reserving a new name for it (as described earlier in this topic) and then publishing the update.

You must update your solution package to replace the old name with the new one and upload the updated package to your submission.

To update a Microsoft AppSource listing to use the new name, go to the Store listings page for that language and select the name from the **Product name** dropdown. Be sure to review your description and other parts of the listing for any mentions of the name and make updates if needed.

> [!NOTE]
> If your app has packages and/or listings in multiple languages, you'll need to update them for every language in which the name needs to be updated.

After your solution is published with the new name, you can delete any names that you no longer need to use.

> [!TIP]
> Each solution appears in Partner Center using the first name that you reserved for it. If you've followed these steps to rename a solution, and you'd like it to appear in Partner Center using the new name, select **Make alias** next to the new name.
