Business Process Libraries
==========================

Business process libraries are nothing but task guides of your end-end
scenarios. The business process library should directly align with your marketing content. Each business process in the business process library should have a [task recording](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/user-interface/task-recorder) associated with it. If you have processes that are outside Dynamics 365 for Operations, please attach a Visio to your BPM library.

See [Business Process Modeler](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/lcs-solutions/business-process-modeler-libraries-lcs-solutions) for more info.

Methodologies
=============

Lifecycle Services (LCS) for Microsoft Dynamics provides methodologies
that you can use to ensure a more repeatable and predictable
implementation project experience. You can use one of the provided
methodologies or create your own. With a methodology, you can easily
track and report on your progress.

A methodology consists of phases, tasks, and milestones. Each phase can have any number of tasks, some of which are mandatory. When all of the tasks in a phase are completed, the phase can be marked as complete. You can also create a milestone for when you anticipate a phase to be completed. The following methodologies are included in an LCS project:

- Implementation
- Sure Step
- Learn development
- Migrate and create solutions
- Consume solutions

See [LCS Methodologies](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/create-methodology) for more info.
