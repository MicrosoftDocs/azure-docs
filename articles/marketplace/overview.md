# What is the Microsoft commercial marketplace?

The Microsoft commercial marketplace is a catalog of solutions from our independent software vendor (ISV) partners. As an ISV member of the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program, you can create, publish, and manage your commercial marketplace offers in Partner Center. Your solutions are listed together with our Microsoft solutions, connecting you to businesses, organizations, and government agencies around the world.

The commercial marketplace is available in more than 100 countries and regions, and we manage tax payment in many of them. If you sell to established Microsoft customers, they have the added benefit of including commercial marketplace purchases in their existing Microsoft purchase agreements to receive a consolidated invoice from Microsoft.

The following video provides more information about transacting in the commercial marketplace.

## Commercial marketplace online stores

The Microsoft commercial marketplace as discussed in this article has two main online stores: 

- [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) for business solutions
- [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) for IT solutions

> [!NOTE]
> Other commercial marketplace software and services can also be found in Microsoft products such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, Microsoft Power Platform, and Azure. Our online stores and in-product experiences draw millions of potential customers each month. Each online store offers different scenarios to make sure your solution or service is available to the right customers.

### Microsoft AppSource

Here's an example of an offer listing page in AppSource:

### Which store should I choose?
When you create a commercial marketplace offer in Partner Center, it may be listed on either store based on the offer type, categories, and other options you select. In the rare case that the offer is relevant to the users of both online stores, it can appear in both. To learn more, see [Listing and pricing options by online store](determine-your-listing-type.md#listing-and-pricing-options-by-online-store).
