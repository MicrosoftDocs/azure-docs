# Test a SaaS plan overview

This article provides guidance about how to test a software as a service (SaaS) plan.

We recommend that you create a test SaaS plan in a separate test and development (DEV) offer. To learn how, see [Plan a test and development (DEV) SaaS offer](plan-saas-dev-test-offer.md). If you choose to create a test plan in a production offer instead, make sure that you create the test plan as a private plan and specify a preview audience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Never publish a test plan live.

## Overall flow

Create your test plan, preferably in a test and DEV offer.
- To learn how to plan a SaaS offer, see [Plan a SaaS offer for the commercial marketplace](plan-saas-offer.md).
- To understand the benefits of a test and DEV offer and the configuration differences between a test and DEV offer and a production (PROD) offer, see [Plan a test and development SaaS offer](plan-saas-dev-test-offer.md).
- For instructions on creating offers and plans, see [Create a SaaS offer](create-new-saas-offer.md).

Once you have the plan you want to test, do the following:
- [Preview and subscribe to the test plan](test-saas-preview-offer.md)
- [Test the SaaS plan](test-saas-plan.md)
- [Create a SaaS plan in your production offer](create-new-saas-offer-plans.md) with the prices you want to charge customers and publish your production offer.
- [Unsubscribe from and deactivate your test plan](test-saas-unsubscribe.md)

## Next steps

- After you create your test plan, you’ll then [Preview and subscribe to your offer](test-saas-preview-offer.md). From there, we’ll lead you through the remainder of the process, including how to test the offer, and how to clean up your test environment.
