# Update core sizes for an Azure virtual machine offer

Complete these steps when you are notified that new core sizes are now supported.

> [!NOTE]
> These steps apply regardless of the selected price entry option (free, flate rate, per core, per core size, per market and core size) and must be completed within the timeframe specified in the notification from Microsoft. Otherwise, we’ll publish the new core sizes at the price that we calculate for you.

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2166002).
1. On the Home page, select the **Marketplace offers** tile.

1. On the **Overview** page, select your VM offer.
1. On the **Offer overview** page, under **Plan overview**, select a plan within your offer.
1. In the left-nav menu, select **Pricing and availability**.
1. Do one of the following:
    - If either the _Per core size_ or _Per market and core size_ price entry options are used, under **Pricing**, verify the price and make any necessary adjustments for the new core sizes that have been added.
    - If your price entry option is set to _Free_, _Flat rate_, or _Per core_, go to step 7.
1. Select **Save draft** and then **Review and publish**. After the offer is republished, the new core sizes will be available to your customers at the prices that you have set.
