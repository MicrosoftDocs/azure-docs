# Review and publish a Dynamics 365 CE&PA offer

This article shows you how to use Partner Center to preview your draft Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement and Power Apps offer and then publish it to the commercial marketplace. It also cover how to check publishing status as it proceeds through the publishing steps.

## Offer status

You can review your offer status on the **Overview** tab of the commercial marketplace dashboard in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/overview). The **Status** of each offer will be one of the following:

| Status | Description |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Draft | Offer has been created but it isn't being published. |
| Publish in progress | Offer is working its way through the publishing process. |
| Attention needed | We discovered a critical issue during certification or during another publishing phase. |
| Preview | We certified the offer, which now awaits a final verification by the publisher. Select **Go live** to publish the offer live. |
| Live | Offer is live in the marketplace and can be seen and acquired by customers. |
| Pending stop sell | Publisher selected "stop sell" on an offer or plan, but the action has not yet been completed. |
| Not available in the marketplace | A previously published offer in the marketplace has been removed. |

## Validation and publishing steps

Your offer's publish status will change as it moves through the publication process. For detailed information on this process, see [Validation and publishing steps](review-publish-offer.md#validation-and-publishing-steps).

When you are ready to submit an offer for publishing, select **Review and publish** at the upper-right corner of the portal. You'll see the status of each page for your offer listed as one of the following:

   - **Not started** – The page is incomplete.
   - **Incomplete** – The page is missing required information or has errors that need to be fixed. You'll need to go back to the page and update it.
   - **Complete** – The page is complete. All required data has been provided and there are no errors.

If any of the pages have a status other than **Complete**, you need to correct the issue on that page and then return to the **Review and publish** page to confirm the status now shows as **Complete**. Some offer types require testing. If so, you will see a **Notes for certification** field where you need to provide testing instructions to the certification team and any supplementary notes helpful for understanding your app.

After all pages are complete and you have entered applicable testing notes, select **Publish** to submit your offer. We will email you when a preview version of your offer is available to approve. At that time:

1. Return to Partner Center.
1. Select the **Overview** tab in the left-nav menu bar.
1. Select the offer.
1. Select **Review and publish**.
1. Select **Go live** to make your offer publicly available.
