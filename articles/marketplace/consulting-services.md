# Consulting service offers

This article explains the eligibility criteria and requirements for publishing new consulting service offers to the commercial marketplace. Consulting service offers give Microsoft system-integrator partners the benefit of connecting their customers with services that support and extend their use of Azure. These consulting services help customers assess, evaluate, and deploy the business solutions that further their business objectives and goals.  

Consulting service offers are customer-specific engagements. Publishers have the option to determine the listing type, scope, duration, and pricing structure (fixed-price or free). Offers have a defined agenda for deliverables to the customer. Leads are received through a notification in partners' CRM systems, and partners aim to respond to customers within 48 hours.

## Compare consulting services

The commercial marketplace storefronts, Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace, are aligned with audiences and cloud products to help customers find what they need. Each storefront has specialized publishing options to help you maximize your publishing investment. To learn more about the difference between the two storefronts, see [Comparing Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/comparing-appsource-azure-marketplace).

Consulting services offers that are based on Dynamics 365, Power Apps, and Power BI are eligible to be listed on AppSource. For more information, download the [Microsoft AppSource consulting services listing guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=828734&clcid=0x409) PDF file.

Consulting services and managed services offers that are based on Microsoft Azure are eligible to be listed on Azure Marketplace.

## The publishing process

Listing your consulting-service offer on Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace involves the following stages:

1. **Listing** – Start drafting a new offer listing by signing in to your [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/partnership) account. In the drop-down list, select **New Offer**, and then select **Consulting Services**. Enter your listing artifact and publish.
2. **Validation** – Your request is reviewed to ensure that you meet the eligibility criteria. We then send you instructions for listing your consulting services offer.
3. **Submit** – Provide the required information that's listed in the instructions. All content and supporting material must be submitted in English.
4. **Review** – Our marketing and editorial team reviews your submission and optimizes it for readability, grammar, and effectiveness.
5. **Staging** – Your submission is staged for your review.
6. **Publishing** – When you and Microsoft are satisfied with the staged content, your listing is ready to go live on the marketplace. The go-live date for your listing depends on the country/region that's specified in your offer. If the catalog for your selected country/region is already live on Azure Marketplace or AppSource, your listing appears within a few hours. Otherwise, the listing appears as soon as the catalog goes live.

Offers must be of least one of the following five service types:

* **Assessment** – An evaluation of a customer's environment to determine the applicability of a solution and provide an estimate of cost and timing.
* **Briefing** – An introduction to a solution or a consulting service to draw customer interest by using frameworks, demos, and customer examples.
* **Implementation** – A complete installation that results in a fully working solution. We recommend limiting it to solutions that can be implemented in two weeks or less.
* **Proof of concept** – A limited-scope implementation to determine whether a solution meets customer requirements.
* **Workshop** – An interactive engagement that's conducted on a customer's premises. It can involve training, briefings, assessments, or demos that are built on the customer's data or environment.

> [!NOTE]
> The *Briefing* service type must be provided *in person*. You can provide the other four consulting services in either of two ways:
> * **In person** – Onsite at a customer's location or a partner's facility.
> * **Virtually** – Via teleconferencing, web conferencing, or remote implementation.

After you've configured the previously listed required elements, the content review team will validate that your offer description is informative and complete for your target audience. 

### The listing title

The title field has a 50-character limit and must transmit the duration and service type of the offer to maximize search engine optimization (SEO). The required format is *Name: Duration type*.

Examples:

|Sample title  |Correct format  |
|---------|---------|
|Getting Started with Azure IoT in Manufacturing    |   Manufacturing IoT: 2-Day Assessment      |
|Workshop on Smart Toasters        |  Smart Toasters: 1-Wk Workshop       |
|  SQL Server Migration PoC    | SQL Migration: 3-Wk Proof of Concept        |
||

### The listing summary and description

After the content review team reviews your offer descriptions and offer summaries, they'll apply the following criteria:

|Offer type  |Required |Recommended  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Assessment**    |   Include a detailed agenda for multi-day or multi-week assessments, and articulate what deliverable the customer can expect.      |    Optimize your offer summary with your top SEO keywords.     |
|**Briefing**    |   Articulate what deliverable the customer can expect. Remember, *Briefing* must be provided in person. If you're providing a virtual service, choose a different offer type.    |  Optimize your offer summary with your top SEO keywords.       |
|**Implementation**    |  Include a detailed agenda for multi-day or multi-week implementations, and articulate what engineering changes, technical artifacts, or other artifacts a customer can expect as outcomes of the engagement.       |    Optimize your offer summary with your top SEO keywords.     |
|**Proof of concept**    |    Articulate what engineering changes, technical artifacts, or other artifacts a customer can expect as outcomes of the engagement.     | Optimize your offer summary with your top SEO keywords.        |
|**Workshop**    |   Include a detailed agenda daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the duration of your offer. Articulate the learning goals or other deliverables of your workshop.     |   Optimize your offer summary with your top SEO keywords.      |

Within Partner Center, you can add formatting to your listing by using [Markdown](/contribute/markdown-reference), a lightweight design language that helps add polish to your listing.

Here are some Markdown tips:
* For *italic* formatting, add an asterisk (\*), without a space, at the beginning and end of a word or series of words (for example, type \*content* to format a word as *content*). Format your *Offer Summary* in italic.
* Insert a line break after a colon (:) to introduce a bulleted or numbered list.
* To create a bulleted list, type an asterisk (\*), followed by a space, for each bulleted item (for example, \*[space]First word of content).
* To create headings, type one or more pound signs (\#), followed by a space (for example, ###[space]Agenda/Deliverables).
* Add a line break after each heading.
* For **bold** formatting, add a double asterisk (\*\*), without a space, at the beginning and end of a word or series of words (for example, type \*\*content\*\* to format a word as **content**).
