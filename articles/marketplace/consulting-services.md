## How To Register For Consulting Services in Azure Marketplace
Start by registering your consulting services with [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/sell/signup). Publishers can reference [Become a Publisher in the Marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/become-publisher), for a complete check-list of registration requirements. 

**What To Expect After Registration**
The Onboarding Team will reach out in 1-3 business days with a welcome email which will include your Cloud Partner Portal (CPP) login information. [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com) is the offer listing portal where publishers submit listing information and submissions. 

>[!Note]
>Partners only need to register once to become a publisher. Once you receive your welcome email and Cloud Partner Portal login, publishers do not need to re-register in order to publish different listing types. 

## Prepare Your Publishing Artifacts

## Publishing Process
Listing your consulting-service offer on the Azure Marketplace involves the following stages:

1. **Request**: To send your request, use the [Azure Marketplace Nomination Form](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/sell/nominate) and tell us more about your organization. 
Note: Publishers will only need to submit nomination process once to list on either Azure Marketplace or AppSource. Once nomination and onboarding process has been completed, a Cloud Partner Portal will be created where publishers can create and submit their offer listings.
2. **Validation**: Your request is reviewed to ensure that you meet the eligibility criteria. We then send you instructions for listing your consulting services offering. 
3. **Submit**: Provide the required information that's listed in the instructions. All content and supporting material must be submitted in English. 
4. **Review**: Our marketing and editorial team reviews your submission and optimizes it for readability, grammar, and effectiveness. 
5. **Staging**: Your submission is staged for your review. 
6. **Publishing**: When you and Microsoft are satisfied with the staged content, your listing is ready to go live on the Azure Marketplace. The go-live date for your listing depends on the country that's specified in your offering. If the catalog for your selected country is already live on the Azure Marketplace, your listing will appear within a few hours. Otherwise, the listing will appear as soon as the catalog goes live.

## Offer Listings and Content Review Criteria
Offerings must be of one of the following five service types (you can list more than one): 

* **Assessment**: An evaluation of a customer’s environment to determine the applicability of a solution and provide an estimate of cost and timing. 
* **Briefing**: An introduction to a solution or a consulting service to draw customer interest by using frameworks, demos, and customer examples. 
* **Implementation**: A complete installation that results in a fully working solution. We recommend limiting it to solutions that can be implemented in two weeks or less. 
* **Proof of concept**: A limited-scope implementation to determine whether a solution meets customer requirements. 
* **Workshop**: An interactive engagement that's conducted on a customer’s premises. It can involve training, briefings, assessments, or demos that are built on the customer’s data or environment. 

**Note:** Except for the *Briefing* service type, consulting services can be offered in-person (that is, onsite at a customer’s location or a partner’s facility) or virtually (that is, via teleconferencing, web conferencing, or remote implementation). Briefings must be offered in person.

Once you have configured the required elements listed above, the content review team will validate that your offer description is informative and complete for your target audience. 

#### Listing Title

Note that the title field has a 50-character limit and must transmit the duration and service type of the offer. This is to maximize search engine optimization. The required format is as follows: NAME : DURATION TYPE

Examples:


|Sample Title  |Correct Format  |
|---------|---------|
|Getting Started with Azure IoT in Manufacturing    |   Manufacturing IoT: 2-Day Assessment      |
|Workshop on Smart Toasters        |  Smart Toasters: 1-Wk Workshop       |
