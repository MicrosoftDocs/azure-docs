## How to grow your business with AppSource
Following best practices in marketing your offers on AppSource helps you maximize your business benefits and set you up for success with Go-to-Market and Microsoft Co-Sell initiatives.

### Promote your offer’s availability on AppSource

When your offer is listed on AppSource, you’ve earned the right to display the “Available on AppSource” badge on your website. 
    ![Dev Center Email](./media/marketplace-publishers-guide/appsourcebadge.png)
Adding this badge to your site promotes that your offer on AppSource, and you can link potential customers directly to the listing page. The AppSource badge is available in three sizes. You can download the badge along with guidance on how to use it at [Promote your app's availability on Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/blogs/promote-your-app-s-availability-on-microsoft-appsource).

#### Linking to your app listing page on AppSource from your website 
When you link from the AppSource badge on your site to your listing on AppSource, you must include the following query parameters at the end of the URL:
* **src** — Include the source from where the traffic is routed to AppSource. For example, website, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.
* **mktcmpid** — Your marketing campaign ID, which can include up to 16 characters using any combination of letter, number, underscore, and hyphen. For example, blogpost_12 

The following example shows a URL that includes the two query parameters:

https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.04931187-431c-415d-8777-f7f482ba8095?src=website&mktcmpid=blogpost_12 

**Important:** When you prepare the URL, do not include the language code, such as /en-us/. 

Adding these parameters to your AppSource URL enables you to review the effectiveness of your campaign in the analytics dashboard in the Cloud Partner Portal. 

#### Marketplace GTM benefits 

New listings in AppSource are eligible to receive free marketplace GTM benefits. Once listed, our team of marketing specialists will reach out to you, and work with your marketing contact to kick-start these activities. 
The activities we provide differ depending on your solution status in our marketplace. Benefits increase for offers that come with a trial experience. Microsoft Gold partners can access additional benefits. 
To maximize the impact of these activities, we encourage you to have your launch plan ready to execute. You may want to leverage your landing page for many of these tactics. Note that One Commercial Partner (OCP) Catalog is a benefit of members in the Microsoft Partner Network. For guidance on how to build a great landing page, see [Build a Great Landing Page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/grow-your-business-azure-marketplace#build-a-great-landing-page). 
For additional go-to-market support including templates, web content, training, and tools to promote your business, visit [https://www.MicrosoftGoToMarket.com](https://www.MicrosoftGoToMarket.com). 

#### Enable lead sharing 
Ensure that lead management is enabled in your Marketplace offer so that you receive the contact information of business users that try your apps or are interested in your services. These leads provide the basis for outreach for nurture campaigns, sales motions by your field sales staff, and information about how your offer is performing. 
Best practices for using these leads include:
* Qualifying the leads and scoring them as sales opportunities
* Nurturing them to enter a sales pipeline
* Aligning these efforts with your overall marketing campaign strategy 

These leads demonstrate user interest in your app or consulting services offering. You want to ensure that you have a process in place to follow up with these leads. In addition to creating a lead in your CRM system, a lead might also be created in the Microsoft field seller CRM. 

However, AppSource leads are different from Microsoft seller-qualified leads that are a feature of the Co-Selling program. See below to learn about how to access the Co-Sell program. 

#### Promote Your Business Through Microsoft Programs 
There are many people and teams within Microsoft whose goal is to support our partners and reduce any friction you have in selling with us. By listing in our marketplace, you open access to our marketplace programs and resources. 

If you haven’t already signed up to the [Microsoft Partner Network (MPN)](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/), this should be your first step. MPN offers guidance for navigating Microsoft – from new business opportunities and connecting with teams or partners, to information about solutions and training to help grow your skill set. 

Additional steps you can take to open access to even more partner benefits and resources are to do the following. 
1. **Leverage your Core Benefits** - As part of our Microsoft Partner Network, you receive a set of [Core Benefits](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/membership/core-benefits) that can help you save time and money while you strengthen your capabilities, better serve customers and build connections to reach your full business potential. 
2. **Earn your Cloud Platform Competency** - Earning [Cloud Platform Competency](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/membership/cloud-platform-competency) allows you to differentiate yourself within Microsoft’s expansive partner network as well as demonstrate technical expertise and customer success in market. Earning a Competency is also a pre-requisite for many key partner programs like Co-Sell. 
3. **Become Co-Sell Ready** - The [Co-Sell Ready](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/reach-customers/promote-your-business) program allows you to collaborate directly with Microsoft sellers and other partners on target customer opportunities and account planning. Your solution becomes visible to our sellers in their solution catalog.

#### Search engine optimization 
You can influence the ranking of your offer in search engine results. Partner with your marketing team, identify keywords, and make sure to follow the guidance below to help improve your apps search results:
* Name your offer with search keywords in mind.
* Include search keywords in the offer summary.
* List the top three search keywords for your offer in the storefront details.
* Associate your offer with the correct category and industry.
* Regularly tweet about the availability of your offer and include a link to your offer.

#### Merchandising 
Microsoft Gold Partners can become eligible to have their app featured, when providing an app trial experience (free app, free trial, or Test Drive) on AppSource. Apps can be featured by category or industry, and are typically promoted for a minimum of two weeks.
