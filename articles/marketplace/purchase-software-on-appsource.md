# How to Purchase Software on Microsoft AppSource

Microsoft [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) now enables customers to subscribe to SaaS applications that are offered by Microsoft partners. Customers can find certified web applications on the store and can manage the charges, upgrades, downgrades, and cancellations in a single place using Microsoft's Admin Center. This article describes how you can purchase an app from the store.

## Requirements

To purchase SaaS offers, you need:

- A work or school account.

    > [!Note]
    > If you don't have a work or school account, you need to create an Azure Active Directory tenant to which a work or school account can be added. To learn more, see [Quickstart: Create a new tenant in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant).

- A valid credit card.

    > [!Note]
    > The credit card needs to belong to the country/region in which the customer is purchasing the offer. To select a different country, select "Change billing country/region" at the bottom of the page.

## Steps for making purchases on AppSource

1. Select your billing/country region on [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).
1. Find the application you wish to purchase.

    > [!Note]
    > AppSource provides you a selection of apps to choose from, including free, trials and paid subscriptions. This article describes how paid subscriptions can be purchased via AppSource.

1. Select **Get it now**.
1. Choose the plan:

    1. Set the number of seats
    1. Set the billing term.
    
1. Enter your billing address.
1. Enter your payment method:
    * Credit cards supported: Visa, Master Card, American Express, Discover.

## How to configure software post-purchase

After your order is received, it can take several seconds to get confirmed. You will receive a link to configure your SaaS subscription on the page, as well as an email confirming the purchase and the link to complete the configuration.

1. On the **Order Confirmation** page, select **Configure**. Alternatively, you can use the Configuration link sent to you in the confirmation email.
1. Complete provisioning and set up on the software provider's website.

    > [!Note]
    > This step is mandatory and can be completed at any time.
