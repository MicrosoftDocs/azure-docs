# Preferred Solutions in Azure Marketplace and AppSource

A Microsoft preferred solution is a cloud application selected for its quality, performance, and ability to address customer needs in a certain industry vertical or solution area. A team of Microsoft industry and sales experts selects solutions from Microsoft Partner Network [Gold membership](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/membership/core-benefits) partners. These solutions are featured in our cloud marketplace storefronts: Azure Marketplace and AppSource. Preferred solutions on AppSource can be discovered by industry verticals, while on Azure Marketplace you can click within solution area categories 

Microsoft will contact solution providers if one or more of their solutions has been selected as a preferred solution.
