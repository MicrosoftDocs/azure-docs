# Configure Dynamics 365 Business Central offer properties

This page lets you define the categories used to group your offer on Microsoft AppSource, your application version, and the legal contracts that support your offer.

## Categories

Select categories and subcategories to place your offer in the appropriate AppSource search areas. Be sure to describe later in the offer description how your offer supports these categories.

- Select a Primary category.
- To add a second optional category (Secondary), select the **+Categories** link.
- Select up to two subcategories for the Primary and/or Secondary category. If no subcategory is applicable to your offer, select **Not applicable**. Use Ctrl+click to select a second subcategory.

See the full list of categories and subcategories in [Offer Listing Best Practices](gtm-offer-listing-best-practices.md).

### Industries

[!INCLUDE [Industry Taxonomy](./includes/industry-taxonomy.md)].

Enter an **App version** for your offer. Customers will see this number listed on the offer's detail page.

### Legal

Provide the **Terms and conditions** customers must accept before they can try your offer. You can also provide the web address where your terms and conditions can be found.

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu, **Offer listing**.
