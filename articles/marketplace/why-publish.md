# Why publish your app with Microsoft’s app stores

Your app can be distributed directly through the Microsoft 365 app stores inside of Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, Teams, and SharePoint, where millions of customers around the world are working everyday. Your app might be featured as an Editor’s Choice app, instantly reaching customers.

In addition to the Microsoft 365 app store, Microsoft AppSource is another distribution point for your app. It is the official app store for Microsoft 365 apps and solutions.
