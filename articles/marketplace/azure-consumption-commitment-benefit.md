# Azure consumption commitment benefit

A select set of Microsoft commercial marketplace offers will contribute towards your organization’s Microsoft Azure consumption commitment if your organization has one of these agreements:

- Microsoft Azure consumption commitment (MACC)
- Azure commit to consume (CtC)

We validate all offers that participate in this program to ensure you receive high-quality solutions.

To take advantage of this benefit, simply purchase a qualifying offer on Azure Marketplace using a subscription that’s related to your Azure agreement. Azure prepayment and monetary commitments are not eligible for this benefit.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Exclusions may apply to CtC agreements signed prior to this marketplace benefit. If you have questions about eligibility, contact your Microsoft account executive.

## Determine if your organization has an Azure consumption commitment (MACC/CtC)

If you are unsure if your organization has a qualifying agreement, sign in to the Marketplace experience within the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/MarketplaceOffersBlade/selectedMenuItemId/home) under a tenant associated with your organization. If you see the **Azure benefit eligible** option within the Pricing filter, you have a qualifying Azure consumption commitment. Qualifying Azure Marketplace purchases will contribute towards your organization’s Azure consumption commitment if purchased directly through the Azure Marketplace.

## Determine which offers are eligible for Azure consumption commitments (MACC/CtC)

1. Sign in to the Marketplace experience within the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/MarketplaceOffersBlade/selectedMenuItemId/home) under a tenant associated with your organization.
2. Apply the **Azure benefit eligible** filter (image above) to discover offers that are eligible to contribute towards your organization’s Azure consumption commitment.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not have this filter, your organization does not have a qualifying commitment. Please contact your Microsoft account executive if you believe this is incorrect.
 
3. Offers will be badged with **Azure benefit eligible** to further indicate that the software/IP costs associated with this offer will contribute towards your organization’s Azure consumption commitment on top of any Azure services billed to your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Azure services billed to your organization through an Azure Marketplace deployment will inherently contribute towards your organization’s commitment. The added benefit to “Azure benefit eligible” offers is that software/IP costs passed through by the 3rd-party vendor will also contribute at 100% of your Azure Marketplace invoice.

4. Purchase/create the offer directly through the Azure Marketplace. Microsoft will contribute 100% of qualifying offer purchases towards your organization’s Azure consumption commitment at each invoice period, including software/IP costs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Offers must be purchased directly via the Azure Marketplace with an enrollment related to your organization’s Azure consumption commitment for the purchase to contribute towards your commitment. Offers purchased through Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), any other reseller channel, or outside of marketplace do not contribute towards your commitment.
