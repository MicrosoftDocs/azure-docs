## Benefits of participating in the Marketplace 

The Marketplace is the launch pad for joint go-to-market activities with Microsoft that can help accelerate your business growth. By using launch promotion, demand generation, and joint sales and marketing, your Marketplace offers can be the centerpiece of your cloud business engine. There are no fees for participating in the Marketplace.

Our goal is to connect Microsoft customers with the best solutions that our partner ecosystem offers. To do that, we support you throughout your journey, from onboarding to publishing and growth. 

Take advantage of the capabilities in the Marketplace to grow your business.

### Expand to new markets and segments and generate new sales opportunities

Use the Marketplace as a channel to access new markets, segments, and Microsoft cloud users with your portfolio of solutions. Generate new marketing leads, and nurture new leads to sales opportunities. Benefit from joint marketing and sales activities to get more customers.

### Enhance business value and increase deal size with existing and new customers 

Upsell and cross-sell your solutions by addressing customer problems after you move workloads to the cloud. If you sell or deploy through the Marketplace, you can reduce sales cycles, accelerate projects, and increase deal profitability by selling complete solutions that target specific workloads and industry scenarios. 

### Get actionable insights 

Get insights on the performance of your listings through the insights and analytics that are available to you through the Marketplace. Get more information about campaign performance, orders and payouts, and how to maximize campaign activities for your solution.

### Marketplace go-to-market benefits 

New listings in the Marketplace are eligible for a diverse set of free benefits to help partners grow their business in the Marketplace. These benefits fall into the following categories: 

*   Technical: Everything you need to get your application ready for launch. From technical support, application design, and architecture design, to Azure credits for development and testing. 

*   Co-marketing: Everything you need to launch your offer. Access free Microsoft Go-To-Market Launch Fundamentals to help you launch and promote your solution. You might also be eligible for additional Microsoft marketing campaign inclusion and opportunities to be featured in the Marketplace.

*   Co-selling: Begin or accelerate your journey to selling with Microsoft through the Marketplace. Access programs and support to drive joint sales with Microsoft teams.

After you [submit your solution](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/sell/signup) to the Marketplace, our onboarding team contacts you to support your publishing experience.

## Storefronts
In a storefront, you can list offers, enable trials, and transact directly with Microsoft customers. Microsoft provides distinct storefronts in the Marketplace and AppSource. For details and a comparison of storefronts, see the following articles:
*   [Comparing AppSource and the Azure Marketplace](./comparing-appsource-azure-Marketplace.md)
*   [Grow your business with AppSource](./grow-your-business-with-appsource.md)
*   [Grow your business with the Azure Marketplace](./grow-your-business-with-azure-Marketplace.md)

Storefronts help customers find, try, and buy apps and services that accelerate the customer's digital transformation. Storefronts help you grow your businesses by increasing access to Microsoft customers and partners.
 
Each storefront provides specialized options to help you maximize your publishing investment. The following table summarizes these options:
