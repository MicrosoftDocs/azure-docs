# Integrated solutions in the commercial marketplace
An integrated solution brings together best-of-breed technologies from Microsoft partners, along with consultation, deployment, and supports provided by expert services partners.

Two or more Microsoft partners integrate their technology and services to create a unified, seamless, and repeatable deployment experience, and this helps get customers up and running rapidly.  The lead partner in the solution (usually the services partner) provides a single point of contact for the customer, providing relevant customization, consulting, and support around the solution.

In other scenarios, partners co-sell or co-market their solution together, whereas an integrated solution is a jointly built new solution that integrates the technology and services across partners.

## Advantages

Advantages of an integrated approach are:

* *Industry expertise*: Service partners providing industry-specific solutions and knowledge
* *Time to value*: Integrated deployment approach to help you realize immediate benefits
* *Best-of-breed solutions*: Discover the ease of an integrated buying and implementation experience
