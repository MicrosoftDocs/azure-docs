# Co-sell with Microsoft sales teams and partners overview

Co-selling with Microsoft is defined as any collaborative engagement between Microsoft and our partner ecosystem. This process includes building demand, sales planning, sharing sales leads, accelerating partner-to-partner empowered selling, and delivering marketplace-led commerce.

When you choose to co-sell an offer, you can work directly with Microsoft sales teams and Microsoft partners on joint selling opportunities. This unlocks benefits when selling through the commercial marketplace online stores: Azure Marketplace and Microsoft AppSource.

Co-selling opportunities are the result of [acting on a lead](./partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads.md), collaborating on it with Microsoft sales teams or Microsoft partners to provide a solution for a customer need.

These solutions (also called offers) can include software built with your intellectual property (IP) and services that support Microsoft technologies.

## Co-sell opportunities

A co-sell opportunity is any type of collaboration with Microsoft sales teams, Microsoft partners, or both to sell products and solutions that meet customer needs. Some of the key categories of co-sell are:

- **Co-sell with Microsoft sales teams** – Work with one or more Microsoft sales teams to actively fulfill customer needs. This can include selling your offers, Microsoft’s offers, or both. You and Microsoft sales teams can identify and share customer opportunities in which your solutions may be a good fit.
- **Partner to Partner (P2P)** – Work with another Microsoft partner to actively solve a customer problem.
- **Private deal** – Share what you are independently working on with Microsoft so it will be reflected in the Microsoft reporting system for analysis and forecasting.
- **Solution Assessment (SA)** – Work with partners who are vetted by the solution assessments business team to assess the technology needs of customers who are using or planning to use Microsoft technologies.

## Co-sell statuses

These are the levels of co-sell status that can be applied to an offer.

Co-sell statuses for Azure:

- Not co-sell ready
- Co-sell ready
- Azure IP co-sell incentive

Co-sell statuses for business applications
- Business Applications Co-sell Incentive Standard
- Business Applications Co-sell Incentive Premium  

For details about the requirements to achieve these co-sell statuses, see [Co-sell requirements](co-sell-requirements.md).

## Benefits of co-sell ready status

Co-sell ready status exposes your solutions to Microsoft sales teams. Co-selling with Microsoft sales teams and Microsoft partners helps you reach a vast community of Microsoft-managed customers to collaborate on sales opportunities that accelerate your business growth.

To learn how to achieve co-sell ready and Azure IP co-sell status, see [Co-sell ready and co-sell incentive requirements](co-sell-requirements.md).

## Benefits of co-sell incentive status

_Co-sell incentivized_ status includes _Azure IP Co-sell incentivized_ and _Business Applications Co-sell incentivized (Standard and Premium)_. These statuses incentivize Microsoft sales teams to sell your offer. To achieve this status, you must also achieve Co-sell ready status. Co-sell incentive status earns all the benefits of Co-sell ready status and can earn additional incentives for Microsoft sales teams, and be eligible for more commercial marketplace benefits.

Azure IP Co-sell incentive status can be applied to these offer types:

- Azure Application
- Azure Container
- Azure Virtual Machine
- IoT Edge module
- Software as a service (SaaS)

Business Applications Co-sell incentive (Standard and Premium) status can be applied to these offer types:

- Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement & PowerApps
- Dynamics 365 for operations

Offers that achieve _Azure IP Co-sell incentivized_ status gain these commercial marketplace benefits:

- Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners receive a 10% incentive to sell your IaaS solution or SaaS offer. To learn more about the CSP program, see [Cloud Solution Provider program](cloud-solution-providers.md).
- Sales of your offer through Azure Marketplace will contribute towards customers’ Azure consumption commitments. Eligible customers will see the offer marked as **Azure benefit eligible** in Azure portal. To learn more about how the MACC program benefits customers and how they can find solutions that are enabled for MACC, see [Azure Consumption Commitment benefit](/marketplace/azure-consumption-commitment-benefit). For information about how publishers can get their transactable offer enrolled in MACC, see [Azure consumption commitment enrollment](azure-consumption-commitment-enrollment.md).
- Offers that achieve _Azure IP Co-sell incentivized_ status or are enrolled in the [Microsoft Business Applications ISV Connect Program](business-applications-isv-program.md) with Co-sell ready status will receive a **Microsoft Preferred solutions** badge on the offer listing page in the online stores: [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) and [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).  After an offer achieves the corresponding status, it may take up to 30 days for the preferred solution badge to be displayed in the online store. The badge promotes an offer's quality, performance, and ability to address customer needs in a certain industry vertical or solution area.
