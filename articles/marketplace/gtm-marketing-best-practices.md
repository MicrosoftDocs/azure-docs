# Marketing best practices

Keep marketing best practices in mind as you create and list offers to the commercial marketplace, provide customer trials, and connect with Microsoft customers and the partner community. If you optimize your offer listings and go-to-market campaigns, you can accelerate your customer acquisition. Download the [Azure Marketplace & AppSource best practice guide](https://aka.ms/marketplacebestpractices) to learn how to get the most out of your online marketing efforts.
