# Standard Contract

To simplify the procurement process for customers and reduce legal complexity for software vendors, Microsoft offers a Standard Contract template in order to help facilitate a transaction in the marketplace. Rather than crafting custom terms and conditions, Azure Marketplace publishers can choose to offer their software under the Standard Contract, which customers only need to vet and accept once. The Standard Contract can be found here: [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2041178](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2041178). 

The terms and conditions for an offering are defined on the Marketplace tab when creating an offer in the Cloud Partner Portal. The Standard Contract option is enabled by changing the setting to Yes.

>[!Note] 
>If you choose to use the Standard Contract, separate terms and conditions are still required for the [Cloud Solution Provider](./cloud-solution-providers.md) channel.
