# Comparing AppSource and Azure Marketplace  
The storefronts serve unique customer requirements. The storefronts enable targeting by role. You may offer the right solution or service based upon your customer.  

## Understanding the Differences between the storefronts  
Choosing a storefront starts with identifying the target audience for your offer. If targeting both audiences, then you may publish once to sell in both storefronts.  
 
Consider the additional benefits for the storefronts.   

### AppSource  

| Benefits | Details | 
|:--- |:--- | 
| ***Billing flexibility*** | Provisions a trial experience. Does not currently offer a commerce-enabled publishing option. You may use your current ordering and billing infrastructure with no additional investment or changes. | 
| ***Facilitation of connections with other partners*** | Links independent software vendors, systems integrators, and managed service providers to specific implementation scenarios. You may collaboratively sell to new customers. | 
| ***Automation*** | Links independent software vendors, systems integrators, and managed service providers to specific implementation scenarios. You may collaboratively sell to new customers. |  
| ***Multiple cloud types*** | Does not currently support Azure Stack, Azure Government, or regional clouds. | 
| ***In-context presentation to customers*** | Reach more customers through the in-app experience for Microsoft products such as Dynamics 365, Power BI, and Office 365. |  

### Azure Marketplace  

| Benefits | Details | 
|:--- |:--- | 
| ***Billing flexibility*** | For VMs, Pay-As-You-Go billing options use Microsoft Enterprise Agreements (EAs) or web direct sales models. Pricing options include a Free Tier subscription where an offering is perpetually free. Pricing options also include a Try It Now subscription. A Try It Now subscription is promotionally free for a limited period; after which the VM is converted to a paid subscription. BYOL activation is also an option for supporting you.<br />For both billing options and the following VM offers, all provisioned Azure resources are billed directly to the customer.<ul> <li>Azure apps: Managed app</li> <li>Azure apps: Solution template</li> </ul> | 
| ***Facilitation of connections with other partners*** | You are not currently able to link a service provider or delivery partners to your offer. This functionality is launching in 2018. | 
| ***Automation*** | You are not currently able to link a service provider or delivery partners to your offer. Take advantage of automated SaaS with add-on provisioning. Use Azure apps: Solution template to automate SaaS-based data collection and deployment scenarios. |  
| ***Multiple cloud types*** | Publish on both public cloud and on-premises solutions using the following types.<ul> <li>Azure Stack</li> <li>Azure Government</li> <li>regional clouds, including China and Germany</li> </ul> |
