# Comparing AppSource and the Azure Marketplace
Storefronts in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com) and [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com) serve unique customer requirements. Use storefronts to target customers by role. You can offer the right solution or service based on your customer.

## Understanding the differences between storefronts
To choose a storefront, begin by identifying the target audience for your offer. If you're targeting audiences in multiple storefronts, you can publish once to sell in multiple storefronts.
 
The following table describes the benefits of using a storefront:

| Benefits | AppSource | Azure Marketplace |
|:--- |:--- | :--- |
| **Billing flexibility** | Provisions a trial experience. Currently, doesn't offer a commerce-enabled publishing option. You can use your current ordering and billing infrastructure with no additional investment or changes. | For VMs, Pay-As-You-Go billing options use Microsoft Enterprise Agreements (EAs) or web direct sales models. Pricing options include a Free Tier subscription, in which an offering is perpetually free. Pricing options also include a Try It Now subscription. A Try It Now subscription is promotionally free for a limited period. When the period ends, the VM is converted to a paid subscription. Bring Your Own License (BYOL) activation is also an option that you can use for customers.<br /><br/>For both billing options and the following VM offers, all provisioned Azure resources are billed directly to the customer:<ul> <li>Azure apps: Managed app</li> <li>Azure apps: Solution template</li> </ul> |
| **Connections with other partners** | Links independent software vendors, system integrators, and managed service providers to specific implementation scenarios. You can collaboratively sell to new customers. | Currently, you can't link a service provider or delivery partners to your offer. | 
| **Automation** | Links independent software vendors, system integrators, and managed service providers to specific implementation scenarios. You can collaboratively sell to new customers. | Currently, you can't link a service provider or delivery partners to your offer. Take advantage of automated software as a service (SaaS) with add-on provisioning. Use the Azure apps: Solution template publishing option to automate SaaS-based data collection and deployment scenarios. |
| **Multiple cloud types** | Currently, doesn't support Azure Stack, Azure Government, or regional clouds. | Publish solutions for both the public cloud and on-premises by using the following types:<ul> <li>Azure Stack</li> <li>Azure Government</li> <li>Regional clouds, including China and Germany</li></ul> |
| **In-context presentation to customers** | Reach more customers through the in-app experience for Microsoft products such as Dynamics 365, Power BI, and Office 365. | Make your solution available in the Azure in-portal experience for contextual search. Use the Virtual machine and Azure apps: Solution template publishing options. |
