# Ratings and Reviews dashboard in commercial marketplace analytics

This article provides information on the Ratings and Reviews dashboard in Partner Center. This dashboard displays a consolidated view of customer feedback for offers on Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace. As customers browse, search, and purchase offers in both marketplaces, they can leave ratings and reviews for the offers they've acquired.

- Customers can submit a new rating or review and update or delete an existing rating or review they have submitted. Customers can make changes only to the ratings and reviews they own.  
- Reviews are posted on the Reviews tab on the product display page of the offer in Azure Marketplace or AppSource. Customers can include their name or post anonymously.

These filters are applied at the Ratings and Reviews page level. Select multiple filters to render the chart for what you want to see in Microsoft AppSource or Azure MarketPlace. Filters are applied on the data extracted for the month range you selected on the upper-right corner of the page.

The page has dashboard-level filters for the following:

- Rating
- Reply Status

Each filter is expandable with multiple options that you can select. Filter options are dynamic and based on the selected date range.

## Ratings and reviews summary

The summary section displays the following metrics for a selected date range:
