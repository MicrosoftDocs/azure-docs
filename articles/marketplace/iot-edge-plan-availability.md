# Set plan availability for an IoT Edge Module offer

If you want to hide your published offer so customers can't search, browse, or purchase it in the marketplace, select the **Hide plan** check box.

## Set plan availability

This field is commonly used when:

- The offer is only to be used only indirectly when referenced though another application.
- The offer should not be purchased individually.
- The plan was used for initial testing and is no longer relevant.
- The plan was used for temporary or seasonal offers and should no longer be offered.

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the **Plan overview** left-nav menu, **Technical configuration**.
