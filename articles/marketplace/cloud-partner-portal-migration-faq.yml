title: Cloud Partner Portal migration FAQ

  The Cloud Partner Portal has transitioned to Partner Center. Partner Center offers a streamlined, integrated experience for publishing new offers to [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) or [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) and for managing existing offers that were migrated from the Cloud Partner Portal. All the functions of the Cloud Partner Portal are available in Partner Center. This article addresses commonly asked questions about transitioning from the Cloud Partner Portal to Partner Center.

      - question: |
          What does the transition to Partner Center mean for me?
        answer: |
          You can continue doing business in Partner Center:
          
          | Area | Changes |
          | --- | --- |
          | Account | No need to create a new Partner Center account; you can use your existing Cloud Partner Portal credentials to sign in to Partner Center where you will now manage your account, users, permissions, and billing. The publishing agreement and company profile information are migrated to your new Partner Center account, along with any payout profile information, user accounts and permissions, and active offers. Learn more at [Manage your commercial marketplace account in Partner Center](manage-account.md). |
          | Offer publishing and offer management experience | We've moved your offer data from the Cloud Partner Portal to Partner Center. You will now access your offers in Partner Center, which offers an improved user experience and intuitive interface. Learn how to [Update existing offers in the commercial marketplace](update-existing-offer.md). |
          | Availability of your offers in the commercial marketplace | No changes. If your offer is live in the commercial marketplace, it will continue to be live. |
          | New purchases and deployments | No changes. Your customers can continue purchasing and deploying your offers with no interruptions. |
          | Payouts | Any purchases and deployments will continue to be paid out to you as normal. Learn more about [Getting paid in Partner Center](/partner-center/marketplace-get-paid?context=/azure/marketplace/context/context). |
          | API integrations with existing [Cloud Partner Portal APIs](cloud-partner-portal-api-overview.md) | Existing Cloud Partner Portal APIs are still supported and your existing integrations still work. Learn more at [Are the Cloud Partner Portal REST APIs still supported?](#are-the-cloud-partner-portal-rest-apis-still-supported-) |
          | Analytics | You can continue to monitor sales, evaluate performance, and optimize your offers in the commercial marketplace by viewing analytics in Partner Center. There are differences between how analytics reports display in CPP and Partner Center. For example, **Seller Insights** in CPP has an **Orders & Usage** tab that displays data for usage-based offers and non-usage-based offers, while in Partner Center the **Orders** page has a separate tab for SaaS Offers.

      - question: |
          Do I need to create a new account to manage my offers in Partner Center?
        answer: |
          No, your account will be preserved. This means that if you're an existing partner, you can use your existing Cloud Partner Portal account credentials to sign in to Partner Center. Don't create a new account or any offers created in Cloud Partner Portal and moved to Partner Center won't be associated with it.

      - question: |
          What about offers I published in the Cloud Partner Portal?
        answer: |
          The offers were moved to Partner Center and will be accessible to you after you sign in to Partner Center, with the exception of Dynamics Nav Managed Service and Cortana Intelligence offers. If your offer was live in the commercial marketplace, it will continue to be live and your customers will continue to be able to purchase and deploy it without interruptions. See the next question, **What offers were moved to Partner Center?** for more details.

      - question: |
          What offers were moved to Partner Center?

        answer: |
          The Cloud Partner Portal APIs are integrated with Partner Center and will continue to work. The transition to Partner Center introduces small changes. Review the table below to ensure your code continues to work in Partner Center.
          
          | API | Change description | Impact |
          | --- | --- | --- |
          | POST Publish, GoLive, Cancel | For migrated offers, the response header will have a different format but will continue to work in the same way, denoting a relative path to retrieve the operation status. | When sending any of the corresponding POST requests for an offer, the Location header will have one of two formats depending on the migration status of the offer: <ul><li>Non-migrated offers: `/api/operations/{PublisherId}${offerId}$2$preview?api-version=2017-10-31`</li><li>Migrated offers: `/api/publishers/{PublisherId}/offers/{offereId}/operations/408a4835-0000-1000-0000-000000000000?api-version=2017-10-31`</li></ul>|
          | GET Operation | For offers that previously supported a 'notification-email' field in the response, this field will be deprecated and no longer returned for migrated offers. | For migrated offers, we'll no longer send notifications to the list of emails specified in the requests. Instead, the API service will align with the notification email process in Partner Center to send emails. Specifically, notifications of operation progress will be sent to the email address set in the Seller contact info section of your account settings in Partner Center.<br><br>Ensure the email address set in the Contact info section in the [Account settings](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/account/v3/organization/legalinfo#developer) in Partner Center is correct to receive notifications. |
