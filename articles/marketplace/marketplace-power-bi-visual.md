# Plan a Power BI visual offer

This article highlights the content and requirements you need to have ready or completed to publish a Power BI visual offer in Partner Center for Microsoft [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com). Power BI visuals are packages that help users visualize the data served to them. Anyone can create a custom visual and package it as a single PBIVIZ file that can be imported into a Power BI report.

Before you start, [create a commercial marketplace account](./create-account.md) in Partner Center and ensure it is enrolled in the commercial marketplace program. Also, review the publishing [process](/office/dev/store/submit-to-appsource-via-partner-center) and [guidelines](/legal/marketplace/rating-review-policies).

## Publishing benefits

Benefits of publishing to AppSource:

- Promote your company by using the Microsoft brand.
- Potentially reach more than 100 million Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 users on AppSource and more than 200,000 organizations through Azure Marketplace.
- Have your services promoted by the Microsoft field and telesales teams.
