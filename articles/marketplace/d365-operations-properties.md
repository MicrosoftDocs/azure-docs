- Select a Primary category.
- To add a second optional category (Secondary), select the **+Categories** link.
- Select up to two subcategories for the Primary and/or Secondary category. If no subcategory is applicable to your offer, select **Not applicable**. Use Ctrl+click to select a second subcategory.
