Offer listing content is not required to be in English as long as the offer description begins with the phrase "This application is available only in [non-English language]." You can also link to a site that offers content in a language other than the one that's used in the offer listing content.

## Marketplace media

### Logos

Provide a PNG file for the **Large** size logo. Partner Center will use this to create a **Small** and a **Medium** logo. You can optionally replace these with different images later. These logos are used in different places in the listing:
