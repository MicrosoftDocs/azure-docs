# Support for the commercial marketplace program in Partner Center

Microsoft provides support for a wide variety of products and services. Finding the right support team is important to ensure an appropriate and timely response. Consider the following scenarios, which should help you route your query to the appropriate team: 

- If you're a publisher and have a question from a customer, ask your customer to request support using the support links in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). 

- If you're a publisher and have a question relating to your app or service, review the following support options.

## Support options for publishers

1. Sign in to the [Commercial Marketplace program on Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/overview) with your work account. (If you have not yet done so, you will need to [create a Partner Center account](./create-account.md).)

2. In the upper menu on the right side of the page, select the **Support** icon. 
 
3. The **Help and support** pane will appear from the right-hand side of the page.
