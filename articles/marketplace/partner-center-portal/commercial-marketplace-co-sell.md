# Co-sell option in Partner Center

Providing information on the Co-sell tab is entirely optional. It is required to achieve Co-sell Ready and IP Co-sell Incentivized status. The information you provide will be used by Microsoft sales teams to learn more about your offer when evaluating its fit for customer needs. It is not available directly to customers. For more information, see [sell through Microsoft](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/sell-with-microsoft).

The Co-sell option in Partner Center is currently available for some offer types. Support for additional offer types will be made available over time.

## Listing

Co-sell listings will help Microsoft sales teams market your offer to a wider audience. *(All fields required.)*

- Choose the Microsoft platforms that your offer is built with, extends, or integrates with.
- Select  market segments that your offer is targeting.
- Select a [solution type](#solution-type) for your offer.
- Choose up to three [solution areas](#solution-areas) and sub-areas.

### Solution type

Solution types help define the scenarios that your offer is designed to address.

| **Solution type**    | **Description**  |
| :------------------- | :-------------------|
| Device (hardware) | An offer that involves building or selling hardware from a device manufacturer. |
| IP (application) | Apps or other copyrightable material licensed for the customer's use. For example: a CRM program that can be licensed and installed on-premises. |
| Service | Hands-on expertise for a specific one-time project, often delivered via consultants. For example: setting up a customer database for a client (with the client assuming responsibility for operating the database after delivery). |
| Managed Service | Hands-on expertise for a cloud-based project, usually on an ongoing basis. For example: Providing a platform and tools for running an online database, with ongoing management provided by the managed service provider. |

### Solution areas

Solution areas help to further define your solution.

You can add up to three solution areas for your offer. For each solution area, you can choose up to two solution subareas. To select multiple subcategories, use the `Ctrl` key (on Windows) or Command key (on macOS).

## Documents

You have the option to provide collateral documents that Microsoft will use to learn more about your offer and evaluate its fit for your customer needs.

| **Documents**    | **Description**  |
| :------------------- | :-------------------|
| *Customer one-pager (Required)* | Customer-ready description of your offering. Microsoft sales teams may share this information with customers to help determine if your offering may be a good fit, and to ensure that it is customer ready. <br> <br> Use one of the relevant templates available in Partner Center: <br> <ul> <li> Microsoft Azure one-pager template </li> <li> Microsoft Dynamics 365 one-pager template </li> <li> Microsoft 365 one-pager template </li> <li> Windows 10 one-pager template </li> </ul> |
| *Customer presentation (Required)* | Slide deck to pitch your offer and its value proposition. After ensuring that your offer is customer ready, Microsoft sales teams may share the presentation with customers to articulate the value that your company and Microsoft bring when deploying a joint solution. The presentation should cover what your offer does, how it can help customers, what industries the offer is relevant for, and how it compares to competing solutions. <br> <br> Use the template available in Partner Center.|
| *Customer case study* | This information shows a potential customer how you and Microsoft have successfully deployed your offer in prior cases. <br> <br> Use the template available in Partner Center. |
| *Verifiable customer wins* | Specific examples of customer successes after your offer has been deployed. |
| *Channel pitch deck* | A slide deck with information that will help channel resellers learn more about your offer and get their sales teams ready to sell it. The deck typically includes an elevator pitch, information about target customers, questions to ask customers, talking points, and links to videos, documentation, and support information. |
| *Reference architecture diagram* | A diagram showing the model that represents your offer and its relationship with Microsoft cloud services, demonstrating how it meets the technical requirements of the IP Co-sell program. [Learn more about the reference architecture diagram.](#reference-architecture-diagram) |
| *Other documents* | Optionally, you may upload up to five additional documents or videos to help Microsoft sales teams and channel resellers to learn more about your offer, organization, and/or differentiators. |
| *External reference URL* | The link to your product's site, where Microsoft sales teams and channel resellers can learn more about your offer. |

## Contacts

Your contact information allows Microsoft sales teams and channel resellers to request additional information from the appropriate resource in your organization. Contact information is available to all Microsoft sales teams. *(A contact for each geography in which your offer is available is required for the Co-sell program.)* If you elect to make your offer available in the CSP program, this contact information is also available to channel resellers.

You can provide your contacts by downloading the CSV template from Partner Center, filling in each row with information about the contact, and importing this CSV file. Importing a CSV file will overwrite the existing contacts.

You can also export your existing list of contacts of an offer, and then make changes on that file.

* *Name (Required)*: The contact's name.
* *Email address (Required)*: The contact's email address.
* *Job title (Required)*: Job title.
* *Role (Required)*: Use any of the following roles.

    | **Role**    | **Description**  |
    | :------------------- | :-------------------|
    | *:::no-loc text="Partner marketing":::* | This role focuses on marketing your offer and collaborating on marketing efforts with Microsoft sales teams and channel resellers. The main point of contact for marketing engagements and offer listing content, such as product descriptions, images, and videos. |
    | *:::no-loc text="Partner sales":::* | This role focuses on selling your offer and collaborating on sales with Microsoft sales teams and channel resellers. Indicate at least one partner sales contact per region in which you wish your offer to be Co-sell Ready. The same partner sales contact may cover multiple regions. |
    | *:::no-loc text="Partner technical sales":::* | Supports technical architecture and deployment considerations during the sales cycle, the post-sales integration, and deployment periods. |
    | *:::no-loc text="Partner customer success manager":::* | Typically supports customers post-deployment, to help them get the most out of your offer and grow its footprint within the customer's organization. |

* *Countries/Regions (Required):*  When filling out the template, use the [two letter country/region codes as listed](./commercial-marketplace-co-sell-countries.md). If the contact covers all Countries/Regions, use the three letter code "OOO". If a contact covers more than one Country/Region, enter each of the two letter codes separated by a comma (for example, enter "US, CA, FR" without quotation marks into the template).

    The countries/regions should reflect each contact's territory. Microsoft sales teams and channel resellers will utilize this information for requesting information or collaborating on sales within the specific Country/Region.

* *States/Provinces (Optional):*  When filling out the template, use the XX-XX format as listed in the [States/Provinces table](./commercial-marketplace-co-sell-states.md).

## Reference architecture diagram

### What is a reference architecture  diagram
The reference architecture diagram is a model that represents the infrastructure your offer relies upon, and how your offer leverages our cloud services per the technical requirements of the IP Co-sell program. It is not designed to assess the quality of the architecture but how it is leveraging the different services.

The document can be created via multiple tools. We recommend Microsoft Visio, as it has multiple stencils that depict Azure architecture models.

A helpful starting point for building reference architecture diagrams is to leverage the [Azure Architecture models](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/browse/).

### Typical components of a reference architecture diagram
- Cloud services that host and interact with your offer, including those generating Azure consumption
- Data connections, data layers, data services being consumed by your offer
- Cloud services used to control security, authentication, users of the offer
- User interfaces and other services that expose the offer to end users
- Hybrid and/or on-premises connectivity and integrations 

### Example reference architecture diagram

(The example reference architecture diagram above is for a vertical industry chatbot that can be integrated with intranet sites to help with forecast demand scenarios via a Machine Learning algorithm using supply chain and manufacturing schedule data from different ERP systems. The bot is designed to address questions about when a sales person can commit on possible delivery dates for an order.)
