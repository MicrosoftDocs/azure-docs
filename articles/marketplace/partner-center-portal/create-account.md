# Create a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center

To publish your offers to [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) or [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/), you must create an account in the commercial marketplace program in Partner Center. This article covers how to create a Partner Center account and how to add new publishers to the commercial marketplace program.

>[!NOTE]
>If you had an account in the Cloud Partner Portal (CPP), we moved it to Partner Center. You don't need to create a new account. For more information, see [Publishers who moved from the Cloud Partner Portal](#publishers-who-moved-from-the-cloud-partner-portal).

## Before you begin

To create an account in Partner Center, make sure you meet the following prerequisites. We'll verify this information during the account creation process.

- You must use a work account associated with your company or organization. Personal accounts aren't supported. For more information, see [Company work accounts and Partner Center](company-work-accounts.md).
- Know your company's legal business name, address, and primary contact. This person can be you.
- You must have authority to sign legal agreements on your company's behalf.

There are two ways to create an account:

- If you're new to Partner Center and don't have a Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) account, continue to [Create an account using the Partner Center enrollment page](#create-an-account-using-the-partner-center-enrollment-page).
- If you're already enrolled in the Microsoft Partner Network or a developer program, create an account directly from Partner Center. Go to [Create an account using existing Partner Center enrollments](#create-an-account-using-existing-partner-center-enrollments).

## Create an account using the Partner Center enrollment page

Use this method if you're new to Partner Center and are not enrolled in the Microsoft Partner Network. Complete the steps in this section to create a new Partner Center account and publisher profile.

### Register on the Partner Center enrollment page

Review the information on the [**Welcome to Microsoft Partner Center**](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/partnership) enrollment page, and then register for an account.

### Sign in with a work account

Sign in with a work account so that you can link your company's work email account domain to your new Partner Center account. After you've associated these two accounts, your company's employees can sign in to Partner Center with their work account user names and passwords.

>[!NOTE]
>To see whether your company already has a work account, learn how to create a new work account, or learn how to set up multiple work accounts to use with Partner Center, see [Company work accounts and Partner Center](company-work-accounts.md).

### Agree to the terms and conditions

As part of the registration process, you need to agree to the terms and conditions in the [Microsoft Publisher Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=699560).

### Provide your publisher profile

Your publisher profile includes your company name and MPN ID. If you haven't yet done so, join the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/commercial). After you join the Microsoft Partner Network, you'll be provided with an MPN ID.

1. Create a Publisher ID. Your Publisher ID uniquely identifies your company and your offers on Azure Marketplace and AppSource.

1. After you've confirmed your publisher profile information, agree to the terms and conditions, and then create your Partner Center account by selecting **Accept and continue**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > To accept these terms, you must be authorized to act on your company's behalf.

    After you're enrolled, you're taken to the commercial marketplace overview page. The commercial marketplace account is displayed in the left pane.

1. To verify that the commercial marketplace account is listed as registered, select **Settings** (gear icon) in the top-right corner > **Developer Settings** > **Programs**.

You've now created a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center. Continue to [Add new publishers to the commercial marketplace](#add-new-publishers-to-the-commercial-marketplace-program).

## Create an account using existing Partner Center enrollments

Use this section to create a commercial marketplace account if you already have an enrollment in Microsoft Partner Center. There are two types of existing enrollments that you can use to set up your commercial marketplace account. Choose the scenario that applies to you:

*What if I'm already enrolled in the Microsoft Partner Network?*
- [Use an existing Microsoft Partner Network enrollment](#use-a-microsoft-partner-network-enrollment) to create your account.

*What if I'm already enrolled in a developer program?*
- [Use an existing developer program enrollment](#use-a-developer-program-enrollment) to create your account.

For both enrollment types, you sign in to Partner Center with your existing credentials. Be sure to have your account and publisher profile information available.

### Use a Microsoft Partner Network enrollment

When you use your Microsoft Partner Network account, it links your company's work email account domain to your new Partner Center account. After you've associated these two accounts, your company's employees can sign in to Partner Center with their work account user names and passwords. 

>[!NOTE]
> You must have an **account admin** or a **global admin** role to sign in to Microsoft Partner Network.

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/) with your Microsoft Partner Network account.
1. Select **Settings** > **Developer Settings** > **Programs** > **Get Started**.

   Microsoft Partner Network detects your subscription and displays the **Publisher profile** pane.

1. Enter your company name and MPN ID.
1. Read the terms and conditions in the [Microsoft Publisher Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=699560), and then select **Accept and continue** to complete your enrollment.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > To accept these terms, you must be authorized to act on your company's behalf.

    After you're enrolled, you're taken to the commercial marketplace overview page. The commercial marketplace account is displayed in the left pane.

1. To verify that the commercial marketplace account is listed as registered, select **Settings** > **Developer Settings** > **Programs**.

You've now created a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center. Continue to [Add new publishers to the commercial marketplace](#add-new-publishers-to-the-commercial-marketplace-program).

### Use a developer program enrollment

>[!NOTE]
>To register for the commercial marketplace under the same account that you're signed in with, you need to have registered in Partner Center with a company account. If you registered with an individual account, your commercial marketplace enrollment will appear under a new account.
>
>Individual accounts are for developers who are working on their own. Company accounts are for organizations and businesses. Company accounts give you access to submit apps with additional functionality.
>
> To ascertain that you're authorized to set up the account for your company, we require additional verification of company accounts after you've registered. This verification can take from a few days to a couple of weeks, and it often includes a phone call to your company. Both types of accounts allow you to submit apps, add-ins, and services. For more information, see [Account types, locations, and fees](../windows/uwp/publish/account-types-locations-and-fees).

When you register for the commercial marketplace program with the same account as your developer program, you can see all of your existing program enrollments in the left pane of Partner Center.

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/) with your existing account.
1. Select **Settings** > **Developer Settings** > **Programs** > **Get Started**, and enter your work email address.
1. Complete the details on the **Publisher profile** page.
2. Read the terms and conditions in the [Microsoft Publisher Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=699560), and then select **Accept and continue** to complete your enrollment.

    >[!Important]
    > To accept these terms, you must be authorized to act on your company's behalf.

    After you're enrolled, you're taken to the commercial marketplace overview page. The commercial marketplace account is displayed in the left pane.

1. To verify that the commercial marketplace account is listed as registered, select **Settings** > **Developer Settings** > **Programs**.

You've now created a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center. For help with adding publishers, continue to [Add new publishers to the commercial marketplace](#add-new-publishers-to-the-commercial-marketplace-program).

## Publishers who moved from the Cloud Partner Portal

If you had a Cloud Partner Portal account, we moved it to Partner Center. You don't need to create a new Partner Center account. You should have received a customized link to your new Partner Center account both in email and in a banner notification after you signed in to your existing Cloud Partner Portal account.

After you've selected the customized link and enabled your new Partner Center account, you can return to your account by going to the [commercial marketplace dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/overview) in Partner Center.

The publishing agreement and company profile information transition to your new Partner Center account, along with any previously set up account payout profile information, user accounts and permissions, and active offers that were associated with your Cloud Partner Portal account.

## Add new publishers to the commercial marketplace program

An organization can have multiple publishers associated with a commercial marketplace account. An existing user can add more publishers after signing in to Partner Center by selecting **Settings** > **Developer settings** > **Publisher** > **Add publisher**.

>[!NOTE]
>Before you add a new publisher, review your list of existing publishers by signing in to Partner Center and selecting **Account Settings** > **Publishers**.

Additional users from the same Azure Active Directory tenant can use the following steps to add a new publisher.

1. Kick off the sign-up flow at [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/partnership).
2. Select **Sign in with a work account**, and enter your work email address.
3. Select the **Add Publisher** button.
4. Choose the MPN ID that you want to associate with the publisher.
5. Update the **Publisher details** on the form.

   * **Publisher name**: The name that's displayed in the commercial marketplace with the offer.  
   * **PublisherID**: An identifier that's used by Partner Center to uniquely identify the publisher. The default value for this field maps to an existing and unique Publisher ID in the system. Because the Publisher ID can't be reused, this field needs to be updated.  
   * **Contact information**: Update the contact information when necessary.

After this process is completed, go to the commercial marketplace account that's listed in the left pane to manage the newly created publisher. If you don't see the commercial marketplace account, refresh the page. The new publisher appears in the **Publishers** list.
