# Create a Commercial Marketplace account in Partner Center

To publish your offers to [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) or [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), you'll need to create an account in the Commercial Marketplace program in Partner Center. In this article, we'll cover how to create a Partner Center account and how to add new publishers to the Commercial Marketplace program.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you have an account in the [Cloud Partner Portal (CPP)](https://cloudpartner.azure.com) that has been moved to Partner Center, you do not need to create a new account. See [Publishers moving from CPP](#publishers-moving-from-cpp) for more information.

## Before you begin

To create an account on Partner Center, make sure you have:

- Authority to sign legal agreements on your company's behalf.
- Your company's legal business name, address, and primary contact (this can be you).

We'll verify this information during the account creation process.

There are two ways to create an account:

- If you're new to Partner Center and don't have a Microsoft Network Account, create your account using [Create an account using the Partner Center enrollment page](#create-an-account-using-the-partner-center-enrollment-page).
- If you're already enrolled in the Microsoft Partner Network, create an account directly from Partner Center using [Create an account using existing Microsoft Partner Center enrollments](#create-an-account-using-existing-microsoft-partner-center-enrollments).

## Create an account using the Partner Center enrollment page

Use this method if you're new to Partner Center and are not enrolled in the Microsoft Partner Network. This section covers how to create a new Partner Center account, including how to:

- [Register on the Partner Center enrollment page](#register-on-the-partner-center-enrollment-page)
- [Sign in with a work account](#sign-in-with-a-work-account)
- [Agree to the terms and conditions](#agree-to-terms-and-conditions)
- [Provide your publisher profile](#provide-your-publisher-profile)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you have an account in the [Cloud Partner Portal (CPP)](https://cloudpartner.azure.com) that has been moved to Partner Center, you do not need to create a new account. See [Publishers moving from CPP](#publishers-moving-from-cpp) for more information.

### Register on the Partner Center enrollment page

Review the information on the [**Welcome to Microsoft Partner Center**](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/partnership) enrollment page and then register for an account.

### Sign in with a work account

Sign in with a work account so you so that you can link your company's work email account domain to your new Partner Center account. By associating these accounts, your company employees can sign into Partner Center with their work account user names and passwords.

>[!NOTE]
>To check whether your company already has a work account, how to create a new work account, or how to set up multiple work accounts to use with Partner Center, visit [Your company work account and Partner Center](./company-work-accounts.md).

### Agree to terms and conditions

You'll need to agree to terms and conditions in the [Microsoft Marketplace Publisher Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=699560).

### Provide your publisher profile

Your publisher profile includes your company name and MPN ID. If you have not yet done so, you will need to join the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/commercial). After you join the Microsoft Partner Network, you'll be provided with an MPN ID.

Create a Publisher ID. Your Publisher ID uniquely identifies your company and your offers in Marketplace and AppSource.

After you've confirmed your publisher profile information, agree to the terms and conditions and create your Partner Center account by selecting **Accept and continue**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>*You must be authorized to act on your company's behalf in order to accept these terms.*

Once enrolled, you're taken to the Commercial Marketplace Overview page. **Commercial Marketplace** is displayed in the left navigation bar. If you select **Settings** > **Partner Settings** > **Programs**, you'll see that Commercial Marketplace is listed as registered.

For help with adding publishers, see [Add new publishers to the Commercial Marketplace program](#add-new-publishers-to-the-commercial-marketplace-program).

## Create an account using existing Microsoft Partner Center enrollments

Use this section to create a Commercial Marketplace account if you already have an enrollment in Microsoft Partner Center.

There are two types of existing enrollments that you can use to set up your Commercial Marketplace account. Choose the one that applies to you:

- If you have an existing Microsoft Partner Network enrollment, create your account using [Enrolled in the Microsoft Partner Network](#enrolled-in-the-microsoft-partner-network).
- If you have an existing developer program enrollment, create your account using [Enrolled in a developer program](#enrolled-in-a-developer-program).

For both methods, you'll use these steps:

- Sign into Partner Center using your existing credentials
- Enter your publishing profile information

Make sure to have your account information handy.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you have an account in the [Cloud Partner Portal (CPP)](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) that has been moved to Partner Center, you do not need to create a new account. See [Publishers moving from CPP](#publishers-moving-from-cpp) for more information.

Thank you for creating an account on Partner Center! For help, see [Commercial Marketplace Overview](./commercial-marketplace-overview.md). For help with adding publishers, see [Add new publishers to the Commercial Marketplace program](#add-new-publishers-to-the-commercial-marketplace-program).

### Enrolled in a developer program

If you're already enrolled in a Partner Center developer program, use this section to create your account directly from Partner Center.

>[!NOTE]
>To sign up for the Commercial Marketplace under the same account you're signed in as, you need to have registered on Partner Center using a Company account. If you signed up with an Individual account, your Commercial Marketplace enrollment will appear under a new account.
>
>Individual accounts are for single developers working on their own. Company accounts are for organizations and businesses. Company accounts give you access to submit apps with additional functionality. We require greater verification for company accounts after you register to confirm that you're authorized to set up the account for your company. This verification can take from a few days to a couple of weeks, and often includes a phone call to your company. Both types of accounts allow you to submit apps, add-ins, and services. For more info, see [Account types, locations, and fees](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/account-types-locations-and-fees).

Sign into [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/) with your Microsoft Partner Center account to enroll into the Commercial Marketplace program under the same account. By signing up for Commercial Marketplace using the same account, you can see both your existing program enrollments and Commercial Marketplace in the left navigation menu of Partner Center.

After you sign in, use the following steps to finish setting up your account:

1. From Partner Center, select **Settings** > **Developer Settings** > **Programs** > **Get Started**, and enter your work e-mail address.
2. Complete the details on the publisher profile page.
3. Read the terms and conditions in the [Microsoft Marketplace Publisher Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=699560), and then select **Accept and continue** to complete your enrollment.

    >[!Important]
    >*You must be authorized to act on your company's behalf in order to accept these terms.*

Once enrolled, you're taken to the Commercial Marketplace Overview page. **Commercial Marketplace** is displayed in the left navigation bar. If you select **Settings** > **Developer Settings** > **Programs**, you'll see that Commercial Marketplace is listed as registered.

## Publishers moving from CPP

If your account has been migrated from the [Cloud Partner Portal (CPP)](https://cloudpartner.azure.com), you do not need to create a new Partner Center account. You should have received a customized link to your new Partner Center account in email, and in a banner notification after logging in to your existing CPP account.

Once you've enabled your new Partner Center account by visiting this customized link, you can return to your account by visiting the [Commercial Marketplace dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/overview) in Partner Center.

The publishing agreement and company profile information will be migrated to your new Partner Center account, along with any previously set up account payout profile information, user accounts and permissions, and active offers associated with your CPP account.

After your account information is moved from CPP to Partner Center, you'll no longer use CPP to make account updates, or manage users, permissions, and billing. For a limited time, any account updates you make in Partner Center will automatically be updated in your read-only CPP account until the CPP portal is eventually deprecated.

## Add new publishers to the Commercial Marketplace program

An organization can have multiple publishers associated with a Commercial Marketplace account. An existing user can add more Publishers after logging into Partner Center by selecting **Account Settings** > **Publishers** > **Add Publisher**.

>[!NOTE]
>Before adding a new publisher, review your existing publishers by logging into Partner Center and selecting **Account Settings** > **Publishers** to see a list of existing publishers.

Another user from the same Azure Active Directory tenant can add a new publisher by following the steps below:

1. Kick off the sign-up flow at [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/azureisv).
2. Select **Sign in with a work account** and enter your work email address.
3. Select the **Add Publisher** button.
4. Choose the MPN ID that you want to associate to the publisher.
5. Update the **publisher details** on the form.

   1. **Publisher Name**: The name that will get displayed in Azure Marketplace or AppSource with the offer.
   1. **PublisherID**: An identifier used by Partner Center to uniquely identify your publisher. The default for this field maps to an existing and unique `PublisherID` in the system, which cannot be reused, and therefore this field needs to be updated.
   1. **Contact information**: Update the contact information when necessary.

After you complete the process, you can manage your newly created publisher by going to the **Commercial Marketplace** program listed in the left navigation menu. If you don't see the **Commercial Marketplace** program, refresh the page. The new publisher will appear in the **Publishers** list.
