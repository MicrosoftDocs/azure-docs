# Publishing guide by offer type

Once you [decide on a publishing option](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type), you are ready to select the offer type that will be used to present your offer. 

 The *offer type* defines the offer structure, which includes the metadata, artifacts, and other content used to present the offer in the marketplace.

Before you can create an offer, you must choose an offer type. The offer type will correspond to the type of solution, app, or service offer that you wish to publish, as well as its alignment to Microsoft products and services. 

A single offer type can be configured differently to enable different publishing options, calls-to-action, provisioning, or pricing. The publishing option and configuration of the offer type also align to the offer eligibility and technical requirements. 

Be sure to review the storefront and offer type eligibility requirements and the technical publishing requirements before creating your offer.
