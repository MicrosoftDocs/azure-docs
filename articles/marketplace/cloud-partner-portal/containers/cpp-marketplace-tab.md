# Container Marketplace tab

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting April 13, 2020, we'll begin moving the management of your Azure Container offers to Partner Center. After the migration, you'll create and manage your offers in Partner Center. Follow the instructions in [Create an Azure Container offer](https://aka.ms/CreateContainerOffer) to manage your migrated offers.

The **Marketplace** tab of the **New Offer** page enables you to provide your prospective customers with marketing, sales, and legal information and agreements and manage leads generated from the marketplace. Add your marketing-specific content to the **Overview** section.

## Overview

In this section, you enter the general information about your Azure Marketplace Offer.  An asterisk (*) appended to the field name indicates that it's required.
