# Container publishing prerequisites

This article describes the prerequisites for publishing a container offer on the Azure Marketplace.  If you have not already done so, you should review the [Containers Offer Publishing Guide](../../marketplace-containers.md).

## Publishing prerequisites

To publish a new container image, you have to meet the following prerequisites:

- Access to the Cloud Partner Portal. For more information, see Azure Marketplace and AppSource publishing guide.
- Agreement to the Azure Marketplace Terms
- Host your container technical asset in an Azure Container Registry.
- Have your container metadata ready to use. For example, the following non-exhaustive list:
  - A title
  - A description (in HTML format)
  - A logo image (in PNG format) and in these fixed image sizes: 40x40 px, 90x90 px, 115x 115 px, and 255x115 px.
- A *Terms of Use* and a *Privacy Policy* statements
- Container solution documentation
- Support contacts

## Next steps

If you have not already done so, you must [prepare your container technical assets](./cpp-create-technical-assets.md) before you [create your container offer](./cpp-create-offer.md).
