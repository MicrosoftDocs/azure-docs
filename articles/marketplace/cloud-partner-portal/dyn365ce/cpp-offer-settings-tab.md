# Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement Offer Settings tab

The [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) no longer supports the creation and management of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement offers. Instead, this functionality has been moved to the Microsoft [Partner Center portal](https://partner.microsoft.com/). For more information, see [Create a new Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement & PowerApps offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-new-customer-engagement-offer).

Before you create a new Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement offer, you should read [Create a Partner Center account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-account) and then open the [Commercial Marketplace dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/directory) with the **Overview** page selected. Follow the instructions in [Create a new Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement & PowerApps offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-new-customer-engagement-offer) to create your offer.
