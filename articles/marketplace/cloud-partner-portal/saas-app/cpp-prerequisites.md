# SaaS application publishing prerequisites

This article describes the prerequisites for publishing a SaaS Application (App) offer on the Azure Marketplace. The Cloud Partner Portal provides role-based access to the portal, allowing multiple individuals to collaborate towards publishing an offer. For more information, see [Manage Users](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal-orig/cloud-partner-portal-manage-users).

## Publishing prerequisites

To publish a new SaaS App offer, you must meet the following prerequisites:
- Access to the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/). For more information, see Azure Marketplace and AppSource publishing guides.
- Before an offer can be published on behalf of a publisher account, one of individuals with Owner role need to agree to comply with the [Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/website-terms-of-use/), [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://www.microsoft.com/privacystatement/default.aspx), and [Microsoft Azure Certified Program Agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/marketplace/certified-program-agreement/).
- Have your metadata ready to use. The following list (non-exhaustive) shows an example of this metadata:
  - A title
  - A description (in HTML format)
  - A logo image (in PNG format) and in these fixed image sizes: 40 x 40 pixels, 90 x 90 pixels, 115 x 115 pixels, and 255 x 115 pixels.
  - A Terms of Use and a Privacy Policy
