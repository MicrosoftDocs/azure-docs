# Power BI App offer prerequisites

>[!Important]
>Starting April 13 2020, we'll begin moving management of your Power BI app offers to Partner Center. After the migration, you'll create and manage your offers in Partner Center. Follow the instructions in [Power BI app creation overview](https://aka.ms/AzurePBIAppCreationOverview) to manage your migrated offers.

This article provides the technical and business requirements that you need to meet before you can publish a Power BI App offer to the AppSource marketplace.  If you have not already done so, review the [Office 365, Dynamics 365, PowerApps, and Power BI Offer Publishing Guide](../../appsource-offer-publishing-guide.md).


## Technical requirements

The main technical asset you'll need for this offer type is a [Power BI app](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2028636). For more
information, see [Create Power BI technical assets](./cpp-create-technical-assets.md).

After your service application is created and tested in Power BI, you should save the application installation URL that Power BI generates. You'll need it to [create a Power BI App offer](./cpp-create-offer.md).

## Business requirements

The business requirements include procedural, contractual, and legal obligations.  You must:

- Be a registered cloud marketplace publisher. If you're not registered, follow the steps in [Become a Cloud Marketplace Publisher](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/become-publisher).

    > [!NOTE] 
    > Use the same Microsoft Developer Center registration account to sign in to the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com). You should have only one Microsoft account for your AppSource offerings. Accounts shouldn't be specific to individual services or offers.
 
- Make technical support available to customers in a commercially reasonable manner.
- Provide content that meets the criteria for your offering to be listed on AppSource. For more information, see [Have an app to list on AppSource? Here's how](https://appsource.microsoft.com/blogs/have-an-app-to-list-on-appsource-here-s-how).
- Comply with the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).


## Next steps

After you've met all the requirements, you're ready to [create a Power BI App offer](./cpp-create-offer.md) in the Cloud Partner Portal.
