# Microsoft Business Applications Independent Software Vendor (ISV) Program onboarding guide

The [Business Applications ISV Program](https://partner.microsoft.com/solutions/business-applications/isv-overview) aims to accelerate the growth and overall success of Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) building modern, cloud-based line-of-business (LOB) solutions with *Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement* (Dynamics CE) or *Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations* (Dynamics Ops). Here's how to be part of it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Existing ISV partners with *Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement* and *Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations* applications will have until **October 15, 2019** to complete the all onboarding steps listed below. ISVs who have not completed these steps by that time will have any existing offers removed from [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com).

In order to enroll and take advantage of all the [technical, marketing, and sales enablement benefits](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/business-applications/isv-overview) of the Business Applications ISV Program, we're asking existing ISV partners with (*Dynamics CE* and *Ops*) to complete several prerequisites explained in this guide. These steps include: 

 - [Setting up](#activate-your-account-in-partner-center) your Microsoft Partner Center account
 - [Signing](#sign-the-business-applications-isv-program-agreement) the Business Applications ISV Program agreement
 - [Specifying your billing](#set-up-your-billing-information) information, and
 - [Republishing](#submit-your-app-for-recertification) your application to Microsoft AppSource

In the past, Microsoft lacked a way for customers to easily assess whether a given ISV application built on
the platform would meet a given quality bar. When you follow these steps to enroll in the Microsoft Business Applications ISV Program, your application is certified and promoted as part of the official ISV ecosystem.

## Activate your account in Partner Center

If you've already published Dynamics CE and/or Dynamics Ops offers, your Cloud Partner Portal (CPP) account has been migrated to Microsoft [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com) (PC), where you can manage it going forward. You'll need to complete all the steps in this document in order to make any changes to an existing offer (as your offers will be locked for editing in CPP until then).

> [!NOTE]
> This step requires an *Owner* role in Cloud Partner Portal for your given account.

Sign in to your *Publisher Profile* page from [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) and click on the yellow banner prompting you to activate your Partner Center account.

For more info, see [*Account migration from Cloud Partner Portal to Partner Center*](../partner-center-portal/account-migration-from-cpp-to-pc.md).

## Sign the Business Applications ISV Program agreement

Participation in this program requires you to review and accept the *Microsoft Business Applications ISV Addendum* agreement.

> [!NOTE]
> This step requires an *Owner* role in Partner Center for your given account in order to sign legal agreements. If you completed your Cloud Partner Portal account migration by [activating your Partner Center account](../partner-center-portal/account-migration-from-cpp-to-pc.md#account-activation-is-complete) in the previous step, your account owner permissions have also migrated to Partner Center.

1. Go to https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/agreements (signing in to Partner Center as prompted).

2. Under the heading *Commercial Marketplace*, locate **Microsoft Business Applications ISV Addendum** and click the link to review the agreement.

3. To sign the agreement, click on *Accept Agreement*.

## Set up your billing information

Next, set up your billing information for the Business Applications ISV Program.

> [!NOTE]
> This step requires an *Owner* role in Partner Center for your given account in order to update billing information.

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard).

2. Click on the *Settings* (gear) icon and select **Developer Settings**.

3. Under *Accounts*, click on **Billing profile**.

4. Review the primary contact and billing information that is populated from your legal entity, and click on the checkbox if you need to make updates.

5. Optionally, supply Tax ID/VAT ID settings (these are not required).

6. **Save** your changes on the form.

You can update your billing profile at any time, however *Company Name* and billing address *Country*  are not editable fields.

## Submit your app for recertification

If you've complete the steps above, your existing Dynamics 365 CE and Dynamics 365 Ops offers are now unlocked for editing in the Cloud Partner Portal (you might need to refresh the page). You can also create new offers through the CPP.

The final step for enrollment in the Business Applications ISV Program is to recertify your existing applications by [republishing your app to AppSource](https://partner.microsoft.com/solutions/business-applications/isv-publish) and [resubmitting your offer to Cloud Partner Portal](manage-offers/cpp-manage-offers.md).
