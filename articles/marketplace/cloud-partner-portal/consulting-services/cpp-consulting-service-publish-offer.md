# Publish a consulting service offer

After you finish **Offer Settings**, **Storefront Details**, and **Contacts**, select **Publish** and provide an email address. When Microsoft is ready to publish your offer, you receive an email to preview it before it goes live. You can return to the portal to check the status of your offer at any time.

Offers might appear in a "Publish canceled" or "Publish failed" status during the publishing process. These designations are a normal part of the process and allow Microsoft to make edits to your offer. If your offer appears as "Publish canceled," leave it as that status.

## Lead destination
