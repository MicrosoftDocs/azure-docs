# Set up Dynamics 365 Operations Apps offer supplemental content

This page lets you provide additional information to help us validate your offer. This information is not shown to customers or published to the marketplace.

## Validation assets

Upload a [Customization Analysis Report (CAR)](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/dev-tools/customization-analysis-report) in this section. This report is generated by analyzing your customization and extension models, based on a predefined set of best practice rules.

This file must be in XLS or XLSX format. If you have more than one report, you can upload a ZIP file containing all of the reports.

## Does solution include localizations?

Select **Yes** if the solution enables use of local standards and policies (for example, if it accommodates the different payroll rules required by different countries/regions). Otherwise, select **No**.

## Does solution enable translation(s)?

Select **Yes** if the text in your solution can be translated into other languages. Otherwise, select **No**.

Select **Save draft**, then continue **Functional validation**, which is not in the left-nav menu.
