# Set up Dynamics 365 Operations Apps technical configuration

This page defines the technical details used to connect to your offer. This connection lets us provision your offer for the end customer if they choose to acquire it.

## Solution identifier

Provide the solution identifier (GUID) for your solution. To find your solution identifier:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), select **Solution Management**.
2. Select your solution, then look for the **Solution Identifier** in the **Package overview**. If the identifier is blank, select **Edit** and republish your package, then try again.

## Release version

Select the version of Dynamics 365 Operations Apps this solution works with.

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu, **Co-sell with Microsoft**. For information on setting up co-sell with Microsoft (optional), see [Co-sell partner engagement](/partner-center/co-sell-overview?context=/azure/marketplace/context/context). If you're not setting up co-sell or you've finished, continue with **Next steps** below.

## Test drive technical configuration

This page lets you set up a demonstration ("test drive") that allows customers to try your offer before purchasing it. Learn more in [What is test drive](what-is-test-drive.md).

To enable a test drive, select the **Enable a test drive** check box on the [Offer setup](dynamics-365-operations-offer-setup.md#test-drive) tab. To remove test drive from your offer, clear this check box.
