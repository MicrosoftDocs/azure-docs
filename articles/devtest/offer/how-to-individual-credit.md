# How to get started with your individual Azure Credit Subscription  

When accessing your Azure Credit Subscription, you have two ways to sign in and use your credits.  

You have the opportunity to use a personal or corporate email address when signing in.  

> [!NOTE]
> The email address you use for sign in dictates what Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Tenant your subscription is associated with.  

## Using a personal email address versus a work account  

The email you use should follow your organization’s requirements – either you use a personal email OR your organization’s provided email.

**Using a Personal Email Account or Microsoft Account (MSA)**  
If you sign in using a personal account like Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail, your organization won't have access to your work, nor will you have access to their Active Directory unless that email is added by an admin. When you sign in with a personal email, a new Azure Directory will be created along with an Azure Tenancy on your behalf. Your profile will be created as the Top-Level Admin with access for adding other admins and users.  

**Using a Corporate Email Account or Work School Account (WSA)**  
If you sign in with your organization’s account, you'll be added as a user within your organization's Active Directory, giving your organization access to manage your account and work.  

## How to activate your Azure Credit Subscription  

Once you receive a my.visualstudio.com license, you can sign in via my.visualstudio.com or portal.azure.com.
Remember, the account you sign in with will dictate what tenant your directory will be under.  

### Sign-In through [Visual Studio](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) - myvisualstudio.com/benefits

1. Locate the Azure tile in the Tools section on the Benefits page and select 'Activate' to access the appropriate subscription

4. This action takes you to a page where you can find the eligible offers  
5. Select the correct subscription offer to associate with your account
