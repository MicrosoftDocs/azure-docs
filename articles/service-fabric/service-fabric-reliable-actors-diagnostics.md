# Diagnostics and performance monitoring for Reliable Actors
The Reliable Actors runtime emits [EventSource](/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventsource) events and [performance counters](/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.performancecounter). These provide insights into how the runtime is operating and help with troubleshooting and performance monitoring.

## EventSource events
The EventSource provider name for the Reliable Actors runtime is "Microsoft-ServiceFabric-Actors". Events from this event source appear in the [Diagnostics Events](service-fabric-diagnostics-how-to-monitor-and-diagnose-services-locally.md#view-service-fabric-system-events-in-visual-studio) window when the actor application is being [debugged in Visual Studio](service-fabric-debugging-your-application.md).

Examples of tools and technologies that help in collecting and/or viewing EventSource events are [PerfView](https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview/releases), [Azure Diagnostics](../cloud-services/cloud-services-dotnet-diagnostics.md), [Semantic Logging](/previous-versions/msp-n-p/dn774980(v=pandp.10)), and the [Microsoft TraceEvent Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent).

### Keywords
All events that belong to the Reliable Actors EventSource are associated with one or more keywords. This enables filtering of events that are collected. The following keyword bits are defined.

| Bit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x1 |Set of important events that summarize the operation of the Fabric Actors runtime. |
| 0x2 |Set of events that describe actor method calls. For more information, see the [introductory topic on actors](service-fabric-reliable-actors-introduction.md). |
| 0x4 |Set of events related to actor state. For more information, see the topic on [actor state management](service-fabric-reliable-actors-state-management.md). |
| 0x8 |Set of events related to turn-based concurrency in the actor. For more information, see the topic on [concurrency](service-fabric-reliable-actors-introduction.md#concurrency). |

## Performance counters
The Reliable Actors runtime defines the following performance counter categories.

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Service Fabric Actor |Counters specific to Azure Service Fabric actors, e.g. time taken to save actor state |
| Service Fabric Actor Method |Counters specific to methods implemented by Service Fabric actors, e.g. how often an actor method is invoked |

Each of the above categories has one or more counters.

The [Windows Performance Monitor](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc749249(v=ws.11)) application that is available by default in the Windows operating system can be used to collect and view performance counter data. [Azure Diagnostics](../cloud-services/cloud-services-dotnet-diagnostics.md) is another option for collecting performance counter data and uploading it to Azure tables.

### Performance counter instance names
A cluster that has a large number of actor services or actor service partitions will have a large number of actor performance counter instances. The performance counter instance names can help in identifying the specific [partition](service-fabric-reliable-actors-platform.md#service-fabric-partition-concepts-for-actors) and actor method (if applicable) that the performance counter instance is associated with.

#### Service Fabric Actor category
For the category `Service Fabric Actor`, the counter instance names are in the following format:

`ServiceFabricPartitionID_ActorsRuntimeInternalID`

*ServiceFabricPartitionID* is the string representation of the Service Fabric partition ID that the performance counter instance is associated with. The partition ID is a GUID, and its string representation is generated through the [`Guid.ToString`](/dotnet/api/system.guid.tostring#System_Guid_ToString_System_String_) method with format specifier "D".

*ActorRuntimeInternalID* is the string representation of a 64-bit integer that is generated by the Fabric Actors runtime for its internal use. This is included in the performance counter instance name to ensure its uniqueness and avoid conflict with other performance counter instance names. Users should not try to interpret this portion of the performance counter instance name.

The following is an example of a counter instance name for a counter that belongs to the `Service Fabric Actor` category:

`2740af29-78aa-44bc-a20b-7e60fb783264_635650083799324046`

In the example above, `2740af29-78aa-44bc-a20b-7e60fb783264` is the string representation of the Service Fabric partition ID, and `635650083799324046` is the 64-bit ID that is generated for the runtime's internal use.

#### Service Fabric Actor Method category
For the category `Service Fabric Actor Method`, the counter instance names are in the following format:

`MethodName_ActorsRuntimeMethodId_ServiceFabricPartitionID_ActorsRuntimeInternalID`

*MethodName* is the name of the actor method that the performance counter instance is associated with. The format of the method name is determined based on some logic in the Fabric Actors runtime that balances the readability of the name with constraints on the maximum length of the performance counter instance names on Windows.

*ActorsRuntimeMethodId* is the string representation of a 32-bit integer that is generated by the Fabric Actors runtime for its internal use. This is included in the performance counter instance name to ensure its uniqueness and avoid conflict with other performance counter instance names. Users should not try to interpret this portion of the performance counter instance name.

*ServiceFabricPartitionID* is the string representation of the Service Fabric partition ID that the performance counter instance is associated with. The partition ID is a GUID, and its string representation is generated through the [`Guid.ToString`](/dotnet/api/system.guid.tostring#System_Guid_ToString_System_String_) method with format specifier "D".

*ActorRuntimeInternalID* is the string representation of a 64-bit integer that is generated by the Fabric Actors runtime for its internal use. This is included in the performance counter instance name to ensure its uniqueness and avoid conflict with other performance counter instance names. Users should not try to interpret this portion of the performance counter instance name.

The following is an example of a counter instance name for a counter that belongs to the `Service Fabric Actor Method` category:

`ivoicemailboxactor.leavemessageasync_2_89383d32-e57e-4a9b-a6ad-57c6792aa521_635650083804480486`

In the example above, `ivoicemailboxactor.leavemessageasync` is the method name, `2` is the 32-bit ID generated for the runtime's internal use, `89383d32-e57e-4a9b-a6ad-57c6792aa521` is the string representation of the Service Fabric partition ID, and `635650083804480486` is the 64-bit ID generated for the runtime's internal use.
