# Operational channel 

The operational channel consists of logs from high-level actions performed by Service Fabric on your nodes and your cluster. When "Diagnostics" is enabled for a cluster, the Azure Diagnostics agent is deployed on your cluster, and is by default configured to read in logs from the Operational channel. Read more about configuring the [Azure Diagnostics agent](service-fabric-diagnostics-event-aggregation-wad.md) to modify the diagnostics configuration of your cluster to pick up more logs or performance counters. 

## Operational channel logs 

Here is a comprehensive list of logs provided by Service Fabric in the operational channel.
