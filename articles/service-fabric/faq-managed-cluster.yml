title: Service Fabric managed clusters frequently asked questions
summary: Here are some frequently asked questions (FAQs) and answers for Service Fabric managed clusters.


sections:
  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: |
          What are Service Fabric managed clusters?
        answer: |
          Service Fabric managed clusters are an evolution of the Service Fabric cluster resource model designed to make it easier to deploy and manage clusters. A Service Fabric managed cluster uses the Azure Resource Manager encapsulation model so that a user only needs to define and deploy a single cluster resource compared to the many independent resources that they must deploy today (Virtual Machine Scale Set, Load Balancer, IP, and more).

      - question: |
          What regions are supported?
        answer: |
          Service Fabric managed clusters are supported in all cloud regions.

      - question: |
          Can I do an in-place migration of my existing Service Fabric cluster to a managed cluster resource?
        answer: |
          No. You will need to create a new Service Fabric cluster resource to use the new Service Fabric managed cluster resource type.

      - question: |
          Is there an additional cost for Service Fabric managed clusters?
        answer: |
          No. There is no additional cost associated with a Service Fabric managed cluster beyond the cost of the underlying compute, storage, and networking resources that are required for the cluster.

      - question: |
          Is there a new SLA introduced by the Service Fabric managed cluster resource?
        answer: |
          The SLA doesn't change from the current Service Fabric resource model.

      - question: |
          What is the difference between a Basic, and Standard SKU cluster?
        answer: |
          A Basic SKU cluster means, most of the configurations are provided by the Service Fabric resource provider. Basic SKU clusters are intended to be used for testing and pre production environments. A Standard SKU cluster allows users to configure the cluster to specifically meet their needs. For more information, see [Service Fabric managed cluster SKUs](./overview-managed-cluster.md#service-fabric-managed-cluster-skus).
      
      - question: |
          Where can I see planned features or suggest one?
        answer: |
          Please see our github project for [managed clusters](https://github.com/microsoft/service-fabric/projects/17)

    questions:
      - question: |
          I run custom script extensions on my Virtual Machine Scale Set, can I continue to do that with a managed Service Fabric resource?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can specify VM extensions on managed cluster node types. For more information, see [Add a scale set extension to a Service Fabric managed cluster node type](./how-to-managed-cluster-vmss-extension.md).
          
      - question: |
          I want to have an internal-only load balancer, is that possible?
        answer: |
          It isn't currently possible to have an internal-only load balancer. We recommended locking down the Network Security Group (NSG) rules to block any undesired inbound/outbound traffic.

      - question: |
          Can I autoscale my cluster?
        answer: |
          Autoscaling is not currently supported.

      - question: |
          Can I deploy my cluster across availability zones?
        answer: |
          Yes, Service Fabric managed clusters which span availability zones are supported in Azure regions which support availability zones. For more information, see [Service Fabric managed clusters across availability zones](./how-to-managed-cluster-availability-zones.md).
          
      - question: |
          Can I deploy stateless node types on a Service Fabric managed cluster? 
        answer: |
          Yes, Service Fabric managed clusters support stateless node types for any secondary node types. For more information, see [Service Fabric managed cluster stateless node types](./how-to-managed-cluster-stateless-node-type.md)
          
      - question: |
          Can I select between automatic and manual upgrades for my cluster runtime?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can select between automatic and manual upgrades. For more information, see [cluster upgrades](./how-to-managed-cluster-upgrades.md).

    questions:
      - question: |
          Is there a local development experience for Service Fabric managed clusters?
        answer: |
          The local development experience remains unchanged from existing Service Fabric clusters. For more information, see [Set up your development environment](./service-fabric-get-started.md) for more details on the local development experience.
          
      - question: |
          Can I deploy my applications as an Azure Resource Manager resource?
        answer: |
          Yes. Support has been added to deploy applications as an Azure Resource Manager resource (in addition to deployment using PowerShell and CLI). To get started, see [Deploy a Service Fabric managed cluster application using ARM template](./how-to-managed-cluster-app-deployment-template.md).
          
      - question: |
          Can I deploy applications with managed identities?
        answer:  Yes, applications with managed identities can be deployed to a Service Fabric managed cluster. For more information see, [Application managed identities](./concepts-managed-identity.md).
