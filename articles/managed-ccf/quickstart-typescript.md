# Quickstart: Create an Azure Managed CCF resource using the Azure SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript

Microsoft Azure Managed CCF (Managed CCF) is a new and highly secure service for deploying confidential applications. For more information on Azure Managed CCF, see [About Azure Managed Confidential Consortium Framework](overview.md).

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[API reference documentation](/javascript/api/overview/azure/confidential-ledger) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/confidentialledger/arm-confidentialledger) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/arm-confidentialledger)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Node.js versions supported by the [Azure SDK for JavaScript](/javascript/api/overview/azure/arm-confidentialledger-readme#currently-supported-environments).
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) on a computer running Windows or Linux.

## Setup

This quickstart uses the Azure Identity library, along with Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell, to authenticate user to Azure Services. Developers can also use Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code to authenticate their calls. For more information, see [Authenticate the client with Azure Identity client library](/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme).

### Sign in to Azure

[!INCLUDE [Sign in to Azure](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/confidential-ledger-sign-in-azure.md)]

### Initialize a new npm project
In a terminal or command prompt, create a suitable project folder and initialize an `npm` project. You may skip this step if you have an existing node project. 
```terminal
cd <work folder>
npm init -y
```

### Install the packages
Install the Azure Active Directory identity client library.

```terminal
npm install --save @azure/identity
```

Install the Azure Confidential Ledger management plane client library.

```terminal
npm install -save @azure/arm-confidentialledger@1.3.0-beta.1
```

Install the TypeScript compiler and tools globally

```terminal
npm install -g typescript
```

### Create a resource group

[!INCLUDE [Create resource group](./includes/powershell-resource-group-create.md)]

### Register the resource provider

[!INCLUDE [Register the resource provider](includes/register-provider.md)]

### Create members

[!INCLUDE [Create member](includes/create-member.md)]

## Create the JavaScript application

### Use the Management plane client library

The Azure SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript library [azure/arm-confidentialledger](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/confidentialledger/arm-confidentialledger) allows operations on Managed CCF resources, such as creation and deletion, listing the resources associated with a subscription, and viewing the details of a specific resource. 

To run the below samples, please save the code snippets into a file with a `.ts` extension into your project folder and compile it as part of your TypeScript project, or compile the script into JavaScript separately by running:

```terminal
tsc <filename.ts>
```

The compiled JavaScript file will have the same name but a `*.js` extension. Then run the script in nodeJS:
```terminal
node <filename.js>
```

The following sample TypeScript code creates and views the properties of a Managed CCF resource.

```TypeScript
import  { ConfidentialLedgerClient, ManagedCCFProperties, ManagedCCF, KnownLanguageRuntime, DeploymentType, MemberIdentityCertificate } from "@azure/arm-confidentialledger";
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";

// Please replace these variables with appropriate values for your project
const subscriptionId = "0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001";
const rgName = "myResourceGroup";
const ledgerId = "testApp";
const memberCert0 = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIBvjCCAUSgAwIBAg...0d71ZtULNWo\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----";
const memberCert1 = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIBwDCCAUagAwIBAgI...2FSyKIC+vY=\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----";

async function main() {
    console.log("Creating a new instance.")
    const client = new ConfidentialLedgerClient(new DefaultAzureCredential(), subscriptionId);

    const properties = <ManagedCCFProperties> {
        deploymentType: <DeploymentType> {
            appSourceUri: "",
            languageRuntime: KnownLanguageRuntime.JS
        },
        memberIdentityCertificates: [
            <MemberIdentityCertificate>{
                certificate: memberCert0,
                encryptionkey: "",
                tags: { 
                    "owner":"member0"
                }
            },
            <MemberIdentityCertificate>{
                certificate: memberCert1,
                encryptionkey: "",
                tags: { 
                    "owner":"member1"
                }
            },
        ],
        nodeCount: 3,
    };

    const mccf = <ManagedCCF> {
        location: "SouthCentralUS",
        properties: properties,
    }

    const createResponse = await client.managedCCFOperations.beginCreateAndWait(rgName, ledgerId, mccf);
    console.log("Created. Instance id: " +  createResponse.id);

    // Get details of the instance
    console.log("Getting instance details.");
    const getResponse = await client.managedCCFOperations.get(rgName, ledgerId);
    console.log(getResponse.properties?.identityServiceUri);
    console.log(getResponse.properties?.nodeCount);

    // List mccf instances in the RG
    console.log("Listing the instances in the resource group.");
    const instancePages = await client.managedCCFOperations.listByResourceGroup(rgName).byPage();
    for await(const page of instancePages){
        for(const instance of page)
        {
            console.log(instance.name + "\t" + instance.location + "\t" + instance.properties?.nodeCount);
        }
    }

    console.log("Delete the instance.");
    await client.managedCCFOperations.beginDeleteAndWait(rgName, ledgerId);
    console.log("Deleted.");
}

(async () => {
    try {
        await main();
    } catch(err) {
        console.error(err);
    }
})();
```

## Delete the Managed CCF resource
The following piece of code deletes the Managed CCF resource. Other Managed CCF articles can build upon this quickstart. If you plan to continue on to work with subsequent quickstarts and tutorials, you might wish to leave these resources in place.

```TypeScript
import  { ConfidentialLedgerClient, ManagedCCFProperties, ManagedCCF, KnownLanguageRuntime, DeploymentType, MemberIdentityCertificate } from "@azure/arm-confidentialledger";
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";

const subscriptionId = "0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"; // replace
const rgName = "myResourceGroup";
const ledgerId = "confidentialbillingapp";

async function deleteManagedCcfResource() {
    const client = new ConfidentialLedgerClient(new DefaultAzureCredential(), subscriptionId);

    console.log("Delete the instance.");
    await client.managedCCFOperations.beginDeleteAndWait(rgName, ledgerId);
    console.log("Deleted.");
}

(async () => {
    try {
        await deleteManagedCcfResource();
    } catch(err) {
        console.error(err);
    }
})();
```
## Clean up resources

Other Managed CCF articles can build upon this quickstart. If you plan to continue on to work with subsequent quickstarts and tutorials, you might wish to leave these resources in place.

Otherwise, when you're finished with the resources created in this article, use the Azure CLI [az group delete](/cli/azure/group?#az-group-delete) command to delete the resource group and all its contained resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a Managed CCF resource by using the Azure Python SDK for Confidential Ledger. To learn more about Azure Managed CCF and how to integrate it with your applications, continue on to these articles:
