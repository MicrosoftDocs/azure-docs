# Quickstart: Update the runtime options of the JavaScript execution engine on an Azure Managed CCF resource

Sometimes it is necessary to update the runtime options of the CCF JavaScript interpreter to extend the request execution duration or update the heap or stack allocation size. In this how to guide, you will learn to update the runtime settings. This tutorial builds on the Azure Managed CCF (Managed CCF) resource created in the [Quickstart: Create an Azure Managed CCF resource using the Azure portal](quickstart-portal.md) tutorial.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](./includes/proposal-prerequisites.md)]

## Download the service identity

[!INCLUDE [Download Service Identity](./includes/service-identity.md)]

## Update the runtime options

[!INCLUDE [Mac instructions](./includes/macos-instructions.md)]

1. Prepare a **set_js_runtime_options.json** file and submit it using this command:
    ```Bash
    $ cat set_js_runtime_options.json
    {
      "actions": [
        {
          "name": "set_js_runtime_options",
          "args": {
            "max_heap_bytes": 1024,
            "max_stack_bytes": 1024,
            "max_execution_time_ms": 5000, // increase the request execution time
            "log_exception_details": false,
            "return_exception_details": false
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    
    $ proposal_id=$( (ccf_cose_sign1 --content set_js_runtime_options.json --signing-cert member0_cert.pem --signing-key member0_privk.pem --ccf-gov-msg-type proposal --ccf-gov-msg-created_at `date -Is` | curl https://confidentialbillingapp.confidential-ledger.azure.com/gov/proposals -H 'Content-Type: application/cose' --data-binary @- --cacert service_cert.pem | jq -r ‘.proposal_id’) )
    ```
1. The next step is to accept the proposal by submitting a vote.
    [!INCLUDE [Submit a vote](./includes/submit-vote.md)]
1. Repeat the above step for every member in the Managed CCF resource.
1. After the proposal is accepted, the runtime options will be applied to the subsequent requests.
