# Starter prompts for Azure SRE Agent Preview

Azure SRE Agent Preview helps you manage and troubleshoot your Azure resources through natural language conversations. This article provides a collection of starter prompts to help you use SRE Agent effectively.

An agent can provide detailed information about aspects of your apps and resources. The following examples demonstrate the types of questions that you might ask your agent:

- What can you assist me with?
- Why isn't my application working?
- What services is my resource connected to?
- Can you provide best practices for my resource?
- What's the CPU and memory utilization of my app?

Here are some prompts that you can use to help you interact with your agent:

- Which apps have Dapr enabled?
- List replicas for my container app.
- Which apps have diagnostic logging turned on?
- Give me an individual heatmap for each storage account.
- Which revision of my container app is currently active?
- What are some best practices that my app should follow?
- What is the ingress configuration for my container app?
- Are any staging slots configured for this web app?
- What container images are used by each of my container apps?
- List all resource groups that you're managing across all subscriptions.
- Draw a heatmap of storage latencies over the last 14 days for storage accounts.
- Show me a visualization of response times for container apps for the last week.
- List [container apps, web apps, or another app type] that you're managing across all subscriptions.
- Visualize the split of container apps versus web apps versus AKS clusters managed across all subscriptions as a pie chart.
